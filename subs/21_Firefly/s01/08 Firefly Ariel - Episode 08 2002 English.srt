00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,789
08 Firefly Ariel - Episode 08 2002 English

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,860
I don't want it.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,650
River, you have to eat.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,360
It's good. It tastes like...

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,660
- It's good.
- It smells like crotch.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,580
- Jayne!
- Well, it does.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,450
We don't even have
to go some place fancy.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,710
We can just go to the park
or something. Feed the pigeons.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,550
Sure, feed the pigeons. Probably
get the firing squad for littering.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,340
- Come on, it's not that bad.
- It is. It's a core planet.

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,510
It's spotless. It's got sensors,
and there's Feds.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,930
All central planets are the same.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,020
Could you please tell my wife
the fun she's missing out on?

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,270
Ariel's quite a nice place, actually.
There's some beautiful museums...

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,770
not to mention some fine restaurants.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,740
But not boring,
like she made it sound.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,530
There's...

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,490
Uh... Uh...

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,530
- There's hiking.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,200
And you can go swimming
in a bio luminescent lake.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,880
Even if it's got sunsets 24 hours a day,
I ain't going to that planet.

22
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,040
No one is setting foot
on that fancy rock.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,050
I don't want anyone leaving the ship.

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,460
Come to think of it...

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I don't want anyone looking out
the windows or talking aloud.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,510
We're here to drop off Inara.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,010
Why come to the core
if I can't even step off the boat?

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,180
You could have gotten off with
Shepherd at the Bathgate Abbey.

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,310
Could have been meditating on the
wonders of your rock garden by now.

30
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,940
It beats just sitting.

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,190
It is just sitting.

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,780
- How long will you be planet-side?
- No more than a day or two.

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,780
Big stop just to renew
your license to companion.

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,240
Can I use companion as a verb?

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,830
It's Guild law.
All companions are required...

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,540
to undergo a physical examination
once a year.

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,090
Could you not do that while we're...?
Ever!

38
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,220
So two days in a hospital.
That's awful.

39
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,060
- Don't you just hate doctors?
- Hey!

40
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,390
I mean, present company
excluded.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,520
Let's not be excluding people.
That'd be rude.

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,230
Son of a...! God!

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,990
What the hell?

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
River, no.

45
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,120
- I got the knife.
- He's bleeding.

46
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,990
- That's deep.
- He okay?

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
River.

48
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,660
He looks better in red.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Gorram freak's completely
off her axle.

50
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,640
- I'm sorry about this. I don't know...
- Shut it. I ain't talking to you.

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,640
She gotta go. Both of them gotta go.

52
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,930
Ariel's as good a place as any
to leave them.

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,560
- Might even pick up a reward.
- No one's getting left.

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,360
She belongs in a bug house.

55
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,110
- You don't pitch her off now, I swear...
- What?

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,820
What do you swear, Jayne?

57
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,660
They don't get gone, you better
start locking up your room at night.

58
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,030
Next time she gets
in a murdering mood...

59
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,330
it might be you
she comes calling on.

60
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,160
Maybe Kaylee or Inara.

61
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,500
You let them stay,
we're gonna find out.

62
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,920
Finish your work, doctor.

63
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,130
This is my boat.
They're part of my crew.

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,890
No one's getting left.
Best you get used to that.

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,730
You owe me a shirt.

66
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,650
She's to stay confined to her room
at all times, no exceptions.

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,740
Take her to the kitchen, infirmary,
you ask me. Understand?

68
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,110
I do.

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,370
When I took you and your sister in,
the deal was you keep her in check.

70
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,700
You can't hold up your end,
we're gonna have to revisit the deal.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,830
She's getting worse, isn't she?

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,050
Yes.

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,480
Just look at the bright side.

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,110
Maybe you'll meet a young,
handsome doctor. He'll ask you out.

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,610
What's the companion policy on dating?

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,410
It's complicated.

77
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,410
- Well, that figures.
- Stay out of trouble.

78
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,500
You too. Bye.

79
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,790
How we gonna find a job
if we don't leave the ship?

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,260
Alliance territory,
ain't any jobs worth having.

81
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,590
Where were the last three
places we've been?

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,260
My pop always said, "Anyone who can't
find work ain't looking hard enough."

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,270
We ain't even looking at all.

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,060
You can stop looking.

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,890
There's a client.

86
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,310
Me.

87
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,070
I have a job for you.

88
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,790
You've got a job for us?

89
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,250
One that'll pay for itself 10 times over.

90
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,630
Oh, forget it. We ain't that desperate.

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,040
Do you know what this is?

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,300
It's a common immune booster
called isoprovoline.

93
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,800
Street value for a dosage this size...

94
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,180
50 platinum, maybe 20 credits.

95
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,560
Propoxyn, maybe 80.

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,270
Hydrozepam, 200.

97
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,020
And all of these are what I had
in the med kit when I came on board.

98
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,280
At a hospital like the one in Ariel City,
they'll have shelves of that stuff.

99
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,990
Whatever the take, it's more than
enough payment for what I have in mind.

100
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,530
So the med vault isn't the job?

101
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,620
That's the payment.

102
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,290
I tell you how to get in,
get out and what's worth taking...

103
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,500
if you help me get River
to the hospital's diagnostic ward.

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,670
- What's in the ward?
- A 3-D neuro-imager.

105
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,090
If I get River there, I might figure out
what they did to her.

106
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,590
So we get you both
in there and you tell us...

107
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,470
how to clean out the hospital.
Yes.

108
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,600
Not to be negative, but don't
the hospital need that medicine?

109
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,230
Government-run facility. They'd be
restocked in a matter of hours.

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,190
She's right. They'll never miss it.

111
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,780
Plus, folks on the rim
sure could use it.

112
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,410
You know, it's very sweet stealing
from the rich, selling to the poor...

113
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,910
but you're talking about breaking into
a secure Alliance facility.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,660
How will you get around security?

115
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,330
Well, it's not easy, but it can be done.

116
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,880
See, like all core hospitals, St. Lucy's
has its own dedicated security force.

117
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,430
A small battery of local Alliance
Federals sub stationed here.

118
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,770
Now, every floor, every doorway
is equipped with sensors...

119
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,560
and at all points of entry,
patient ident scans.

120
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,110
However, once clear of the checkpoints,
movement within the facility...

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
should be relatively unhindered.
The standard layout puts the med vault...

122
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,280
Go back to the ident scans.

123
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,820
You and your sister are fugitives.
How will you get in the building?

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,740
Through the front door.

125
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,620
Believe me, captain, getting
the two of us in is going to be easy.

126
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,710
The rest of you, that is going
to be the real trick.

127
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,260
We'll need to procure a few items
off-ship. I've made a list.

128
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,590
Now, given my status as a fugitive,
someone else will have to...

129
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,720
We have some volunteers. Good.

130
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,560
And before we make it to the front door,
we have to breach the perimeter.

131
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,270
Only official vehicles are allowed in,
so we'll need one.

132
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,150
Now, obviously, we can't steal
what we need.

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,320
Any illegal activity in the planning stages
could end this thing before it starts.

134
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,070
St. Lucy's Hospital contracts...

135
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,370
with a local municipal dump yard
for all its large disposals.

136
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,910
Figures.

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,960
First time on the core, and what
do I get to do? Dig through trash.

138
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,590
Why couldn't he send me shopping
at the Triplex?

139
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,170
Oh, synchronisers.

140
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,510
Big hospitals mean big waste,
so we shouldn't have trouble...

141
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,680
finding what we're looking for.

142
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,860
We'll have to look like we belong.

143
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,210
All we do is slip some bills
into the right hands.

144
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,670
That gets us uniforms,
ID badges and key cards.

145
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,630
A little creative forgery, and we've
got ourselves a working alias.

146
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,600
Now, all these items are easy to obtain.

147
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,980
They'll get us up to the door.
Now, in order to get us in...

148
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,020
Patients were cynical, not responding.

149
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,650
- We couldn't bring him back.
- They were cyanotic...

150
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,070
They were cyanotic and unresponsive...

151
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,700
And we're unable to...

152
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,070
- Resuscitate them.
- Yes.

153
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,910
- Resuscitate.
- Resuscitate them.

154
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,490
Which methods did you use?

155
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,920
We tried pulmonary stimulator's
and cardiac...

156
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,250
- Infusers.
- Infusers.

157
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,500
- Pulmonary...
- Pulmonary stimulator's...

158
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,000
And cardiac infusers.

159
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,670
- What about cortical electrodes?
- Oh.

160
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,890
We forgot them.

161
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,140
- Let's try that again.
- Yeah.

162
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,730
The pupils were fixed and dilapidated.

163
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,110
- Dilated.
- Dilated. Dilated!

164
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,710
We got there, and the patients
were cyanotic.

165
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,340
Not responsive, and we tried
to resuscitate them.

166
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,130
And despite our best efforts,
they kicked.

167
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,630
In spite of our best efforts...

168
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,220
- Which methods did you use?
- We tried pulmonary stimulator's...

169
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,220
and cardiac infusers.

170
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,890
What about the cortical electrodes?

171
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,640
What's that?

172
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,600
We applied the cortical electrodes.

173
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,230
We used the electromagnetic...
Reaction from...

174
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,230
But unable to get a neural...

175
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,650
Applied cortical electrodes but did not
get a neural reaction...

176
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,570
Unable to get a neural...

177
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,120
- Response.
- Response.

178
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,040
Hell, if I'd wanted schooling,
I'd have gone to school.

179
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll get it.

180
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,260
That's amazing.
You two did an incredible job.

181
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,510
And now for the finishing touch.

182
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,770
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were ready to save lives.

183
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,900
- Now all we need are a couple patients.
- Corpses, actually.

184
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,200
For this to work,
River and I will have to be dead.

185
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,450
I'm starting to like this plan.

186
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,120
We're going to be asleep.

187
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,660
Capt.. Reynolds will pretend we're dead
to sneak us into the hospital.

188
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,340
Once we're inside, we'll wake up,
everything will be fine.

189
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,960
You understand?

190
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,720
You're going to suspend cerebral,
cardiac and pulmonary activity...

191
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,390
in order to induce
a proto-comatose state.

192
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
That's right.

193
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,770
- I don't wanna do it.
- I know.

194
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,810
I don't wanna go to that place.
I don't wanna die.

195
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,190
No, no one is going to die.

196
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,940
The others will take care of us while
we're asleep, and when we get back...

197
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,410
- No, no, no.
- Shh, River? River, it's okay.

198
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,410
It's okay. This, this could be
what we've been hoping for.

199
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,330
When this is over,
I'll be able to help you.

200
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,880
I'll be able to make
the nightmares go away.

201
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,920
Okay?

202
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,720
Okay.

203
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,010
Okay.

204
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,010
Lie back.

205
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,110
It's time to go to sleep.

206
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,960
We speak only when spoken to.

207
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,920
We avoid unnecessary contact and stay
together until we reach the morgue.

208
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,960
- Yes, sir.
- Applied cortical electrodes.

209
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,090
- Jayne?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

210
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,680
- Will we have a problem?
- I know what I gotta do.

211
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,600
That's not what I'm talking about. Will
I have a problem with you and Simon?

212
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,890
It's up to him.

213
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,730
You got stabbed the other day. It's
bound to make anyone a might onerous.

214
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,730
- So I figure...
- It's a good plan.

215
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
What?

216
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,820
Doc did good coming up with that job.
Don't mean I like him better.

217
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,950
Nothing buys bygones quicker than cash.

218
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,280
Maybe I'll give him a tattoo
while he's out.

219
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,790
Let him do his thing and then
get him out. No messing with him.

220
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,960
Don't worry about me.
As long as I get paid I'm happy.

221
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,330
Applied the cortical electrodes,
unable to get a neural response.

222
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,460
Applied the cortical electrodes.

223
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,370
We have a few hours
before the morning shift.

224
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,490
Won't be an hour.

225
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,850
- What do you got?
- We got a couple DOAs.

226
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,730
- By the time we got there...
- Take them to the morgue.

227
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,190
We applied the cortical electrodes
but were unable to get a neural reaction.

228
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,760
That should bring them out soon.

229
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,470
Once they're up,
get them to the imaging suite...

230
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,020
let Simon do his thing
and haul it back to the rendezvous.

231
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,860
- Fifty minutes.
- Got it.

232
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,230
And I'll just sit right here.

233
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,770
I'm in.

234
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,270
- Do you have the fugitives?
- You got my reward?

235
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,900
Yes, just like we talked about.

236
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,410
- Then I got your fugitives.
- Good, we'll see you shortly.

237
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,620
Congratulations. You're about
to become a very rich man.

238
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,850
Copper for a kiss.

239
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,100
Jesus.

240
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,770
What did you say?

241
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,530
What the hell's the matter with you?

242
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,530
Nothing. It's just the after effects
of the drugs.

243
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,410
I'll be fine. Just give me a second.

244
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,170
Well, your sister seems okay.

245
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,460
You better get dressed. We gotta move.

246
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,470
Two lefts, two rights, and we're there.
You see anyone, smile.

247
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,430
- No one smiles in hospitals.
- Yes, they do. It's the core.

248
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,680
Everyone's rich and happy here.
Why wouldn't they smile?

249
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,020
Excuse me? Excuse me?

250
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,520
Hi.

251
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,150
- Where are you taking those bodies?
- To the morgue.

252
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,610
Downstairs is that way.

253
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,700
Right. Must have gotten turned around.

254
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,200
Let me see your badge.

255
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,500
You're doing it backwards,
walking up the down slide.

256
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,210
Keep her quiet.

257
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,130
This is the recovery ward.

258
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,670
This is where patients
come to get better.

259
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
Going to die.

260
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,970
- No one is going to die.
- He is.

261
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,010
No, he's not. That man
standing next to him is his doctor.

262
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,350
- He's going to help him.
- He's not going to help him right.

263
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,100
River, the doctors here
are the best in the system.

264
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,480
This is one of the top hospitals
in the core or anywhere else.

265
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,780
Where you should be.

266
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,610
- You have to help him.
- River, we don't have time.

267
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,070
- He's killing him.
- Code blue.

268
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,290
- Stay here.
- Don't you...!

269
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,200
Don't move.

270
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
What do we have?

271
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,960
42-year-old, double-bypass post-op.
Prognosis, positive.

272
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,050
- BP's 60/20. Pulse is thready.
- Who are you?

273
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,970
- He's crashing.
- Get the cart.

274
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,510
- We have flat line.
- We gotta crack him.

275
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,100
We're not cracking a post-op.

276
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,930
- Should I call the code team?
- Get the infusers and.4 of atropine.

277
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,440
- What did you give him?
- Just 20 of apresoline push.

278
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,570
Clear.

279
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,240
- Clear.
- Clear.

280
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,410
- He's going tachy.
- But his heart's beating.

281
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,250
He's okay.

282
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,430
How do you justify administering
a vasoconstrictor to this patient?

283
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,390
- Apresoline is a painkiller not an vaso...
- Unless you combine it with dilaftin.

284
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,690
Which any first-year should know
is the standard prep medicine...

285
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,560
your patient took before surgery.

286
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,940
Your patient should be dead.

287
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,910
Let's go.

288
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,160
Walk with me a minute.

289
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,710
- Where are we going?
- You see this badge? It says doctor.

290
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,210
I say walk, you walk.

291
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,750
- But where are we going?
- You must be new.

292
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,760
Don't get comfortable.
Your type doesn't last long here.

293
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,880
When your supervisor hears
about the rude and disrespect... Ah!

294
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,470
Clear.

295
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,020
Ready?

296
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,540
1205, here it is.

297
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,840
Zoe.

298
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,640
It must have been damaged.

299
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,050
They opened up her skull.

300
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,680
That's a scalpel scar. They...

301
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,140
They opened up her skull,
and they cut into her brain.

302
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,270
Why?

303
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,600
The only reason to make an incision in
someone's brain is to lobotomise them.

304
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,060
To remove damaged tissue.

305
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,320
Why anyone would
cut into a healthy brain is...

306
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,320
They did it over and over.

307
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,490
They stripped her amygdala.

308
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Her what?

309
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,460
You know how you get scared
or worried or nervous...

310
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,510
but you don't wanna be,
so you push it to the back of your mind.

311
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,140
You try not to think about it.
Your amygdala is what lets you do that.

312
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:27,230
It's like a filter in your brain
that keeps your feelings in check.

313
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,900
She feels everything. She can't not.

314
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,320
Well, that's fascinating.
Let's get moving.

315
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,690
We still have 20 minutes.

316
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,490
The plan changed when you were out.
We're meeting out the back way in five.

317
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,370
I could use a few minutes.
If we contact Capt.. Reynolds...

318
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,410
He gave orders.
We play it by the book.

319
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,800
River, it's okay. It's okay.

320
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,050
Get her in the chair and let's go.

321
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,300
No. No. No. They come out of the black.
They come when you call.

322
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,220
- River, it's okay. It's over. We're leaving.
- Your toes are in sand.

323
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,060
- And your head's up your...
- Hey, back off.

324
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,850
Make sure her mouth is shut.

325
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,770
I don't need her screeching
while we try to get away.

326
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,820
It's okay.

327
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,660
You should have let me know
the plan changed.

328
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,540
I told you when you needed to know.

329
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,540
What are you griping about?
You got what you came for.

330
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,300
No, no, I can't go back.
I don't wanna go back.

331
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,800
It's okay.
We're just going back to the ship.

332
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,970
We're almost home.

333
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,600
Federal marshals, don't move.

334
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,480
River and Simon Tam, by the authority
of the Union of Allied Planets...

335
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,690
you are hereby bound by law.

336
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,410
Take them to processing.

337
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,210
You gonna take me away for questioning
now? How you wanna play it?

338
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,720
You're under arrest for aiding
and abetting federal fugitives.

339
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,010
- Better get a lawyer.
- You're kidding, right?

340
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,720
- Where's my rutting money?
- You mean my money?

341
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,640
For apprehending three fugitives,
I expect I'll be getting it soon.

342
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,620
- How much did we get?
- Enough to keep us flying.

343
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,540
- Can we fly somewhere with a beach?
- Maybe a naked beach.

344
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,090
The job's not done until
we're back on Serenity.

345
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,420
Sorry, sir, didn't mean
to enjoy the moment.

346
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,840
Where are the others?

347
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,150
If those officers hadn't been armed,
I think you'd have had a chance.

348
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,280
A guy shoves me, I shove him.

349
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,490
Not like I was trying to mount a rescue.

350
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,120
Still, I appreciate you trying.

351
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,160
You know what I'd appreciate?

352
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,870
Stop flapping that mouth at me.

353
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,170
I'm trying to figure a way out of here.
Can't do it with you yammering.

354
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,130
They took Christmas away.

355
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,210
What the hell now?

356
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,380
Came downstairs
for the shiny presents.

357
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,220
They took the tree and the stockings.

358
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,890
Nothing left but coal.

359
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,930
Would you shut her up?

360
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,190
Don't look in the closet either.
It's greedy.

361
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,230
It's not in the spirit of the holiday.

362
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:06,990
You shut the hell up right now,
or so help me, I will shut you up.

363
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,910
Time?

364
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,830
- Ten minutes past rendezvous.
- Something's happened.

365
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,880
Kaylee, are you linked?

366
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,790
I am now. What do you need?

367
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,340
See if there's a security alert
in the hospital.

368
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,760
Hang on.

369
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,640
- Maybe they're late.
- Not this late.

370
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,600
Jayne would have sent up a flag.

371
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,850
Nothing from hospital security
or on the local pipeline.

372
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,400
Although I am getting some weird
chatter from the official 262.

373
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,730
It sounds like...

374
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,690
they're talking about ducks.

375
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,820
- Code.
- Feds got them.

376
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,820
Have her bring up a hospital schematic.
Find a way into the security substation.

377
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,790
Wait a minute, you don't
even know if they're in there.

378
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,620
- Gonna find out. Check.
- Coming in clear.

379
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,460
So you're just gonna walk in
through the front door?

380
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,130
No, you're gonna find me
a way around back.

381
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,420
- Get up.
- What's going to happen to us?

382
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,880
I said, get up.

383
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,850
Agent McGinnis, I'm certain
you're working under a superior...

384
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,970
who's keeping close tabs
on this case.

385
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,690
I know because important
people don't do fieldwork.

386
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,650
I'm also quite certain your superior
wants me and my sister alive.

387
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,900
Now, I'm not going to move from this
spot until one of two things happens.

388
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,830
You answer my very simple question,
or you shoot me.

389
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,120
We're transferring you to a holding
area until you can be retrieved.

390
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,290
Retrieved? By whom?

391
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,340
People who want you alive.

392
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,010
People. Not me.

393
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Take them.

394
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,250
- Wash, we could use direction here.
- Working on it.

395
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,660
Kaylee, what do you got?

396
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,330
Tell them to go left when they
reach cryo. They'll see a door.

397
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,760
All right, go through that door
and down to green level.

398
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,720
This is exactly what I didn't want.

399
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,720
I wanted simple. I wanted in and out.
I wanted easy money.

400
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,770
Things get complicated,
don't they, sir?

401
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,850
Just once I'd like things
to go according to the gorram plan.

402
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,900
- Guys, you might wanna hurry.
- Oh, is there a problem?

403
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,320
I think the reinforcements just arrived.

404
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,110
- What are you doing?
- Going out the way we came in.

405
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,280
- There are four armed Feds out there.
- Six, I know.

406
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,780
- We run.
- You got no idea where that goes.

407
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,620
- We'll find our way.
- I ain't chancing that.

408
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,660
I can handle the Feds.

409
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,790
Doesn't matter.

410
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,380
They're here.

411
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,840
Gentlemen, that was prompt.

412
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,850
We're almost finished here.

413
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,020
Prisoners will be out in a minute.

414
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,270
Let me get the paperwork together
for you. Bobby, bring that here.

415
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,560
Not that it'll mean much.

416
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,860
The men were tight lipped. The girl was
spewing gibberish. We got it all down.

417
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,780
You spoke to the prisoners?

418
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,740
Well, yeah. Had to process them.

419
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,040
There was no interrogation,
if that's what you mean.

420
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,910
Didn't do your job for you.

421
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,920
- Did your men also speak with them?
- As much as they had to.

422
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,120
What the hell is that?

423
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,300
Two by two. Hands of blue.

424
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:10,020
Two by two. Hands of blue.
Two by two. Hands of blue.

425
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,200
- Where the hell's she going?
- Must be some sort of exit this way.

426
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,540
I don't see no exit.

427
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,300
- Dead.
- This one's alive.

428
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,340
I won't run around like a rat in a maze
till we're dead.

429
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,050
Now, we're going back.

430
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,530
Almost there.

431
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,870
Almost there.

432
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,700
Almost there.

433
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,660
There.

434
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,460
Stand back.

435
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,420
Come here.

436
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,350
Shee-niou high-tech Alliance crap!

437
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,010
Hey, Inara.
How was your check up?

438
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,680
Same as last year.
What's going on here?

439
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,060
Let's see, we killed Simon and River,
stole a bunch of medicine.

440
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:18,650
Now the cap and Zoe
are springing the others...

441
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,570
got snatched by the Feds.
Oh, there they are now.

442
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,790
Tell me we weren't followed.

443
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Nothing in our rear-view
the whole way back.

444
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,290
All right.

445
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,670
- Take us out, quick as you can.
- We'll be out of atmo in five minutes.

446
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,550
Hey, how was your thing?

447
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,050
As advertised, lots of needles
and cold exam tables.

448
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,850
I heard you had some excitement.

449
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,810
Nothing much.
Lots of running around, a little gunplay.

450
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,940
A couple needles.

451
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,770
Next time we're here,
I'll stay with the preacher.

452
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,900
If you hadn't come, you wouldn't
be getting your payday.

453
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,820
So get what you needed?

454
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,700
I think I did. I have the information
off the imager.

455
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,120
I just have to go over it,
and I'm hopeful.

456
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,250
- What happened to your face?
- Huh?

457
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
- Ow.
- Oh, nothing.

458
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,670
He was amazing.
I can't even begin to tell you.

459
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,760
We wouldn't be standing here
if it weren't for him.

460
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:28,760
Thank you.

461
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,720
Well, hey, you're part of my crew.

462
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,640
I think I might cry.

463
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,350
All right. Jayne, help me with the cargo.
Everyone, make yourselves useful.

464
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,310
You got jobs, go do them.

465
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,520
This has gotta be our best take ever.

466
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,940
Well, doc had a good notion.
The boy's got a decent criminal mind.

467
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,700
So, what are you buying with your cut?

468
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,600
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

469
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,820
The job is done.

470
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,900
I figured it was time for a little chat.

471
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,380
It seems to me we had a solid plan.

472
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,090
Smooth, you might say.

473
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:53,090
But what I can't figure out is, what
you were doing around the back exit.

474
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,260
What?

475
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,220
I couldn't go out the front. I had
to improvise. Open the damn door!

476
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,060
You called the Feds.

477
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,190
What? I got pinched.

478
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,150
Which is what happens
when you call the Feds.

479
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,980
No. I would never do that.

480
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,860
My hand to God. May he strike
me down as I'm standing here.

481
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,910
Well, you won't be
standing there long.

482
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,990
Minute we break atmo, you'll be thinner
once you get sucked out that hole.

483
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,160
- Come on, Mal!
- Leaving atmo in 2 minutes.

484
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,420
- That ain't no way for a man to die.
- Secure cargo door.

485
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:30,090
You wanna kill me, shoot me.
Just let me in.

486
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,380
I hear tell they used to keelhaul
traitors back in the day.

487
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,550
I don't have a keel
to haul you on, so...

488
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay. I'm sorry, all right?

489
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,060
Sorry for what, Jayne?
I thought you'd never do such a thing.

490
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,650
Money was too good.

491
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,820
I got stupid.

492
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,940
I'm sorry, okay?

493
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,900
Be reasonable.

494
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,410
What are you taking
this so personal for?

495
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,700
It ain't like I ratted you out
to the Feds.

496
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,830
But you did. You turn on
any of my crew, you turn on me.

497
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,830
Since that's a concept you can't
wrap your head around...

498
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,460
then you got no place here.

499
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,090
You did it to me, Jayne,
and that's a fact.

500
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,350
- What are you gonna tell the others?
- About what?

501
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,940
About why I'm dead.

502
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,690
I haven't thought about it.

503
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,280
Make something up.

504
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,370
Don't tell them what I did.

505
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,880
The next time you decide
to stab me in the back...

506
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,260
have the guts to do it to my face.

507
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,150
Can I come in?

508
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,530
Hi.

509
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,030
What are you doing?

510
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,080
Drawing.

511
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,830
That's really good.

512
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,090
What are you doing?

513
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,300
I...

514
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,010
I brought some medicine.

515
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,050
Do you remember why
we went to the hospital?

516
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,930
Is it time to go to sleep again?

517
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,730
No, Mei Mei.

518
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,860
It's time to wake up.
