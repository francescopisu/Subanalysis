09 Firefly War Stories - Episode 09 2002 English

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,330
Did you ever read the works
of Shan Yu?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Shan Yu, the psychotic dictator?

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,420
Yep.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,590
Fancied himself
quite the warrior-poet.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,470
Wrote volumes on war, torture,
the limits of human endurance.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,850
That's nice.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,810
He said, "Live with a man 40 years."

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,480
Share his house, his meals,
speak on every subject.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,480
Then tie him up and hold him
over the volcano's edge.

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,990
"And on that day,
you will finally meet the man."

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,280
- What if you don't live near a volcano?
- I expect he was being poetical.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,580
Sadistic crap legitimised
by florid prose.

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,620
- Tell me you're not a fan.
- I'm just wondering if they were.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,380
The people who did this to your sister.

16
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,840
The government did this to her.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,720
A government is a body of people,
usually, notably, ungoverned.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,590
Now you're quoting the captain.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,140
I'm just wondering if they
put her through this...

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,600
just to see how much
she could take.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,610
To truly "meet her,"
as Shan Yu would have said.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,780
No. The more I see, the more I think
their purpose was very specific.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,660
And look at this. The pattern.

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,830
If they just wanted to hurt River,
they wouldn't still be after her.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,710
- But she's doing better.
- I've tried a couple different medications.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,460
She's sleeping better,
but nothing really stable.

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,090
I'll keep trying.

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,170
Certainly got enough drugs on hand.

29
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,760
Yes, I'd forgotten you're moonlighting
as a criminal mastermind now.

30
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,220
Got your next heist planned?

31
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,140
No.

32
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,020
But I'm thinking about growing
a big, black moustache.

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,100
I'm a traditionalist.

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,290
Hold, please.

35
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,040
So now we are past the preliminaries.
The little questions.

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,210
Why you skim from protection fund.

37
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,960
How you could betray my trust.

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,720
This we are past.

39
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,430
Now we get to the real questions...

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,600
about who you truly are.

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,020
I'm sorry, sir.

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,270
I get to heart of matter,
and always, interruptions!

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,360
One of our long-ranges picked up a read
on the other side of the world.

44
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,240
Might be Serenity,
Malcolm Reynolds' ship.

45
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,530
Oh, this is exciting news.

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,660
Send a team.

47
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,660
Bring him here to me.

48
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,620
Very exciting.

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,630
Yes, sir.

50
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,420
Now...

51
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,970
we get to spend some time
finding out about your true self.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,760
Tell me.

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,770
Are you familiar
with the works of Shan Yu?

54
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,580
I said yes already.
Where's the outstanding issue?

55
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,670
The councillor's an important
political figure and a private...

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,340
So he comes here,
instead of you going to his place.

57
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,260
What, is the ship not clean enough?

58
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,670
I just want the councillor
to feel comfortable.

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,300
And when I say comfortable,
I mean totally alone.

60
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,020
Oh, the pitter-patter of tiny feet
in huge combat boots.

61
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,440
Shut up!

62
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,110
There's nobody sets foot
on my boat that I don't meet them.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,610
Don't worry, I won't start any
sword fights. I'm over that phase.

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,110
I'd appreciate it if you'd keep
the others from ogling.

65
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,370
One of you is gonna fall and die,
and I'm not cleaning it up.

66
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,200
She took my apple.

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,040
- Jayne bought a crate of them.
- And this one's mine.

68
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,870
Not anymore.

69
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,210
Oh, okay.

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,930
No power in the 'verse can stop me.

71
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,890
These really are the genuine article.
I could get used to being rich.

72
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,690
It's Jayne being so generous
with this cut confuses and frightens me.

73
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,940
It does kind of freeze the blood.

74
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,900
Zoe, how come you always
cut your apples?

75
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,860
- You do?
- Her and the captain both.

76
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,580
Whenever we get fresh fruit,
they never just munch on them.

77
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,540
Know what a Griswold is?

78
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,910
- A grenade.
- About the size of a battery.

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,210
It responds to pressure.

80
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,380
Our platoon was stuck in a trench
outside of New Kasmir...

81
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,960
during the Winter Campaign.
More than a week...

82
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,640
completely cut off, and the Alliance
entrenched not 10 yards away.

83
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,430
We even got to talking to them.

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,930
Yelling across insults and jokes
and such...

85
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,770
because no ammo to speak of,
no orders, so, what are you gonna do?

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,980
We mentioned that we were out
of rations, and 10 minutes later...

87
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,110
a bunch of apples rained
into the trench.

88
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,780
And they grew into a big tree.

89
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,660
And they all climbed up the tree
into a magical land...

90
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,870
with unicorns and a harp.

91
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,120
Blew off their heads, huh?

92
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,330
Captain said, "Wait."
But they were so hungry.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,210
Don't make much noise.

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,630
Just little pops, and there's three guys
that kind of just end at the rib cage.

95
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,340
But these apples are health some, good.

96
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,890
Yeah, grenades cost extra.

97
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,270
We are about 20,000 miles
from our last drop, people.

98
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,730
Then we can take a break and think
about spending some of this money.

99
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,150
- All right!
- Yeah!

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,560
Could've made more.

101
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,110
That wasn't a bad idea, Wash.

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
But eliminating the middleman,
never as simple as it sounds.

103
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,820
You heard about...?

104
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,120
Half of the human race is middlemen...

105
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,120
and they don't like being eliminated.

106
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,790
This quadrant, we play nice.
Got enemies enough as it is.

107
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,960
So when you said that you didn't get
a chance to tell the captain my idea...

108
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,050
- Uh-huh.
- What you actually meant was...

109
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,510
that you told him my idea,
he rejected it out of hand...

110
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,890
and you didn't argue the point
or even give it another thought.

111
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,390
I gave, honey. I...

112
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,270
And then came the lying
to me about it...

113
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
which for me, is the highlight
of this little adventure.

114
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,280
Am I gonna get out of this
with honour and dignity?

115
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:33,030
You're pretty much down
to ritual suicide, lambie-toes.

116
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,860
I didn't want to upset you.

117
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,410
What did you think of it?

118
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,410
- Of what?
- My idea.

119
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,960
Call the local MDs. Forget the fence,
go straight to the source.

120
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,040
Better prices, and we know
the drugs get to the right people.

121
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Captain thinks it'll get back
to someone, just cause trouble.

122
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,220
Was I ever not asking
what the captain thought?!

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,270
- Well, I tend to agree with him.
- Tend to, or have to?

124
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,440
I love that you two
are old army buddies...

125
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,610
you have wacky stories
with rib cages...

126
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,780
but could you have an opinion
of your own, please?

127
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,320
You're losing the high ground
here, sweet cakes.

128
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,620
I'm sure you and Mal will take
that hill and fortify it with...

129
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
I thought your plan was too risky.

130
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,960
- I thought.
- Then tell me.

131
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,750
I am a large, semi muscular man.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,920
I can take it. Don't hide behind Mal,
he'll shoot it down for you. Tell me.

133
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,140
Right. Because what this marriage
needs is one more shouting match.

134
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,270
No, what this marriage
needs is one less husband.

135
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,480
Right now, it's kind of crowded.

136
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,990
Whoa.

137
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,870
- How you doing?
- I threw up.

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,710
I'm sorry, it's a side effect.

139
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,840
We just have to find
the right treatment for you.

140
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,760
- How do you feel now?
- Going...

141
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,970
Going back like...

142
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,430
apple bits, coming back up.

143
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,720
Chaos.

144
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,520
But you felt okay this morning?

145
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,060
Played with Kaylee.

146
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,610
The sun came out,
and I walked on my feet...

147
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,240
and heard with my ears.

148
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,910
I ate the bits, the bits that stay down.

149
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,620
And I work, I function like I'm a girl.

150
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,290
I hate it because I know
it'll go away.

151
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,460
The sun grows dark
and chaos has come again.

152
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,550
Bits, fluids.

153
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,090
What am I?

154
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,100
You are my beautiful sister.

155
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,940
I threw up on your bed.

156
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Yep.

157
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,860
Definitely my sister.

158
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,580
Didn't Inara express a wish for privacy?

159
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,500
We gotta see who she's got.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,790
Bet he's handsome.

161
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,880
Think he's gonna bring her flowers.

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,550
Oh, there he is.

163
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,260
Well, he looks the respectable sort.

164
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,390
Welcome aboard.
I'm Captain Malcolm.

165
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,990
We're all clear here, councillor.

166
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,260
- Huh.
- Oh, my.

167
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,340
Oh, gosh, I...

168
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,850
I knew she took female clients.
I just...

169
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,310
They look so glamorous together.

170
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,940
I'll be in my bunk.

171
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,870
I'll be glad to see the last
of it. Makes us a target...

172
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,750
Was River in here messing around?

173
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,460
The ignition sequence
is all turned about.

174
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,670
- I can't even...
- I can.

175
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,460
Well, get it set, Wash.
We gotta get moving.

176
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,930
Here's a funny twist. No.

177
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,510
- No what?
- No, sir.

178
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,550
Change the sequence?

179
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,930
Didn't want you taking off without me.
In fact, didn't want you taking off at all.

180
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,650
Thought I might take this run instead.
Me and the captain.

181
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,230
The captain who's standing right here
telling you that's not gonna happen?

182
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,190
Well, it's a dangerous mission, sir.

183
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,820
I can't stand the thought of something
happening that might cause you...

184
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,990
to come back with another thrilling
tale of bonding and adventure.

185
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,660
- I just can't take that right now.
- Okay...

186
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,590
I'm lost, I'm angry and I'm armed.

187
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,960
- So if you have something you need to...
- It's all right, sir.

188
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,010
We've dealt with Bosh before.
It shouldn't be a problem.

189
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,560
And I wouldn't mind
sitting this one out.

190
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,060
Oh, this is a:

191
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,640
But I don't have time to unwind it.

192
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,480
Wash.

193
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,320
Get her started.

194
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,190
Zoe, ship is yours.

195
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,780
Bye, hon.

196
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,860
We promise not to stop
for beers with the fellas.

197
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,540
So...

198
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,960
are we gonna sing army songs
or something?

199
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,180
That feels amazing.

200
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,390
Oh, right there.
Oh, that's perfect.

201
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,860
- I should have done this weeks ago.
- Hmm.

202
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,610
I wouldn't have been here weeks ago.

203
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,650
And that would have been a shame.

204
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,240
For me as well.

205
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,830
You have such beautiful skin.

206
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,580
There's no need for this show, Inara.

207
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,710
I just need to relax with someone
who's making no demands on me.

208
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Most of my clientele is male.
Do you know that?

209
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,100
No.

210
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,770
If I choose a woman...

211
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,150
she tends to be extraordinary
in some way.

212
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,400
And the fact is, I occasionally have
the exact same need you do.

213
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,070
One cannot always be oneself
in the company of men.

214
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,370
Never, actually.

215
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,830
So no show.
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

216
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,710
You are so lovely.

217
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,520
- Look, this thing with you and Zoe...
- I'm not looking to talk on that topic.

218
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,360
Hey, I let that niou-Se trick of yours
slide because this is a milk run.

219
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,570
But when I go on a mission, I'm taking
Zoe and that's the drill. You know that.

220
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,330
- What if we get into a situation here?
- I've been in a fire fight before.

221
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,910
Well, I was in a fire.

222
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,880
Actually, I was fired
from a fry-cook opportunity.

223
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,460
I can handle myself.

224
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,210
And you understand
what Zoe's job entails.

225
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,430
I'll learn as I go.

226
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,060
So now I'm learning about carrying.

227
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,410
Nice to know you're still trustworthy.

228
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,290
But not so trustworthy I don't want
to see the money you promised me.

229
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,170
Can't believe you guys knocked
over an Alliance hospital.

230
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,380
- The pair you have.
- Yeah.

231
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,300
Stuff legends are...

232
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,650
Now I'm learning about scary.

233
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,190
I'll be in my bunk.

234
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,530
Jayne, grab your weapon.

235
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,280
- Why, what's going on?
- Maybe nothing. Maybe trouble.

236
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,610
- The drop?
- They're late.

237
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,330
They should have been
back more than an hour ago.

238
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,450
We go by ground.
We'll take the mule.

239
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,160
I'll go with you.

240
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,250
No offence, but I sure hope
they don't need a preacher.

241
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,550
Three sets of eyes
are better than two.

242
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,670
Might see something you don't.

243
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,680
Let's move.

244
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,230
None of them's ours.

245
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,110
This is precision work. Sharpshooters.

246
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,280
From the look of these wounds,
I'd say a 54-R sniper rifle, laser sights.

247
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,570
You do a lot of shooting at the abbey?

248
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,910
Rabbits.

249
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,830
For stew, sure.

250
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,250
Whoever did this,
they weren't after the goods.

251
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,800
We ain't gonna find them here.

252
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,590
They're off the planet already.

253
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,810
Only one type of transport
I know makes a mark like this.

254
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,470
Fast-burn rocket-shuttle.

255
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,230
Craft like that not commonly
part of a ship.

256
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,690
- More likely we're looking at...
- Space station.

257
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,780
I know who's got them.

258
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,920
- I think I've been kidnapped.
- Yeah.

259
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,250
- You see where we are?
- No.

260
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,010
- Mal, what the hell is going on?
- Ain't rightly sure.

261
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,390
- But you've got some theories.
- Still working it through.

262
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,350
I don't want you to spare me. If you
know what's happening, then tell me.

263
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,390
You wouldn't spare Zoe
if she were with you, would you?

264
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,810
You would be planning and plotting
and possibly scheming.

265
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,030
So whatever Zoe would do
in this instance is what I wanna do.

266
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,530
And you know why?

267
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,660
Because no matter how ugly it gets, you
two always come back with the stories.

268
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,910
So I'm Zoe. Now...

269
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,540
what do I do?

270
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,960
Probably not talk quite so much.

271
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,000
Right. Less talking.

272
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,380
She's terse. I can be terse.

273
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,760
Once in flight school, I was laconic.

274
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,970
If I'm not gonna talk,
then you have to.

275
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,350
- We just gotta keep our heads.
- Right. Keep our heads.

276
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,900
That way we'll be able to,
you know...

277
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,780
keep our heads.

278
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,780
You and Zoe been in plenty
of situations like this before.

279
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,360
- Many a time.
- Many a time, you and Zoe.

280
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,160
Once we know who took us...

281
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,580
Zoe and you, together in a tricky...

282
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,420
- Mal, she's my wife.
- Huh?

283
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,050
What gives you the right to put her
in a dangerous situation like this?

284
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
- I didn't.
- You did.

285
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,260
- She ain't here, Wash.
- No, but she would've been.

286
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,930
- Okay.
- I mean, I'm the one that she swore...

287
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,810
to love, honour and obey.
Listen...

288
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,310
She swore to obey?

289
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,140
Well, no, not...

290
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,480
But that's just my point.
You, she obeys.

291
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,650
She obeys you. There's obeying
going on right under my nose.

292
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,410
Look, Zoe and I have a history.
She trusts me.

293
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,490
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

294
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,830
You're making out like she follows
my every word. That ain't true.

295
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,330
- Sure it is.
- Not so.

296
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,920
There's plenty orders of mine
that she didn't obey.

297
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,960
- Name one.
- She married you!

298
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,810
What?

299
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,110
- Here's all I got left.
- Thanks.

300
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
Jayne.

301
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,030
How do you know he won't just
grab you as well?

302
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,700
Don't think that's like to happen.
I walk in there unarmed, make the offer.

303
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,950
This guy has his own code.

304
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,250
Twisted as it may be.
Very excited about reputation.

305
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,540
- He'll see reason.
- Reason? He's a gangster.

306
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,750
The money he paid you for that
other job was returned to him.

307
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,420
Could be he's harbouring
some resentment at us.

308
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,300
Putting his man through our engine.

309
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,470
Wait a reasonable amount of time.

310
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,640
If you don't hear back, you take
Serenity and get out of this quadrant.

311
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,270
This don't play out right...

312
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,610
there's no guarantee he won't
come looking for the rest of you.

313
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,700
I'm not...

314
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,580
gonna say it...

315
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,290
again.

316
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,330
Shipboard romances complicate things.

317
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,710
- For who? For you?
- For everyone.

318
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,260
Well...

319
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,800
what about love?

320
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,430
I ain't against it as a rule.

321
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,310
I mean, in situations such as ours,
it tends to cause problems.

322
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,270
It splits loyalties.

323
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,150
- Know what I think?
- What?

324
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,700
What, Wash? What do you think?
Because I'm interested.

325
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,790
This policy you got against
shipboard relationships...

326
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,750
that's just you projecting your
own intimacy issues on everyone else.

327
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,260
Of course, could be a lot simpler
than that.

328
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,220
Could be I just don't think
you're good enough for Zoe.

329
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,220
- I don't give a gorram what you think.
- Oh, don't you?

330
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,690
Zoe and I, we got a history.

331
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,980
And I figure you gotta be
asking yourself...

332
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,400
some fundamental questions
as to the nature of that history.

333
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,440
You never slept with my wife.

334
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,700
That a fact?
You know that for sure, do you?

335
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,120
You ever ask her?

336
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,120
We been together a long time
before you came along.

337
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,670
And she's a damn fine-looking woman.

338
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,670
Never happened. Know how I know?

339
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,220
How? Tell me.

340
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,390
This whole captain thing
isn't Zoe's trouble.

341
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,560
It's "the guy she never slept with" thing.

342
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,060
Mal, I wish you had slept with her.

343
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,230
Then at least she'd be over it.

344
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,900
You want me to sleep with her?

345
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,070
- Would that make you feel better?
- It might.

346
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,440
I imagine it would do wonders
for her too.

347
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,280
- Screw you.
- Get in line.

348
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Okay, Wash, I'm gonna do it.

349
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,000
Wash. Wash, listen.

350
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,750
First thing when we get back...

351
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,590
Listen to me!

352
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,630
The first thing when we get back...

353
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,510
I'm gonna take your wife into my bed.
Yeah?

354
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,050
I'm gonna get me a piece of...

355
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,950
I'm unarmed.

356
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,330
I wanna talk to Niska.

357
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,250
Huh.

358
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,840
No, no, no.

359
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,430
Run. Run.

360
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,640
Five times what you paid
for the train job.

361
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,860
Yes, you have had, you say,
good times.

362
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,820
I see that.

363
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,150
Should be more than enough
to buy back my men.

364
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,030
- This is your opinion, is it?
- It is.

365
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,490
They are perhaps damaged now.

366
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,830
- Are they worth so much to you?
- Yes.

367
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,620
And to me, they are worth more.

368
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,580
I think this is not enough.

369
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,460
Not enough for two.

370
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:38,630
But sufficient perhaps for one.

371
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,340
- You now have...
- Him.

372
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm sorry. You were going
to ask me to choose, right?

373
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,560
Do you wanna finish?

374
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,400
He is yours. We are ended now.

375
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,660
- Mal?
- Just keep walking.

376
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,750
A moment please.

377
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,380
This money, it is too much.

378
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,510
You should have some small refund.

379
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,490
Now we are ended.

380
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,890
He's insane.

381
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,140
- I know.
- I mean, you told the damn stories.

382
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,600
Saved you in the war.

383
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,480
I didn't know.

384
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,440
- You mean Mal?
- He's crazy.

385
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,490
He wouldn't break, Zoe.
He kept me from...

386
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Okay.

387
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,580
- I wouldn't have made it.
- Shh. Shh.

388
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,460
This is gonna kill him.

389
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,790
He's gonna make it last
as long as possible.

390
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,210
Days, if he can.

391
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,760
Bastard's not gonna get days.

392
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,950
- Thank God you're safe.
- What happened?

393
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,820
- How bad is it?
- I'm fine.

394
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,240
- Where's Mal?
- Niska wouldn't let him go.

395
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,450
- Is he alive?
- For now.

396
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,750
Take that to the infirmary.
Put it on ice.

397
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,500
What is that?

398
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,420
It's his ear.

399
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,930
- We're getting him back.
- What are we gonna do, clone him?

400
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Well, it's a clean cut.

401
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,560
With the right equipment,
I should be able to re-attach it.

402
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,890
That's assuming there's a head.

403
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,070
Do you know the writings
of a Shan Yu?

404
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,860
Are you starting a book club?

405
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,740
Or what, are you trying to torture me?

406
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,830
Yes, today we meet you.

407
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,290
And you're quite a man,
an extraordinary man, yes.

408
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,340
But these are not times
for extraordinary men.

409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,420
Business is not war.

410
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,760
Heroics are unseemly,
they complicate.

411
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,050
For you, I have...

412
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,470
special machine.

413
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,690
Very precious.

414
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,520
And they say people
don't look like their pets.

415
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,910
Well, let us see if we can meet
the real you.

416
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,880
Here, six shots and then just drop it.
Keep moving.

417
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,220
This here is suicide.

418
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,720
You know that, don't you?

419
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,310
You really think you can mount
a two-man frontal assault...

420
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,310
on Niska's Skyplex and live?

421
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,360
Technically, it's a one-man,
one-woman assault. A unisex.

422
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,690
- Grenades?
- Oh, yes. Thank you, dear.

423
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,660
- He won't be expecting it.
- Right, because they ain't insane.

424
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,120
I just got a wave from Inara.

425
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,290
No luck with the councillor.

426
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,830
What are they doing?

427
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,710
Fixing to get themselves killed.

428
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,090
- We're gonna go get the captain.
- Oh, good.

429
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,630
- Can they do that?
- No.

430
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,930
You know...

431
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,850
there's a certain motto.

432
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,720
A creed among folks like us.
You may have heard it.

433
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,310
"Leave no man behind."

434
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
Suicide.

435
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,900
Got a good look at the layout
on the way in last time.

436
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,650
You let me lead. Cover my...

437
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,110
back.

438
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,990
What's this?

439
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,820
We're going with you.

440
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,530
If it were any one of us,
captain wouldn't hesitate.

441
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,240
Here you go.

442
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,620
- This should do.
- Preacher...

443
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,250
don't the Bible have some pretty
specific things to say about killing?

444
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Quite specific.

445
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,460
It is, however, somewhat fuzzy
around the subject of kneecaps.

446
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,670
If you look for me to talk you out of it...

447
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,390
What?

448
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,560
Let's go get the captain.

449
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,070
Yep. He's dead.

450
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,860
Mr. Reynolds?

451
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,160
You died, Mr. Reynolds.

452
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,250
Seemed like the thing to do.

453
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:48,750
When you die, I can't hurt you anymore.
And I want two days at least. Minimum.

454
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,510
I think many people know the name
Malcolm Reynolds.

455
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,760
And many know he crossed Niska.

456
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:02,180
They must know
what happens after that.

457
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,810
They must know
that business is still running.

458
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,910
You think this will work.

459
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,790
Well, except for the com static,
I'm piping out on all frequencies.

460
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,830
We've been powered down since I fired
the attitude thrusters a half-hour ago.

461
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,380
We'll show up on their screen
as a glitch if they aren't looking close.

462
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,970
- What if they are looking too close?
- Hell, I'm just glad we're on course.

463
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,600
It's like throwing a dart, Jayne,
and hitting a bull's-eye 6000 miles away.

464
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,220
That's my man.

465
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,390
You guys better get down to the bay.

466
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,440
We'll be at their front door
in less than a minute.

467
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,190
I'm right behind you, baby.

468
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,580
- Book, you good?
- Yes, ma'am. Ready when you are.

469
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,750
How you doing on that
override sequence?

470
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,090
Pretty sure this will pop their air-lock
doors if Wash can get a seal his first try.

471
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,840
I'm smelling a lot of if coming
off this plan.

472
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,680
You could've stayed in your bunk.

473
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,390
Could've, should have, would've.

474
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,060
We're set.

475
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,520
Okay, people. If it moves, shoot it.

476
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,190
- Unless it's the captain.
- Unless it's the captain.

477
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,630
Listen...

478
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,220
if you got guests,
I can come back later.

479
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,620
Move, move, move. Take cover!

480
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,800
Second team, hold this position.

481
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,880
We lose this ground, we lose it all.

482
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,840
You're going to hold this ground.

483
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,930
Understand me?

484
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,390
- Understood.
- Okay then.

485
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,430
Viktor, what is it?

486
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,390
- Viktor!
- Ah!

487
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,990
Looks like business ain't running
so much as crawling away.

488
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,790
You wanna meet the real me now?

489
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,210
Gorram it!

490
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,040
Ah!

491
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,020
Ah!

492
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,850
Book, we...

493
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,040
Get behind us, preacher.
We need cover.

494
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,870
Don't think, just shoot.

495
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,150
Can't look. Can't look.

496
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,290
No power in the 'verse can stop me.

497
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,950
Haven't you killed me
enough for one day?

498
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,760
Jayne, this is something the captain
has to do for himself.

499
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,050
- No. No, it's not.
- Oh.

500
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,910
You sure this thing's gonna stay on?

501
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,910
This dermal mender creates
an excellent tissue bond.

502
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,540
It should be fine.
Just don't fiddle with it.

503
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,550
Be sure to thank the councillor for me.

504
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,260
Awful nice of her to pull some strings
and lend us this equipment.

505
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,430
Least she could do.

506
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,020
- I just wish you'd killed that old bastard.
- I got regrets on that score myself.

507
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,600
So...

508
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,690
I hear you all took up arms
in that little piece of action back there.

509
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,360
How you faring with that, doctor?

510
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,200
I don't know.
I never shot anyone before.

511
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,120
I was there, son.

512
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,660
I'm fair sure you haven't
shot anyone yet.

513
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,910
Hmm. Wife's soup.
I must have done good.

514
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,130
Yes, dear. You done good.

515
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,500
Ow.

516
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,260
- Did you tell her?
- Tell her what?

517
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,800
Your husband has demanded
we sleep together.

518
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,300
Really?

519
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,640
What...? Mal, come on.

520
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,270
He thinks it would get all this
burning sexual tension out in the open.

521
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,150
You know, make a fair fight
for your womanly affections.

522
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,770
No, that was the torture talking,
remember the torture?

523
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,450
I know it's a difficult mission...

524
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,110
but you and I...

525
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,530
have to get it on.

526
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,500
I understand. We have no choice.

527
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,040
Take me, sir. Take me hard.

528
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,090
Now, something about that is
just downright unsettling.

529
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,550
We'll be in our bunk.

530
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,970
Oh.

531
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,310
Oh, hey. Free soup.
