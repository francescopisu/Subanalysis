1
00:00:03,972 --> 00:00:06,178
Parents like to drag kids
to historical sights.

2
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,805
I remember going to
Colonial Williamsburg...

3
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:11,681
...and you see the supposedly
authentic blacksmith there.

4
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:14,262
He's got the three-cornered hat,
knickers...

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,816
...and the Def Leppard shirt.

6
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:20,279
My parents took me to the
Amish country, which to a kid...

7
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:23,613
...to see a bunch of people that have
no cars, no TV, no phone...

8
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,942
...they go, "So what? Neither do I."

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,036
So it's the whole community
that's been grounded.

10
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:31,245
That's the way they should
punish the kids.

11
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,539
"All right, get up to your room.
I've had it.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,786
You are Amish, young man.

13
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:38,879
For the rest of this weekend.
Did you hear me? Amish.

14
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:41,966
Don't come down till you make
some noodles and raise a barn."

15
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,342
They have a guide. He takes you...

16
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,435
...shows you the battlefield,
gives you a bit of the history.

17
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:54,395
How far is Gettysburg?
I'd like to go.

18
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,438
- About three hours.
- Tommy, you're on.

19
00:00:56,608 --> 00:00:58,766
- Gotta go.
- Have a good set.

20
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:04,990
What did they do for toilet paper
in the Civil War?

21
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:09,864
Wonder what toilet paper
was like in the 1860s.

22
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:13,039
Did they-? Did they carry it
in rolls in their duffel bags?

23
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,120
Everything with you comes down
to toilet paper.

24
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:18,253
- What?
- That's always...

25
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:21,375
...the first question with you.
Why is that always your focus?

26
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:24,085
- Then what did they do?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,047
Maybe they gave out big loose
clumps to all the soldiers.

28
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:31,306
It would be nice if there was some
sort of historical record of it.

29
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:34,975
They should have a toilet-paper
museum. Would you like that?

30
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:38,396
So we could see all the toilet-paper
advancements through the ages.

31
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,227
Toilet paper during the Crusades.

32
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,272
The development of the perforation.
The first six-pack.

33
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,113
Excuse me, Jerry.

34
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:49,117
I'm Stu Schirmack. I'm from NBC.

35
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:51,194
- Could we speak for a few moments?
- Sure.

36
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:53,696
- Hi. Jay Crespi.
- Hello.

37
00:01:53,873 --> 00:01:57,242
- C-R-E-S-P-I.
- That's right.

38
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:59,376
I'm unbelievable
at spelling last names.

39
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,455
- Give give me a last name.
- I'm not-

40
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,204
George.

41
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,208
All right. All right.

42
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:10,178
First of all...

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,099
...that was a terrific show.

44
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,677
- Thank you very much.
- And-

45
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,936
I just wanted to let you know
that we've been discussing you...

46
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:21,268
...at some of our meetings, and we'd be
very interested in doing something.

47
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,396
- Really?
- So if you had an idea for, like...

48
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,568
...a TV show for yourself,
well, we'd just love to talk about it.

49
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,027
I'd be very interested in that.

50
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:32,780
Well, here.

51
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:36,702
Why don't you give us a call,
and maybe we can develop a series.

52
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,791
Okay. Great. Thanks.

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,952
- It was very nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

54
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,750
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

55
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,461
- What was that all about?
- They said they were interested in me.

56
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:51,420
- For what?
- You know, TV show.

57
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,929
- Your own show?
- Yeah, I guess so.

58
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,217
They want you to do a TV show?

59
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:01,938
They want me to come up with an
idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.

60
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:06,653
Come on. How hard is that?
Look at all the junk that's on TV.

61
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,738
You want an idea? Here's an idea.

62
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:12,774
You coach a gymnastics team
in high school, and you're married.

63
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:16,950
Your son is not interested in
gymnastics, and you're pushing him.

64
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,406
Why should I care if
my son's into gymnastics?

65
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:23,249
- You're the teacher. It's only natural.
- But gymnastics is not for everybody.

66
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:26,214
- I know, but he's your son.
- So what?

67
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,379
All right, forget that idea.

68
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,170
It's not for you.

69
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,967
Okay, okay. I got it.

70
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,513
You run an antique store.

71
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,223
- Yeah. And?
- And people come into the store...

72
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:43,018
...and you get involved in their lives.

73
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:46,851
What person who runs an antique
store gets involved in people's lives?

74
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,354
- Why not?
- So someone comes in...

75
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,991
...to buy an old lamp, and suddenly
I'm getting them out of a jam.

76
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,237
I could see if I was a pharmacist.

77
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:58,868
A pharmacist knows
what's wrong with everybody.

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,748
Antiques are very popular right now.

79
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,159
- No, they're not. They used to be.
- Oh, sure.

80
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:06,088
- Like you know.
- Oh, like you do.

81
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:11,677
And you're the manager
of the circus.

82
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:14,596
- The circus?
- Oh, come on. This is a great idea.

83
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:17,681
Look at the characters. You got
all these freaks in the show.

84
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,261
A woman with a moustache.

85
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,223
Who wouldn't tune in to see
a woman with a moustache?

86
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:26,975
You got the tallest man in the world.
A guy who's just a head.

87
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:29,022
- I don't think so.
- Look...

88
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:32,196
...the show isn't about the circus.
It's about watching freaks.

89
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,357
I don't think the network
would go for it.

90
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,859
- Why not?
- I'm not pitching a show about freaks.

91
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:40,203
Oh, come on, Jerry. You're wrong.
People, they wanna watch freaks.

92
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:42,081
This is a "can't miss."

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,788
- Kramer.
- Hello, Newman.

94
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,038
I got the helmet.
Go get the radar detector.

95
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:51,126
Okay. I'll be back in a second.
You guys coming to my party?

96
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,258
- Yeah. Sure.
- Of course.

97
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,713
- What's this about?
- We're making a trade.

98
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,258
I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet.
He's giving me his radar detector.

99
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:04,183
- I didn't know you have a motorcycle.
- Well, my girlfriend had one.

100
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,063
You have a girlfriend?

101
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:08,023
I had a girlfriend.

102
00:05:08,192 --> 00:05:09,936
And she was pretty wild.

103
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,820
- I don't remember you with a girl.
- Nevertheless.

104
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,610
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer.

105
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,321
A radar detector's worth much more
than that helmet. You're cheating him.

106
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,906
- Don't say anything.
- All right.

107
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:27,871
Hey, you know you're
getting gypped over here.

108
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,422
Really.

109
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,919
Hey. We had a deal.

110
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,500
Are you reneging out of the deal?
Are you reneging?

111
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,671
- That's a renege.
- Stop saying " reneging."

112
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,593
- Well, you're reneging.
- Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.

113
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,391
All right. Give it to me.

114
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,387
- All right, let go.
- Come on.

115
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,221
- Let go on three.
- Give me that. Just give me that!

116
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,273
- Three.
- Here.

117
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,601
Idiots.

118
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:55,610
Thanks, buddy. So long.

119
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,989
- Does that thing work?
- No.

120
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:04,247
I got a postcard from Elaine.

121
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,206
- Really?
- Yeah. They're in London now.

122
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,368
They'll be back in a few weeks.

123
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,379
I can't believe she got
involved with her shrink.

124
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:13,958
What about the TV show?
Got anything?

125
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,090
No. Nothing.

126
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,171
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

127
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,597
What do you need salsa for?

128
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,807
Salsa is now the number-one
condiment in America.

129
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,305
Do you know why?

130
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,186
Because people like to say "salsa."

131
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,643
Do you have any salsa?

132
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:33,521
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa? No salsa?

133
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:36,983
You know, it must be impossible
for a Spanish person...

134
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,065
...to order seltzer and not get salsa.

135
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,162
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.

136
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,494
Don't you know the difference
between them?

137
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,906
You have the seltzer after the salsa.

138
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,670
This should be the show.
This is the show.

139
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:53,831
- What?
- This.

140
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,666
Just talking.

141
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,964
Yeah. Right.

142
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,883
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

143
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,215
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?

144
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,185
It's about nothing.

145
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:11,560
- No story?
- No, forget the story.

146
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:15,101
- You gotta have a story.
- Who says you gotta have a story?

147
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:18,729
Remember when we were waiting for
that table in that Chinese restaurant?

148
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,113
That could be a TV show.

149
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,360
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?

150
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:26,079
I could be a character.

151
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:29,250
- You?
- Yeah. You base a character on me.

152
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:32,371
So on the show there's a character
named George Costanza?

153
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:36,080
Yeah. What? There's something
wrong with that? I'm a character.

154
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:39,626
People are always saying to me,
"You know, you're quite a character."

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,380
And who else is on the show?

156
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,094
Elaine could be a character. Kramer.

157
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:47,931
Now, he's a character.

158
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,640
So everybody I know
is a character on the show.

159
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,141
Right.

160
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:54,603
- And it's about nothing.
- Absolutely nothing.

161
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,393
So you're saying I go into NBC
and tell them...

162
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,728
...I got this idea
for a show about nothing.

163
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,448
We go into NBC.

164
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,905
We? Since when are you a writer?

165
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:07,197
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.

166
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:10,749
You wanna go with me to NBC?

167
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,536
We really got something here.

168
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,038
- What do we got?
- An idea.

169
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,121
- What idea?
- An idea for the show.

170
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,962
- I still don't know what the idea is.
- It's about nothing.

171
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,128
- Right.
- Everybody's doing something.

172
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:24,260
We'll do nothing.

173
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,722
We go into NBC, tell them we got
an idea for a show about nothing.

174
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,600
- Exactly.
- "What's your show about?"

175
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,761
- I say, " Nothing."
- There you go.

176
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:34,229
I think you may have something here.

177
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:39,019
So the show would be
about my real life...

178
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:42,398
...and one of the characters
would be based on you.

179
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:44,693
No, I don't think so.

180
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,776
What do you mean,
you don't you think so?

181
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,744
- I don't like it.
- I don't understand.

182
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:51,119
- What don't you like?
- I don't like the idea...

183
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,042
- ...of a character based on me.
- Why not?

184
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,452
I don't know. It just doesn't sit well.

185
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,121
There's gotta be a character
based on you.

186
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:02,335
- That's your problem.
- I don't know what the big deal is.

187
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,218
You can do it on one condition.

188
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:06,426
- Whatever you want.
- I get to play Kramer.

189
00:09:06,597 --> 00:09:09,515
- You can't play Kramer.
- I am Kramer.

190
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,012
But you can't act.

191
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:17,311
- Okay, fine, we'll use Newman.
- Newman?

192
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,603
- Use me for what?
- Nothing. What do you want?

193
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,489
Well, you'll never guess
what happened to me today.

194
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,025
I was driving home on
the Palisades Parkway...

195
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,996
...when I look in the rearview mirror,
and what did I see?

196
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,204
The fuzz. And it's funny...

197
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,618
...because my new radar detector
was on, but I didn't hear a thing.

198
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:42,714
- Isn't that strange?
- Yeah, that's strange.

199
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:47,047
Because the radar detector,
as I understand it, detects radar!

200
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,427
With a series of beeps
and flashing lights.

201
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:51,721
But for some reason,
I didn't hear a thing...

202
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,885
...except for the sound
of a police siren.

203
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:56,345
Well, that's queer, huh?

204
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,393
I want my helmet back!

205
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:01,057
You give me back my helmet,
and pay for that ticket!

206
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:04,189
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You better think again, MoJumbo.

207
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:08,109
You gave me a defective detector.

208
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,826
- Jerry?
- Buyer beware.

209
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,578
Are you gonna give me my helmet?

210
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:14,581
No, we had a deal.
There's no guarantees in life.

211
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,410
No, but there's karma, Kramer.

212
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:18,375
Karma Kramer?

213
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,665
And one more thing:

214
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:22,795
I'm not coming to your party!

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,878
Salsa, seltzer.

216
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:32,051
Do you have any salsa?

217
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:34,550
No, not seltzer, salsa.

218
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:38,896
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

219
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,815
You sure?

220
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,308
- You look a little pale.
- No, I'm fine. I'm good.

221
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,146
Fine. Very good.

222
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:48,156
- What, are you nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous. I'm very good.

223
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:51,900
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- What?

224
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:54,284
I can't. I've tried. I'm here.
It's impossible.

225
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:56,744
- This was your idea.
- What idea?

226
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,285
I just said something. I didn't
know you were gonna listen to me!

227
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,252
Don't worry about it.

228
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:04,628
They're just TV executives.

229
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,799
They're men with jobs, Jerry!

230
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,920
They wear suits and ties.

231
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:14,263
They're married.
They have secretaries!

232
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,509
- I told you not to come.
- I need some water.

233
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,014
I gotta get some water.

234
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:21,022
- They'll give us water in there.
- Really?

235
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,018
That's pretty good.

236
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,033
- Oh, God, it's Joe Davola.
- Who?

237
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:34,075
This guy's a writer. He's a total nut.

238
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:36,368
I think he goes to
the same shrink as Elaine.

239
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,622
Oh, God, he saw me.

240
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:44,460
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hey, Joe!

241
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,000
How you doing?

242
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,747
You're under no obligation
to shake my hand.

243
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,210
Oh, no. Just a custom.

244
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:55,057
That's my friend, George.

245
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,134
You look good.

246
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:58,804
Why shouldn't I look good?

247
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:02,226
No. No reason.
You do the karate, right?

248
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,724
Yeah, you wanna hit me?

249
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,570
- What are you doing here?
- I dropped a script off.

250
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,029
Good for you.

251
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,037
Well.

252
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,993
- You don't have to say anything.
- No...

253
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,168
- Hey, I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
- Why?

254
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:27,164
Kramer's party.

255
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,085
- Kramer's having a party?
- No. No, he's not having a party.

256
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:36,128
He's doing something. I don't know.
It's nothing. He's not doing anything.

257
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:39,055
I thought Kramer and I
were very close friends.

258
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,642
No, I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you're very close friends.

259
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,722
Very close.

260
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,725
Give my best to Hinckley.

261
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,525
- What was that?
- I can't believe what I did.

262
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,536
I didn't know Kramer didn't invite him.
I gotta call Kramer.

263
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,371
They're ready for you.

264
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,662
Okay. Okay. Look.

265
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,122
- You-You do all the talking. Okay?
- Oh, relax!

266
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,963
- Who are they?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,206
- They're not better than me.
- Of course not.

268
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,924
- Who are they?
- They're nobody.

269
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,635
- What about me?
- What about you?

270
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:15,842
- Why them? Why not me?
- Why not you?

271
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,922
- I'm just as good as them.
- Better.

272
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,257
- You really think so?
- No.

273
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:41,405
The bit- The bit I really liked was
where the parakeet flew into the mirror.

274
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,372
That was funny.

275
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,664
The parakeet in the mirror.
That is a good one, Stu.

276
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:51,411
Yeah. One of my favourites.

277
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:57,801
What about you, George? Have you
written anything we might know?

278
00:14:00,808 --> 00:14:03,263
Well, possibly. I...

279
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,143
I wrote an off-Broadway show.

280
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,354
<i>La Cocina.</i>

281
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,767
Actually, it was off-off Broadway.

282
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:17,235
It was a comedy
about a Mexican chef.

283
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,200
It was- It was very funny.

284
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:23,702
There was one great scene
with the chef.

285
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,031
What was his name?

286
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,782
- Pepe.
- Oh, Pepe. Yes, Pepe.

287
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:30,835
And he was making tamales.

288
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,914
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?

289
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:37,248
No, no, he mimed it.
That's what was so funny about it.

290
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:41,087
So, what have you two
come up with?

291
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:43,388
We thought about this
in a variety of ways...

292
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,473
- ...but the basic idea is I play myself-
- May I?

293
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,771
Go ahead.

294
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:54,479
I think I can sum up the show
for you with one word:

295
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Nothing.

296
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:00,280
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

297
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:01,951
What does that mean?

298
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:06,118
The show is about nothing.

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,325
- It's not about nothing.
- No, it's about nothing.

300
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,661
Well, maybe in philosophy.

301
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,297
But even nothing is something.

302
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,713
Mr. Dalrymple, your niece
is on the phone.

303
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:21,131
- I'll call back.
- D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L.

304
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:23,179
Not even close.

305
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:26,471
- Is that with a Y?
- No.

306
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,433
- What's the premise?
- As I was saying, I would play myself...

307
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,896
...as a comedian
living in New York...

308
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:37,904
...and I have a friend and a neighbour
and an ex-girlfriend.

309
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:40,907
- Which is all true.
- But nothing happens on the show.

310
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,569
You see, it's just like life.

311
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:46,906
You know, you eat, you go
shopping, you read, you eat...

312
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:50,331
- ...you read, you go shopping.
- You read?

313
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,659
You read on the show?

314
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:56,704
Well, I don't know about the reading.
We didn't discuss the reading.

315
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:00,467
All right, tell me about the stories.

316
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:02,628
- What kind of stories?
- Oh, no. No stories.

317
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,382
No stories?

318
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:06,930
- So, what is it?
- What did you do today?

319
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,476
- I got up and came to work.
- There's a show. That's a show.

320
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:13,808
How is that a show?

321
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:16,652
Well, maybe something happens
to you on the way to work.

322
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:19,903
No. No! No! Nothing happens!

323
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:22,029
Well, something happens.

324
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,283
- Well, why am I watching it?
- Because it's on TV.

325
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,698
Not yet.

326
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,117
Okay, look.

327
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,248
If you wanna just keep doing
the same old thing...

328
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:40,922
...then maybe this idea is not for you.

329
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:46,010
I, for one, am not going to
compromise my artistic integrity.

330
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,340
And I'll tell you something else:

331
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,762
This is the show,
and we're not gonna change it.

332
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:54,681
Right?

333
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,693
How about this?

334
00:16:59,862 --> 00:17:01,985
I manage a circus.

335
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:10,654
I don't even wanna talk
about it anymore.

336
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:13,617
What were you thinking?

337
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,334
What was going on in your mind?

338
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,663
Artistic integrity.

339
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,747
Well, where did you
come up with that?

340
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,960
You're not artistic,
and you have no integrity.

341
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:27,462
You really need some help. A regular
psychiatrist couldn't even help you.

342
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,762
You need to go to, like,
Vienna or something.

343
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:33,344
You know what I mean? You need
to get involved at the university level.

344
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,011
Like where Freud studied,
and have people looking...

345
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,681
...and checking up on you.
That's the kind you need.

346
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:42,228
Not the once-a-week for 80 bucks.
No. You need a team.

347
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:45,859
A team of psychiatrists,
working round the clock...

348
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:48,156
...thinking about you,
having conferences.

349
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:51,660
Observing you, like the way
they did with the Elephant Man.

350
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,531
That's what I'm talking about. That's
the only way you're gonna get better.

351
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,964
I thought the woman
was kind of cute.

352
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:05,753
Hold it. I really wanna
be clear about this.

353
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:08,632
Are you talking about
the woman in the meeting?

354
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:11,007
Is that the woman
you're talking about?

355
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,590
Yeah. I thought I might
give her a call.

356
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:18,472
I don't meet that many women.
I meet, like, three women a year.

357
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,140
I mean, we've been introduced.
She knows my name.

358
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,933
- It's completely inappropriate.
- Why?

359
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:27,155
Maybe she liked me. I mean, she-
She was looking right at me.

360
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:29,360
I think she was impressed.

361
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:32,654
We had good eye contact
through the whole meeting.

362
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:37,333
- Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
- Wait a minute, let me call Susan.

363
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:40,455
- No, this is more important.
- She might leave work any minute.

364
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:43,298
I gotta warn him that I told
Joe Davola about his party.

365
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:44,959
No!

366
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,967
What is it?

367
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:57,435
I was just thinking about
this patient of mine.

368
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,058
What?

369
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:02,232
Just wondering if he's taking
his medication.

370
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:06,269
Come on. We're on vacation.

371
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:12,900
Well, we were standing
in the waiting area there...

372
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:15,367
...and you know how Davola is.
He's all...

373
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,115
<i>- Yeah?
- It's George.</i>

374
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,713
And so I felt very
uncomfortable with him...

375
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,917
...and, you know, I just blurted out
something about your party.

376
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,672
- Back up a second.
- I didn't know you didn't invite him.

377
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,174
Why would I invite him?

378
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,139
- Well, I just assumed that-
- Assumed?

379
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,308
Never assume anything.
I don't want that nut in my house.

380
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,055
You know he's on medication.

381
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,896
- Well, hello. Oh, hello.
- Hello.

382
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,771
You remember Susan from NBC.

383
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:49,064
- Of course. How are you?
- Fine. Good to see you.

384
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:52,026
- This is Kramer.
- Hello.

385
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,825
All right, go ahead, Susan. Tell him.

386
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,034
- Tell me what?
- Well, I-

387
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:58,789
I'm sorry. Excuse me one second.

388
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:00,286
<i>- Hello?
- Hi...</i>

389
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,376
<i>...would you be interested
in switching to TMI long distance?</i>

390
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:04,873
I-I can't talk right now.

391
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,964
Why don't you give me your home
number, and I'll call later?

392
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,007
<i>I'm sorry. We're not allowed
to do that.</i>

393
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,632
I guess you don't want
people calling you at home.

394
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:15,675
<i>- No.
- Well, now you know how I feel.</i>

395
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,894
- So go ahead. Tell him.
- Well-

396
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,143
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?

397
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:30,106
- Yeah.
- What's the expiration date on that?

398
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:33,487
September third.

399
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:35,865
- The third?
- The third?

400
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:51,003
Never should have
brought her up there.

401
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,342
Should have known better.

402
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:56,003
I should have seen it coming.
I didn't see it coming.

403
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:59,851
I think she saw it coming.

404
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:04,806
You know, she was behind the idea.
She was gonna champion the show.

405
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:07,472
I was bringing her up to tell you,
and she liked me.

406
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,486
Look, just because Kramer vomited
on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.

407
00:21:13,323 --> 00:21:14,698
What are you, crazy?

408
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:17,440
It's a traumatic thing
to be thrown up on.

409
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,951
Vomiting is not a deal-breaker.

410
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:22,161
If Hitler had vomited on Chamberlain...

411
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,621
...he still would have
given him Czechoslovakia.

412
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:26,121
Chamberlain.

413
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:30,292
You could hold his head in the toilet,
he'd still give you half of Europe.

414
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:33,801
What happened to you?

415
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:35,839
Davola came after me.

416
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:37,847
What? Davola?

417
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,850
See, this guy is crazy.
I can't believe this. What happened?

418
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:43,722
Can I get coffee? You know,
I was walking home...

419
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:47,306
I had to pick up my helmet from
the shop. I had to get a new strap.

420
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:50,816
So I had it on, and I was checking
the strap out to make sure it fit.

421
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:54,811
And suddenly, I feel this kick
hit me on the side of the head.

422
00:21:55,073 --> 00:21:59,569
It knocks me down. I look up,
and it's Crazy Joe Davola.

423
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:02,746
And he says, "That's what I think
of your party."

424
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:06,956
- Boy, that is some kick.
- Newman's helmet, it saved my life.

425
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,665
- Look at that.
- Wow, Newman's helmet.

426
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:12,463
I got bad news for you, buddy.

427
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,127
Davola says you're next.

428
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:15,963
Me? Why?

429
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:17,922
He doesn't like you.

430
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:21,216
What does he want from me?
I didn't do anything.

431
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:25,181
See, this is all Elaine's fault. She took
off to Europe with his psychiatrist.

432
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:28,058
He can't get his medication.
Now I got some nut after me.

433
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:30,023
Pass the cream.

434
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:32,442
Wait a second.

435
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,196
All right.

436
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:44,580
When you vomit on somebody...

437
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,954
...it is a social faux pas...

438
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,747
...from which there
is really no recovery.

439
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:53,787
At that point, there's really very
little you can say to the person.

440
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,717
There's no Hallmark cards
that cover this occasion.

441
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,046
There's no vomit sympathy-card
section of the store, you know.

442
00:23:00,305 --> 00:23:02,974
"You wear it well."
You know, there's no words...

443
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:05,134
...that really capture, you know...

444
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,685
"Next time, lunch is on me."

445
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:11,978
There's no, really,
way to phrase the sentiment.

446
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,941
Where the hell did I put it?

447
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,612
- Where did I put it?
- What are you looking for?

448
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,079
The remote. The remote.
I can't find the remote.

449
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:31,290
Did I-? I lost it.
Did you take it?

450
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,335
- Did you put it some place?
- No, no, no.

451
00:23:33,505 --> 00:23:35,213
All right, what is this?

452
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:39,172
- What is what?
- All right, very funny. I get it.

453
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:41,010
- You're in a weird mood.
- Come on.

454
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,721
Go to your apartment and fix it.

455
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:44,763
- Fix what?
- Your pants!

456
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:50,426
What is this? Why do I got
one pant leg on for?

457
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:55,433
Don't you know? Look at your face. You
only shaved the right side of your face.

458
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:58,435
- What is this, a joke?
- No joke. What? A joke?

459
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:00,689
You think this is funny?
