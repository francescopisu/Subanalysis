1
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:03,423
So I went to a fashion show.

2
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:07,090
The concept of modelling
is counterproductive...

3
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:08,429
...to the fashion industry.

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:11,388
Because when these women
are around, who's looking at clothes?

5
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:14,350
I didn't notice any of the clothes.
We're all applauding. Yeah.

6
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:17,097
What are we applauding?
"There's great-looking women here.

7
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:18,391
This is great.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm glad I'm here with all
these great-looking women."

9
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:22,687
Anybody can design a shirt.

10
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:27,195
It takes talent to get all these girls
in one spot. That's talent.

11
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:30,235
What is this goofy walk
that the models do?

12
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:32,906
You know this walk
that they do down the runway?

13
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:34,413
Like they have to go somewhere.

14
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:38,120
They're walking like they're really
on the way somewhere.

15
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:41,085
Then they get to the end,
and it's like:

16
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,667
"Well, I guess I'll just go back."

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,426
I loved her, Jerry. I loved her.

18
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:52,848
No, you didn't.

19
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:57,768
- And she loved me. She really did.
- No, she didn't.

20
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:04,114
What am I gonna do now?
I can't live without Susan.

21
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:07,947
I gotta get her back. How?
How am I gonna to get her back?

22
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,871
Not only didn't you love her,
you didn't even like her!

23
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:15,625
- Who says?
- You did!

24
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:20,295
A beautiful, successful, intelligent
woman's in love with me.

25
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:24,000
And I throw it all away.
Oh, boy.

26
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:26,798
Now I'll spend the rest
of my life living alone.

27
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:29,641
I'll sit in my disgusting
little apartment...

28
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:32,808
...watching basketball games,
eating Chinese takeout...

29
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:36,892
...walking around with no underwear
because I'm too lazy to do the laundry.

30
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,226
You walk around
with no underwear?

31
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:43,610
What do you do when
you run out of laundry?

32
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,938
I do a wash.

33
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:50,610
Who am I gonna meet
that's better than her?

34
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:52,696
No one, Jerry.
No one's better than her.

35
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:55,328
When you were with her,
you said you couldn't stand her.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,409
I loved her.

37
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,661
You said going up the steps
to her apartment...

38
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,462
...was like being taken to a cell.

39
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:05,000
I would give anything to be going
up those stairs again.

40
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,967
I gotta call her. Should I call her?

41
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,928
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

42
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:11,469
- Why?
- You need some professional advice.

43
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:14,096
Why don't you go see
Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.

44
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,842
I'm not gonna see that nut doctor
she went to Europe with.

45
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,975
No, no. Elaine, what's the name
of that friend of yours...

46
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:22,023
...that's a therapist? The woman.

47
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:23,937
- Dana Foley.
- Right. Dana Foley.

48
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:26,021
- She any good?
- Yeah, she's terrific.

49
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:28,273
Why? You thinking of going?

50
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:30,945
Tia? Who's that?

51
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,030
It's that model I met on the plane.

52
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,285
She sent you a Christmas card?

53
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,958
And we're going out Saturday night.

54
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:47,460
My darling, Susan. My darling!

55
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,877
- What are you doing?
- Date with Fred.

56
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:53,139
- The religious guy?
- He's not that religious.

57
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,052
Let us pray.

58
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,060
- You got any Double Crunch?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,891
Kramer, should I call Susan?

60
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,391
Now, what does the little man
inside you say?

61
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,320
See, you gotta listen
to the little man.

62
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:11,738
- My little man doesn't know.
- The little man knows all.

63
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,317
My little man's an idiot.

64
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:17,367
See, she was clever.

65
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,707
She put her picture on her card.
I never do anything like that.

66
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:23,000
You want a picture on a card.
I can do that.

67
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,919
She kept such a nice, clean
apartment. She was so sanitary.

68
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,878
No. I was thinking out loud.
I don't want my picture on a card.

69
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,176
I'll take it.
I'll take care of everything.

70
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,423
She made a big breakfast
every Sunday.

71
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,591
I don't know what
she put in those eggs.

72
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:40,477
You come on over. I'll have my
cereal, and I'll take your picture.

73
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:42,271
Really? Can you take a picture?

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,729
He takes good pictures.
He's got equipment there.

75
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:46,312
- All right.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,356
- I don't know about that outfit, though.
- What's wrong with it?

77
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,488
Well, we'll have to improvise.

78
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,117
<i>Oh, hey</i>

79
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,242
<i>If you happen to see</i>

80
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,162
<i>The most beautiful girl</i>

81
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:07,583
<i>Who walk ed out on me</i>

82
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,084
<i>Tell her I'm sorry</i>

83
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:17,468
<i>Tell her I need my baby</i>

84
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>Won't you tell her</i>

85
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,553
<i>That I love her?</i>

86
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:28,809
<i>- Oh, hey-
- George.</i>

87
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:32,608
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

88
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:38,242
So I'm thinking of putting in
a tropical-fish tank right here.

89
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,452
Are sure you're ready
for that kind of commitment?

90
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,452
Well, if it doesn't work out,
I can flush them down the toilet.

91
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:46,002
That's horrible.

92
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,712
What's the perfume you're wearing?

93
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,288
Oh, I completely forgot.
I want you to see this.

94
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:53,503
That Calvin Klein ad I was telling
you about came out today.

95
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:55,505
- What is that smell?
- It's here somewhere.

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,965
- It smells like the beach.
- Exactly.

97
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:02,142
- Oh, my God. Is that the new perfume?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:06,523
I can't believe this. My neighbour had
the idea for this perfume last year.

99
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:10,024
He met with a Calvin Klein executive.
I can't believe they stole his idea.

100
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:13,895
- Are you sure?
- And you're the model for this perfume?

101
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,407
That's him. He just came home.

102
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:20,404
I'll lock the door.

103
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,449
Hey.

104
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,786
Hey.

105
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:27,790
Hey, how you doing?

106
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,541
Yeah, I'll see you later.

107
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:35,837
I just wanted to borrow
your DustBuster.

108
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,386
All right, come on in.

109
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,384
- Just wait over here.
- What?

110
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,387
Just wait here,
and I'll get it for you.

111
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:47,303
- Kramer, this is Tia.
- Hello.

112
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:56,231
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

113
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,898
Let's see. Come on. Back to back.

114
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,452
- No, Kramer!
- What?

115
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,909
What's the matter? I wanted
to see how tall she was.

116
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:07,700
You're tall. She's tall. I'm tall.
What's the difference? We're all tall.

117
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:09,371
- What's that?
- What?

118
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:12,250
- That smell. What's that smell?
- What smell?

119
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,878
It's very familiar. I can't put
my finger on it. It's familiar.

120
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:18,590
Oh, they're all the same.
Here. Now, if you'll excuse us.

121
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,423
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,425
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.

123
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:26,094
Yeah, I'll see you later.

124
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,432
That was close.

125
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,434
The beach!

126
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,111
You smell like the beach.
What's that perfume you're wearing?

127
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,770
- It's Ocean by Calvin Klein.
- Calvin Klein?

128
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,784
No. No, that's my idea.
They stole my idea.

129
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:43,739
I had the idea of a cologne that
made you smell like the beach.

130
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,740
I know. Look at this.

131
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:51,034
That's you. What is going on here?

132
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,833
The jerk! He laughs at me.
Then he steals my idea!

133
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,335
I could've been a millionaire.

134
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:58,592
I could have been
a fragrance millionaire, Jerry.

135
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:01,136
They're not gonna
get away with this.

136
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:10,312
Hello, George. Come in, come in.
I've heard an awful lot about you.

137
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,150
- Please sit down.
- Well, hello.

138
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:16,022
Specifically, the reason
that I'm here-

139
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:19,196
I don't know what
Elaine told you, but...

140
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:22,282
...I broke up with my girlfriend
a couple of weeks ago.

141
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,156
Actually, she broke up
with me, and-

142
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:27,820
Well, I was the cause of it, and...

143
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,869
I just wanted to find out from you...

144
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:32,419
What's with this thing?

145
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:35,837
- So she broke up with you.
- Yeah, and...

146
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,756
Why won't this go down?

147
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,883
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

148
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,429
So why'd she break up with you?

149
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:45,170
What is with this damn zipper?

150
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:48,267
It doesn't matter. Fix it later.
Tell me about your girlfriend.

151
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:51,729
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here.

152
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,142
I can't get the cloth out.

153
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:55,225
- It doesn't matter-
- This is a new jacket.

154
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:58,402
Boy, this really burns me up.

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,447
George. George, look at me.

156
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:04,533
Okay, forget about the zipper.

157
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,282
What's your girlfriend's name?

158
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,032
- Susan.
- Okay, we're getting somewhere.

159
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:19,250
It's just so frustrating. It's a
brand-new jacket for crying out loud.

160
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:30,141
So Fred and I are gonna do volunteer
work for that church on Amsterdam.

161
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,680
Volunteer work. See, that's what I love
about the holiday season.

162
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:35,599
That's the true spirit
of Christmas.

163
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:39,309
People being helped
by people other than me.

164
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:43,656
That makes me feel good inside.

165
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:47,242
Oh, look at what we have here.

166
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:50,163
A Christmas card from Lainey.

167
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:54,160
Thank you. You didn't have to
go to that trouble.

168
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,742
It was no trouble.
My assistant did the whole thing.

169
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,838
- How'd the picture come out?
- Oh, you know. It's a picture.

170
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,677
Oh, look at that. Looks good.
Kramer did a good job.

171
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,919
Yeah, well, how hard is it
to take a picture?

172
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:10,177
- What?
- Did you look at this picture carefully?

173
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:11,674
Carefully?

174
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:16,929
Because I'm not sure,
and correct me if I'm wrong...

175
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:19,943
...but I think I see a nipple.

176
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,818
- What?
- Here, take a look. What is that?

177
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:29,069
Oh, my God!

178
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:32,071
That's my nipple!

179
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:36,239
- That's what I thought.
- That's my nipple! My nipple's exposed!

180
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:39,914
I sent this card
to hundreds of people.

181
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:45,381
My parents. My boss.
Nana and Papa.

182
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,222
- Didn't you look at the picture?
- Oh, God, I didn't notice.

183
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,840
What am I gonna do? You know,
your whole life, you go through...

184
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:55,184
...painstaking efforts to hide
your nipple, and then boom.

185
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:58,391
Suddenly hundreds of people
get their own personal shot of it.

186
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,976
Hey.

187
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,650
- Have you seen the card?
- What card?

188
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:07,906
- My Christmas card.
- Yeah. Of course, I took it.

189
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,984
Did you notice
anything unusual about it?

190
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,734
- No.
- Well, come here and take a look.

191
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,830
- Yeah, so?
- So, what's that?

192
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,330
- That's a nipple.
- Right.

193
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,169
- Oh, great. Didn't you see that?
- No, I didn't notice it.

194
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,586
It's because you made me wear
that stupid shirt.

195
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,219
Well, maybe no one noticed it.
You didn't notice it.

196
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:35,760
- Let's see if Newman sees it.
- No, I don't want him looking.

197
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,095
What's the difference?
Everybody else has it.

198
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,647
Give me that.

199
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,184
Oh, my God, I sent one to the
super in my building, my mailman.

200
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,819
My 10-year-old little nephew.

201
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:50,361
Sister Mary Catherine, Father Chelios.
Oh, my God, Fred. I sent one to Fred.

202
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:53,526
- Okay, what is it?
- Here.

203
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:56,788
Take a look at this card. Tell me
if you notice anything unusual.

204
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,579
Yeah, your nipple's showing.

205
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:02,664
Okay, thanks.

206
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,036
- Anything else?
- No.

207
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:06,254
All right. See you later.

208
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,710
What? So what?

209
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:12,840
It's a nipple.

210
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:17,393
It's a little brown,
circular protuberance.

211
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,644
What's the big deal?

212
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,731
Everybody's got them.
Look, I got them.

213
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,683
- I got them too.
- Look at this.

214
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,488
Everybody's got them.

215
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:33,573
See, it's kind of gotta little piece of
cloth that's stuck underneath and-

216
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:35,404
Well, can you pull it up a bit?

217
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,951
Well, here you hold it.
Wait, hold it. Hold it.

218
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:41,662
Damn it. I can't move it.

219
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:43,662
God, I've never seen
a zipper so stubborn.

220
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,666
Damn it. I almost had it.

221
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,713
Okay. Wait, that'll separate it.

222
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:49,508
- Let me try.
- Take it off the track.

223
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:52,002
You're gonna rip it.
You're gonna rip it.

224
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,432
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to stop now.

225
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:01,598
Okay.

226
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:05,893
My mother is gonna pay
for the session.

227
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,354
Oh, is this Elaine?

228
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,905
Yeah.

229
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:30,216
No!

230
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,426
No!

231
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,422
No. Oh, no.

232
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,646
I've called every day for four days.
She hasn't returned one call.

233
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,771
Was it a scratch...

234
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,277
...or a pick?

235
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,817
It was a scratch.

236
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:56,612
Hey, it's me.

237
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,328
Don't you think I know the difference
between a pick and a scratch?

238
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,496
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

239
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,999
Come on up.

240
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:12,170
Was there any
nostril penetration?

241
00:13:13,886 --> 00:13:16,175
There may have been some
incidental penetration...

242
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:19,846
...but from her angle, she was
in no position to make the call.

243
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:24,302
So let's say, in her mind,
she witnessed a pick.

244
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,315
- Okay, so then what?
- Is that so unforgivable?

245
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:29,107
Is that like breaking
a commandment?

246
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,981
Did God say to Moses,
"Thou shalt not pick"?

247
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:35,190
I guarantee you
Moses was a picker.

248
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,150
You wander through the desert
for 40 years with that dry air.

249
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:48,415
You telling me you're not gonna have
occasion to clean house a little?

250
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:52,210
Let me ask you something.
If you were dating somebody...

251
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,956
...and she did that, would you
continue going out with her?

252
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,591
No. That's disgusting.

253
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,724
You cannot believe
what I am going through.

254
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:05,514
That card is plastered
all over the office.

255
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,894
Everybody's calling me " Nip."

256
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:13,357
Yeah, that's my new nickname
at the office. Nip.

257
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,687
These guys keep asking
me out for drinks.

258
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:18,402
Not only that. Fred, you know,
the guy I told you about...

259
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,485
...he hasn't called me in three days.

260
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,366
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

261
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:25,827
How come I didn't get
a Christmas card?

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,076
Everybody else got one.

263
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:30,410
Jerry got one. Kramer got one.

264
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:34,039
I thought we were good friends. I don't
get a Christmas card. I don't get it.

265
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:37,300
You want a Christmas card? You want
a Christmas card? All right, here.

266
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:39,213
Here's your Christmas card.

267
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,481
You got any Double Crunch?

268
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:54,727
Yeah, I think I do.

269
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,609
- What's that perfume?
- It's the ocean.

270
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:04,909
That's mine. That's my smell.

271
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,200
Jerry, get that model to get me an
appointment with Calvin Klein.

272
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,035
I can't. She won't return my calls...

273
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,369
...because she caught me
in a pick at a light.

274
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,590
- I thought you said it was a scratch.
- That's not what she thinks.

275
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:20,092
Call her agency. Maybe she's been
out of town and didn't get the calls.

276
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:21,637
Get it.

277
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,841
All right.

278
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,769
I'll call the agency.

279
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,228
Hello.

280
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,393
I'm trying to get in touch
with Tia Van Kamp.

281
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,645
Do you know if she's been in town?

282
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,529
Oh, really?

283
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,655
- Well, thank you very much.
- What?

284
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:44,660
She has been in town.
She's at Calvin Klein right now.

285
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,035
Let's go.

286
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,205
It'll be different this time.
I promise.

287
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:55,786
I promise difference.
I'm committed to difference.

288
00:15:55,964 --> 00:15:58,965
I need someone a little more stable.

289
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:01,921
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock.

290
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:06,140
I take these glasses off, you can't tell
the difference between me and a rock.

291
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:09,642
I put these glasses on a rock, you
know what jumps into people's minds?

292
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,769
Costanza.

293
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,685
- People don't change.
- I change. I change.

294
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:17,065
Two weeks ago,
I tried a soft-boiled egg.

295
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:22,147
Never liked it before. Now, I'm dunking
a piece of toast in there and loving it.

296
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,285
I'm not a soft-boiled egg.

297
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:28,656
And I am not a piece of toast.

298
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,369
I just don't think that we have
anything in common.

299
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,618
That's okay. That's good.

300
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,878
You think Louis Pasteur and
his wife had anything in common?

301
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:40,879
He was in the fields all day
with the cows and the milk...

302
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:44,883
...examining the milk, delving into milk,
consumed with milk.

303
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,213
Pasteurization. Homogenization.

304
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:51,223
And she was in the kitchen, killing
cockroaches with a boot on each hand.

305
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:54,351
Why were there
so many cockroaches?

306
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:57,607
Because there was a lot of cake
lying around the house...

307
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:02,237
...just sitting there with all the excess
milk from the all experiments.

308
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,490
- And they got along?
- Yes. Yes.

309
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,738
She didn't know
about pasteurization.

310
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:13,911
He didn't know about fumigation.
But they made it work.

311
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,370
- You can't go in.
- I want to talk to Calvin.

312
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:19,827
- Let me talk to Calvin.
- Wait.

313
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,083
- I just want to talk to Calvin.
- Kramer?

314
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,883
- Oh, Tia, hi.
- Who are you?

315
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:25,547
I'm here to talk about the ocean.

316
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,261
Oh, yes, Kramer.

317
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:32,180
I think I know something about this.
Would you excuse us, Tia?

318
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:35,011
- I don't want any trouble, Calvin.
- Neither do I.

319
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,433
Hello. There you are.

320
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,103
Hello. What are you doing here?

321
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,768
I had to talk to you.
You haven't returned my calls.

322
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:45,070
Well, I've been busy.

323
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,692
I thought we had a good time. The only
explanation I could come up with is...

324
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,621
...you think that you caught me...

325
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,118
I'd rather not talk about this.

326
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,078
But I was clearly
on the outer edge of the nostril.

327
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,459
- I know what I saw.
- But there was no pick.

328
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,456
I did not pick. There was no pick.

329
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:05,297
- I gotta go.
- No. No pick.

330
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:06,797
Now here's the scoop, Calvin.

331
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,466
I came in here last January
to talk to one of your flunkies.

332
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:12,970
Interesting face.

333
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,439
And when I told him my idea
about the beach cologne...

334
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,100
...you know, he laughed at me.

335
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:22,477
You're very lithe, aren't you?
Very graceful.

336
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,898
Well, yeah.

337
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,449
- Sit down.
- All right.

338
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:36,070
You're very lean. But muscular.

339
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,247
You know, I try to take care of myself.
I watch what I eat.

340
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,172
Just recently, I cut out fructose.

341
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,424
I think you're spectacular.

342
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:54,881
I told you, Fred. My friend's
next-door neighbour took it.

343
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,435
So, what happened?

344
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,138
Well, I-I must have missed a button.
I forgot to button it.

345
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:03,850
I really don't see how you could
miss a button like that.

346
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,521
Oh, you've never missed a button?

347
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>- Yeah.
- It's your sister, Gail.</i>

348
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:12,660
Oh, God. My nephew.

349
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,696
Hi, Gail.

350
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,069
Yeah.

351
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,371
Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.

352
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,949
Hey, Nip, you need
that manuscript, or can I take it?

353
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,912
Take it. Take it.
And stop calling me Nip.

354
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:28,046
It was an accident.

355
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:33,048
Well, it's gotta be somewhere.
Look under his mattress.

356
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:55,741
About the focus group? I have nothing
to do with the focus group.

357
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:00,456
Oh, yeah.

358
00:20:03,754 --> 00:20:06,126
He's sexual...

359
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,919
...athletic and without a trace
of self-consciousness.

360
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:11,425
His buttocks are sublime.

361
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:15,013
His pectorals could use some work.
Get him into the weight room.

362
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:19,226
No. Let's get him in the studio today.
We could send these out immediately.

363
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,109
You've done it again, C.K.

364
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:29,610
And what if I did do it? Even though
I admit to nothing and never will.

365
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,404
What does that make me?

366
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:35,440
I'm not just defending myself, but all
those pickers who have been caught.

367
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:37,951
Each and every one of them...

368
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:43,412
...who has to suffer the shame and
humiliation because of people like you.

369
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:48,377
Are we not human?
If we pick, do we not bleed?

370
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:53,634
I am not an animal.

371
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:58,300
I did not bare myself deliberately,
but I tell you, I wish now that I had.

372
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:01,926
Because it is not me
that has been exposed, but you.

373
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:05,722
For I have seen the nipple
on your soul!

374
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:10,899
So the minute I started up the steps
to her apartment...

375
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,648
...I knew I made a terrible mistake.

376
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,156
Going back with her.

377
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,942
So we're in her apartment.
She goes into the bathroom.

378
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,869
I'm cursing myself.
Now how do I get out of there?

379
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,283
And then it hits me
like a bolt of lightning.

380
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:28,412
The pick.

381
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,834
- The pick?
- The pick?

382
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:35,924
She comes out of the bathroom,
I'm in up to my wrist.

383
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,968
You should've seen
the look on her face.

384
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:43,598
I think I've seen that look.

385
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:47,730
Hey, I got the magazine.
The underwear ad came out.

386
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,809
Hey, Calvin Klein!

387
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:53,899
- Hey, you look great!
- Neat.

388
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,314
Boy, they really
worked on your pectorals.

389
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:59,196
- Well.
- Your buttocks are spectacular.

390
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,527
- Oh, my.
- What?

391
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:05,619
Well, I'm not sure...

392
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:09,209
...but I think I see your...

393
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,206
The human body
is a lot of maintenance.

394
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:14,916
A lot of showering, a lot of shaving,
a lot of cleaning, a lot of clipping...

395
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:18,130
...a lot of checking. If your body
was a car, you wouldn't buy it.

396
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:21,175
It's too much upkeep.
It's a pain.

397
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,019
But women definitely go
to the absolute extreme.

398
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:28,729
To me, it's amazing the way women
take care of all the hair on their bodies.

399
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:30,891
One of the
great mysteries to me...

400
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,068
...is the fact that a woman
could pour hot wax on her legs...

401
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:39,232
...rip the hair out by the root
and still be afraid of a spider.
