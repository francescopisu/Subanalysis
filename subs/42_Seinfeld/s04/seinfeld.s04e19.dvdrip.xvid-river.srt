1
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:07,797
I don't belong to a health club. I have a
limit on naked men I see in one day.

2
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,600
Zero.

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:11,561
That's it.

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:14,730
What is with the high level of security
at health clubs, you know?

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,266
The picture IDs. Security guards.
Signing in and out.

6
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:19,103
What is this, the Kremlin?

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,775
I mean, the people with a membership
go twice a year. Who's breaking in?

8
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:28,615
Is this a big problem,
people stealing exercise?

9
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:31,908
And what if they catch the person?
What then? They run. It's aerobic.

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,040
Makes it even worse.

11
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,292
- Hi, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Sidra.

12
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,592
I last about 10 minutes
on the StairMaster.

13
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,595
Unless someone's stretching in front of
me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.

14
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:52,432
- Really?
- That's why it's called the StairMaster.

15
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:54,596
You get up there and you stare.

16
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:58,604
Well, I'm done.
I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.

17
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,187
I'll see you Thursday night?

18
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,772
- Thursday night.
- Okay.

19
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,490
Good workout?

20
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:07,865
Tremendous workout.

21
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:11,781
- It's a pretty girl.
- Tremendous girl.

22
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:15,041
- She the one you went out with?
- Yeah. I really like her.

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,625
You know, they're fake.

24
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:23,468
- What? Don't say that.
- No. They're fake.

25
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:25,627
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

26
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,473
You know how you always brag
how you can spot a lesbian?

27
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,303
I'm not bragging. I happen to
have a very keen lesbian eye.

28
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,802
Hi, how you doing?

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,470
Oh, right.

30
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:41,397
Come on. Don't you think
they seem just a bit too perfect?

31
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,562
Yes, they do.

32
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,991
I never knew you were into breasts.
Thought you were a leg man.

33
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,904
Leg man? Why would I be a leg man?
I don't need legs. I have legs.

34
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:56,617
Have you seen her naked
in the locker room?

35
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,620
- No.
- Then I can't accept your testimony.

36
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,123
Maybe if you'd seen her naked.

37
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,503
- I don't wanna see her naked.
- Well, I do.

38
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,631
Well, that's your problem.

39
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:07,755
Look, you made the allegation.
The least you could do is follow up.

40
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:12,011
Jerry, what am I gonna do? Go in
there and spy on her in the sauna?

41
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:15,967
Yes. Go in there. Do a little
investigative journalism.

42
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,343
I need to know.

43
00:02:17,522 --> 00:02:20,606
But a few more dates,
you can find out for yourself.

44
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,518
Don't be so sure. Look at George.

45
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:25,363
He's on his ninth date with Betsy.
Still hasn't got anywhere.

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,775
What's his problem?

47
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,106
Every time he makes a move
something screws up.

48
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,075
Their last date
they were on the couch...

49
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:33,533
- ...but she was on his wrong side.
- Wrong side?

50
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:37,204
Yeah, she was on his right side. He
can't make a move with his left hand.

51
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,655
Can't go left.

52
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,039
- He can't go left?
- No.

53
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:43,881
I'm lefty. Can't go right.

54
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,173
What about women?
They go left or right?

55
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,631
No, we just play defence.

56
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,902
Could I ask you a question?

57
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,243
Would you mind switching seats?

58
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:24,667
Actually, I'd really prefer to sit here.
I don't hear very well out of this ear.

59
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:29,416
I always try to sit
to the right of people.

60
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,260
I'll shout.

61
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,089
Well, I really think
I feel more comfortable here.

62
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,011
Come on, come on.

63
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:39,894
- Come on, really. Come on.
- George, I-

64
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:42,304
- Now, come on.
- No, I really-

65
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,610
See, now is that so bad?

66
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,277
What?

67
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,613
- Oh, I-
- The machine will get it.

68
00:03:56,788 --> 00:03:57,986
No, it's not on.

69
00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:00,951
- They'll call back.
- George, what if it's an emergency?

70
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,795
In the whole world right now
there's maybe three emergencies.

71
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,915
Why would you think on this
planet that you're one of those three?

72
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,794
George, please.

73
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,011
Hello.

74
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:15,592
What?

75
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:18,090
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,722
All right, maybe four.

77
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,557
<i>Boy, I'm really sweating.</i>

78
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,317
<i>Good sweat. Beads of sweat.
Sweating bullets.</i>

79
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,316
<i>Look at her.</i>

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,325
<i>I don't need to see her naked
to know those aren't real.</i>

81
00:04:35,493 --> 00:04:37,818
<i>I mean, why'd she even
tie the towel around her?</i>

82
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,569
<i>She's got a rack on her chest.</i>

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,334
<i>Oh, God.
Sidra's taking the towel off.</i>

84
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,666
<i>Doctor.</i>

85
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:52,087
<i>That's it.</i>

86
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,833
<i>I knew it. I knew it.
They're definitely fake.</i>

87
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,301
So when's the funeral?

88
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,969
Oh, well.

89
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:05,433
Aunt Clarice was so ill
I guess it was really a blessing.

90
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,985
Yeah, I'll fly home
as soon as I can.

91
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:27,251
Okay. You too. Get some sleep.

92
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,130
- You're sure?
- Positive.

93
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:39,091
This chick's playing
with Confederate money.

94
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,056
Then that's it.
That's the end of that.

95
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,384
- What? Just because that?
- Just because of that?

96
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:46,764
It's like finding out
Mickey Mantle corked his bat.

97
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:51,400
You've dated women with nose jobs.
What's the difference?

98
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,527
You don't touch the nose.
You don't aspire to reach the nose.

99
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,905
You don't unhook anything
to get to a nose...

100
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:02,742
...and no man has ever tried to look
up a woman's nostrils.

101
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,158
You've put a lot of thought into this,
haven't you?

102
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:09,711
Well, I take it very seriously.

103
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:15,168
Sometimes when I think you're
the shallowest man I've ever met...

104
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:18,842
...you somehow manage
to drain a little more out of the pool.

105
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:22,636
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,549
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:28,397
You know, I do kind of wonder
what fake breasts feel like.

108
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,521
Well, I know what they feel like.

109
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,936
You? How do you know?

110
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,861
Well, I lived in Los Angeles
for three months.

111
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,030
- I thought you hated Los Angeles.
- No, I do.

112
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,772
Just miss
the warm weather, you know?

113
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,158
Oh, man, I wish I could get away.

114
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,785
Real busy now, down at the office?

115
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:48,751
No. You know who I saw
at the health club?

116
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,910
Salman Rushdie.

117
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,792
- No.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,293
Salman Rushdie.

119
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,253
Well, I could see that. You got
five million Moslems after you.

120
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,586
You wanna stay
in pretty good shape.

121
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:02,962
I know what the problem is.

122
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:06,256
I like her too much.
That's why I can't make a move.

123
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:10,480
- You put her on a pedestal.
- I put them on a dental chair.

124
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,265
He puts them on a dental chair.

125
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:16,818
I'm not her boyfriend.
I wanna be her boyfriend.

126
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:21,153
It's like a sauna in here.

127
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,831
- That's funny.
- You're a funny guy.

128
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,872
Never heard that before.

129
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,203
So you going to the funeral?

130
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,038
- You think I should?
- Are you kidding?

131
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,621
It's a golden opportunity
to advance the relationship.

132
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,337
She's crying. You put your arm
around her and console her.

133
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,301
You're the consolation guy.

134
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,931
- I'm the consolation guy.
- Consolation guy is big.

135
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:48,677
Her aunt dying
is the best thing for you.

136
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:51,426
It's like 10 dates in one shot.

137
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:55,433
This confers upon you
instant boyfriend status.

138
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,152
The family's there.

139
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,317
You're taking care of things. You're
getting sandwiches. You're the rock.

140
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,863
It's in Detroit, though.
It's an expensive flight.

141
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:07,154
Why don't you get a
"death in the family" fare?

142
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,872
What?

143
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,542
Go to the airlines. Tell them
that you have a death in the family...

144
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,083
...they give you
50 percent off the fare.

145
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,536
- Really?
- In fact...

146
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:21,001
...listen, I'll go with you. We'll tell them
there's a death in my family.

147
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:23,300
You buy the ticket. I'll split it.

148
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:27,718
Then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll
get to Detroit for a quarter of the price.

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,187
<i>Boy, I'm getting a good sweat here.
Great sweat. Good beads. Nice beads.</i>

150
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:40,398
<i>Oh, look who's here.
Silicon Valley.</i>

151
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:45,402
Oh, so anyway. We go out on one date,
and he asks me out for a second...

152
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:48,149
...and then out of nowhere he calls me,
cancels the date...

153
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,820
...and says
he doesn't wanna see me again.

154
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,585
Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing.

155
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:57,504
- Oh, that's okay.
- Did he give you a reason?

156
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:00,589
Yeah. He's going back
to his old girlfriend.

157
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,415
Really?

158
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:04,550
Said she's mentally ill.

159
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:10,972
He's one of those guys who is
obsessed with neatness and order.

160
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:15,604
Everything has gotta be just so.
He would have made a great Nazi.

161
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:21,692
Hey, does he ever
talk about Superman?

162
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:26,192
- Yes. How did you know?
- I know the type.

163
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,406
- Oh, so you can relate?
- Oh, yeah.

164
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:32,409
You know, I've seen you around the
club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

165
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,203
- Oh, hi. I'm Elaine.
- Hi.

166
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,250
Anyway, I stood up to shake her hand
and suddenly I lost my balance...

167
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:48,298
- ...and I fell right into her.
- You fell on her?

168
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,300
I touched them.

169
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:53,388
You what?

170
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:57,270
I touched them.

171
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,638
You touched them?

172
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:01,687
I needed them to help me
break my fall.

173
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,651
If it hadn't been for them,
I could have really injured myself.

174
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,565
Anyway...

175
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,656
...they're real.

176
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,324
Excuse me.

177
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,165
I think they might be real.

178
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,502
Oh, what do you know? You have
no breast-touching experience.

179
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:25,006
- I've touched mine.
- So have I.

180
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:28,257
Oh, right, I forgot.

181
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:34,349
Anyway, touching two breasts
doesn't make you an expert.

182
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,348
All right. Anyway, I think they're real,
and if they are, they are spectacular.

183
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:45,857
What are you doing to me?

184
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:50,897
You see...

185
00:10:51,076 --> 00:10:54,030
...my friend here,
his aunt passed away last-

186
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,782
Oh, I'm very sorry.

187
00:10:55,956 --> 00:11:01,377
I saw her last week. She looked
healthy and peaceful but she knew.

188
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:03,668
You poor thing.

189
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:07,881
You don't think you could buy
the ticket yourself? Oh, no, okay.

190
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:12,050
- I couldn't-
- No, please. There, there. You sit.

191
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:14,548
I'll purchase the ticket for you.

192
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,054
You're a good friend.

193
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:20,635
I understand you offer a
50-percent-off bereavement fare?

194
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:25,560
Yes. You have to pay the full fare now
then return to one of our counters...

195
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:29,948
...with a copy of the death certificate,
and we'll refund half your fare.

196
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,402
The death certificate?

197
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:38,742
Yes, we do need documentation
or people could take advantage.

198
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:43,079
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

199
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:44,997
I know but it happens.

200
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:50,593
You want my friend to ask his uncle,
a man who lost his wife of 44 years...

201
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,596
...for a death certificate to
save a few bucks on a flight?

202
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:56,931
That would be $387 round trip.

203
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,470
- You'll need my frequent flyer number.
- Yes.

204
00:12:03,691 --> 00:12:05,434
I don't know.
One minute they're fake...

205
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:08,017
...the next they're real.
I don't know what to believe.

206
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:12,027
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only
one who's touched them.

207
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:16,443
Well, you were grabbing
onto them to save your life.

208
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,613
If you were drowning and
I threw you a life preserver...

209
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:21,197
...you think you could tell
me if it was an inflatable?

210
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,866
I wouldn't have said anything if
I'd known you'd stop seeing her.

211
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:28,124
I don't mind a phony personality
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

212
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:31,297
- Hey.
- Hey.

213
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,959
- George off to Detroit?
- Yep. And in two days...

214
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:36,296
...I'm off to Puerto Rico.

215
00:12:36,974 --> 00:12:38,634
Hey, Kramer, by the way...

216
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,474
...I saw that guy at the health club.
That is not Salman Rushdie.

217
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,474
Wrong.

218
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,776
- There's Sidra.
- There's Salman.

219
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:50,522
- Where?
- Talking to that woman.

220
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,068
- To Sidra?
- If that's Sidra, she's talking to Salman.

221
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,612
- I don't think that's Salman.
- I don't think they're real.

222
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:58,157
- If that's Rushdie, they're real.
- If they're real, that's Rushdie.

223
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,784
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Sidra.
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Salman.

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,835
Like a sauna in here, huh?

225
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,589
Feel like I'm back at the desert.

226
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,007
- You've lived in the desert?
- Oh, yeah. I've-

227
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:21,136
I spent a little time
in the Mideast.

228
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,392
You ever been to the Mideast?

229
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:28,347
- Yes, I've been there.
- Look, my name's Kramer.

230
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,146
- Sal Bass.
- Yeah.

231
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,276
- Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:35,105
So...

233
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,275
...what kind of work do you do?

234
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:40,868
I'm a writer.

235
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:47,414
- Have you met my boyfriend, George?
- No.

236
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:50,587
George, this is Aunt May
and Father Jessup.

237
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,749
Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy.

238
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,594
This is my boyfriend, George.

239
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,430
Oh, George, how nice of you
to come all this way.

240
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:03,757
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise,
what's the point of being the boyfriend.

241
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,519
This is where you have to be
when you're the boyfriend.

242
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:10,638
Betsy, dear,
have you had anything to eat?

243
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:14,103
- I'm not very hungry.
- They have some very nice snacks.

244
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,316
I'm about to get myself a snack.

245
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,029
Oh, no. You sit right here.

246
00:14:20,202 --> 00:14:22,954
I will get you a nice snack.

247
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,414
This is my...

248
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,297
...third wake this month.

249
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:34,089
Never gets any easier.

250
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:37,591
Well, losing a loved one is-

251
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:40,003
I mean, forget about it.

252
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,557
You-

253
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:54,359
You seem to be of great comfort
to Betsy. We're very appreciative.

254
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,604
Comfort "schmomfort."

255
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:02,701
Listen, Father,
can I ask you a question?

256
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,700
In a terrible time like this...

257
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:09,039
...who would I get the
death certificate from?

258
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:13,790
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, how can you be so sure?

259
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:19,089
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer.
He said his name was Sal Bass.

260
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,541
Bass, Jerry.

261
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,805
Instead of salmon,
he went with bass.

262
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:27,094
He just substituted
one fish for another.

263
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:31,891
Look, you idiot, first of all,
it's "Salman," not "salmon."

264
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,817
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing
the big picture.

265
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,441
All right. Maybe it is,
but listen, I gotta get ready...

266
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,652
...Sidra's coming over
so if you don't mind-

267
00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:43,323
- What, did you ask her?
- I'm gonna find out tonight.

268
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:45,403
Yes.

269
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:49,661
Why do you need
a death certificate?

270
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,826
Well, Dr. Allenwood...

271
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,255
...I was hoping to compile an...

272
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:02,798
...admittedly rudimentary
scrapbook of her life.

273
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,841
Something that Betsy
could have and hold on to.

274
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,676
Well, I suppose I could
make a copy of it.

275
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:11,347
Oh, that would be wonderful.

276
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,349
- Well, it's nice meeting you, George.
- Likewise.

277
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:32,040
What are you doing?

278
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,493
- What?
- Did-?

279
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:37,710
Did you just double dip that chip?

280
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,673
- Excuse me?
- You double dipped the chip.

281
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,168
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?

282
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:46,679
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

283
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,972
...and you dipped again.

284
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,392
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth...

285
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,556
...right in the dip.

286
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:02,529
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

287
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:09,034
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...

288
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,247
...but I don't dip that way.

289
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:13,206
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

290
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,210
You dip the way you wanna dip...

291
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,086
...I'll dip the way I wanna dip.

292
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:19,833
- Give me the chip.
- Hey, hey, hey!

293
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,252
Give me the chip.

294
00:17:22,426 --> 00:17:25,925
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I must be crazy.

295
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:41,360
- Hey, you mind switching seats?
- Why?

296
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,740
I don't know. I like sitting to the left of
people. Makes me feel like I'm driving.

297
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:49,030
Okay.

298
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,999
- How you doing?
- Good.

299
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,079
- How you doing?
- Good.

300
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:02,164
Feel good.

301
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,589
You know that Jayne Mansfield
had some big breasts.

302
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,095
Really big-

303
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:16,435
Huge. Just coming out the top of
her dress. They were choking her.

304
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:20,899
- I hear that's how she died.
- Yeah.

305
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,729
Have you noticed
that women today are-?

306
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,814
You know, they seem bigger.

307
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,489
- A lot of women are having them done.
- Really?

308
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,067
- Yeah.
- How do you like that?

309
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:34,997
A lot of people ask me
if I've had mine done.

310
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:37,537
You know people.

311
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:40,160
Gets a little tiring.
It's none of their business.

312
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,828
Oh, the nerve.

313
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:47,007
You know some people have
asked me if you've done that.

314
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:48,964
And what do you tell them?

315
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,171
Whatever you want me
to tell them.

316
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:56,183
Well, I think
you'll find out soon enough.

317
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:05,359
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- No.

318
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,364
- Well, what if it's an emergency?
- Oh, there's no emergency.

319
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:11,865
Jerry. Come on.
It's an emergency.

320
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,620
Excuse me.

321
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,492
All right.

322
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,291
What is it? You're interrupting.

323
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,838
I'm packing for Puerto Rico.
I need to borrow your bathing suit.

324
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,547
This is an emergency?
You need a bathing suit?

325
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:28,998
Well, I like yours.

326
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,213
I don't know, my bathing suit?
That's a little familiar.

327
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,760
I don't want your boys down there.

328
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,565
What's the matter with my boys?

329
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:49,318
Your boys should stay
in their neighbourhood.

330
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:54,151
- All right, come on.
- All right. It's in the top drawer.

331
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,569
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

332
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,577
- Hi, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.

333
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,332
- Oh, hi, Sidra.
- Hi. Elaine?

334
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,208
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Kramer.

335
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,046
- What's going on?
- She was just...

336
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,592
...showing me pictures
of places in Puerto Rico.

337
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,255
- When you two went down there.
- Oh, yeah. All right.

338
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,591
- Well, just-
- You know, these-

339
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,179
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

340
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,478
So where were we?

341
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,902
- I was just leaving.
- Right. You were leaving.

342
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,907
I can't believe you sent a woman
into the sauna to do that?

343
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,866
That was an accident.

344
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,036
I think you're both mentally ill.

345
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:50,586
And by the way, they're real
and they're spectacular.

346
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:55,334
Stop it, George. Get out. Get out!
I never wanna see you again.

347
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:58,468
- Go back to New York.
- Get out.

348
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:05,474
All right, sir. Now all I need is a death
certificate and you'll be on your way.

349
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,316
Well, you see
what happened was...

350
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:16,031
...the doctor, the very same doctor that
was attending my late aunt suffered...

351
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:18,443
...an untimely stroke...

352
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,285
...and lost the use
of his right hand so...

353
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:26,158
...obviously I was unable to get
the death certificate.

354
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:29,337
However, I do have this.

355
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:33,342
What's this?
- A picture of me next to the coffin.

356
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,678
- Nice try.
- Not even close, huh?

357
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,341
No.

358
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:45,852
The cosmetic surgery procedures
that are available to people today-

359
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:47,849
Liposuction.
Are you familiar with this?

360
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,147
This is a fat-sucking machine.

361
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:53,023
Now, you know, somewhere,
somebody is working on a way...

362
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:55,568
...that this thing could go
into a restaurant.

363
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,982
And you could just
order it off the menu.

364
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,199
Give me the cheesecake,
crank me up to nine...

365
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,659
...and put a scoop of ice cream
on the side.
