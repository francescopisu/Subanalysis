1
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:05,797
To me, the whole concept
of fear of success...

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:09,722
...is proof that we are definitely
scraping the bottom of the fear barrel.

3
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:12,599
Will we have to have AA-type
meetings for these people?

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:16,936
"Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing
I'm worried about is having a stereo...

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,186
...and a cream-colored couch."

6
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:24,823
According to most studies, people's
number-one fear is public speaking.

7
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,318
Number two is death.

8
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:32,038
Death is number two.

9
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:37,837
Now, this means to the average
person, if you have to go to a funeral...

10
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,757
...you're better off in the casket
than doing the eulogy.

11
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:47,389
Why can't I play Kramer?

12
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:50,226
Look, we've been through this
already. You're not an actor.

13
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:51,887
- Well, neither are you.
- I know.

14
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,888
Why do we need two people
that can't act?

15
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:55,973
Oh, come on, Jerry.
How hard is it to act?

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,272
You say something.
I'll pretend it's funny.

17
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,858
- What?
- My grandmother's in the hospital.

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,315
Your grandmother's in the hospital.

19
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,786
- This is real believable.
- You didn't think I was laughing?

20
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,197
- It stinks.
- All right, let me see you do it.

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,581
- Say something funny.
- All right.

22
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:19,584
I've never been to Mars,
but I imagine it's quite lovely.

23
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,084
Mine was better than that.
Come on, look:

24
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:33,262
- Why are you pretending to laugh?
- We're acting.

25
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:36,009
Oh, yeah, real good.

26
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,308
- Any word from NBC?
- No.

27
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,437
I don't understand. They're
supposed to be casting this week.

28
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,939
Maybe they're not doing it.

29
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:44,690
Well, at least let me audition.

30
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,738
He wants to play Kramer in the pilot.

31
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:49,778
Out of the question.
How could we not hear anything?

32
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:52,574
What's with this Russell?
What's he doing?

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,624
Hi, Russell.

34
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:01,127
- Sit. Sit down. It's okay.
- I really appreciate you coming.

35
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,547
Oh, that's okay. I-I don't have much
time, though, so-

36
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,710
All right, well, first of all...

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,378
...I want to apologize for
all the phone calls.

38
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,382
It's just- It's just...

39
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,391
I don't understand.
We went out once, and-

40
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,888
Yeah, that was two months ago.

41
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,932
Yes, I know, and I-I-I just-
I can't get you out of my mind.

42
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,611
Ever since that-

43
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:27,104
The day in that restaurant
when we met...

44
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:31,858
- Do you have a ketchup secret?
- No, but-

45
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:37,370
Russell, you are the president of NBC.

46
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,080
You can have any woman you want.

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,747
But I want you.

48
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,923
God, I hate these mixtures.

49
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,217
I don't know why- Why don't they
just put pretzels out on the table?

50
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,089
Or peanuts would be good, but...

51
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:53,098
...I don't know who eats
these cheesy things.

52
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,391
Is it something I said?

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,758
Or did?

54
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:00,098
Look, Russell...

55
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,276
...you're a very sweet guy, but...

56
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,400
...I gotta be honest with you.

57
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't like television.

58
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,277
And that's your world.
That's your life.

59
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,789
Maybe if you were in Greenpeace or
something, that would be different...

60
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,495
...but network television, I mean...

61
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,705
...come on, Russell.
You're part of the problem.

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,631
Elaine, we're doing some very
interesting things right now.

63
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,006
We've got very exciting pilots
for next season.

64
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:32,213
We have one with a bright young
comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

65
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:35,722
Oh, yeah, you know, I've heard of him.
He's that:

66
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:38,762
"Did you ever notice this?
Did you ever notice that?" guy.

67
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:42,187
In fact, he was in the restaurant
the day that we met.

68
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,642
Well, anyway, it's a
groundbreaking show.

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,319
Really? What is it about?

70
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,523
Well, really- It's-It's really-
It's very unusual.

71
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,741
It's about nothing.

72
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,701
What do you mean, it's about nothing?

73
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,320
For example, what did you do today?

74
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,953
I got up. I went to work.

75
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,752
Then I came here.

76
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,997
There's a show. That's a show.

77
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,415
Russell, see, I'm really not
interested in this...

78
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,668
...and I do have to...

79
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:15,094
- ...go to work, so-
- Elaine, when-? When are we-?

80
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:19,345
- When are we gonna see each other?
- I'm sorry, Russell. I'm sorry, okay?

81
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,179
Bye-bye.

82
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:26,475
- So I'll see you later, huh?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,356
Hello. Yeah, he's here. Hey!

84
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,687
- It's for you.
- Oh, yeah?

85
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,406
He's getting phone calls here now?

86
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,117
Hello.

87
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,361
Again with the sweatpants?

88
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:38,948
What? I'm comfortable.

89
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,791
You know the message you're
sending with these sweatpants?

90
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,449
You're telling the world, " I give up.

91
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,208
I can't compete in normal society.

92
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,416
I'm miserable, so I might
as well be comfortable."

93
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:53,209
Hold on a second, I got another call.

94
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:54,886
Hello.

95
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:56,466
Yeah, he'll call you back.

96
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,134
- Who is it?
- That's NBC.

97
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,800
NBC?!
Give me the phone!

98
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,386
- I'm having a conversation here.
- Get off the phone.

99
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,062
Okay, look, I'll call you back. Yeah.

100
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:10,650
You know I'm waiting
to hear from them.

101
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,402
- Who was it?
- Russell Dalrymple's secretary.

102
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:17,487
All right. Now you're doing
something to help me.

103
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:20,870
Hello. Yes, it's Jerry Seinfeld
returning the call.

104
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,913
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

105
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:29,162
Casting tomorrow at NBC, 4:00.
We're in business. The pilot's on!

106
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,580
You're gonna be successful.

107
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,294
What if the pilot gets picked up...

108
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,422
...and it becomes a series?

109
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,506
That would be wonderful.
You'll be rich and successful.

110
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:42,888
That's why I'm worried.

111
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,183
God will kill me before letting
me be successful.

112
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,106
- He'll never let me be happy.
- You don't believe in God.

113
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,602
I do for the bad things.

114
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,601
Do you hear what you're saying?

115
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,905
God isn't out to get you, George.

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,694
What-?

117
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,910
What is that on your lip?

118
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:05,954
- What?
- It's like a discoloration. It's white.

119
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,958
Yes. Yes, it's white.

120
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,253
- Why is that white?
- You'd better get that checked out.

121
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,632
- "Better get that checked out"?
- I would.

122
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,472
What kind of a therapist are you?

123
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,971
I'm telling you I'm scared
something will happen...

124
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,388
...and you look for tumours?

125
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,231
- I'm trying to help you.
- What are you, like, a sadist?

126
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:30,888
No matter how bad somebody
feels, you can make it worse.

127
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,225
- You're rooting for a tumour.
- You'd better go.

128
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:35,609
I'm going, baby. I'm going!

129
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,982
- Where?
- Right here.

130
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:41,781
Get out of here, it's nothing.

131
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:43,990
Excuse me.

132
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,657
Do you see anything on my lip?

133
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,157
Yeah. Like a discoloration.

134
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,706
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's all white.

135
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,085
It's all white, Jerry.
It's all white.

136
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:54,501
Would you stop?

137
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,298
I'd get that checked out.

138
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,258
Again with the checked out.

139
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,005
I'm not going to the doctor.

140
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,097
If I don't, nothing will happen.
If I go, he might find something.

141
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:06,183
- If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
- Catch what in time?

142
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,641
- Whatever it is.
- You think it's something?

143
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,563
I hate these bums with their rags.

144
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:15,066
No, no, no, I don't want it. Get away.
Get away. Get away from my car.

145
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,145
You know, these squeegee-

146
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,610
Oh, my God,
it's Crazy Joe Davola.

147
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,690
Good luck on the pilot, Jerry.

148
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,449
Yeah, I think I see it. It's like a...

149
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,371
...white discoloration.

150
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,249
What do you think it is?

151
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,626
It's like a white discoloration.

152
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,258
Okay, guys, are we ready to start?

153
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,552
Where's Russell? I thought
he was gonna be here.

154
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:49,227
I don't know. I saw him this morning,
and I said hello. He walked past me.

155
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,471
He must be worried about
the fall schedule.

156
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,474
- It's a real bear.
- Yeah.

157
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,105
So, what's going on?
We're gonna shoot the pilot...

158
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,151
...then it's gonna be on TV
the next week?

159
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:59,981
Yeah, right.

160
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:01,984
This is Mark Matz.

161
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:04,115
He'll be auditioning
for the role of George.

162
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,112
- How you doing?
- Hey, Mark, how are you?

163
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,656
<i>They've gotta be kidding.</i>

164
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,658
<i>This guy's perfect.</i>

165
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,909
Okay, let's read this.

166
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,745
And I'll be reading Jerry's part.

167
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,956
Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?

168
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,588
- No, why?
- Listen to me.

169
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,547
I told the unemployment office
I was close to a job with them...

170
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,215
...and I gave them your number.

171
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,972
When you answer the phone, you've
got to say, "Vandelay Industries."

172
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,765
- I'm Vandelay Industries?
- Right.

173
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:33,645
- What is that?
- You're in latex.

174
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,273
What do I do with latex?

175
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,979
I don't know. You manufacture it.

176
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,310
This is Michael Barth,
another George.

177
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,944
- Hi, Michael.
- How you doing?

178
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,690
- Everything all right?
- I just came from the podiatrist.

179
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,111
Something's wrong with my foot.
A little gangrene.

180
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,913
They'll probably have to amputate.

181
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:53,951
Any questions?

182
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:56,452
What are we looking at?
Is this guy a real loser?

183
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,538
No, not a loser.

184
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,665
Let's start with the second scene.
You have it?

185
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,956
- Yeah.
- Okay.

186
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:05,131
A man gave me a massage.

187
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,219
So?

188
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,058
Well, he-

189
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,721
He had his hands, you know...

190
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,220
- ...and he was-
- He was what?

191
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:18,849
Well, he was, you know-
He was touching and rubbing.

192
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,979
That's a massage.

193
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:23,439
I think it moved.

194
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,948
This is Melissa Shannon.

195
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,489
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

196
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:31,116
Melissa is reading for Elaine.

197
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,285
It's like a bald convention out there.

198
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,702
<i>Sorry, I made a faux pas.</i>

199
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,702
No, you didn't,
he knows he's bald.

200
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,545
So how about that guy
wearing sweatpants?

201
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,339
Is that for the part, or does he
walk around like that?

202
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:49,347
Okay. Shall we start?

203
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:51,433
You know what?

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,059
I'll read with her.

205
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,769
Oh, great.

206
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,393
- All right, wanna start?
- Yeah.

207
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:01,848
Okay.

208
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:07,360
- What was that look?
- What look?

209
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,992
That look you just gave me.

210
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,654
- I gave a look?
- Yes.

211
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,117
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:15,200
Let's see some more Kramers.

213
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,634
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

214
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,885
- How you doing?
- Good.

215
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,062
- What is this about?
- Levels.

216
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,774
- Levels?
- Yeah. Getting rid of all my furniture.

217
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,395
All of it. I'm building levels...

218
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:51,115
...with steps, completely carpeted...

219
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,828
...with pillows.

220
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,076
Like ancient Egypt.

221
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,202
How are you gonna be
comfortable like that?

222
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:03,999
I'll be comfortable.

223
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,546
- Very good.
- Very nice.

224
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:11,336
Tom, that was terrific.
Thank you for coming in.

225
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,509
- Wonderful reading.
- That's really something.

226
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,351
- Bye.
- Okay. Thank you. Take it easy.

227
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,430
I thought he was really good,
very funny.

228
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,266
Yeah, I liked him.

229
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,942
What happened to the raisins?

230
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,019
Yeah, there was a box
of raisins there.

231
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,190
Did he just steal the raisins?

232
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,276
You think he stole them?

233
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:36,622
This is Martin Van Nostrand.

234
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:39,625
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other?

235
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,831
Wait a minute. I know you.

236
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,410
You're the guy from the Calvin Klein
underwear ads.

237
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,459
That's true.

238
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,265
I saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts again.

239
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,180
But this time...

240
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,188
...I went in.

241
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:09,861
Where's the bathroom?

242
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:13,406
I think if you go down the hall,
it's on the right at the very end.

243
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,320
Be right back.

244
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,207
Sorry, buddy. Full house.

245
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,473
Sorry. Customers only.

246
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,226
Hey, you need a ticket.

247
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,277
- So who's playing Elaine?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

248
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:56,862
Very talented young actress.

249
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,281
- Really?
- Yes.

250
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,281
- Who is it?
- She's an Eskimo, actually.

251
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,781
- Oh, God.
- She came down from Juneau by sled.

252
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,458
She was in the Iditarod. Got to the
finish line, just kept going.

253
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,917
She's got the dogs with her
in the hotel room.

254
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,709
Listen, was Russell at the casting?

255
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,792
No, he didn't show up.

256
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,380
You know...

257
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,629
...I'm a little bit worried about him.

258
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,881
I don't understand.
We had one date...

259
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:21,015
...two months ago.

260
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,976
Am I that charming and beautiful?

261
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,138
No. No, you're not.

262
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,852
- Why do I keep setting you up?
- I don't know.

263
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,484
Could we get a little more?

264
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,896
Heat more.

265
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,113
Ever since this new owner took over,
the service here is really slow.

266
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,572
Yeah. Have you noticed anything
else that's...

267
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,369
...different since the new
management?

268
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:49,244
They're putting a little lemon
in the tuna. I love that.

269
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:52,043
Besides that.
Look at the waitresses.

270
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:53,956
Yeah?

271
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,428
What physical...

272
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:02,180
...characteristic would
you say is common to all of them?

273
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,891
I mean, look at this.

274
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:10,931
Every waitress working here has the
same proportions, wouldn't you say?

275
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,648
Yes. I would say.

276
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,064
What's going on here?
How is this possible?

277
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,065
- Do you think it's a coincidence?
- No.

278
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:23,075
I-I haven't seen four women like this
together outside of a Russ Meyer film.

279
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:29,247
Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the
hiring of waitresses here?

280
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,421
He does. We're looking for
another girl if you know anyone.

281
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,125
You know what?
That's discriminatory.

282
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,636
That is unfair. Why should these
women have all the advantages?

283
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:44,222
They get all the attention from men.
They get all the waitress jobs too?

284
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:47,228
Hey, that's life. Good-looking men
have the same advantage.

285
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,305
You don't see
any handsome homeless.

286
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:55,603
You see, it's right here.
It's-It's a little white.

287
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,697
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

288
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,656
I've never seen this before.

289
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:04,237
"Never seen this before"?

290
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,326
I'm gonna have to take
a biopsy on this.

291
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:10,500
- A what?
- A biopsy.

292
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,243
- A biopsy?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,580
Cancer? Is it cancer?
Do I have cancer?

294
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,129
Well, I don't know what it is.

295
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,594
He took a biopsy, Jerry.
A biopsy.

296
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,977
- What'd he say?
- He didn't know what it was.

297
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,227
All right, so?

298
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,234
When I asked him about cancer,
he didn't say, "Get out of here."

299
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,154
That's what I wanted to hear,
"Cancer? Get out of here."

300
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:41,657
Maybe he doesn't have a
"get out of here" kind of personality.

301
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:44,233
How could a doctor
not say, "Get out of here"?

302
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,578
It should be part of medical school
training. " Cancer? Get out of here.

303
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,075
Go home. What are you, crazy?

304
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,370
It's a little test. It's nothing.
You're a real nut, you know that?"

305
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,955
Told you God would never
let me be successful.

306
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,792
I never should've written that pilot.

307
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,589
The show will be a hit, make
millions, and I'll be dead.

308
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,300
Dead, Jerry. Because of this.

309
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:06,512
Can't you at least die
with a little dignity?

310
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,391
No, I can't.

311
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,230
I can't die with dignity.
I have no dignity.

312
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,222
I want to be the person who
doesn't die with dignity.

313
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,151
I lived my whole life in shame.
Why die with dignity?

314
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,072
Hey.

315
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,366
What happened to you yesterday?

316
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,736
I got mugged.

317
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:28,651
- You got mugged?
- Mugged?

318
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:33,576
I wouldn't have minded, but I was
running home to go to the bathroom.

319
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:38,589
- Why didn't you use it in the building?
- It was full.

320
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,801
I tried a few other places, you know,
but that didn't work.

321
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,092
I mean, it was an emergency, Jerry.

322
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,098
I was really percolating.

323
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:53,676
So I decided to run home through the
park, and then two guys stopped me.

324
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:55,429
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me.</i>

325
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,983
Come on up.

326
00:16:58,443 --> 00:16:59,854
Now I got a big problem, buddy.

327
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,607
- What is it?
- Well...

328
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:05,696
I waited so long, I-
I missed my chance.

329
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:09,780
- You didn't go?
- No, and now I can't get it back.

330
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:20,622
The best thing to do
is just not think about it.

331
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,792
How could you not think about it?

332
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:26,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,971
- What's the matter with him?
- He's a little backed-up.

334
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,308
Elaine.

335
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,611
So I spoke to some of my sisters
about that coffee shop.

336
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,771
Oh, the sisters.

337
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,821
Have you seen the
waitresses in there?

338
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,529
I never had so much coffee in my life.

339
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,117
So we decided I should go over
there and apply for a job myself.

340
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,450
Apply for a job? What for?

341
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,120
Because it's discriminatory.

342
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:58,836
It's a coincidence.

343
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,831
- This is what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

344
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:02,749
You're not gonna get the job.

345
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,669
Exactly.

346
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,640
Hello.

347
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,350
Oh, hi.

348
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,851
Yeah, I guess we could do that.
At what time?

349
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,346
All right. I'll see you there.

350
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,852
Okay, bye.

351
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,108
- Who's that?
- TV Elaine.

352
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:24,270
She wants to talk about the part.

353
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:28,358
- What about the dogs?
- They're having sex in the hotel room.

354
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:34,572
So the Elaine character is based
on someone you know.

355
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,038
- Yes.
- And she's really your ex-girlfriend.

356
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:40,210
- Yeah.
- I want to know her from the inside.

357
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,170
What is she like?
Tell me about her.

358
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,423
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland.
She enjoys teasing animals...

359
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,712
...Banlon and seeing people
running for their lives.

360
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:53,051
She loves throwing garbage out the
window, yet she's extremely dainty.

361
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:54,636
How would she eat a hamburger?

362
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,767
- With her hands.
- What about pasta?

363
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:58,265
Also with her hands.

364
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,683
Seriously.

365
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:04,145
I want to experience
everything she's experienced.

366
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,897
Everything?

367
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,484
- Everything.
- All right, she cuts pasta with a knife.

368
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,318
Good. What's her favourite movie?

369
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:12,821
<i>Shaft.</i>

370
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:15,746
You gotta give me her picture.
What about sex?

371
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,491
She likes talking during sex.

372
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,078
Dirty talking?

373
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:24,380
No. Just chitchat, movies,
current events. Regular stuff.

374
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,375
- You know, Sandi-
- Elaine.

375
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,673
- What?
- Call me...

376
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:31,757
...Elaine.

377
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,097
All right...

378
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,853
- ...Elaine.
- How does Elaine kiss?

379
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,346
- Well-
- Does she kiss...

380
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,101
...like this?

381
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,234
Actually, she has a thing where she
spirals her tongue around. It's like a-

382
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:51,652
Like this?

383
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,870
I think you got it.

384
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,450
Now, I like to eat spaghetti...

385
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,037
...with just a fork.

386
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,919
Because I can keep
the strands long...

387
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:08,588
...and I can slurp it up to my mouth
like this. Look.

388
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,795
Now, sex, I like the bottom.

389
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,215
Let them do all the work, you know?

390
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,551
You should be writing
this stuff down.

391
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:21,804
Yeah. Bran flakes.

392
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,266
One hundred percent.
I got a big problem.

393
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:28,063
- And I'll have the hamburger. That's it.
- Yeah.

394
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,481
- Thanks a lot.
- That's good.

395
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,731
Now, I like to play golf.

396
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:33,864
Look, this stuff doesn't matter to me.

397
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,904
See, I'm gonna do the character
like me, not like you.

398
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,621
You gotta play him like me.

399
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,247
I'm Kramer.

400
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:43,750
- I'm Kramer.
- I'm Kramer.

401
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,828
What can I do for you?
Would you like table?

402
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:48,673
No, I'd like to apply
for a waitress job.

403
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,964
Have you ever waited
on tables before?

404
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,137
Oh, yeah. I've been a professional
waitress for the last 10 years.

405
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:57,765
I've worked all over this city.

406
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,806
These are my references.

407
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:02,930
I'm sure you'll find
that I'm more than qualified.

408
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,604
I don't think I need
anyone else right now.

409
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:15,533
You're in big trouble, mister!
And I mean trouble with a capital T!

410
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:18,819
What? What did I do?

411
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,325
Anyway, there's at least...

412
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,410
...four of them,
and they're all huge.

413
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,293
I mean, one is bigger than the next.

414
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,621
It's like a Russ Meyer movie.

415
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:31,541
Who's Russ Meyer?

416
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,668
He's this guy who made these...

417
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:37,715
...terrible movies in the '70s
with these kinds of women.

418
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,087
He's obsessed.

419
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,223
He's obsessed with breasts.

420
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,054
That's hard to say.

421
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:46,224
Anyway, go on.

422
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:50,898
There's not really much more to tell.
He was looking for waitresses...

423
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:55,446
...I went in to apply, and he looked me
up and down, and he rejected me.

424
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,865
Paul, come here for a second.
I want you to listen to this.

425
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,827
- Hi.
- Hi.

426
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:04,367
The woman here claims there's
a restaurant on the West Side...

427
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,246
...that's only hiring
large-breasted women.

428
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:09,670
Really?

429
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,923
- What do you mean, made-up?
- It's made-up.

430
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,465
Häagen-Dazs is made-up.
It's not Danish.

431
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,547
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

432
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:21,175
George, is Häagen-Dazs Danish?

433
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:23,508
- What do you mean, Danish?
- This guy stinks.

434
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:25,761
Danish. Is it from Denmark?

435
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,689
They make it in New Jersey.
It's just a Danish-sounding name.

436
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,765
I can't believe that.
They fooled me, Jerry.

437
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:34,733
Boy, talk about a show
about nothing.

438
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,103
Excuse me.

439
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,647
Excuse me.

440
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,907
This-This is not right.

441
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,620
May I?

442
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,286
You see, you're going:

443
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:52,704
"They fooled me, Jerry."
