1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,011
It's amazing to me
that people move...

2
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:07,674
...thousands of miles away
to another city.

3
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:10,139
They think nothing of it.
They get on a plane.

4
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,269
They live there now.

5
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:14,645
Just a thousand miles-
I'm living over there.

6
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:17,733
You know, pioneers- It took years
to cross the country.

7
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:21,900
Now people will move thousands
of miles just for one season.

8
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:24,113
I don't think any pioneers did that.

9
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,572
"Yeah, it took us a decade
to get there...

10
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,369
...and we stayed for the summer.

11
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:31,290
It was nice. It had a pool.
The kids loved it.

12
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:34,743
And then we left about 10 years ago,
and we just got back.

13
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:37,126
We had a great summer.
It took us 20 years...

14
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:39,289
...and now our lives are over."

15
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:46,879
<i>- Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
- Yeah.</i>

16
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,515
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:51,343
<i>Murphy Brown, the TV show?</i>

18
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,595
Come on, will you?

19
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:58,766
<i>Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
That son of a gun.</i>

20
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,232
- It's something, isn't it?
- With Candice Bergen.

21
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,693
- I know.
- I've always liked her.

22
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,489
<i>Remember her
in Carnal Knowledge?</i>

23
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:08,196
- Sure.
- She show her breasts in that?

24
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,987
She's not really the naked type.

25
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:13,157
I can't believe I missed Kramer.

26
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,243
He asked me to go with him.

27
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:17,910
- He did?
- Yeah. I turned him down.

28
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,964
- Why didn't you tell me?
- He asked me to keep it a secret.

29
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,876
- You can't keep a secret.
- I know.

30
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:26,005
This was a record. My previous
record was when Jodi Hirsch...

31
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:28,551
...asked me not to tell anybody
we slept together.

32
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,131
I kept a lid on that
for about 28 seconds.

33
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:34,139
- Well, you've come a long way.
- I've matured.

34
00:01:34,312 --> 00:01:36,305
<i>The Tonight Show
called and they want me...</i>

35
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,814
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me free tickets to L.A.

36
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,526
You wanna go?

37
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:43,153
A free ticket?

38
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,778
Yeah. In fact, we could
track down Kramer.

39
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:48,784
I always felt bad about the way
he left. That was a mess.

40
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:51,490
I never should've taken back
those keys.

41
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,236
- What about accommodations?
- All taken care of.

42
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:56,996
Is there a meal allowance?

43
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,995
What about seat assignments?

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,088
Could I have the kosher meal?
I hear the kosher meal is good.

45
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:05,127
And I need clothes.
I gotta get a haircut.

46
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,840
And I have to refill
my allergy medication.

47
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,921
Do I need a hat?
I need a hat, don't I?

48
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:14,344
<i>Could we do the Universal tour?
They have that Backdraft exhibit.</i>

49
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,061
Now, that looks very cool to me.

50
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:20,690
See, my acting technique-
My personal acting technique...

51
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:24,234
...is working with colour.
Imagining colour...

52
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,150
...and then finding the emotional,
vibrational mood...

53
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:28,865
...connected to the colour.

54
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:32,035
If you look through my scripts
you'll see that my lines...

55
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:35,738
...have a special colour.
So I don't memorize the language.

56
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:40,244
I memorize colour. This way, I can
go through red, yellow, green, blue.

57
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,586
And you have a full palette
of emotions.

58
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:45,215
Hey.

59
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,708
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?

60
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:49,214
- Did you?
- Let's go.

61
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:51,380
- I was just-
- Yeah, you were just nothing.

62
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:53,216
Come on, let's go.

63
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,307
We'll talk about this a little later.

64
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,635
- Let's go.
- Are you an actor?

65
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:00,847
See you, Mike!

66
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:23,913
<i>- Murphy Brown.
- Yeah, Candice Bergen, please.</i>

67
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,880
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

68
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,421
Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.

69
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,928
All right, I'll-I'll call her at home.

70
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,090
Here. Go ahead. It's all yours.

71
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:41,470
- Hello, Kramer.
- Oh, Helene. How are you?

72
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,308
I haven't worked since 1934.
How do you think I am?

73
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,561
Well, that's only...

74
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,071
<i>- Fifty-eight years.
- It was a Three Stooges short.</i>

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,569
"Sappy Pappies."

76
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,067
I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary,
remember?

77
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:57,284
Right, yeah.
That was a Shemp, right?

78
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,613
No, no. Curly.

79
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:02,079
The boys played three sailors
who find a baby.

80
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:05,087
The baby's been kidnapped,
and the police think they did it.

81
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,420
- Right.
- Of course, they didn't do it.

82
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,796
The police have made
an awful mistake.

83
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,126
Moe hits Curly with an axe.

84
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:14,924
- The Stooges catch the kidnappers.
- Right.

85
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:17,007
- But it's too late.
- Really?

86
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:19,888
- The baby's dead.
- Really?

87
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,311
The boys are sent to death row
and are executed.

88
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,390
Well, I don't remember that part.

89
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,393
I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.

90
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,976
Oh, yeah, yeah. You were very good.

91
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:33,321
<i>It was sad for a Three Stooges,
what with the dead baby...</i>

92
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,982
...and the Stooges
being executed and all.

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,280
Yeah, well, that was an unusual
choice for the Stooges.

94
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,950
Would you like to buy me
a fat-free frozen yoghurt at the store?

95
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:45,332
Well, you know, I can't right now,
you know.

96
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:46,831
I got a very big meeting.

97
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,495
I got these people interested
in my movie treatment.

98
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:51,666
So we'll have to make it another time.

99
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,547
No! No, no, don't go up there,
Kramer. They'll hurt you.

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
You'll never make it in this town.
You're too sensitive, like me.

101
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,685
Helene, you're wrong.
You know, I'm not that sensitive.

102
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,844
I was engaged to Mickey Rooney.
He left me at the altar.

103
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:06,897
Kramer.

104
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,438
Kramer!

105
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,949
- What is this?
- What?

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,121
We're going on a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

107
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,951
I happen to dress based on mood.

108
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,917
But you essentially wear
the same thing all the time.

109
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,462
Seemingly. Seemingly.

110
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:37,217
But within that basic framework,
there are many subtle variations...

111
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,844
...only discernible
to an acute observer...

112
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,554
...that reflect the many moods,
the many shades...

113
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,016
...the many sides
of George Costanza.

114
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:48,521
- What mood is this?
- This is "morning mist."

115
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,776
What do you figure? Twenty?

116
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:58,486
- Twenty-one?
- Close enough.

117
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,652
Forensics ought to be able
to nail it down.

118
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,655
- No ID?
- No ID.

119
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,365
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

120
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,582
Just the trees.

121
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,045
Pretty young thing.

122
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:13,208
She was.

123
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:14,925
Not anymore.

124
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:17,300
Somebody saw to that.

125
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,427
Sure did, Johnny.

126
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:21,964
Damn shame too.

127
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,886
What do you make of it?

128
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,637
I don't know.

129
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:29,014
But I don't like it.

130
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,770
Look at this guy.
He's like a cat burglar.

131
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:40,862
He thinks if he goes through real slow,
the machine won't detect him.

132
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,864
I've always been nervous
about going through these things.

133
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,363
I'm afraid I'm gonna step
into another dimension.

134
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,450
Just go.

135
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:52,629
I made it.

136
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:55,204
Empty your pockets, please.

137
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:58,206
Walk through again, please.

138
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,295
Are you sure you don't
have metal on you?

139
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:03,922
- Bracelets, rings, anklets?
- Anklets? No.

140
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,760
- A lot of men wear anklets.
- Really?

141
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,342
- Yeah.
- What do you have in your bag, sir?

142
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,146
- My bag?
- Step over here, please.

143
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:12,984
- Over here?
- Do you have a knife in the bag?

144
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:15,061
A knife?

145
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,526
Open the bag, please.

146
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,907
- What's this?
- Moisturizer.

147
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:25,202
For your wife?

148
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:27,452
No. I...

149
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:29,450
I use it.

150
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,540
Spread your arms and legs, please.

151
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:39,498
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

152
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,505
Have a good trip.

153
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:44,634
- All right.
- That's it?

154
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:46,135
- That's it.
- All right.

155
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:47,637
Come on, Jerry, let's go.

156
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:51,770
- What was that all about?
- I must have iron-rich blood.

157
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,766
- Here we go. L.A.
- The coast.

158
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,270
La-la land.

159
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,601
- I got the window seat, right?
- Who said that?

160
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,403
- I called it.
- Oh, no.

161
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:03,071
It seems to me that the closest thing
we have to royalty in America...

162
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:05,733
...are the people that get
to ride in those carts...

163
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,364
...through the airport.

164
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:10,076
Don't you hate these things?
They come out of nowhere.

165
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,618
Beep-beep. " Cart people.
Look out. Cart people. Look out."

166
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,285
We all scurry out of the way
like worthless peasants.

167
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,374
"It's cart people.

168
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,708
I hope we didn't slow you down.

169
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:26,180
Wave to the cart people, Timmy.
They're the best people in the world."

170
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,090
You know, if you're too fat,
slow and disoriented...

171
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:33,052
...to get to your gate on time,
you're not ready for air travel.

172
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,804
I hate the people that get
onto the moving walkway...

173
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,059
...and then just stand there.

174
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:40,275
Like it's a ride.

175
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:44,313
"Excuse me, there's no animated
pirates or bears along the way here.

176
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:47,777
Do your legs work at all?"

177
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,341
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

178
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:10,006
Which audition? The music video,
the horror movie...

179
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,093
...the exercise tape,
or the infomercial?

180
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:18,105
Let's see. Well...

181
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,560
You scream good.

182
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,850
You too.

183
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:07,904
- So can I keep this treatment?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I got 20 copies.

184
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,566
Because I can show it
to my manager.

185
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,236
He has connections with
West German television money.

186
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:16,747
Yeah, they're trying to put together
a miniseries for me on Eva Braun.

187
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,040
I mean, think about it.
Is that a great idea?

188
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:22,627
We know nothing about Eva Braun,
only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

189
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:25,087
What was it like having sex
with Adolf Hitler?

190
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,593
What do you wear in a bunker?
What did her parents think of Hitler...

191
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:31,336
- ...as a potential son-in-law?
- Wait, hold on.

192
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:34,174
Look who's over there.
Don't look, don't look.

193
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,178
It's Fred Savage.

194
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:39,386
- Big deal.
- He'd be perfect for my movie.

195
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,689
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

196
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,770
I gotta go over there. I gotta give him
a copy of my treatment.

197
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,574
Why are you breathing so hard?

198
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:52,866
I'm just a little nervous.

199
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:55,409
Okay, I gotta relax.

200
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,832
All right. Wish me luck, huh?

201
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:07,710
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you?

202
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,293
I'm not crazy. I look weird,
but I'm just like you.

203
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,223
I'm just a regular guy trying
to make it in this business.

204
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,757
I really like your work. The...

205
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,761
- Thank you.
- I can't remember the name.

206
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,185
- My mind's a blank. I'm nervous.
- That's okay.

207
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:21,684
- You know...
- Just relax.

208
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:24,064
Okay, yeah. But I got-

209
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,691
Stupid table.
I'm not normally like this.

210
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:29,614
Usually I'm cool and charming.
I don't mean to bother you.

211
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,736
It's fate that you're here
at the same time as me.

212
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,701
It's fate. You can't avoid your fate.

213
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,077
I got this treatment
I think you'd be great in.

214
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:39,371
- I'll give it to you.
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.

215
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,368
Excuse me.
Oh, wait. Are you going now?

216
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:42,919
- Bye.
- Wait, wait.

217
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:51,548
Yeah, that's Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R.

218
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:56,055
I don't know, wavy. George, how
would you describe Kramer's hair?

219
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,260
- Curly.
- Wavy.

220
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,891
- What did you ask me for?
- Yeah. I'll hold on.

221
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,768
George, did you see a piece
of paper on the nightstand...

222
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:06,562
- ...like, crumpled up like a napkin?
- No.

223
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:09,856
Because I had three jokes on it.
They were perfectly worded...

224
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,774
...just the way I wanted to have it.

225
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,776
I can't find it.

226
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,410
Hello?

227
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,451
Hey, a shoe-buffing machine.

228
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,706
I don't know, 6'3"?
George, how tall is Kramer?

229
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,163
You got your own shampoo,
conditioner...

230
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:26,918
Body lotion, Jerry, body lotion.

231
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,209
- About 6'3".
- A shower cap.

232
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:33,384
Come in.

233
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,472
Hello. I have more towels.

234
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:43,476
Oh, good, good. Come in, come in.
Welcome. I'm George.

235
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,931
- Hello.
- Hi. And this is Jerry...

236
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:48,813
...over there on the phone.
That's Jerry. And you are...?

237
00:12:48,986 --> 00:12:51,559
- Lupe.
- Lupe. That's very nice.

238
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:54,146
Are you gonna be making the bed
in the morning?

239
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,027
- Oh, yes.
- Fine, excellent.

240
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,277
Could you do me a favour?

241
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:01,408
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

242
00:13:01,582 --> 00:13:03,491
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

243
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,327
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.

244
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,661
I like to just be able
to take the blankets...

245
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:10,543
...and swish them and swirl them.
You know what I mean?

246
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:14,251
You know, I don't like them
all tucked in. I just don't.

247
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:18,260
I like to have a lot of room. I like
to have my toes pointed up in the air.

248
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,840
I just like to scrunch up the blankets.

249
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:23,723
Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.

250
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:26,185
Exactly. You know
what I'm talking about, right?

251
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:28,605
Yes. It's too tight.

252
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,480
- Him too?
- You want your blankets tucked in?

253
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:34,529
- What?
- Want your blankets tucked in?

254
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:36,821
- What blankets?
- When Lupe makes up the beds.

255
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:39,032
I don't know. Whatever they do.

256
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:40,863
I tuck in, yes?

257
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:42,947
Tuck in. Tuck in.

258
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,706
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

259
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,876
- Okay.
- Yes. One second, sweetheart.

260
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,289
Jerry, it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.

261
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:54,206
Excuse me. Fine.
You don't want me to tuck...

262
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:56,424
...put me down for a no-tuck.

263
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,511
It's two no-tucks.

264
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:02,555
Hang on a second. You know what?
Changed my mind. Make it a tuck.

265
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,511
- You just said you weren't tucking.
- I'm tucking.

266
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:10,728
Hello? Hello? They hung up on me.

267
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,770
They don't know
where Kramer is anyway.

268
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:17,571
Alrighty. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck. You got that?

269
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:22,321
Excuse me. Did you see a piece
of paper on the nightstand here...

270
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,572
...earlier today,
crumpled up like a napkin?

271
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:28,034
Oh, yes, yes. I throw away
when we clean the room.

272
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,119
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Thank you.

273
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,869
Thank you. All right, Lupe,
bye-bye now.

274
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,542
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

275
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:37,042
I can't believe she threw that out.

276
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:41,135
I had the perfect wording of a joke
I was gonna do about the airport.

277
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,343
<i>I was gonna do it on The Tonight Show.
Now I can't remember it.</i>

278
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,594
What did you want?
You left it on the table.

279
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,893
They're not supposed
to throw everything out.

280
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:52,564
Hey, hey!
It's not Lupe's fault.

281
00:14:52,735 --> 00:14:54,811
- You shouldn't have left it out.
- All right.

282
00:14:54,987 --> 00:14:57,359
Get your thing together
and let's get out of here.

283
00:14:57,531 --> 00:15:01,445
All right. Now, what mood am I in?
What mood am I-?

284
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,777
- You shouldn't have tucked.
- I like it tucked.

285
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,445
Nobody tucks anymore.

286
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,101
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

287
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:29,558
This was found on her person.

288
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,604
On her person?

289
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,981
- What kind of expression is that?
- I don't know, sir. Police lingo.

290
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:37,481
Oh, yeah?

291
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,947
What's your name, son?

292
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,821
- Ross.
- Ross.

293
00:15:42,993 --> 00:15:45,828
- You see that person there, Ross?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:47,407
She's dead.

295
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,159
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,661
Good.

297
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:53,409
Get out before you find yourself
on transit patrol...

298
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:56,921
...writing tickets to senior citizens
with fake bus passes.

299
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,633
Yes, sir.

300
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:07,017
I think we just caught a break.

301
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:12,096
This is very exciting.

302
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:15,350
<i>You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.
Who else is on the show?</i>

303
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,767
- I don't know.
- You might meet a celebrity.

304
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,854
I can't believe she threw out
my napkin.

305
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,066
What are you worried about?
You know it.

306
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,818
- You're gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Go about your business.

307
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:30,032
- I'll just wander around.
- All right. Don't wander too far.

308
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,035
- I'll meet you back here in 15 minutes.
- Go, go. Don't worry about me.

309
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,427
Hey.

310
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:51,220
Corbin Bernsen.

311
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,430
How you doing?

312
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:59,728
- Big fan. Big fan.
- Thank you.

313
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,908
- Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
- Yeah.

314
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:08,574
Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing a movie
during my hiatus.

315
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:10,786
Hey, you know...

316
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:14,580
<i>Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.</i>

317
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,871
Really.

318
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:22,379
So mind you, at this point, I'm only
going out with her two, three weeks.

319
00:17:22,593 --> 00:17:26,840
So she goes out of town,
and she asks me to feed her cat.

320
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:33,969
So, at this time, there's a lot of stuff
going on in my life...

321
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:38,144
...and it slips my mind
for a few days.

322
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:40,890
Maybe a week. Not even a week.
Five, six days.

323
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:43,027
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened?

324
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:47,146
Well, it's the damnedest thing.

325
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,609
The cat dies.

326
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,118
So she comes back. She finds the cat,
lying on the carpet, stiff as a board.

327
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:58,127
- So you killed the cat?
- That's what she says.

328
00:17:58,295 --> 00:18:00,703
I say, " Listen...

329
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:04,748
It was an old cat.
It died of natural causes."

330
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,387
So get this. Now she tells me
that I gotta buy her a brand-new cat.

331
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,849
I say, " Listen, honey,
first of all...

332
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:16,802
...it was a pretty old cat. I'm not
gonna buy you a brand-new cat...

333
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,807
...to replace an old dying cat.

334
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:21,271
And second of all,
I go out to the garbage...

335
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:23,815
...I find you a new cat
in 15 seconds."

336
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:27,985
I say, "You show me an autopsy report
that says this cat died of starvation...

337
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:30,400
...I spring for a new cat."

338
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,620
So she says something to me,
like, I don't know...

339
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,992
"Get the hell out of here."
And she breaks up with me.

340
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:41,584
<i>Now, don't you think that would be
a great case on L.A. Law?</i>

341
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,632
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your show-

342
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:49,178
No, of course not.

343
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:51,919
It's enough with the bar already,
you know?

344
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:54,591
Have they thought
about changing the setting?

345
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,096
Doubt it. I doubt it. Yeah.

346
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,346
People do meet in places
besides a bar.

347
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:00,016
Well, yeah, they do.

348
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,681
What about a rec room, huh?

349
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,979
- Or a community centre.
- You ought to write one of those.

350
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:08,480
I'll bring it up with the producers.
I gotta...

351
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:11,860
Fabulous. I'll think about that,
George. Thank you.

352
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:14,446
- How's it going?
- Great, great.

353
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:18,121
I actually just had two meaningful,
intelligent conversations...

354
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:20,201
...with Corbin Bernsen
and George Wendt.

355
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:23,212
- Really?
- Yeah. Not fan talk. Not gushing.

356
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,713
You know? Actual conversation.
I was incredibly articulate.

357
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,553
You got toilet paper
on your heel there.

358
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:37,925
<i>It's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.</i>

359
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:41,187
Tonight Jay welcomes
Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt...

360
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:43,978
...and comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

361
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:49,395
<i>Oh, yeah. People are always trying
to give me a great case for L.A. Law.</i>

362
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,194
Just a few seconds ago,
right outside in the hallway...

363
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,037
...this nut, some sick nut
comes up to me...

364
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:58,822
...and says he was supposed
to watch this girl's cat...

365
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:02,332
...while she was away out of town.
Anyway, he forgets to feed the cat.

366
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:05,290
The cat dies, starves to death.
He kills the cat.

367
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:07,421
Refuses to get her a new one.

368
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,998
Won't give her any money,
won't pay her.

369
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:12,668
And he wants Arnie Becker
to represent him. Nice guy.

370
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,922
<i>Yeah, that'd make a great case
for L.A. Law.</i>

371
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,092
Thanks a lot.

372
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:22,890
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

373
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,353
But troubled, strange.

374
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,148
I think he may be in love with me.

375
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:33,401
Of course, there's nothing abnormal
about that. I have many suitors.

376
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,025
It's funny, because
even after all these years...

377
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:40,247
...we still get people giving us advice
how to improve the show.

378
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:43,535
Actually, a few moments ago,
I ran into a nut back there...

379
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,082
...who said that maybe
we should think about...

380
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:48,924
...you know, not doing the show
in a bar.

381
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:57,053
So that's when I said,
"Hey, Kramer, dude...

382
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,631
...you ever kill a man before?"

383
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:02,852
And he said,
"What do you think, junior?

384
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:07,143
These hands have been
soaking in Ivory Liquid?"

385
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:09,475
That guy you talked to,
what did he look like?

386
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:13,401
- Short little bald guy with glasses.
- That's the same guy I talked to.

387
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,649
Never ends, does it?

388
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:21,278
So I'm going through the airport,
and I put my bag on that little...

389
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:24,243
The... The conveyor belt.

390
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,629
Issue an arrest warrant.
Put out an APB.

391
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,924
Let's pick up this...

392
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,756
...Kramer.

393
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:41,682
- I was terrible.
- What, are you crazy? You were fine.

394
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:44,010
I couldn't remember
what I was trying to say.

395
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,394
- That whole thing about the...
- Conveyor belt.

396
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:49,352
Yeah. Because she threw out
my napkin.

397
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:52,315
I can't believe-
You're blaming Lupe?

398
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:55,987
Yes. Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.

399
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,359
<i>Our top story tonight:
There's been a break...</i>

400
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:03,201
<i>...in the so-called Smog Stranglings.
Police have just released a photo...</i>

401
00:22:03,373 --> 00:22:06,409
<i>...of the suspect being sought
in connection with the slaying.</i>

402
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:10,713
<i>He is known only as Kramer.</i>

403
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:17,591
Talk show hosts
never seem to have any idea...

404
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:19,802
...how much time is left in the show.

405
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,464
They're always looking off-camera:
"Do we have time?

406
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,101
How are we doing on time?

407
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:27,056
Anybody know what the time is?
What's the time?"

408
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,852
You never see Magnum P.I. go,
"Should I strangle him...

409
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:31,816
...or are we gonna take a break here?

410
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,820
Can you stay for another beating?
I'll bop him in the head.

411
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,648
We'll do a commercial, come back...

412
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,030
...I'll drive the car real fast.
Stay with us."
