1
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:03,507
What are lawyers really?

2
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:08,882
To me, a lawyer is basically the person
that knows the rules of the country.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,349
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game...

4
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:14,564
...moving pieces around the board,
but if there's a problem...

5
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:18,516
...the lawyer is the only person that
has read the inside top of the box.

6
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:23,149
I think one of the fun things
for them is to say "objection."

7
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:28,117
"Objection! Objection, Your Honour."

8
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:32,120
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of "afraid not."

9
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,714
To which the judge
can say two things:

10
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:44,509
He can say "overruled," which
is the adult version of "afraid so."

11
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:49,296
Or he can say "sustained,"
which is the adult version of "duh."

12
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,640
So-So you're a lawyer.

13
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,817
What kind of cases do you handle?

14
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:03,936
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents,
immigration and naturalization.

15
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:07,740
What is that? Immigrants come over,
you show them how to act natural?

16
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:11,912
Are your friends as funny as you?

17
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:15,750
No, they're not funny at all.
No. I have no funny friends.

18
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:18,955
<i>I'm the funny one. El Clown-o.</i>

19
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,919
Look, I was nice enough
to pick it up for you.

20
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:24,298
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.

21
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,960
It's mostly bills, magazines
and junk mail anyway.

22
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:29,012
Elaine, that's what mail is.

23
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:32,017
Without bills, magazines
and junk mail, there is no mail.

24
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:34,974
- Here's my card.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

25
00:01:35,146 --> 00:01:37,518
- Hey, good talking to you.
- Nice meeting you.

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,069
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

27
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,146
You would not believe
what just happened.

28
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:47,442
I was waiting for you, and this woman
was sitting at the counter.

29
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:48,992
- The one who just left?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,446
And so we started talking
and she's this lawyer, who's incredible.

31
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,579
You know,
everything I said was funny.

32
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:58,083
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.

33
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,834
You know, in a way,
it was almost too good.

34
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:04,505
I started so good, I can't go anyplace
but down now, you know.

35
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,592
I got no place to go.

36
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:10,217
Yeah, well, guess it's all over.

37
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,805
Hey, is that Babu?

38
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:17,140
- It is. Hey, Babu!
- Jerry.

39
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,057
Look at you. You got the job.

40
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:22,149
- Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
- I didn't do anything.

41
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,403
No, you do everything.
Get me job, get me place to live.

42
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:26,942
- Come on.
- You very good man.

43
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,609
- Stop.
- You did everything.

44
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:31,072
I can never thank you enough
for everything.

45
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:33,362
You see, this is what I do
with women.

46
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:35,495
I start out too strong.

47
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:38,452
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.

48
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:42,253
What good is real? They don't
want real. They want funny.

49
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,996
- No, they don't. No.
- Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.

50
00:02:45,174 --> 00:02:48,294
You gotta put on a show.
You always gotta give them a big show.

51
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,304
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?

52
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:54,758
They'd just go for a better-looking
guy with more money.

53
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,228
You mean that's true? I'm right?

54
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,977
Okay, great. Well, I'm glad
everything worked out.

55
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:04,185
- Yes. Everything wonderful.
- I'll see you around the building.

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,567
I'll see you in the building.

57
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,443
- Remember Babu Bhatt?
- Who's he?

58
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,900
Remember that guy,
opened the restaurant...

59
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,911
...from the building last year
and he wasn't doing so well?

60
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,653
I told him he should make it
into all-Pakistani.

61
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:19,789
- It drove him out of business.
- Right.

62
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:22,749
So you going with me
to the auto show Saturday?

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,127
- Yeah.
- Can you bring my mail then please?

64
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:27,337
- What mail?
- I picked up his mail...

65
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,046
- ...while he was on the road.
- Why didn't Kramer?

66
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,889
Because he was at that baseball
fantasy camp in Florida.

67
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,677
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?

68
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,634
- Monday, I think.
- Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.

69
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:42,434
His whole life is a fantasy camp.

70
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:46,651
People should plunk down $2,000
to live like him for a week.

71
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:49,566
Do nothing,
fall ass backwards in the money...

72
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,898
...mooch food and
have sex without dating.

73
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,114
That's a fantasy camp.

74
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,364
If you're gonna go out with this lawyer,
have dinner with us.

75
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,327
Then you can go to the auto show
with her if you want.

76
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,908
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.

77
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,211
He never heard of corduroy!

78
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,506
Stop it, you're killing me!

79
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:18,259
Never heard of corduroy.
True story. True story.

80
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:20,804
Funny.

81
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,605
- No. No, I don't- I don't think so.
- Why?

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,778
Well, I think I'm better off
going one-on-one.

83
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:34,441
I don't know why you wanna play
man-to-man when you could play zone.

84
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:37,452
She might not be comfortable.

85
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,910
Why? We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.

86
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,073
- We'll be funny.
- No. No.

87
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,373
It's not good. I don't think so.

88
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,210
All right. If you change your mind,
we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.

89
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:50,420
No. No Isabella's. I don't want to go.

90
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:54,043
- Why?
- No, it's too trendy. No Isabella's.

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,102
Excellent.

92
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:04,976
Like I really know
what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,724
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.

94
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,562
But toast I love.

95
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,817
Never start the day
without a good piece of toast.

96
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:18,409
In fact, let's toast to toast.

97
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:27,538
Look who's here. Georgie boy.

98
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:30,921
What are you doing here?
You said you hated Isabella's.

99
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:32,549
No, I talked him into it.

100
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,211
What happened to the auto show?

101
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:37,552
Oh, we're still going. Still going.
Elaine, do the spokesmodel.

102
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,887
The turbo quadramatic transmission...

103
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:42,595
...offers you the power and prestige
to propel you...

104
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,761
...well into the 21st century.

105
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:53,231
Hi.

106
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,240
- Hi.
- Cheryl, this is Elaine and Jerry.

107
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:57,736
Hi. Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,028
- Would you like to join us?
- No, no. They don't wanna join us.

109
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:02,995
- No, it's okay. Don't be silly.
- Okay.

110
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,824
Why don't we put these together.

111
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:08,831
You can't do that. They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just...

112
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,959
Jerry. Jerry, tell them that
funny story you were telling me-

113
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,127
No. No.

114
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:21,301
No, George, it's so funny. We saw
this cab driver's picture, right?

115
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:23,098
You know, we should really order.

116
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:26,470
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything...

117
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,689
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you
a legal question?

118
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:32,065
- I'm being sued.
- Oh, what happened?

119
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:37,689
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin,
and I crossed against the light...

120
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:41,363
...and I knocked over
the delivery boy.

121
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,319
- Was he Chinese?
- Yeah.

122
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,120
Is your-? Is your last name " Benes"?

123
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:53,623
- How did you know?
- Oh, God! Ping is my cousin.

124
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,292
No.

125
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:58,004
- That's so funny.
- I'm handling his case.

126
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:01,339
- What? You're Cheryl Fong?
- That's right.

127
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:02,842
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

128
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:06,016
I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.

129
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,763
I know.

130
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,396
Wow. Well, I-

131
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,979
I guess you don't have any advice
for me on how to win the case.

132
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,648
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.

133
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,445
Tell Ping I said hello.

134
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:27,030
Tell him you think you may have
broken the case wide open.

135
00:07:31,877 --> 00:07:33,669
I can't believe it.

136
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,830
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

137
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,462
- What?
- This is not good. This is not good.

138
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,923
- What?
- I don't think it's such a great idea...

139
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,886
- ...for you to sit here.
- Why not?

140
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:45,629
He thinks if you're funny,
he might not look so funny.

141
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:49,011
- Biff.
- What?

142
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:52,306
- You're not worried about that?
- No, of course not.

143
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,688
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?

144
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,860
He thinks that if a woman
sees a guy put on a better show...

145
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,528
...she'll walk out on his show,
go see the other show.

146
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,361
Well, should we leave?

147
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,990
Well, maybe you don't have
to be so funny.

148
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:09,661
Would it kill you not to be so funny
all the time? That's all I'm asking.

149
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,243
This woman thinks I'm funny.

150
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,575
Now you're gonna be funny,
what am I gonna be?

151
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:17,881
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses
who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

152
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:23,047
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?

153
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,890
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.

154
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:27,219
- You don't?
- No way.

155
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,051
It's completely under my control.

156
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,894
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.

157
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:34,890
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?

158
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,352
A little.

159
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?

160
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,232
Yeah.

161
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,734
George, is this funny?

162
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,741
It's funny.

163
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,902
It wouldn't kill you to not
be so funny either.

164
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,574
What? What did I do?

165
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,123
- Hi.
- Hi.

166
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,085
Hello.

167
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,916
Welcome back.

168
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:05,550
I'm sorry. It was my aunt's birthday.
She makes such a big deal about it.

169
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:08,094
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?

170
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:12,180
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic
of how another year has gone by...

171
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,181
...and how little we've grown.

172
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:18,977
No matter how desperate we are
that a better self will emerge...

173
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:23,066
...each flicker of the candles
on the cake, we know it's not to be.

174
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:27,613
But for the rest of our sad,
wretched, pathetic lives...

175
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:31,117
...this is who we are to the bitter end...

176
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,040
...inevitably, irrevocably.

177
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:38,536
Happy birthday? No such thing.

178
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,457
Funny guy, huh?

179
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,631
Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.

180
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,298
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.

181
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,810
Oh, listen. So guess what.

182
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:58,930
Cheryl convinced Ping
to drop the case against me.

183
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,686
Drop the case?

184
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,148
Congratulations.
That will save you some money.

185
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,156
Yeah. No kidding. That lawyer
was gonna charge me a fortune.

186
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:10,654
Oh, great. Birth announcement
from Arnie and Joy Harris.

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,832
Hear that? Guess who's back.

188
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,417
Thought you weren't
coming back till Monday.

189
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:28,011
Well, the camp ended
a few days early.

190
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,134
Why?

191
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:32,849
Well, there was an incident.

192
00:10:34,018 --> 00:10:35,346
What happened?

193
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,686
I punched Mickey Mantle
in the mouth.

194
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:40,857
- What?
- Yeah, I punched him...

195
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,685
...they took him to the hospital...

196
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,149
...and then they cancelled
the rest of the week.

197
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:46,863
You punched who in the mouth?

198
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,573
Mickey Mantle.

199
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:52,695
- What happened?
- You know, we were playing a game...

200
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,705
...and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.

201
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,032
And Joe Pepitone, he was up...

202
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,782
...and, man, that guy,
he was crowding the plate.

203
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,290
Wow, Joe Pepitone.

204
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:05,250
Well, Joe Pepitone or not,
I own the inside of that plate.

205
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:08,425
So, you know,
I throw one inside, you know.

206
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:11,429
A little chin music
right on his pants...

207
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:14,598
...because I gotta intimidate,
you know, when I'm on the mound.

208
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,721
Well, the next pitch,
he's right back in the same place.

209
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:20,647
So I had to plunk him.

210
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:23,268
- You plunked him?
- Oh, yeah.

211
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:26,977
Well, he throws down his bat,
he comes racing up to the mound.

212
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,396
Next thing,
both benches are cleared, you know.

213
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,360
A brouhaha breaks out between
the guys in the camp...

214
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:33,863
...and the Yankee players.

215
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,954
I'm trying to get Moose Skowron
off of one of my teammates...

216
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:38,830
...somebody pulls me from behind...

217
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,751
...and I turned around
and I popped him.

218
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,920
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.

219
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,086
I punched his lights out.

220
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,003
Wow, this is incredible.

221
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,422
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.

222
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:55,969
- What's going on out there?
- What are you doing?

223
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:00,056
This is not right, people. You're
making a very bad mistake. Very bad.

224
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:02,435
Babu. I'll be right back.

225
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,646
- Yeah, so...
- Hank Bauer, he's screaming:

226
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:08,150
"Mickey! What have you done
with Mickey! You killed Mickey!"

227
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:12,775
- So, what did you do?
- Well, I got the hell out of there.

228
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,326
They took Babu away.

229
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,161
They took Babu away?

230
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,999
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.

231
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:22,538
Poor Babu. Everything was going
so well for him.

232
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,418
He had an apartment, he had a job.

233
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:27,078
- What a shame.
- Jerry!

234
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,340
Help me!

235
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:36,049
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu! Don't worry!

236
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,971
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's chasing me around.

237
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:42,144
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.

238
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,433
What?

239
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:47,687
- Well, this is interesting.
- What is it?

240
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,149
It's a letter
from the Immigration Bureau.

241
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:54,270
It's Babu's
visa-renewal application form.

242
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,818
They must have put it
in my mailbox by mistake.

243
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:00,653
Well, doesn't he need that?

244
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:13,174
If you'd given me my mail last week,
this never would have happened.

245
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,632
You should have come
to my house to pick it up.

246
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:18,130
- Am I being funny now?
- No, actually, you're not.

247
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:20,880
See, I told you I wasn't funny
all the time.

248
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,516
Hey, George, look,
I'm not funny now.

249
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:27,436
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed...

250
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,814
...she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.

251
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:33,520
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.
Babu needs a lawyer. His visa expired.

252
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:35,026
Why her?
There's a million lawyers.

253
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:38,235
Yeah, but you said this is one
of the things that her firm does.

254
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,364
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.

255
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:44,539
- Will you stop it already.
- Jerry, please.

256
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,119
How long is this gonna go on?

257
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:48,331
Till I'm comfortable.

258
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,496
Well, when is that gonna be?

259
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,546
After consummation.

260
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:57,594
Consummation? I don't think
you have enough material.

261
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,677
I have a friend in the immigration
department who owes me a big favour.

262
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:07,397
You're very lucky.

263
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:14,732
That's wonderful news. Thank you.

264
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,363
You're a very serious person,
aren't you?

265
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:24,288
Well, with so many people
in the world deprived and unhappy...

266
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:28,240
...it doesn't seem like it would
be fair to be cheerful.

267
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,675
I understand.

268
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,714
I think that's curdled.

269
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,797
I don't care.

270
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,009
Do you ever laugh?

271
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:50,440
Not really.
Sometimes when I'm in the tub.

272
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,601
That's so sad.

273
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:57,483
- What do you do?
- I'm a comedian.

274
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,360
Oh, let me get that.

275
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,660
You've been so helpful.

276
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:09,615
Hey, we're gonna go
see Babu now, right?

277
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,750
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.

278
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,996
I'm just gonna say hi to Cheryl.

279
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:15,583
- Hi.
- Hi.

280
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:18,213
Listen, gosh,
I wanted to thank you so much...

281
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,544
...for convincing Ping
to drop the case.

282
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:24,137
After we met, you were all so nice,
I just couldn't go through with it.

283
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:27,095
Between you and me, you would
have paid through the nose.

284
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,483
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

285
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,325
- Babu.
- Jerry! Jerry. Hello, Jerry.

286
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:47,496
- You remember Elaine.
- Yes, yes, of course.

287
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:50,656
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice of you both to come.

288
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:54,583
- Oh, Babu.
- No, you're both very kind. Very kind.

289
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,376
- Oh, well, you know, we try.
- We do what we can.

290
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,756
- We do what we can.
- See...

291
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,762
...the problem is, I never got
my renewal form in the mail.

292
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,508
- I was expecting it.
- Yes. See, here's the thing, Babu.

293
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,060
What happened was...

294
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:11,897
...I was away for a couple of weeks
doing comedy shows.

295
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:14,140
The comedy shows,
you're very funny man.

296
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:18,524
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up
my mail while I was away...

297
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:20,818
...because that little box
can get very full.

298
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,738
<i>Yes. TV Guide, magazines, everything.
I would have picked up your mail.</i>

299
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,827
- Your box is right next to mine.
- I don't want to bother you.

300
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:31,496
No bother. You get me job. You get
me apartment, you very good man.

301
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,240
Well, yesterday,
after they took you away...

302
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:36,957
...I looked in my mail,
and I noticed the mailman...

303
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:40,546
...accidentally put your
visa-renewal in my mailbox.

304
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,793
- Come again?
- I've been home for a week...

305
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,054
...and Elaine didn't give me my mail
till yesterday...

306
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,975
...even though
I asked her repeatedly for it.

307
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:52,891
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come
to my house to pick it up.

308
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:54,688
You had my visa application?

309
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:56,399
- Not technically.
- I kill you!

310
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:58,483
- What about her?
- I kill both of you!

311
00:16:58,652 --> 00:16:59,850
- Babu.
- No Babu.

312
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:02,484
No Babu. You're bad man.
You're very bad man.

313
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,984
You're very lazy, bad man.

314
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:05,782
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.

315
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:08,407
I have a lawyer who knows
someone in immigration.

316
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,152
They'll straighten the thing out.
The wheels are in motion.

317
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,831
- Things are happening as we speak.
- The wheels are in motion?

318
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:17,416
The wheels are in motion.
Things are happening.

319
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,545
Jerry?

320
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,046
I'm very attracted to him.

321
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:26,924
You think the person
you were talking to was him?

322
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:31,593
That's not even close to him.
He's funny. Jerry's funny.

323
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,936
- He's never said anything funny.
- He can't not be funny.

324
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:40,182
No, no. He's dark and disturbed.

325
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,030
Dark and disturbed?

326
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:46,197
His whole life revolves around
Superman and cereal.

327
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,533
What kind of a friend are you?

328
00:17:48,702 --> 00:17:52,403
I convinced him to act like that so
that you would think I was funnier.

329
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,620
That's how disturbed I am.

330
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,914
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.

331
00:17:57,085 --> 00:17:59,623
I mean, you can't find sickness
like that anywhere.

332
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,955
You think sickness like that
grows on trees?

333
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,290
Nobody is sicker than me. Nobody.

334
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:06,626
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.

335
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:09,425
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing
was an act?

336
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:12,967
And I put him up to it,
because I'm sick.

337
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,385
I'm the one that needs help.

338
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:21,229
- I gotta go.
- Well, should I call you later?

339
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,901
- Please don't.
- But-But I'm disturbed.

340
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:30,446
I'm depressed.
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

341
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,534
So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?

342
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,617
I don't know. I don't understand it.

343
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:42,293
Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it. He should be back by now.

344
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,882
<i>- Yeah?
- George.</i>

345
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,090
- Come on up.
- Babu.

346
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:50,803
- Babu, what happened to you?
- Babu must be back.

347
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:53,179
- Well, where's Babu?
- He is in Pakistan!

348
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,389
- Who are you?
- I am his brother.

349
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,016
He knew a lawyer.
It was all going to be fixed.

350
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,145
The lawyer did everything they could.

351
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:03,186
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?

352
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,399
Show me Babu!

353
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,154
- Snapple?
- No.

354
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:12,861
Too fruity.

355
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:20,832
Hey, what happened? I thought Cheryl
was gonna help Babu get his visa.

356
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,871
- She didn't help him?
- No.

357
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,371
- Where is he?
- He's in Pakistan.

358
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:29,342
- Oh, boy
- What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?

359
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:33,972
Well, last night she told me
that she liked you.

360
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,299
Not you, the disturbed you.

361
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,845
So I had to tell her the truth.

362
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:41,309
You told her the truth?
You got Babu deported!

363
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,566
What do you mean I "got"? You didn't
give him his visa application.

364
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:46,110
Because she had my mail.

365
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:49,729
I wouldn't have to get your mail
if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.

366
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,658
Well, I just came back
from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.

367
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,534
How could you go in there?

368
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,408
Well, I had to. I had to apologize.

369
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:00,030
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
my idol.

370
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,248
It was eating me up inside!

371
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:05,202
- What happened?
- I got on my knees, and I went:

372
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,874
"Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.

373
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:10,049
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me. Come on, hit me.

374
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,341
I love you, Mickey. I love you."

375
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,841
So, what did he do?

376
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:16,884
Well, the four of them, they picked
me up by my pants...

377
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,894
...and they threw me outside,
right into a horse.

378
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:23,976
- Kramer.
- Hey!

379
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:26,391
Yeah. It's my Chinese food.

380
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,608
Oh, Ping. Hi.

381
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:32,148
Listen, thank you so much
for dropping that lawsuit against me.

382
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,363
- Not anymore.
- What?

383
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,405
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.

384
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,907
Why?

385
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,406
She call you
and your friends big liars.

386
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,457
You think she nice girl?

387
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:46,960
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!

388
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,538
They call her "The Terminator."

389
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:54,259
She never lose a case,
and now you make her mad.

390
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,636
She doubled the damages.

391
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,140
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

392
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:09,399
So his friend had the mail,
but she did not give it to him.

393
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,064
Then he came to visit me...

394
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:15,022
...said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.

395
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,534
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.

396
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:20,910
And so they sent me back here.

397
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,496
This is a terrible story, Babu.

398
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,626
What are you going to do?

399
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:28,581
I'm going to save up every rupee...

400
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,249
...for someday...

401
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:33,839
...I will get back to America,
and when I do...

402
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,762
...I will exact vengeance
on this man.

403
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:38,673
I cannot forget him.

404
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:40,722
He haunts me.

405
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:47,519
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.

406
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,394
I am for open immigration...

407
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:51,940
...but that sign we have
on the Statue of Liberty:

408
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,315
"Give us your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses."

409
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,990
Can't we just say, " Hey, the door's
open, we'll take whoever you got."

410
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:02,861
Do we have to specify
the "wretched refuse"?

411
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,368
Why don't we just say:

412
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,032
"Give us the unhappy, the sad,
the slow, the ugly...

413
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:09,921
...people that can't drive,
that have trouble merging...

414
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:13,587
...if they can't stay in their lane,
don't signal, can't parallel park...

415
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:16,795
...if they're sneezing, if they're
stuffed up, if they're clogged...

416
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,553
...if they have bad penmanship, don't
return calls, if they have dandruff...

417
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:25,220
...food between their teeth, if they have
bad credit, if they have no credit....

418
00:22:25,395 --> 00:22:27,553
...missed a spot shaving."
In other words...

419
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:31,396
...any dysfunctional, defective slob...

420
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:34,059
...that you can somehow cattle prod
onto a wagon...

421
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,811
...send them over, we want them.
