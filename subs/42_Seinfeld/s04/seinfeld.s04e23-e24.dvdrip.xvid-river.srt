1
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:05,797
To me, the whole concept
of fear of success...

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:09,722
...is proof that we are definitely
scraping the bottom of the fear barrel.

3
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:12,599
Will we have to have AA-type
meetings for these people?

4
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:16,936
"Hi, my name is Bill, and the one thing
I'm worried about is having a stereo...

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,186
...and a cream-colored couch."

6
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:24,823
According to most studies, people's
number-one fear is public speaking.

7
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,318
Number two is death.

8
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:32,038
Death is number two.

9
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:37,837
Now, this means to the average
person, if you have to go to a funeral...

10
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,757
...you're better off in the casket
than doing the eulogy.

11
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:47,389
Why can't I play Kramer?

12
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:50,226
Look, we've been through this
already. You're not an actor.

13
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:51,887
- Well, neither are you.
- I know.

14
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,888
Why do we need two people
that can't act?

15
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:55,973
Oh, come on, Jerry.
How hard is it to act?

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,272
You say something.
I'll pretend it's funny.

17
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,858
- What?
- My grandmother's in the hospital.

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,315
Your grandmother's in the hospital.

19
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:10,786
- This is real believable.
- You didn't think I was laughing?

20
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:13,197
- It stinks.
- All right, let me see you do it.

21
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,581
- Say something funny.
- All right.

22
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:19,584
I've never been to Mars,
but I imagine it's quite lovely.

23
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,084
Mine was better than that.
Come on, look:

24
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:33,262
- Why are you pretending to laugh?
- We're acting.

25
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:36,009
Oh, yeah, real good.

26
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,308
- Any word from NBC?
- No.

27
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,437
I don't understand. They're
supposed to be casting this week.

28
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,939
Maybe they're not doing it.

29
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:44,690
Well, at least let me audition.

30
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,738
He wants to play Kramer in the pilot.

31
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:49,778
Out of the question.
How could we not hear anything?

32
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:52,574
What's with this Russell?
What's he doing?

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,624
Hi, Russell.

34
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:01,127
- Sit. Sit down. It's okay.
- I really appreciate you coming.

35
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,547
Oh, that's okay. I-I don't have much
time, though, so-

36
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,710
All right, well, first of all...

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,378
...I want to apologize for
all the phone calls.

38
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,382
It's just- It's just...

39
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:16,391
I don't understand.
We went out once, and-

40
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,888
Yeah, that was two months ago.

41
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:22,932
Yes, I know, and I-I-I just-
I can't get you out of my mind.

42
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,611
Ever since that-

43
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:27,104
The day in that restaurant
when we met...

44
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:31,858
- Do you have a ketchup secret?
- No, but-

45
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:37,370
Russell, you are the president of NBC.

46
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,080
You can have any woman you want.

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,747
But I want you.

48
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,923
God, I hate these mixtures.

49
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,217
I don't know why- Why don't they
just put pretzels out on the table?

50
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,089
Or peanuts would be good, but...

51
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:53,098
...I don't know who eats
these cheesy things.

52
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,391
Is it something I said?

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,758
Or did?

54
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:00,098
Look, Russell...

55
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,276
...you're a very sweet guy, but...

56
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,400
...I gotta be honest with you.

57
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't like television.

58
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,277
And that's your world.
That's your life.

59
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,789
Maybe if you were in Greenpeace or
something, that would be different...

60
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,495
...but network television, I mean...

61
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,705
...come on, Russell.
You're part of the problem.

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,631
Elaine, we're doing some very
interesting things right now.

63
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,006
We've got very exciting pilots
for next season.

64
00:03:29,177 --> 00:03:32,213
We have one with a bright young
comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

65
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:35,722
Oh, yeah, you know, I've heard of him.
He's that:

66
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:38,762
"Did you ever notice this?
Did you ever notice that?" guy.

67
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:42,187
In fact, he was in the restaurant
the day that we met.

68
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,642
Well, anyway, it's a
groundbreaking show.

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,319
Really? What is it about?

70
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:50,523
Well, really- It's-It's really-
It's very unusual.

71
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,741
It's about nothing.

72
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,701
What do you mean, it's about nothing?

73
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,320
For example, what did you do today?

74
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,953
I got up. I went to work.

75
00:04:03,127 --> 00:04:04,752
Then I came here.

76
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,997
There's a show. That's a show.

77
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:09,415
Russell, see, I'm really not
interested in this...

78
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,668
...and I do have to...

79
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:15,094
- ...go to work, so-
- Elaine, when-? When are we-?

80
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:19,345
- When are we gonna see each other?
- I'm sorry, Russell. I'm sorry, okay?

81
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,179
Bye-bye.

82
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:26,475
- So I'll see you later, huh?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,356
Hello. Yeah, he's here. Hey!

84
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,687
- It's for you.
- Oh, yeah?

85
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,406
He's getting phone calls here now?

86
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,117
Hello.

87
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,361
Again with the sweatpants?

88
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:38,948
What? I'm comfortable.

89
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:41,791
You know the message you're
sending with these sweatpants?

90
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,449
You're telling the world, " I give up.

91
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,208
I can't compete in normal society.

92
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,416
I'm miserable, so I might
as well be comfortable."

93
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:53,209
Hold on a second, I got another call.

94
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:54,886
Hello.

95
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:56,466
Yeah, he'll call you back.

96
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,134
- Who is it?
- That's NBC.

97
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:02,800
NBC?!
Give me the phone!

98
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:05,386
- I'm having a conversation here.
- Get off the phone.

99
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,062
Okay, look, I'll call you back. Yeah.

100
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:10,650
You know I'm waiting
to hear from them.

101
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,402
- Who was it?
- Russell Dalrymple's secretary.

102
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:17,487
All right. Now you're doing
something to help me.

103
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:20,870
Hello. Yes, it's Jerry Seinfeld
returning the call.

104
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,913
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

105
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:29,162
Casting tomorrow at NBC, 4:00.
We're in business. The pilot's on!

106
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,580
You're gonna be successful.

107
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,294
What if the pilot gets picked up...

108
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,422
...and it becomes a series?

109
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,506
That would be wonderful.
You'll be rich and successful.

110
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:42,888
That's why I'm worried.

111
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,183
God will kill me before letting
me be successful.

112
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,106
- He'll never let me be happy.
- You don't believe in God.

113
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,602
I do for the bad things.

114
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,601
Do you hear what you're saying?

115
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,905
God isn't out to get you, George.

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,694
What-?

117
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:00,910
What is that on your lip?

118
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:05,954
- What?
- It's like a discoloration. It's white.

119
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,958
Yes. Yes, it's white.

120
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,253
- Why is that white?
- You'd better get that checked out.

121
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,632
- "Better get that checked out"?
- I would.

122
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,472
What kind of a therapist are you?

123
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,971
I'm telling you I'm scared
something will happen...

124
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,388
...and you look for tumours?

125
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,231
- I'm trying to help you.
- What are you, like, a sadist?

126
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:30,888
No matter how bad somebody
feels, you can make it worse.

127
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,225
- You're rooting for a tumour.
- You'd better go.

128
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:35,609
I'm going, baby. I'm going!

129
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,982
- Where?
- Right here.

130
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:41,781
Get out of here, it's nothing.

131
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:43,990
Excuse me.

132
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,657
Do you see anything on my lip?

133
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,157
Yeah. Like a discoloration.

134
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,706
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's all white.

135
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,085
It's all white, Jerry.
It's all white.

136
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:54,501
Would you stop?

137
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,298
I'd get that checked out.

138
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,258
Again with the checked out.

139
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,005
I'm not going to the doctor.

140
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:03,097
If I don't, nothing will happen.
If I go, he might find something.

141
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:06,183
- If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.
- Catch what in time?

142
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:09,641
- Whatever it is.
- You think it's something?

143
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:11,563
I hate these bums with their rags.

144
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:15,066
No, no, no, I don't want it. Get away.
Get away. Get away from my car.

145
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,145
You know, these squeegee-

146
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,610
Oh, my God,
it's Crazy Joe Davola.

147
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,690
Good luck on the pilot, Jerry.

148
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,449
Yeah, I think I see it. It's like a...

149
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,371
...white discoloration.

150
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:35,249
What do you think it is?

151
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,626
It's like a white discoloration.

152
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,258
Okay, guys, are we ready to start?

153
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:43,552
Where's Russell? I thought
he was gonna be here.

154
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:49,227
I don't know. I saw him this morning,
and I said hello. He walked past me.

155
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,471
He must be worried about
the fall schedule.

156
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,474
- It's a real bear.
- Yeah.

157
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,105
So, what's going on?
We're gonna shoot the pilot...

158
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:58,151
...then it's gonna be on TV
the next week?

159
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:59,981
Yeah, right.

160
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:01,984
This is Mark Matz.

161
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:04,115
He'll be auditioning
for the role of George.

162
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,112
- How you doing?
- Hey, Mark, how are you?

163
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,656
<i>They've gotta be kidding.</i>

164
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,658
<i>This guy's perfect.</i>

165
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,909
Okay, let's read this.

166
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,745
And I'll be reading Jerry's part.

167
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,956
Anyone call for Vandelay Industries?

168
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,588
- No, why?
- Listen to me.

169
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,547
I told the unemployment office
I was close to a job with them...

170
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:25,215
...and I gave them your number.

171
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,972
When you answer the phone, you've
got to say, "Vandelay Industries."

172
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,765
- I'm Vandelay Industries?
- Right.

173
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:33,645
- What is that?
- You're in latex.

174
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,273
What do I do with latex?

175
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,979
I don't know. You manufacture it.

176
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,310
This is Michael Barth,
another George.

177
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:43,944
- Hi, Michael.
- How you doing?

178
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,690
- Everything all right?
- I just came from the podiatrist.

179
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,111
Something's wrong with my foot.
A little gangrene.

180
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,913
They'll probably have to amputate.

181
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:53,951
Any questions?

182
00:08:54,126 --> 00:08:56,452
What are we looking at?
Is this guy a real loser?

183
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,538
No, not a loser.

184
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,665
Let's start with the second scene.
You have it?

185
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,956
- Yeah.
- Okay.

186
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:05,131
A man gave me a massage.

187
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,219
So?

188
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,058
Well, he-

189
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,721
He had his hands, you know...

190
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,220
- ...and he was-
- He was what?

191
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:18,849
Well, he was, you know-
He was touching and rubbing.

192
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,979
That's a massage.

193
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:23,439
I think it moved.

194
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:25,948
This is Melissa Shannon.

195
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:28,489
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

196
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:31,116
Melissa is reading for Elaine.

197
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,285
It's like a bald convention out there.

198
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,702
<i>Sorry, I made a faux pas.</i>

199
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,702
No, you didn't,
he knows he's bald.

200
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,545
So how about that guy
wearing sweatpants?

201
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,339
Is that for the part, or does he
walk around like that?

202
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:49,347
Okay. Shall we start?

203
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:51,433
You know what?

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,059
I'll read with her.

205
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,769
Oh, great.

206
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,393
- All right, wanna start?
- Yeah.

207
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:01,848
Okay.

208
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:07,360
- What was that look?
- What look?

209
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,992
That look you just gave me.

210
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,654
- I gave a look?
- Yes.

211
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:13,117
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:15,200
Let's see some more Kramers.

213
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,634
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

214
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,885
- How you doing?
- Good.

215
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,062
- What is this about?
- Levels.

216
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,774
- Levels?
- Yeah. Getting rid of all my furniture.

217
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:46,395
All of it. I'm building levels...

218
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:51,115
...with steps, completely carpeted...

219
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,828
...with pillows.

220
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,076
Like ancient Egypt.

221
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:01,202
How are you gonna be
comfortable like that?

222
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:03,999
I'll be comfortable.

223
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,546
- Very good.
- Very nice.

224
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:11,336
Tom, that was terrific.
Thank you for coming in.

225
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,509
- Wonderful reading.
- That's really something.

226
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,351
- Bye.
- Okay. Thank you. Take it easy.

227
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,430
I thought he was really good,
very funny.

228
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,266
Yeah, I liked him.

229
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,942
What happened to the raisins?

230
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,019
Yeah, there was a box
of raisins there.

231
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,190
Did he just steal the raisins?

232
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,276
You think he stole them?

233
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:36,622
This is Martin Van Nostrand.

234
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:39,625
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other?

235
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,831
Wait a minute. I know you.

236
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,410
You're the guy from the Calvin Klein
underwear ads.

237
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,459
That's true.

238
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,265
I saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts again.

239
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:00,180
But this time...

240
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,188
...I went in.

241
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:09,861
Where's the bathroom?

242
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:13,406
I think if you go down the hall,
it's on the right at the very end.

243
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:16,320
Be right back.

244
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,207
Sorry, buddy. Full house.

245
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,473
Sorry. Customers only.

246
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,226
Hey, you need a ticket.

247
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,277
- So who's playing Elaine?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

248
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:56,862
Very talented young actress.

249
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,281
- Really?
- Yes.

250
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:00,281
- Who is it?
- She's an Eskimo, actually.

251
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:02,781
- Oh, God.
- She came down from Juneau by sled.

252
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,458
She was in the Iditarod. Got to the
finish line, just kept going.

253
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:08,917
She's got the dogs with her
in the hotel room.

254
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,709
Listen, was Russell at the casting?

255
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,792
No, he didn't show up.

256
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:14,380
You know...

257
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,629
...I'm a little bit worried about him.

258
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,881
I don't understand.
We had one date...

259
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:21,015
...two months ago.

260
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:22,976
Am I that charming and beautiful?

261
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,138
No. No, you're not.

262
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,852
- Why do I keep setting you up?
- I don't know.

263
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,484
Could we get a little more?

264
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,896
Heat more.

265
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,113
Ever since this new owner took over,
the service here is really slow.

266
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,572
Yeah. Have you noticed anything
else that's...

267
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,369
...different since the new
management?

268
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:49,244
They're putting a little lemon
in the tuna. I love that.

269
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:52,043
Besides that.
Look at the waitresses.

270
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:53,956
Yeah?

271
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:58,428
What physical...

272
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:02,180
...characteristic would
you say is common to all of them?

273
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,891
I mean, look at this.

274
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:10,931
Every waitress working here has the
same proportions, wouldn't you say?

275
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,648
Yes. I would say.

276
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,064
What's going on here?
How is this possible?

277
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,065
- Do you think it's a coincidence?
- No.

278
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:23,075
I-I haven't seen four women like this
together outside of a Russ Meyer film.

279
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:29,247
Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the
hiring of waitresses here?

280
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,421
He does. We're looking for
another girl if you know anyone.

281
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,125
You know what?
That's discriminatory.

282
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,636
That is unfair. Why should these
women have all the advantages?

283
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:44,222
They get all the attention from men.
They get all the waitress jobs too?

284
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:47,228
Hey, that's life. Good-looking men
have the same advantage.

285
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,305
You don't see
any handsome homeless.

286
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:55,603
You see, it's right here.
It's-It's a little white.

287
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:58,697
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

288
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,656
I've never seen this before.

289
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:04,237
"Never seen this before"?

290
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,326
I'm gonna have to take
a biopsy on this.

291
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:10,500
- A what?
- A biopsy.

292
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,243
- A biopsy?
- Yeah.

293
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:16,580
Cancer? Is it cancer?
Do I have cancer?

294
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,129
Well, I don't know what it is.

295
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,594
He took a biopsy, Jerry.
A biopsy.

296
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:30,977
- What'd he say?
- He didn't know what it was.

297
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,227
All right, so?

298
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,234
When I asked him about cancer,
he didn't say, "Get out of here."

299
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,154
That's what I wanted to hear,
"Cancer? Get out of here."

300
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:41,657
Maybe he doesn't have a
"get out of here" kind of personality.

301
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:44,233
How could a doctor
not say, "Get out of here"?

302
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,578
It should be part of medical school
training. " Cancer? Get out of here.

303
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,075
Go home. What are you, crazy?

304
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,370
It's a little test. It's nothing.
You're a real nut, you know that?"

305
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:56,955
Told you God would never
let me be successful.

306
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,792
I never should've written that pilot.

307
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:01,589
The show will be a hit, make
millions, and I'll be dead.

308
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,300
Dead, Jerry. Because of this.

309
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:06,512
Can't you at least die
with a little dignity?

310
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,391
No, I can't.

311
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,230
I can't die with dignity.
I have no dignity.

312
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,222
I want to be the person who
doesn't die with dignity.

313
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,151
I lived my whole life in shame.
Why die with dignity?

314
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,072
Hey.

315
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,366
What happened to you yesterday?

316
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,736
I got mugged.

317
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:28,651
- You got mugged?
- Mugged?

318
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:33,576
I wouldn't have minded, but I was
running home to go to the bathroom.

319
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:38,589
- Why didn't you use it in the building?
- It was full.

320
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,801
I tried a few other places, you know,
but that didn't work.

321
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,092
I mean, it was an emergency, Jerry.

322
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,098
I was really percolating.

323
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:53,676
So I decided to run home through the
park, and then two guys stopped me.

324
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:55,429
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me.</i>

325
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:56,983
Come on up.

326
00:16:58,443 --> 00:16:59,854
Now I got a big problem, buddy.

327
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,607
- What is it?
- Well...

328
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:05,696
I waited so long, I-
I missed my chance.

329
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:09,780
- You didn't go?
- No, and now I can't get it back.

330
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:20,622
The best thing to do
is just not think about it.

331
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,792
How could you not think about it?

332
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:26,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,971
- What's the matter with him?
- He's a little backed-up.

334
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:37,308
Elaine.

335
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,611
So I spoke to some of my sisters
about that coffee shop.

336
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:43,771
Oh, the sisters.

337
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:45,821
Have you seen the
waitresses in there?

338
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,529
I never had so much coffee in my life.

339
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,117
So we decided I should go over
there and apply for a job myself.

340
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,450
Apply for a job? What for?

341
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,120
Because it's discriminatory.

342
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:58,836
It's a coincidence.

343
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:00,831
- This is what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

344
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:02,749
You're not gonna get the job.

345
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,669
Exactly.

346
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,640
Hello.

347
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,350
Oh, hi.

348
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,851
Yeah, I guess we could do that.
At what time?

349
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,346
All right. I'll see you there.

350
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,852
Okay, bye.

351
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,108
- Who's that?
- TV Elaine.

352
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:24,270
She wants to talk about the part.

353
00:18:25,322 --> 00:18:28,358
- What about the dogs?
- They're having sex in the hotel room.

354
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:34,572
So the Elaine character is based
on someone you know.

355
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,038
- Yes.
- And she's really your ex-girlfriend.

356
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:40,210
- Yeah.
- I want to know her from the inside.

357
00:18:40,545 --> 00:18:42,170
What is she like?
Tell me about her.

358
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,423
Well, she's fascinated with Greenland.
She enjoys teasing animals...

359
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,712
...Banlon and seeing people
running for their lives.

360
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:53,051
She loves throwing garbage out the
window, yet she's extremely dainty.

361
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:54,636
How would she eat a hamburger?

362
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,767
- With her hands.
- What about pasta?

363
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:58,265
Also with her hands.

364
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,683
Seriously.

365
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:04,145
I want to experience
everything she's experienced.

366
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,897
Everything?

367
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,484
- Everything.
- All right, she cuts pasta with a knife.

368
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,318
Good. What's her favourite movie?

369
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:12,821
<i>Shaft.</i>

370
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:15,746
You gotta give me her picture.
What about sex?

371
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,491
She likes talking during sex.

372
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:20,078
Dirty talking?

373
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:24,380
No. Just chitchat, movies,
current events. Regular stuff.

374
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,375
- You know, Sandi-
- Elaine.

375
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:29,673
- What?
- Call me...

376
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:31,757
...Elaine.

377
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,097
All right...

378
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,853
- ...Elaine.
- How does Elaine kiss?

379
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,346
- Well-
- Does she kiss...

380
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,101
...like this?

381
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,234
Actually, she has a thing where she
spirals her tongue around. It's like a-

382
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:51,652
Like this?

383
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,870
I think you got it.

384
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,450
Now, I like to eat spaghetti...

385
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,037
...with just a fork.

386
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,919
Because I can keep
the strands long...

387
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:08,588
...and I can slurp it up to my mouth
like this. Look.

388
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,795
Now, sex, I like the bottom.

389
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,215
Let them do all the work, you know?

390
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:19,551
You should be writing
this stuff down.

391
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:21,804
Yeah. Bran flakes.

392
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,266
One hundred percent.
I got a big problem.

393
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:28,063
- And I'll have the hamburger. That's it.
- Yeah.

394
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,481
- Thanks a lot.
- That's good.

395
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,731
Now, I like to play golf.

396
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:33,864
Look, this stuff doesn't matter to me.

397
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,904
See, I'm gonna do the character
like me, not like you.

398
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,621
You gotta play him like me.

399
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,247
I'm Kramer.

400
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:43,750
- I'm Kramer.
- I'm Kramer.

401
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,828
What can I do for you?
Would you like table?

402
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:48,673
No, I'd like to apply
for a waitress job.

403
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,964
Have you ever waited
on tables before?

404
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:56,137
Oh, yeah. I've been a professional
waitress for the last 10 years.

405
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:57,765
I've worked all over this city.

406
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,806
These are my references.

407
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:02,930
I'm sure you'll find
that I'm more than qualified.

408
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,604
I don't think I need
anyone else right now.

409
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:15,533
You're in big trouble, mister!
And I mean trouble with a capital T!

410
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:18,819
What? What did I do?

411
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,325
Anyway, there's at least...

412
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,410
...four of them,
and they're all huge.

413
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,293
I mean, one is bigger than the next.

414
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,621
It's like a Russ Meyer movie.

415
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:31,541
Who's Russ Meyer?

416
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,668
He's this guy who made these...

417
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:37,715
...terrible movies in the '70s
with these kinds of women.

418
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,087
He's obsessed.

419
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,223
He's obsessed with breasts.

420
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,054
That's hard to say.

421
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:46,224
Anyway, go on.

422
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:50,898
There's not really much more to tell.
He was looking for waitresses...

423
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:55,446
...I went in to apply, and he looked me
up and down, and he rejected me.

424
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,865
Paul, come here for a second.
I want you to listen to this.

425
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,827
- Hi.
- Hi.

426
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:04,367
The woman here claims there's
a restaurant on the West Side...

427
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,246
...that's only hiring
large-breasted women.

428
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:09,670
Really?

429
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,923
- What do you mean, made-up?
- It's made-up.

430
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,465
Häagen-Dazs is made-up.
It's not Danish.

431
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:19,547
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

432
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:21,175
George, is Häagen-Dazs Danish?

433
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:23,508
- What do you mean, Danish?
- This guy stinks.

434
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:25,761
Danish. Is it from Denmark?

435
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:28,689
They make it in New Jersey.
It's just a Danish-sounding name.

436
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,765
I can't believe that.
They fooled me, Jerry.

437
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:34,733
Boy, talk about a show
about nothing.

438
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,103
Excuse me.

439
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,647
Excuse me.

440
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,907
This-This is not right.

441
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,620
May I?

442
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,286
You see, you're going:

443
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:52,704
"They fooled me, Jerry."

444
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,957
You want to hit "fooled" more.

445
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,711
"They fooled me, Jerry."

446
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:58,795
You see the difference?

447
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:00,797
I'm not gonna say it like that.

448
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:03,800
Just a suggestion.

449
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:08,259
All right, everybody.

450
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:11,011
- Take a five.
- Yep, that's five.

451
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:12,811
George?

452
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,733
I don't have much
experience with acting...

453
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:23,067
...but from what I can gather...

454
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:26,578
...they're a little touchy about
being told how to say the lines.

455
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:28,078
Why is that?

456
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,330
I don't know,
but they don't seem to like it.

457
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:33,493
By the way, how am I doing?

458
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:36,163
Oh, you're- You're fine. You're fine.

459
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,175
So you think this guy playing Kramer
took the raisins?

460
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,597
Why would he steal a box of raisins?

461
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:47,345
Yeah.

462
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,645
It's bizarre.

463
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,813
That little bald guy's driving me nuts.

464
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,683
I'm gonna rip him a new one
if he doesn't leave me alone.

465
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,188
I wish that was our real problem.

466
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,359
What is the real problem?

467
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:02,813
It's Seinfeld.

468
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:05,697
He can't act. It's pathetic.

469
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,575
I told you these stand-ups can't act.

470
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,492
I'm cringing watching him.

471
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:16,870
What's with him?

472
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,663
Russell?

473
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:22,301
Russell?

474
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:24,430
- What?
- You okay?

475
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:28,049
Yeah. No, I-I was just...

476
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,219
...thinking of something.

477
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,104
I'll be back in a second.

478
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:40,194
What's the matter?

479
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:41,568
Nothing.

480
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,566
You're acting weird.
Is anything wrong?

481
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:44,987
No.

482
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,324
Are you breaking up with me?

483
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,454
Are we going out?

484
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,032
You're breaking up
with me, aren't you?

485
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,574
Do you want me to?

486
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,502
If that's what you want.

487
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:59,672
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Fine, break up with me.

488
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:02,130
All right, we're broken up.

489
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:07,839
Can we still be friends?

490
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,341
- Remember when you auditioned?
- Yeah.

491
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:15,598
There was a box of raisins
on the coffee table.

492
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:19,771
Did you, by any chance,
take them with you when you left?

493
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:22,941
What are you talking about?

494
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:25,025
Well, we were all eating the raisins.

495
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,070
And I remember you- You were
eating some of the raisins.

496
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,703
And then you left...

497
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,579
...and the raisins were gone.

498
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:34,120
I was just wondering if, you know...

499
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,285
...maybe you took them with you.

500
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:39,545
Are you accusing me
of stealing the raisins?

501
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,372
- Oh, no, no-
- Why would I steal a box of raisins?

502
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,255
No, you wouldn't.
Nobody would, you know.

503
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,635
It's just that...

504
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,386
...they were missing, and...

505
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:53,308
...well, I'm just inquiring.

506
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:55,767
Let me give you a
word of advice, okay?

507
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,145
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna talk to you.

508
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:01,767
And I don't wanna hear any more of
your stupid notes and suggestions.

509
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,487
I don't like you.

510
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:07,987
So if you got any other problems,
whether it's raisins, prunes...

511
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,445
...figs or any other dried fruit...

512
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:14,492
...just keep it to yourself and stay out
of my way, okay?

513
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:19,169
All right.

514
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,828
I don't think we're gonna have any
problem with that.

515
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,213
Good talking to you, Tom. Really.

516
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:28,004
Elaine? Elaine?

517
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:30,717
What do you want?
What can I do?

518
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:32,927
Is-? Is it...?

519
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:35,929
Is it my job? Is that what it is?

520
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:38,845
Elaine, I can't go on like this.

521
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:41,849
Look, will-? Will-? Will you call me?

522
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,651
Would you call me?

523
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,355
Well, why? I-
All right, you want-? May I call you?

524
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,525
Elaine? Elaine?

525
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:52,734
Excuse me, Mr. Dalrymple...

526
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,035
- ...I am so sorry.
- All right, what's your name?

527
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,870
- David Richardson.
- Get out, you're fired.

528
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,248
- But, Mr. Dalrymple-
- Don't talk back to me!

529
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,710
I said, get out.
You want me to call the cops?

530
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,586
I make and break little worms
like you every day.

531
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,918
Do you know how much
money I make? Any idea?

532
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,340
Do you know where I live?

533
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,218
I could have any woman in this city
that I want. Anyone.

534
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:15,135
Now, get out!

535
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,136
What are you all looking at?!

536
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:22,981
Go back to work.

537
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,391
Back!

538
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:27,189
Back!

539
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:40,197
Doctor called and said I'm not gonna
get the results for another two days.

540
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,203
Oh, you're fine.
There's nothing wrong.

541
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:43,754
I'm the one who's dying.

542
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,582
- What do you mean?
- I can't act.

543
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:47,666
I stink. I don't know what I'm doing.

544
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm gonna make a fool out of myself.

545
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:54,302
Come on, you're...

546
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:56,016
You're fine.

547
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,429
This show's gonna ruin my career.

548
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,679
- How did I get involved?
- What about me?

549
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,097
I was a total failure.
Everything was fine.

550
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:06,892
Now this thing's gonna be a success,
and God gives me a terminal disease.

551
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:09,234
This actress playing Elaine,
she's crazy.

552
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,398
The guy playing Kramer
threatened me.

553
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:14,492
- Why?
- I asked him about the raisins.

554
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:17,788
You mentioned the raisins.

555
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,785
- Oh, yeah.
- Did he take them?

556
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,544
I don't know.

557
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,080
Well, if he didn't take them...

558
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,880
...what happened to them?

559
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,124
That's what I'm trying to find out.

560
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,926
- Hey.
- Hey.

561
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:40,926
- Any luck?
- No. No, nothing.

562
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:44,396
I got no peristalsis.

563
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:46,772
- Well, what about bran?
- I tried bran.

564
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:49,268
Forty percent, 50 percent,
100 percent.

565
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:51,734
The bran isn't working for me.

566
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,531
- Well, what about Meta-?
- Did it.

567
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,028
- How about Ex-?
- Yeah, had it.

568
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,277
- Milk of Magne-?
- Yeah, yeah.

569
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:00,620
Well, my friend...

570
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:05,419
...it may be time to consider
the dreaded apparatus.

571
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,297
Hold it right there.

572
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:12,632
If you're suggesting what I think,
you're wasting your time.

573
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:16,005
I am not, Jerry, under any
circumstances, doing any...

574
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,671
...inserting in that area.

575
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,386
Oh, it's not that bad.

576
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:22,843
Yes, it is.

577
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,474
Well...

578
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:28,473
...it's all taken care of. I filed a report.
An investigation is under way.

579
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,057
So you going to the taping?

580
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:33,190
No, I don't think I should go.
I don't want to bump into Russell.

581
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:34,823
He called me the other day.

582
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:38,360
Come on, you gotta go. He's harmless.
He's got a little crush on you.

583
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:42,368
Jerry, this is not a crush.
This is a complete fixation.

584
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,367
He makes me very uncomfortable.

585
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,084
We need you there.

586
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,168
- Hey, are you gonna go?
- No, no, I-I'm gonna stay home. I...

587
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,547
I wanna be close to my home base, in
case there's any news from the front.

588
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:07,991
No. Pick it up more in the front.
It's gotta be higher. Higher.

589
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,623
Make a wall. A wall.

590
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:12,835
Sandi, are you in wardrobe?

591
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,128
- Sandi?
- Try " Elaine."

592
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,755
- Elaine?
- Yes?

593
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:24,509
Elaine?

594
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,055
It's me.

595
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:29,766
Wilton Marshall. Remember?

596
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:31,932
Camp Tioga, 1978?

597
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,397
- Remember?
- Right.

598
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,319
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

599
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,572
- I can't remember my lines.
- Just relax, you'll be fine.

600
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:47,118
I can't relax. I don't-
I don't know any of them.

601
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,448
You're just like George.
He'd do the same thing.

602
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,784
- You're just like him. It's amazing.
- Help me.

603
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:53,918
George is always saying that.

604
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,330
You don't have to worry anyway.
It's not live.

605
00:31:56,507 --> 00:31:58,630
It's not on till next week.
Have a good show.

606
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,090
What's my first line?
Just tell me my first line.

607
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:04,014
- "New sneakers."
- "New sneakers. " Right, that's it.

608
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:08,012
Where's Russell?

609
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,473
You know, I don't know.
I assumed he wouldn't miss it.

610
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,055
He hasn't been well.

611
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:17,563
Can I tell you something
in confidence?

612
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,773
I think it's a woman.

613
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,572
How pathetic.

614
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:25,869
Yeah, this is George Costanza.
I'm-I'm calling for my test results.

615
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,121
Negative?

616
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,118
Oh, my God!

617
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:35,579
Why? Why? Why?

618
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:38,203
What?

619
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,547
Negative's good?

620
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:44,972
Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.

621
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:48,224
Thank you. Thank you very much.

622
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:52,645
What was I worried about?

623
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:19,214
Listen.

624
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,336
I know we've had our
problems in the past...

625
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,377
...but we got a show to do tonight.
Time to pull together as a team.

626
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:27,754
Life's too short.

627
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:31,597
I say, let's let bygones be bygones.

628
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:34,889
If you took the raisins,
if you didn't take the raisins...

629
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:37,187
They weren't even my raisins.

630
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,983
I-I was just curious because...

631
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:42,770
...seems like a strange
thing to do...

632
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:48,286
...to walk into a room, audition
and walk out with a box of raisins.

633
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:50,612
Anyway, whatever.

634
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:54,371
If you ever want to tell me about it,
the door to my office is always open.

635
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,700
In the event that I get an office.

636
00:33:56,878 --> 00:34:00,745
You'll come in. We'll talk about the
raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.

637
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,584
How would you like it if I just...

638
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,342
...pulled your heart out of your chest
now and shoved it down your throat?

639
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:12,598
<i>Good evening. Welcome to a taping
of the new show Jerry.</i>

640
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,221
Does everybody know what a pilot is?

641
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:21,024
- Yeah, he flies a plane.
- No, a pilot is the taping of a show...

642
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,685
...that's the first show
before a TV series.

643
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,484
And this show will air on Thursday.

644
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:30,407
Are you ready to meet our cast?
All right.

645
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:39,875
Good evening, folks.
How you doing?

646
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,835
You sound like a great crowd.

647
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,629
We have a show we're gonna put on
for you tonight.

648
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:49,472
It's a- It's a new TV show.
It's what they call a pilot.

649
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,588
<i>And we hope it becomes a series.
It's called Jerry. I'm playing Jerry-</i>

650
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:56,010
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

651
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,404
What about Davola?
Did you believe that?

652
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,860
<i>What was that thing he yelled out,
sic semper tyrannis? Is that Latin?</i>

653
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,194
John Wilkes Booth yelled it
when he shot Lincoln.

654
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,863
- Really? What's it mean?
- It means "death to tyrants."

655
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,495
I could see that.

656
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:23,544
See, now, this is exciting!
This is exciting!

657
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:26,881
- Did I miss anything already?
- No, it starts in five minutes.

658
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:28,711
You were there.
What's the big deal?

659
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,093
Now it's on TV. It's different.

660
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:33,713
- I told everybody I know to watch it.
- Yeah, me too.

661
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:36,716
- Did you hear from Russell?
- No.

662
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:39,053
Strange, him not showing up
at the taping.

663
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,697
Well, well.

664
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,106
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

665
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:53,905
- You went for the big E, huh?
- Wet and wild.

666
00:35:55,204 --> 00:35:57,825
- Kramer, sit down. It's about to start.
- Oh, yes.

667
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:02,916
Hey, what is this?

668
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,080
Look, a wallet.

669
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:08,091
- A wallet? Let me see that.
- Here.

670
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:12,209
It's my father's wallet. He thought
they stole it at the doctor's office.

671
00:36:12,388 --> 00:36:15,140
- This is it.
- How do you like that?

672
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,876
You hurt me.

673
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:54,962
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

674
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,799
- New sneakers?
- Yeah.

675
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:00,644
- What do you need new sneakers for?
- I like sneakers.

676
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:04,644
How do you decide which ones to
wear? I'd go crazy if I had to decide.

677
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,475
You're crazy anyway.

678
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:09,811
<i>Why did you eat the top
off the muffins?</i>

679
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:12,312
<i>- So what?
- I can't eat it now.</i>

680
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,358
- George.
- George.

681
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,744
What kind of stupid show is this?

682
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:22,324
Hey, that's that idiot that took
all my records.

683
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:27,121
John, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.

684
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:29,704
This show looks interesting.

685
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:32,338
Isn't he that Seinfeld fella you
went out with?

686
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,841
Oh, he's horrible. Horrible.

687
00:37:35,054 --> 00:37:36,429
Nevertheless.

688
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:38,674
That Jerry's a funny guy, huh?

689
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,593
Got to love the "Sein."

690
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:42,511
I hate the "Sein."

691
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,107
This is a piece of crap.

692
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:56,404
Oh, Donald, you used to like him.

693
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:57,856
What a sellout.

694
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,862
Give me that remote. Give me that.

695
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,037
- Give me the remote.
- Donald.

696
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:04,958
- Jerry, the commercial's almost over.
- All right.

697
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,539
You know, I really like this guy
playing the butler.

698
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,538
Yeah, he's good.
He's John Ritter's cousin.

699
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:12,373
- Really?
- Yeah.

700
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:16,794
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello.

701
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:19,213
So where do you want me
to start today?

702
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,055
- Why don't you start in the bedroom.
- I'll start in your bedroom.

703
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,687
- Hey.
- Hey. The butler's here.

704
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,682
He is? Listen.

705
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:30,897
When he's finished,
send him over to my house.

706
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:33,227
- I'm not sending him to your house.
- Why not?

707
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:36,358
The judge decreed he'd become
my butler, not my friend's butler.

708
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:39,319
Jerry, he is your butler. You can give
him any order you want.

709
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,163
- That's what butlers do.
- But I don't want to.

710
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,034
Jerry, my house is
a pigsty. Come on.

711
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:48,579
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

712
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:50,295
Come on up.

713
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:54,413
- I need more Pledge.
- More Pledge?

714
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:57,628
I just bought two cans last week,
and I don't have any wood here.

715
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,926
Well, it goes fast.

716
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,928
Hello.

717
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,390
Hello.

718
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:14,184
What's all this about?

719
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:17,113
- We had a date last week.
- You had a date?

720
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:20,650
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

721
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:24,954
- Why do I need your permission?
- Because he's my butler.

722
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,031
That's terrific.

723
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,705
How could anyone not like him?

724
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,254
I like his style.

725
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:36,293
He has a sort of casual elegance.

726
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,044
But he picks his nose.

727
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,211
Nevertheless.

728
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,961
He's a member of our
health club, isn't he?

729
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,259
Yeah.

730
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:50,393
You know, that Kim Novak
had some big breasts.

731
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:58,442
You ever notice a lot of butlers
are named Jeeves?

732
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:04,447
You know, I think when you-
When you name a baby Jeeves...

733
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:08,621
...you've pretty much mapped out
his future, wouldn't you say?

734
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:12,242
Not much chance he's gonna be
a hitman, I think, after that.

735
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:15,504
"I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I'm going to have to whack you."

736
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,337
Yeah.

737
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,920
Oh, wow, that was great.

738
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:24,674
That show was so funny.

739
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:28,015
It was really funny. I'm not just
saying that because I know you.

740
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,807
All right. Well, let's go out
and celebrate.

741
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:33,347
- That was so good.
- Come on, let's eat something.

742
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:36,359
I think this will get picked up, George.
You're gonna be rich!

743
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:38,318
- You really think so?
- Oh, yeah.

744
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:40,029
And God didn't kill me.

745
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:41,858
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.</i>

746
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:44,986
- This is Rita Kirson.
- Oh, hi, Rita.

747
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,536
<i>I'm calling to let you know...</i>

748
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:49,029
...Russell Dalrymple is
no longer with this network.

749
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:51,040
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?

750
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,450
<i>To be honest with you,
nobody really knows.</i>

751
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,335
He seems to have disappeared.

752
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,046
Russell's disappeared?

753
00:40:57,381 --> 00:41:00,501
<i>In any event, I've been made
the new president of NBC.</i>

754
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:02,218
<i>As you may or may not know...</i>

755
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:06,135
...Russell and I did not see eye to eye
on many, many projects.

756
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:10,885
And as my first order of business,
I'm passing on your show.

757
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:14,679
You're passing already?
The show just ended two minutes ago.

758
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:17,063
Well, I just got the job.

759
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,061
Goodbye, Jerry.

760
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:22,485
Yeah. See you.

761
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,079
What are you-?
What are you looking at me for?

762
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:31,868
- It was you.
- What-? What did I do?

763
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,662
Do you realize his obsession with you
cost us a TV series?!

764
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:38,162
I didn't know that he'd fall for me,
and I'd drive him insane, I mean-

765
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,580
- You know, that's not my fault.
- Yes, it is!

766
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:42,501
You're very charming!

767
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,178
I can't believe this.

768
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:46,923
What happened to him?
Where is he?

769
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,174
No one knows.

770
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:53,723
She works for Pendant Publishing.

771
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:57,265
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

772
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:58,900
You know...

773
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:03,528
...I used to work for NBC,
but when I go back to her this time...

774
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:05,904
...she'll respect me.

775
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:11,079
You'd better get down.
They might start firing soon.

776
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:25,462
Hey, look at this.

777
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:26,881
What is going on here?

778
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:28,429
Well, well.

779
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,430
Nothing has changed.

780
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,974
How did this happen?

781
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:36,597
I talked to these guys at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

782
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:39,144
Hey. What are you two guys
doing here?

783
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,478
I thought you were gonna do
something. Now you're eating here?

784
00:42:42,903 --> 00:42:46,070
No, that's- That's-That's why
we're here. We're checking things out.

785
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,197
- We're checking it out.
- Checking it out?

786
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,359
See you back at the office, guys.

787
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:54,162
Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner?

788
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:56,656
Boy, you guys ought to move in.

789
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,660
How about a piece of pie, on me, huh?

790
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:00,994
Sophia, take care of these fellows.

791
00:43:01,171 --> 00:43:03,164
Hey, come here.
I want you to know something.

792
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,796
You are not gonna get
away with this.

793
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:09,253
- Get away with what?
- "With what?" You know what.

794
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,347
With the waitresses,
how they're all alike.

795
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:16,843
Of course they're alike.

796
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,680
They are my daughters.

797
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:24,399
Your daughters.

798
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:27,777
You must be very proud, Mr. Barzakian.

799
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:31,364
And may I say, sir, they're lovely girls.
Absolutely lovely girls.

800
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:33,658
It's nice to see such fine,
upstanding women...

801
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:37,115
- ...in gainful employment, Mr. Barzakian.
- Here's table for you.

802
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,785
- Oh, a table right here.
- Peggy.

803
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,702
Peggy. All right.

804
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,870
- Peggy?
- Peggy. His daughter Peggy.

805
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:44,706
Peggy's coming over to serve.

806
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:46,376
One of the family.

807
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:49,093
- My daughter Peggy.
- Peggy.

808
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:50,506
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Peggy.

809
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,802
Thank you very much.

810
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:57,049
- So guess what I gotta do tomorrow.
- What?

811
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,469
Start looking for a job.

812
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,141
You know what you ought to do?

813
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:02,857
You should work for Greenpeace.

814
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:05,730
You know, they attack the whalers
out on the open sea.

815
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:07,231
Are you crazy?

816
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:10,571
You take your life in your hands
with those nuts.

817
00:44:11,408 --> 00:44:15,073
Keep fighting it, matey.
Get your head above the water.

818
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:17,617
I've got you, matey.

819
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,577
I got you. Matey.

820
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:23,495
I'll remember her name.

821
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,046
Elaine Benes.

822
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:26,838
I'll write to her.

823
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,921
I'll tell her all about you
and what you did out here.

824
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:33,087
Goodbye, matey.

825
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:34,592
Goodbye.

826
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:46,023
Now, I know women often complain
about the number of things...

827
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:48,351
...you have to do to get male attention.

828
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,438
The high heels, the pantyhose,
the makeup.

829
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:52,523
It's even worse if you're a man.

830
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,941
If you're a man,
you don't know what to do.

831
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:57,740
That's why we're building bridges,
climbing mountains...

832
00:44:57,913 --> 00:45:02,374
...exploring uncharted territories.
You think we wanna do these things?

833
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,210
Nobody wants to build a bridge.

834
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:07,964
It's really, really hard.

835
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,957
Designing rockets,
flying off into space.

836
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:15,421
I guarantee you, every astronaut,
when he comes back from space...

837
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:19,180
...goes up to a girl and goes,
"So did you see me up there?"
