444
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:54,957
You want to hit "fooled" more.

445
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,711
"They fooled me, Jerry."

446
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:58,795
You see the difference?

447
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:00,797
I'm not gonna say it like that.

448
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:03,800
Just a suggestion.

449
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:08,259
All right, everybody.

450
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:11,011
- Take a five.
- Yep, that's five.

451
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:12,811
George?

452
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,733
I don't have much
experience with acting...

453
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:23,067
...but from what I can gather...

454
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:26,578
...they're a little touchy about
being told how to say the lines.

455
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:28,078
Why is that?

456
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,330
I don't know,
but they don't seem to like it.

457
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:33,493
By the way, how am I doing?

458
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:36,163
Oh, you're- You're fine. You're fine.

459
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,175
So you think this guy playing Kramer
took the raisins?

460
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,597
Why would he steal a box of raisins?

461
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:47,345
Yeah.

462
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,645
It's bizarre.

463
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,813
That little bald guy's driving me nuts.

464
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,683
I'm gonna rip him a new one
if he doesn't leave me alone.

465
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,188
I wish that was our real problem.

466
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,359
What is the real problem?

467
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:02,813
It's Seinfeld.

468
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:05,697
He can't act. It's pathetic.

469
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,575
I told you these stand-ups can't act.

470
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,492
I'm cringing watching him.

471
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:16,870
What's with him?

472
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,663
Russell?

473
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:22,301
Russell?

474
00:24:23,054 --> 00:24:24,430
- What?
- You okay?

475
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:28,049
Yeah. No, I-I was just...

476
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,219
...thinking of something.

477
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,104
I'll be back in a second.

478
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:40,194
What's the matter?

479
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:41,568
Nothing.

480
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,566
You're acting weird.
Is anything wrong?

481
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:44,987
No.

482
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,324
Are you breaking up with me?

483
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,454
Are we going out?

484
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,032
You're breaking up
with me, aren't you?

485
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,574
Do you want me to?

486
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,502
If that's what you want.

487
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:59,672
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Fine, break up with me.

488
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:02,130
All right, we're broken up.

489
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:07,839
Can we still be friends?

490
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,341
- Remember when you auditioned?
- Yeah.

491
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:15,598
There was a box of raisins
on the coffee table.

492
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:19,771
Did you, by any chance,
take them with you when you left?

493
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:22,941
What are you talking about?

494
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:25,025
Well, we were all eating the raisins.

495
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,070
And I remember you- You were
eating some of the raisins.

496
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,703
And then you left...

497
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,579
...and the raisins were gone.

498
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:34,120
I was just wondering if, you know...

499
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,285
...maybe you took them with you.

500
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:39,545
Are you accusing me
of stealing the raisins?

501
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,372
- Oh, no, no-
- Why would I steal a box of raisins?

502
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,255
No, you wouldn't.
Nobody would, you know.

503
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,635
It's just that...

504
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,386
...they were missing, and...

505
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:53,308
...well, I'm just inquiring.

506
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:55,767
Let me give you a
word of advice, okay?

507
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,145
Stay away from me.
I don't wanna talk to you.

508
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:01,767
And I don't wanna hear any more of
your stupid notes and suggestions.

509
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,487
I don't like you.

510
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:07,987
So if you got any other problems,
whether it's raisins, prunes...

511
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,445
...figs or any other dried fruit...

512
00:26:11,621 --> 00:26:14,492
...just keep it to yourself and stay out
of my way, okay?

513
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:19,169
All right.

514
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,828
I don't think we're gonna have any
problem with that.

515
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,213
Good talking to you, Tom. Really.

516
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:28,004
Elaine? Elaine?

517
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:30,717
What do you want?
What can I do?

518
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:32,927
Is-? Is it...?

519
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:35,929
Is it my job? Is that what it is?

520
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:38,845
Elaine, I can't go on like this.

521
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:41,849
Look, will-? Will-? Will you call me?

522
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,651
Would you call me?

523
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,355
Well, why? I-
All right, you want-? May I call you?

524
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,525
Elaine? Elaine?

525
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:52,734
Excuse me, Mr. Dalrymple...

526
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:55,035
- ...I am so sorry.
- All right, what's your name?

527
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,870
- David Richardson.
- Get out, you're fired.

528
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,248
- But, Mr. Dalrymple-
- Don't talk back to me!

529
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:03,710
I said, get out.
You want me to call the cops?

530
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,586
I make and break little worms
like you every day.

531
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,918
Do you know how much
money I make? Any idea?

532
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,340
Do you know where I live?

533
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,218
I could have any woman in this city
that I want. Anyone.

534
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:15,135
Now, get out!

535
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:20,136
What are you all looking at?!

536
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:22,981
Go back to work.

537
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,391
Back!

538
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:27,189
Back!

539
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:40,197
Doctor called and said I'm not gonna
get the results for another two days.

540
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,203
Oh, you're fine.
There's nothing wrong.

541
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:43,754
I'm the one who's dying.

542
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,582
- What do you mean?
- I can't act.

543
00:27:45,757 --> 00:27:47,666
I stink. I don't know what I'm doing.

544
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm gonna make a fool out of myself.

545
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:54,302
Come on, you're...

546
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:56,016
You're fine.

547
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:58,429
This show's gonna ruin my career.

548
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,679
- How did I get involved?
- What about me?

549
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,097
I was a total failure.
Everything was fine.

550
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:06,892
Now this thing's gonna be a success,
and God gives me a terminal disease.

551
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:09,234
This actress playing Elaine,
she's crazy.

552
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,398
The guy playing Kramer
threatened me.

553
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:14,492
- Why?
- I asked him about the raisins.

554
00:28:16,246 --> 00:28:17,788
You mentioned the raisins.

555
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,785
- Oh, yeah.
- Did he take them?

556
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,544
I don't know.

557
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,080
Well, if he didn't take them...

558
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:27,880
...what happened to them?

559
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,124
That's what I'm trying to find out.

560
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:37,926
- Hey.
- Hey.

561
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:40,926
- Any luck?
- No. No, nothing.

562
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:44,396
I got no peristalsis.

563
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:46,772
- Well, what about bran?
- I tried bran.

564
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:49,268
Forty percent, 50 percent,
100 percent.

565
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:51,734
The bran isn't working for me.

566
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:53,531
- Well, what about Meta-?
- Did it.

567
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,028
- How about Ex-?
- Yeah, had it.

568
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,277
- Milk of Magne-?
- Yeah, yeah.

569
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:00,620
Well, my friend...

570
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:05,419
...it may be time to consider
the dreaded apparatus.

571
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,297
Hold it right there.

572
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:12,632
If you're suggesting what I think,
you're wasting your time.

573
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:16,005
I am not, Jerry, under any
circumstances, doing any...

574
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,671
...inserting in that area.

575
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,386
Oh, it's not that bad.

576
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:22,843
Yes, it is.

577
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:24,474
Well...

578
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:28,473
...it's all taken care of. I filed a report.
An investigation is under way.

579
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,057
So you going to the taping?

580
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:33,190
No, I don't think I should go.
I don't want to bump into Russell.

581
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:34,823
He called me the other day.

582
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:38,360
Come on, you gotta go. He's harmless.
He's got a little crush on you.

583
00:29:38,536 --> 00:29:42,368
Jerry, this is not a crush.
This is a complete fixation.

584
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,367
He makes me very uncomfortable.

585
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,084
We need you there.

586
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,168
- Hey, are you gonna go?
- No, no, I-I'm gonna stay home. I...

587
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,547
I wanna be close to my home base, in
case there's any news from the front.

588
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:07,991
No. Pick it up more in the front.
It's gotta be higher. Higher.

589
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,623
Make a wall. A wall.

590
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:12,835
Sandi, are you in wardrobe?

591
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,128
- Sandi?
- Try " Elaine."

592
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,755
- Elaine?
- Yes?

593
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:24,509
Elaine?

594
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,055
It's me.

595
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:29,766
Wilton Marshall. Remember?

596
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:31,932
Camp Tioga, 1978?

597
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,397
- Remember?
- Right.

598
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,319
You know, you haven't changed a bit.

599
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,572
- I can't remember my lines.
- Just relax, you'll be fine.

600
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:47,118
I can't relax. I don't-
I don't know any of them.

601
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,448
You're just like George.
He'd do the same thing.

602
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,784
- You're just like him. It's amazing.
- Help me.

603
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:53,918
George is always saying that.

604
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:56,330
You don't have to worry anyway.
It's not live.

605
00:31:56,507 --> 00:31:58,630
It's not on till next week.
Have a good show.

606
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,090
What's my first line?
Just tell me my first line.

607
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:04,014
- "New sneakers."
- "New sneakers. " Right, that's it.

608
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:08,012
Where's Russell?

609
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,473
You know, I don't know.
I assumed he wouldn't miss it.

610
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,055
He hasn't been well.

611
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:17,563
Can I tell you something
in confidence?

612
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,773
I think it's a woman.

613
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:21,572
How pathetic.

614
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:25,869
Yeah, this is George Costanza.
I'm-I'm calling for my test results.

615
00:32:27,497 --> 00:32:29,121
Negative?

616
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,118
Oh, my God!

617
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:35,579
Why? Why? Why?

618
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:38,203
What?

619
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,547
Negative's good?

620
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:44,972
Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.

621
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:48,224
Thank you. Thank you very much.

622
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:52,645
What was I worried about?

623
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:19,214
Listen.

624
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:22,336
I know we've had our
problems in the past...

625
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,377
...but we got a show to do tonight.
Time to pull together as a team.

626
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:27,754
Life's too short.

627
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:31,597
I say, let's let bygones be bygones.

628
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:34,889
If you took the raisins,
if you didn't take the raisins...

629
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:37,187
They weren't even my raisins.

630
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,983
I-I was just curious because...

631
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:42,770
...seems like a strange
thing to do...

632
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:48,286
...to walk into a room, audition
and walk out with a box of raisins.

633
00:33:48,703 --> 00:33:50,612
Anyway, whatever.

634
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:54,371
If you ever want to tell me about it,
the door to my office is always open.

635
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,700
In the event that I get an office.

636
00:33:56,878 --> 00:34:00,745
You'll come in. We'll talk about the
raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.

637
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,584
How would you like it if I just...

638
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,342
...pulled your heart out of your chest
now and shoved it down your throat?

639
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:12,598
<i>Good evening. Welcome to a taping
of the new show Jerry.</i>

640
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,221
Does everybody know what a pilot is?

641
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:21,024
- Yeah, he flies a plane.
- No, a pilot is the taping of a show...

642
00:34:21,194 --> 00:34:23,685
...that's the first show
before a TV series.

643
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:26,484
And this show will air on Thursday.

644
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:30,407
Are you ready to meet our cast?
All right.

645
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:39,875
Good evening, folks.
How you doing?

646
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,835
You sound like a great crowd.

647
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,629
We have a show we're gonna put on
for you tonight.

648
00:34:46,802 --> 00:34:49,472
It's a- It's a new TV show.
It's what they call a pilot.

649
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,588
<i>And we hope it becomes a series.
It's called Jerry. I'm playing Jerry-</i>

650
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:56,010
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

651
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,404
What about Davola?
Did you believe that?

652
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:11,860
<i>What was that thing he yelled out,
sic semper tyrannis? Is that Latin?</i>

653
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,194
John Wilkes Booth yelled it
when he shot Lincoln.

654
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,863
- Really? What's it mean?
- It means "death to tyrants."

655
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,495
I could see that.

656
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:23,544
See, now, this is exciting!
This is exciting!

657
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:26,881
- Did I miss anything already?
- No, it starts in five minutes.

658
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:28,711
You were there.
What's the big deal?

659
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,093
Now it's on TV. It's different.

660
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:33,713
- I told everybody I know to watch it.
- Yeah, me too.

661
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:36,716
- Did you hear from Russell?
- No.

662
00:35:36,894 --> 00:35:39,053
Strange, him not showing up
at the taping.

663
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,697
Well, well.

664
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,106
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.

665
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:53,905
- You went for the big E, huh?
- Wet and wild.

666
00:35:55,204 --> 00:35:57,825
- Kramer, sit down. It's about to start.
- Oh, yes.

667
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:02,916
Hey, what is this?

668
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,080
Look, a wallet.

669
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:08,091
- A wallet? Let me see that.
- Here.

670
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:12,209
It's my father's wallet. He thought
they stole it at the doctor's office.

671
00:36:12,388 --> 00:36:15,140
- This is it.
- How do you like that?

672
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,876
You hurt me.

673
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:54,962
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

674
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:57,799
- New sneakers?
- Yeah.

675
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:00,644
- What do you need new sneakers for?
- I like sneakers.

676
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:04,644
How do you decide which ones to
wear? I'd go crazy if I had to decide.

677
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,475
You're crazy anyway.

678
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:09,811
<i>Why did you eat the top
off the muffins?</i>

679
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:12,312
<i>- So what?
- I can't eat it now.</i>

680
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,358
- George.
- George.

681
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,744
What kind of stupid show is this?

682
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:22,324
Hey, that's that idiot that took
all my records.

683
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:27,121
John, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.

684
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:29,704
This show looks interesting.

685
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:32,338
Isn't he that Seinfeld fella you
went out with?

686
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,841
Oh, he's horrible. Horrible.

687
00:37:35,054 --> 00:37:36,429
Nevertheless.

688
00:37:36,847 --> 00:37:38,674
That Jerry's a funny guy, huh?

689
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,593
Got to love the "Sein."

690
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:42,511
I hate the "Sein."

691
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,107
This is a piece of crap.

692
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:56,404
Oh, Donald, you used to like him.

693
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:57,856
What a sellout.

694
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,862
Give me that remote. Give me that.

695
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,037
- Give me the remote.
- Donald.

696
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:04,958
- Jerry, the commercial's almost over.
- All right.

697
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,539
You know, I really like this guy
playing the butler.

698
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,538
Yeah, he's good.
He's John Ritter's cousin.

699
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:12,373
- Really?
- Yeah.

700
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:16,794
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello.

701
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:19,213
So where do you want me
to start today?

702
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,055
- Why don't you start in the bedroom.
- I'll start in your bedroom.

703
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,687
- Hey.
- Hey. The butler's here.

704
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,682
He is? Listen.

705
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:30,897
When he's finished,
send him over to my house.

706
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:33,227
- I'm not sending him to your house.
- Why not?

707
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:36,358
The judge decreed he'd become
my butler, not my friend's butler.

708
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:39,319
Jerry, he is your butler. You can give
him any order you want.

709
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:42,163
- That's what butlers do.
- But I don't want to.

710
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:45,034
Jerry, my house is
a pigsty. Come on.

711
00:38:47,334 --> 00:38:48,579
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

712
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:50,295
Come on up.

713
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:54,413
- I need more Pledge.
- More Pledge?

714
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:57,628
I just bought two cans last week,
and I don't have any wood here.

715
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,926
Well, it goes fast.

716
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,928
Hello.

717
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:06,390
Hello.

718
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:14,184
What's all this about?

719
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:17,113
- We had a date last week.
- You had a date?

720
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:20,650
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

721
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:24,954
- Why do I need your permission?
- Because he's my butler.

722
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,031
That's terrific.

723
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,705
How could anyone not like him?

724
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,254
I like his style.

725
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:36,293
He has a sort of casual elegance.

726
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,044
But he picks his nose.

727
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,211
Nevertheless.

728
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,961
He's a member of our
health club, isn't he?

729
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,259
Yeah.

730
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:50,393
You know, that Kim Novak
had some big breasts.

731
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:58,442
You ever notice a lot of butlers
are named Jeeves?

732
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:04,447
You know, I think when you-
When you name a baby Jeeves...

733
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:08,621
...you've pretty much mapped out
his future, wouldn't you say?

734
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:12,242
Not much chance he's gonna be
a hitman, I think, after that.

735
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:15,504
"I'm terribly sorry, sir,
but I'm going to have to whack you."

736
00:40:18,092 --> 00:40:19,337
Yeah.

737
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,920
Oh, wow, that was great.

738
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:24,674
That show was so funny.

739
00:40:24,848 --> 00:40:28,015
It was really funny. I'm not just
saying that because I know you.

740
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,807
All right. Well, let's go out
and celebrate.

741
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:33,347
- That was so good.
- Come on, let's eat something.

742
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:36,359
I think this will get picked up, George.
You're gonna be rich!

743
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:38,318
- You really think so?
- Oh, yeah.

744
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:40,029
And God didn't kill me.

745
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:41,858
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.</i>

746
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:44,986
- This is Rita Kirson.
- Oh, hi, Rita.

747
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,536
<i>I'm calling to let you know...</i>

748
00:40:46,704 --> 00:40:49,029
...Russell Dalrymple is
no longer with this network.

749
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:51,040
Oh, my God. Did he get fired?

750
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:53,450
<i>To be honest with you,
nobody really knows.</i>

751
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,335
He seems to have disappeared.

752
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,046
Russell's disappeared?

753
00:40:57,381 --> 00:41:00,501
<i>In any event, I've been made
the new president of NBC.</i>

754
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:02,218
<i>As you may or may not know...</i>

755
00:41:02,386 --> 00:41:06,135
...Russell and I did not see eye to eye
on many, many projects.

756
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:10,885
And as my first order of business,
I'm passing on your show.

757
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:14,679
You're passing already?
The show just ended two minutes ago.

758
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:17,063
Well, I just got the job.

759
00:41:17,234 --> 00:41:19,061
Goodbye, Jerry.

760
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:22,485
Yeah. See you.

761
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,079
What are you-?
What are you looking at me for?

762
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:31,868
- It was you.
- What-? What did I do?

763
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,662
Do you realize his obsession with you
cost us a TV series?!

764
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:38,162
I didn't know that he'd fall for me,
and I'd drive him insane, I mean-

765
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,580
- You know, that's not my fault.
- Yes, it is!

766
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:42,501
You're very charming!

767
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,178
I can't believe this.

768
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:46,923
What happened to him?
Where is he?

769
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:49,174
No one knows.

770
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:53,723
She works for Pendant Publishing.

771
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:57,265
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

772
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:58,900
You know...

773
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:03,528
...I used to work for NBC,
but when I go back to her this time...

774
00:42:03,697 --> 00:42:05,904
...she'll respect me.

775
00:42:06,867 --> 00:42:11,079
You'd better get down.
They might start firing soon.

776
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:25,462
Hey, look at this.

777
00:42:25,636 --> 00:42:26,881
What is going on here?

778
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:28,429
Well, well.

779
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:30,430
Nothing has changed.

780
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:31,974
How did this happen?

781
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:36,597
I talked to these guys at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

782
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:39,144
Hey. What are you two guys
doing here?

783
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,478
I thought you were gonna do
something. Now you're eating here?

784
00:42:42,903 --> 00:42:46,070
No, that's- That's-That's why
we're here. We're checking things out.

785
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,197
- We're checking it out.
- Checking it out?

786
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:50,359
See you back at the office, guys.

787
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:54,162
Fred, Paul, lunch and dinner?

788
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:56,656
Boy, you guys ought to move in.

789
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:58,660
How about a piece of pie, on me, huh?

790
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:00,994
Sophia, take care of these fellows.

791
00:43:01,171 --> 00:43:03,164
Hey, come here.
I want you to know something.

792
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,796
You are not gonna get
away with this.

793
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:09,253
- Get away with what?
- "With what?" You know what.

794
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,347
With the waitresses,
how they're all alike.

795
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:16,843
Of course they're alike.

796
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,680
They are my daughters.

797
00:43:22,192 --> 00:43:24,399
Your daughters.

798
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:27,777
You must be very proud, Mr. Barzakian.

799
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:31,364
And may I say, sir, they're lovely girls.
Absolutely lovely girls.

800
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:33,658
It's nice to see such fine,
upstanding women...

801
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:37,115
- ...in gainful employment, Mr. Barzakian.
- Here's table for you.

802
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:38,785
- Oh, a table right here.
- Peggy.

803
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,702
Peggy. All right.

804
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,870
- Peggy?
- Peggy. His daughter Peggy.

805
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:44,706
Peggy's coming over to serve.

806
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:46,376
One of the family.

807
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:49,093
- My daughter Peggy.
- Peggy.

808
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:50,506
- Good to see you.
- Hi, Peggy.

809
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,802
Thank you very much.

810
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:57,049
- So guess what I gotta do tomorrow.
- What?

811
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,469
Start looking for a job.

812
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,141
You know what you ought to do?

813
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:02,857
You should work for Greenpeace.

814
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:05,730
You know, they attack the whalers
out on the open sea.

815
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:07,231
Are you crazy?

816
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:10,571
You take your life in your hands
with those nuts.

817
00:44:11,408 --> 00:44:15,073
Keep fighting it, matey.
Get your head above the water.

818
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:17,617
I've got you, matey.

819
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,577
I got you. Matey.

820
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:23,495
I'll remember her name.

821
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,046
Elaine Benes.

822
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:26,838
I'll write to her.

823
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,921
I'll tell her all about you
and what you did out here.

824
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:33,087
Goodbye, matey.

825
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:34,592
Goodbye.

826
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:46,023
Now, I know women often complain
about the number of things...

827
00:44:46,193 --> 00:44:48,351
...you have to do to get male attention.

828
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,438
The high heels, the pantyhose,
the makeup.

829
00:44:50,614 --> 00:44:52,523
It's even worse if you're a man.

830
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,941
If you're a man,
you don't know what to do.

831
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:57,740
That's why we're building bridges,
climbing mountains...

832
00:44:57,913 --> 00:45:02,374
...exploring uncharted territories.
You think we wanna do these things?

833
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,210
Nobody wants to build a bridge.

834
00:45:05,128 --> 00:45:07,964
It's really, really hard.

835
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,957
Designing rockets,
flying off into space.

836
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:15,421
I guarantee you, every astronaut,
when he comes back from space...

837
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:19,180
...goes up to a girl and goes,
"So did you see me up there?"
