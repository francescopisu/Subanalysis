1
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:07,883
I think people think of their office
as a stationery store with Danish.

2
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:10,266
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...

3
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:12,476
...your envelopes, your supplies...

4
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,601
...your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,769
Why do people that work in offices...

6
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:21,111
...have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?

7
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,404
Do they forget that they're married?

8
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,410
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.

9
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:28,570
Hold it a second.

10
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:31,368
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.

11
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,916
I completely forgot."

12
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:43,543
- She hasn't told her father yet?
- We're supposed to tell him tonight.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,756
- What do you mean, "we're"?
- Susan wants me to be there.

14
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,220
You're meeting the father
for the first time?

15
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:53,639
- Yeah.
- You'll make quite an impression...

16
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:56,387
...when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.

17
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:00,059
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.

18
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:03,570
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,776
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars-

20
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,410
- I know what happened.
- No, wait.

21
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:11,662
- Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
- I know.

22
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:15,995
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...

23
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:19,585
...with one of those
very same cigars.

24
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,420
It's very comical.

25
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:25,252
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.

26
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:26,673
I got a lot on my mind.

27
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:29,088
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.

28
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,223
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.

29
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:33,718
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.

30
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,140
Come on.

31
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,098
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.

32
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,851
We could build a cabin like that.

33
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:41,695
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,060
BICs? What, did you get BICs?

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,149
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?

36
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,117
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.

37
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:51,693
All right, let's just get to work.

38
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.</i>

39
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,868
Act 1, Scene A.

40
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:00,796
So you're gonna sit there?

41
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:02,709
Let me explain to you...

42
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:05,504
...one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.

43
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:07,171
Because it may seem outwardly...

44
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:10,180
...that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.

45
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:15,806
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.

46
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:19,016
Okay, so just- Just park yourself.

47
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,313
All right. Act 1, Scene A.

48
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:23,975
- Drink?
- No. No drink.

49
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:29,439
- All right. Here we go.
- Act 1, Scene A.

50
00:02:35,582 --> 00:02:38,417
- Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
- Yes.

51
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,751
Hi, is Elaine there?

52
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,504
Oh, hi, Sandra.

53
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:50,585
Yeah, I can hold.

54
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:54,512
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.

55
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:56,890
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.

56
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,101
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.

57
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:02,107
I'll be off in a minute!

58
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,102
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?

59
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:06,649
Okay, thanks.

60
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:09,812
Are you thinking of ideas?

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,943
Is there any way I can
get you directly?

62
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:15,618
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.

63
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,034
So we're on for later?

64
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,407
Yeah, I'll come by after work.

65
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,419
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.

66
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:24,953
I gotta go. I gotta go.

67
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,958
Sandra? Sandra?

68
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,592
Can you come here
for a second?

69
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:30,761
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

70
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:32,968
- You got it? Here we go.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,379
Okay, how about this:

72
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:39,058
I'm in my apartment.
You come in.

73
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,186
It's beautiful.

74
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,391
And what do I say?

75
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:52,900
Could you do me a favour?

76
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:54,618
When my friends call...

77
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:57,746
...could you not talk to them
for too long?

78
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,122
Why, did Jerry say something?

79
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,786
No. No.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
He must've said something.

81
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,795
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

82
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,373
- I can't work for you.
- Oh, God.

83
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:09,383
- I can't. I'm leaving.
- No, Sandra...

84
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,674
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.

85
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,762
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.

86
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,636
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.

87
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:20,644
Sometimes they don't laugh.

88
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,096
- All right, let's get going.
- All right, let's go to work.

89
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,556
- Let's go.
- Okay.

90
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,689
- Hey.
- We're in the middle of something.

91
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,437
- We're trying to do a little work here.
- Yeah, come on.

92
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:34,897
What's with you?

93
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,282
- No more golf.
- Why?

94
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:40,698
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...

95
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:43,791
...who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?

96
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,795
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!

97
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,630
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.

98
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:56,049
What are you, crazy?

99
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:59,472
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.

100
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,551
What's one thing got to do
with another?

101
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:03,890
Kramer, please.

102
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:06,222
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.

103
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,807
I can't. I won't.

104
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:11,191
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.

105
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,569
The grass has
big brown patches in it.

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,115
They don't rake the sand traps.

107
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:18,237
Not to mention the calibre of people
you have to play with.

108
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,657
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them some place else.

109
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,824
Where? They're Cubans.

110
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,247
- You know what? I should take off.
- What?

111
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,207
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.

112
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:33,086
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.

113
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:35,382
You got four hours.
What about the script?

114
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:37,553
I think we got a bite on it.

115
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,020
Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?

116
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:51,102
A slight resemblance.

117
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,818
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

118
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,408
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.

119
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:01,411
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...

120
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:05,781
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...

121
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:10,370
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?

122
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,955
Oh, the cigars.

123
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,707
I'm sucking them down.

124
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:19,377
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

125
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,881
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.

126
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:24,968
I did not know that.

127
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,473
Weird. Wild.

128
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:31,604
- What?
- He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.

129
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,645
I didn't care much for his jokes.

130
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,780
- Daddy never laughs.
- Oh, well, so what?

131
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,941
Laughter. What is that?

132
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:43,652
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:

133
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,747
What is that?

134
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:51,452
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.

135
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:54,334
You and your cigars.

136
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,796
Wear some more lipstick.

137
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:02,887
Daddy, there's- There's something
that we have to talk to you about.

138
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:06,177
Oh, I forgot to ask you:
how'd you like the cabin?

139
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,100
Oh, the- The cabin.

140
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,932
Well...

141
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,235
After we get off the phone
you tell her?

142
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,397
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.

143
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,530
Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.

144
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,784
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- I know.

145
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:26,705
I screwed up. It's all my fault.

146
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:29,790
- Would you call her?
- Oh, dial the number.

147
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,540
How could you do this?

148
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,706
I was just trying to help you.

149
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:39,718
Trying to help me.

150
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,428
Hello. Sandra.

151
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,221
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

152
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,890
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

153
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,852
See, I told Elaine...

154
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:53,141
...that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.

155
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:56,649
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.

156
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,235
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."

157
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:03,609
But I was really being sincere.

158
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,192
No, of course I like you.

159
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,406
Tonight?

160
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,241
Hold on a second.

161
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:15,708
- She wants to have a drink with me.
- Just go. Go.

162
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,588
- Oh, I don't-
- Go.

163
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:20,046
Yeah, I think I can.

164
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:22,510
Yeah, I know where that is.

165
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:26,261
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.

166
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,425
Now I gotta have a drink with her.

167
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,428
The cabin.

168
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,681
Well...

169
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:36,098
Susan?

170
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,683
- About the cabin-
- I love that place.

171
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:42,444
My father built that cabin in 1947.

172
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:46,031
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...

173
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:50,034
...and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.

174
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:51,914
She died there the following winter.

175
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:57,203
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.

176
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:00,878
His last words to me were:

177
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,714
"Cherish the cabin."

178
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:10,806
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.

179
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:15,645
But, " Cherish the cabin."

180
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:18,982
And I have, for 45 years.

181
00:09:19,318 --> 00:09:23,446
It's often been a sanctuary for me.

182
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:26,993
Kind of like Superman's
Fortress of Solitude.

183
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,320
What?

184
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,329
Superman.

185
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:34,415
He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...

186
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:37,917
...to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.

187
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:41,589
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

188
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:46,218
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.

189
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,762
- Daddy?
- Yes.

190
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,172
Daddy, about the cabin.

191
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,385
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.

192
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:57,432
- What about it?
- Well, the thing is...

193
00:09:57,607 --> 00:10:01,023
- What? What is it?
- Well, the cabin is kind of...

194
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:03,863
- George?
- Burned.

195
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:08,237
- Burned?
- There was a fire, and it-

196
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,868
Burned.

197
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,570
- The cabin burned?
- Yeah, burned.

198
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:17,536
Burned?

199
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,908
Was anything found?

200
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,123
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?

201
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:24,967
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing?

202
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,930
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...

203
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,671
...what with it being your cigars
and everything...

204
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,724
...it's really rather ironic.

205
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:37,978
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.

206
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:43,068
Really. Think about it.

207
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:45,809
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

208
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:48,230
How could you say
something like that to me?

209
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,815
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.

210
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,404
I was just trying to keep up.

211
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:56,279
- That was a weird thing to say.
- Why? It didn't mean anything.

212
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,995
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

213
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:03,332
- Oh, I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.

214
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,540
You said much sicker things
than me.

215
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:08,585
- I'm leaving.
- You're making too much of this.

216
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:09,959
Excuse me.

217
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:12,130
- Let me walk you to a cab.
- That's okay.

218
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,714
The main thing is that this is
just between us.

219
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,644
- And that'll be the end of it.
- Oh, really?

220
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:20,481
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.

221
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:23,139
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.

222
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,985
So we're drinking and talking.

223
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,529
And so she starts rubbing my leg.

224
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:34,618
Wow, what did you do?

225
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:37,195
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?

226
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,788
- Yeah. Right.
- I know it's the wrong thing to do.

227
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,245
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.

228
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:47,791
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."

229
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:51,667
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:

230
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:53,304
"Would you mind?"

231
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:57,300
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?

232
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,967
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.

233
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:03,980
- All right, so go ahead.
- So then we go back to my apartment.

234
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,145
So we're fooling around there.

235
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,313
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.

236
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:13,656
And she starts with the dirty talking.

237
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,495
All right, all right. Hold on.

238
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:18,655
Time out.

239
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:24,330
- What did she say?
- You know. The usual.

240
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:26,496
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?

241
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:29,792
- Typical things.
- What's typical? Give me typical.

242
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:34,174
She says...

243
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,521
That's very dirty.

244
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,531
That's absolutely filthy.

245
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:55,858
And then she starts talking
about her panties.

246
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,733
I'm gonna need some water here.

247
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,872
So I said something.

248
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,618
Okay, what did you say?

249
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:06,794
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.

250
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:09,085
- Of course.
- Okay.

251
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:12,507
So she's talking about her panties.

252
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,586
So...

253
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,840
So I said:

254
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:20,134
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."

255
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:36,825
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?

256
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:39,448
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

257
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,575
It just popped out.

258
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:45,915
- Well, how did she react?
- She flipped out. Just left.

259
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,496
Well, that's not offensive.

260
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,042
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

261
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:53,381
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.

262
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,259
I mean, especially the pantie remark.

263
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:58,345
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.

264
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,180
What if this girl says something?

265
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:01,927
She will. She's going back to work.

266
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:04,674
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.

267
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,638
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?

268
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,436
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.

269
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:13,610
- Guess he didn't see the humour in it.
- Yeah.

270
00:14:16,157 --> 00:14:18,445
- Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
- All right.

271
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:20,824
- Big workday.
- That's right.

272
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,152
- Okay.
- Let's go.

273
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,575
- Right now.
- Let's do it.

274
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:26,456
- Okay.
- All right.

275
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:30,458
- What do you got?
- I got, you enter, you go, " Hi."

276
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,539
And I go, " Hello."

277
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,795
Now, we need something here.

278
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:39,463
- Oh, hey.
- Kramer! Hey!

279
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,011
- Buddy!
- You guys are working. I'll come back.

280
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:43,593
- No, no! Come on.
- No, no!

281
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,932
No, you guys should
get back to work.

282
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:48,594
- Don't leave. We're taking a break.
- Oh, yeah?

283
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,442
George, did you talk to that guy
about getting more cigars?

284
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:53,775
I told you. I'm not gonna do that.

285
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,103
Okay. Well...

286
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,614
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take matters into my own hands, huh?

287
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,326
All right. I'll see you guys.

288
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:04,530
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.

289
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,381
Okay...

290
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:23,013
- I need to talk to someone.
- Well, what is this about?

291
00:15:23,182 --> 00:15:25,755
Well, it's a very private matter,
but extremely urgent.

292
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,677
- Are you an American?
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:15:28,854 --> 00:15:30,183
I see.

294
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:32,229
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

295
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:39,021
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's get focused here.

296
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,863
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.

297
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:45,364
<i>- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.</i>

298
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:47,364
Come on up.

299
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,166
All right, you know what
we should do?

300
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,459
We should go to the movies.

301
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,836
- Get away from the script for a while.
- We should.

302
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:00,507
I just have to go over to the Rosses'
and drop off Susan's sunglasses.

303
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:02,884
- Come with me?
- Yeah. Does she live with them?

304
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,300
No, no.

305
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:08,553
- Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
- What?

306
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,057
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.

307
00:16:12,356 --> 00:16:14,265
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.

308
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,897
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.

309
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,611
- Why, what happened? Did you talk?
- Talk? Did I talk? I-

310
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,616
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.

311
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,907
I've concluded,
from the basis of those talks...

312
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,569
...that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.

313
00:16:28,747 --> 00:16:31,073
- You really think I should fire her?
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,413
In fact, if George and I weren't
so busy working, I'd do it myself.

315
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,095
<i>What is your name, señor?</i>

316
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,513
Kramer.

317
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:53,722
<i>So Señor Kramer,
what is this about?</i>

318
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:57,231
- Cigars.
- Cigars?

319
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:00,232
- Cigars.
- What about cigars?

320
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,487
See, here, I-

321
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,863
I saved one of the cigar rings.

322
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:10,535
- You mean, one of these.
- Yeah, yeah. That's them.

323
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:14,490
Okay, so I'd like to buy
a couple of boxes of those from you.

324
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,954
You realize, of course,
these are illegal in your country.

325
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,464
Well, illegal, huh?

326
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:26,377
I like that jacket.

327
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,724
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

328
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,144
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

329
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,977
I thought you guys were
working today.

330
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:42,402
- Just taking a little break.
- Yeah.

331
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,572
- Oh, here's your sunglasses.
- Oh, thanks. Come on in for a second.

332
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:49,074
This is my brother Ricky. He's home
from college for the weekend.

333
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:51,202
Hey, there, young fella.

334
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,245
- What's your major?
- I don't have one.

335
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:55,659
Well, you should always
consider podiatry.

336
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:57,621
Nothing wrong with the feet.

337
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:59,337
And this is my aunt, Sara.

338
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,583
He doesn't look like me.

339
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,501
Sara, what do you have
on your wheels?

340
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,552
Nothing. They're clean.

341
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,466
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

342
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:14,057
- Yes.
- Well, they're filthy.

343
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,064
It's just a matter
of common courtesy.

344
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:23,190
You come in the house,
you wipe your wheels.

345
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,153
Excuse me.

346
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:27,944
Hello, Raymond.

347
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,405
The man from the insurance company
dropped this off.

348
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,282
Said it was the only thing left
from the remains of the fire.

349
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,364
Oh, thank you.

350
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,531
Wow, I've never seen this before.

351
00:18:38,711 --> 00:18:39,991
Oh, they're letters.

352
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,585
- Here.
- Oh, sure.

353
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:47,882
From- From John Cheever!

354
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,765
"Dear Henry...

355
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,685
...last night with you was bliss.

356
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:57,810
I fear my...

357
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:02,562
...orgasm has left me a cripple.

358
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:06,269
I don't know how I shall ever
get back to work.

359
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,862
I love you madly, John.

360
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:13,410
P.S. Loved the cabin."

361
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,952
- Well, we really should be...
- Yeah, look at the time.

362
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,749
...heading out.
You know, it's a time...

363
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:25,547
The box!

364
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:27,258
My letters! Give me that!

365
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,089
Who told you to open it?

366
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:31,590
Who's John? Who's John?!

367
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:33,673
- I knew it.
- I wanna know who John is!

368
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,091
John Cheever? Dad!
You and John Cheever?

369
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:40,182
Yes. Yes, he was the most
wonderful person I've ever known.

370
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:42,766
And I loved him deeply.

371
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:45,598
In a way you could
never understand.

372
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,947
Well, we really should be
heading out.

373
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,161
Jerry hates to miss
the coming attractions.

374
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,408
- Yeah, and because of the time.
- Yeah.

375
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:03,751
Time is what he's indicating there.

376
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:07,669
Anyway, onward and upward.

377
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:12,001
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

378
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,554
- Come on, now.
- Right now.

379
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:15,631
- You and me. No fooling.
- You got it.

380
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:18,762
- All right, what do you got?
- I got, you come in, you say, " Hi."

381
00:20:18,936 --> 00:20:21,308
And then I say, " Hello."

382
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,557
- All right. So we need something.
- Yeah.

383
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:28,277
How about this:
I say, " How's it going?"

384
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:32,405
"How's it going?" Beautiful.

385
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,447
- Come on. We were just on a roll now.
- All right.

386
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,446
- Did you get that line?
- "How's it going?"

387
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:40,492
- Did you write it down?
- I'm writing it. " How's it going?"

388
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,993
- Real good!
- What?

389
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:46,502
You know how much money
you cost me today? $429.

390
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:49,163
- What? How?
- I got Sandra transferred...

391
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:51,084
...to another office upstairs, okay.

392
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,344
So she blabs to Lippman about
my long-distance calls to Europe!

393
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:57,846
- What calls?
- I made a friend when I was in Europe.

394
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:01,183
And we've been in touch,
and Sandra told Lippman!

395
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,685
Did she say anything else to you?

396
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:06,729
Anything else? What do you mean,
"anything else"?

397
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:08,685
So she just left the office...

398
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,696
...didn't say a word to you
about anything?

399
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,446
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

400
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,285
Why is that beautiful?

401
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,948
Oh, no. Not beautiful.

402
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:21,782
It's $429!

403
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,866
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.

404
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:26,580
- No, no.
- No, I insist.

405
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,995
I was the one that encouraged you
to fire her.

406
00:21:29,172 --> 00:21:30,880
- The whole thing was all my-
- Okay.

407
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,627
Fault.

408
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,877
Do you smell smoke?

409
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:41,719
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you
to meet my new friends here.

410
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:44,729
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.

411
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:47,103
- Hey.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

412
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:50,026
Yeah, we're heading up
to Westchester. Gonna hit the links.

413
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:52,898
- Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that your...?

414
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:54,981
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're going.
All right.

415
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,410
Hey, what are you reading?

416
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:08,120
<i>The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.</i>

417
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:11,458
John Cheever. You ever read
any of his stuff?

418
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:15,131
Yeah, I'm familiar with
some of his writing. You know.

419
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,431
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.

420
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,426
- Okay. I'll leave you two alone.
- Okay.

421
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:23,799
Maybe I'll visit my mother.

422
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:28,604
She just bought me some new panties,
and they're all laid out for me.

423
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:45,279
There's this whole
talking-during-sex business.

424
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:47,117
I mean, what are we doing here?

425
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,036
The question is...

426
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:51,417
...does the talking really
improve the sex?

427
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,082
Or is the sex act now...

428
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,629
...just there to spice up
the conversation?

429
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:59,300
Eventually, I'm sure people will get
too lazy even for phone sex.

430
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:02,176
They'll start having
phone machine sex.

431
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:06,383
"Yeah, I want you really bad.
Just leave it on the tape."

432
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,897
Then, I guess, the phone company
will come out with sex-waiting.

433
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,940
That'll be the new thing.

434
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,149
"Yeah, hold on, honey.
I got another call.

435
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,601
Oh, hi, baby. One second.

436
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,615
Honey, I've gotta take this.

437
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,823
Yeah, I've got sex-waiting
on the other line...

438
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:24,116
...and I've got to take this."
