1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,363
I had glasses when I was 10.

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,738
Anybody beat that?
Anybody got them younger?

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,904
- Seven.
- Seven?

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,801
Two?

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,980
Anybody born with glasses?
Come out...

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,642
Actually come out
of the birth canal and go:

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,880
"That was a hell of a delivery,
I'll tell you that.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,324
Can I clean these?

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,127
Does anybody have one
of those little cloths?

10
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,926
I was just born. They're a little...

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,659
A little smudgy."

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,540
- Fantastic.
- I told you. How good is this?

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,145
- It's good.
- How good?

14
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,302
- Very good.
- I know.

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,473
They put real blueberries in this.
What kind did you get?

16
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,142
Coffee. They grind up
the coffee beans and put it in!

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,618
Let me test-taste that.

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,788
- And it's nonfat.
- How could this not have any fat?

19
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,693
- It's too good.
- You wanna taste mine?

20
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,260
- Oh, you wanna taste mine.
- No, I don't.

21
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,701
If you wanna taste mine, you don't
have to offer me some of yours.

22
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,200
All right, let's just forget it.

23
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,543
Kramer's gonna clean up
on this place.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,405
- What do you mean?
- He invested in it.

25
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,979
- No kidding?
- We've been coming here every day.

26
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,675
This is so f*****g good!

27
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,444
Jerry!

28
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,586
Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,255
- That's nice.
- All right.

30
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,589
We should get going, but I'm gonna
get a little bit more, okay?

31
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,332
- Oh, God, look who's here.
- Who is it?

32
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,595
This guy from my old neighborhood,
Lloyd Braun.

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,831
He's a big adviser to Mayor Dinkins.
He thinks he's so cool.

34
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,065
Oh, really.

35
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,512
Hey, George.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,148
Hey, Lloyd!

37
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,046
Hey!

38
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,015
My friend Jerry.

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,020
So I hear you're living back home now,
or something?

40
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,825
Yeah, there was a fire
in my apartment.

41
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,791
A fire.

42
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,163
There's a lot of major chicks
in this place, huh?

43
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,992
Something wrong with your arm?

44
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,765
Yeah, actually.

45
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,812
I bumped my elbow on a desk
and injured something...

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,949
...and now it sort of
moves involuntarily.

47
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,210
That's a bitch, huh?

48
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,384
- So how are your parents doing?
- Oh, pretty good.

49
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,921
- This place does some business, huh?
- Yeah, this is my first time here.

50
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,555
Hey, she's a doll.

51
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,327
Hi.

52
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,195
- Hello.
- Elaine, this is Lloyd.

53
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,201
- Hi.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

54
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,805
Nice to meet you too.

55
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,037
Boy, I'm really sorry
I gotta run now.

56
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,304
- Well, take it easy, huh, George?
- Yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,212
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

58
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,118
- Boy, he is really cute.
- He's a jerk.

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,589
- He's gone, George.
- All right, all right.

60
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,424
So there were a lot of people there?

61
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
That yogurt place-
You're gonna make a fortune.

62
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,733
- They're doing incredible business.
- I told you to go in on it.

63
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,998
- How did you know?
- Well, I tasted it at the one downtown.

64
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,142
It's got a remarkable texture.

65
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,107
You'd never know it was nonfat.

66
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,376
<i>- Yeah?
- Me.</i>

67
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,046
Hey, I had the show of my life
last night.

68
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,122
- I ad-libbed, like, 10 new minutes.
- Yeah, but did you tape it?

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,258
- Yeah.
- Right there. I got it.

70
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,155
I did this thing on
the Ottoman Empire:

71
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,661
What, was this a whole empire
based on putting your feet up?

72
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,165
<i>I'm telling you, I got a whole
new Tonight Show here.</i>

73
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,132
- Hi.
- Hey.

74
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,068
What's the matter?

75
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,266
I was having lunch
and I bit down on the fork.

76
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,076
It's hard to believe
with so much biting experience...

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,544
...a person could still
make a mistake like that.

78
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,548
- What?
- You're getting heavy.

79
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,748
- What?
- You look like you put on 5...

80
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,289
...10 pounds.

81
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,490
- Kramer!
- I'll tell you something else...

82
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,527
...you're looking
a little chunky yourself.

83
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,055
- Me?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,928
- No.
- Where's your bathroom scale?

85
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,370
Oh, my God! I've gained 7 pounds!

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,144
- I've gained 8!
- I told you.

87
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,373
I thought I'd put on a couple, but
7 pounds, how did I gain 7 pounds?

88
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,710
- How did I gain 8?
- I don't get it.

89
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,979
I've been doing the same exercises.
I haven't been eating different.

90
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,588
Me either.

91
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,748
Wait a second.
Maybe it's that yogurt.

92
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,622
- No, no. That's 100-percent nonfat.
- How else could this have happened?

93
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,060
- Maybe it's the Oreos.
- I don't eat Oreos.

94
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,133
You don't eat Oreos?
The way you break them open...

95
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,365
You're practically having
sex with them.

96
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,166
- What about me?
- You? You're getting old.

97
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:13,278
- Maybe your yogurt isn't so nonfat.
- Oh, guess again, tubby.

98
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,107
There's gotta be a way
we can find that out.

99
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,376
There must be a kind of lab
that would do that.

100
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,946
I've got it! I'll call
the Food and Drug Administration.

101
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,855
Hey, I'll tell you what, chubs.

102
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:32,726
If that yogurt has fat in it, I will
put myself on an all-yogurt diet...

103
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,595
- ...for a week.
- Well, let's start the insanity.

104
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,937
Giddyup.

105
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,306
"Tommy Tune
is a very good dancer."

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,880
You ever see Tommy Tune dance?

107
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,312
- No.
- I like tap-dancing.

108
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,118
Tap-dancing. Anyone can tap-dance.
It's those shoes.

109
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,490
Are you kidding?
They practice for years, those people.

110
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,588
What's for supper?

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,566
Somebody's at the door.

112
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,134
Tommy Tune is very tall.

113
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,963
That helps. It makes him lankier.

114
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,010
- Lloyd!
- Hello, Mrs. Costanza.

115
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,611
Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.

116
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,772
- Hey, Lloyd!
- What are you doing here?

117
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,215
Well, I was just visiting my mother,
so I thought I'd drop by, say hello.

118
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,813
Georgie, come here and say hello.

119
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,685
How you doing? I hear you're
a big adviser for Dinkins now.

120
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:37,296
- That's right. Hey, George.
- Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?

121
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,693
I ran into George yesterday
in the city.

122
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,035
What's the matter with you?

123
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,404
So how's the arm?

124
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,769
- Oh, it's good.
- What's the matter with your arm?

125
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,343
- Nothing.
- Yeah, his arm moves like this.

126
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,040
Your arm moves like this? I've never
seen your arm move like this.

127
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,480
- Me either.
- Well, it comes and goes.

128
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,983
It's like some kind of...

129
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,519
...a spasm.

130
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,114
I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew
any good orthopedists.

131
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,285
He said he had the best. So I made
an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.

132
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,091
Mayor Dinkins got
an appointment for him?

133
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,960
You mentioned George's name
to Mayor Dinkins?

134
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,803
You discussed George
with the mayor of New York?

135
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:23,908
Dinkins was talking about you.
He was discussing you!

136
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,275
You know, Lloyd,
I've been to the doctor.

137
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,970
- There's nothing they can do.
- Hey!

138
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,774
Mayor Dinkins set this up for you.

139
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,349
You know what kind of a doctor
he must be?

140
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,645
All right. All right, I'll go.

141
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:36,616
Well, that's great.

142
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,156
And I'll be very interested
to hear the diagnosis.

143
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,898
Okay, well, we're coming down.
All right. Okay.

144
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,865
I got a place that can analyze it.
It's in Brooklyn.

145
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,232
- They said they could do it?
- Yeah. It's 45 bucks.

146
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,739
All right, let's go to the yogurt store
and get a specimen.

147
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,809
- Well, I hope you're satisfied.
- What?

148
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,109
Every word out of my son's
mouth now is f**k, f**k, f**k.

149
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,452
You know what he said to me
five minutes ago?

150
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,317
"Where's my f*****g cupcake?"

151
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,824
Gee, I'm really sorry.

152
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,726
He wants to be like you
because you're a comedian.

153
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,265
- Maybe you could talk to him.
- I'd be happy to.

154
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,696
Thank you.

155
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,101
Mary, we've been eating
a lot of your husband's yogurt...

156
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,935
...at the yogurt place.
Does that have any fat in it?

157
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,441
No f*****g way.

158
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:41,283
- It was very nice seeing you again.
- Oh, it was good seeing you.

159
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,016
By the way, who was that gorgeous
woman I saw you with the other day?

160
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,261
- Just a friend of mine.
- You must mean Elaine.

161
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,863
- Isn't she adorable?
- She is, she is.

162
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,626
How about giving me her number?

163
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,099
You know, Lloyd,
I really don't have it.

164
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,206
She works at Pendant Publishing.

165
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,700
Elaine Benes.

166
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,003
- Great. Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,305
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

168
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,748
Oh, that Lloyd Braun,
he is something, isn't he?

169
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,922
I wouldn't hear of it.
I said, "Nice try, granny"...

170
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,560
...and I sent her to the back
of the line.

171
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,696
Hello, Newman.

172
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,638
Hello, Jerry.

173
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,333
Say, this yogurt is really something,
huh? And it's nonfat!

174
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,913
I've been waiting for something like
this my whole life, and it's finally here!

175
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,843
Hey, Seinfeld.

176
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,212
I'd appreciate if you'd stop using
obscenities around my son, huh?

177
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,686
It was an accident.
I'm gonna talk to him.

178
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,826
I'll have a small plain vanilla
in a cup to go.

179
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,029
- That's nonfat, right?
- That's right.

180
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,289
I'm on a special diet.

181
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,491
- The doctor said I can't have any fat.
- Yeah, well, there is no fat.

182
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,262
Hey, another round of strawberry
for me and my friends!

183
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,366
- Hurry, Jerry, hurry.
- How's it doing?

184
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,603
Not so good.

185
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,906
You can't have this tested now.
It's melting.

186
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,516
- So what?
- It changes the molecules.

187
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,515
You don't know
what you're talking about.

188
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,122
Hey, fatso, I got a 90 in biology.

189
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,884
You call me fatso again,
you're gonna be walking back.

190
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,763
Hi. I called earlier about
getting the yogurt tested?

191
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,925
Oh, right.
Would you fill this out, please?

192
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,936
- Does it matter if it's melted?
- No.

193
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,475
- This is gonna take a couple of days.
- That's okay.

194
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,811
Hello there.

195
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,109
Hello.

196
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,451
Test tubes.

197
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,950
Cool.

198
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,882
- What do you got there?
- This is Mr. Giuliani's blood.

199
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,787
We're doing a cholesterol workup
on it.

200
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,423
Okay, I'm done.

201
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,627
- It was really nice meeting you.
- Well, the pleasure's all mine.

202
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,063
- You can't take that chemist out.
- Why not?

203
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,835
Because she's like the jury.
She's gotta be sequestered.

204
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,945
I'm not taking her out
just to influence the results.

205
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,207
- I think the whole thing stinks.
- It smells. Smells bad.

206
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,907
- Smells really bad.
- That's enough.

207
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,382
- What?
- With the smells.

208
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,548
So he made an appointment for me
to see Dinkins' doctor.

209
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,717
- He's just trying to humiliate me.
- Yeah.

210
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,831
And I have to go. If I don't go,
he'll know I'm lying.

211
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,035
What are you gonna do,
sit in the doctor's office doing this?

212
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,569
He's gonna think
you're a mental patient.

213
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,072
I don't care.

214
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,402
Look, Lloyd doesn't know
what he's up against.

215
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,568
This is nothing to me.

216
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,941
My whole life is a lie.

217
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,450
- Hey.
- Hey.

218
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,176
So guess who called me.

219
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,948
- Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
- We're going out tomorrow night.

220
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:08,560
All right, look, he's gonna ask you
about my arm.

221
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,958
So just tell him I banged it
against a desk...

222
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,325
...and it's been moving involuntarily
ever since.

223
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,727
I can't say that.

224
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,664
- Why not?
- What if I like him?

225
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,000
- I'm gonna start out lying to this guy?
- So you're taking his side?

226
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,936
No, but what if we get married?

227
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,509
We'll always have that between us.

228
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,942
Already you're marrying this guy?

229
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,775
- You never know.
- Believe me...

230
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,077
- ...you're not gonna marry him.
- What if we become a couple?

231
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,585
Every time we see you, you're gonna
be walking around going like this?

232
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,417
Even you can't keep that up.

233
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,422
Oh, I believe he can.

234
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,891
- You know Jerry.
- Of course. He's a funny f****r.

236
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,068
See?

237
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,935
Listen, Matthew, I want to explain
something to you.

238
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:07,147
Now, cursing is not something
that most comedians do.

239
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,115
- You did it.
- That's true, but it was an accident.

240
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,021
I haven't done it since,
and I would never do it again.

241
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,487
If you continue cursing,
you'll never become...

242
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,358
...a comedian like me
when you grow up.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,695
Excuse me one second.

244
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,005
You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins
on everything he does.

245
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,509
- Yeah, yeah. Big adviser.
- He tells him what soap to use.

246
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,016
What the f**k are you doing,
you little piece of s**t?!

247
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,719
We don't want to disturb
the security guard.

248
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,228
Where's the lights?

249
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,995
- How about this?
- Yeah.

250
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,899
A Bunsen burner.

251
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,413
You want a taste? It's cappuccino.

252
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,818
It's delicious.

253
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,559
- I hear you.
- Nonfat?

254
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,955
Well...

255
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,728
...you tell me.

256
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,190
Is the verdict in yet?

257
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,829
No.

258
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,567
Well...

259
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,228
...this is in case there's a tie.

260
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,784
As far as I know,
he bumped his arm into a door...

261
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,083
...and it's kind of got...

262
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,923
...this involuntary movement.
It's some sort of a spasm.

263
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,590
So, anyway, you're a big adviser
to Dinkins, huh?

264
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,202
Yeah, yeah. It's coming
right down the wire.

265
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,500
Know what I would do
if I was running for mayor?

266
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,665
One of my campaign themes
would be...

267
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:14,540
...that everybody should wear
nametags to make the city friendlier.

268
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,204
- Nametags, huh?
- Everybody would know everybody.

269
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,613
It would be like a small town.

270
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,013
- Maybe I'll mention that to him.
- Really?

271
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,258
- You sure you don't want any yogurt?
- No, I'm watching my weight.

272
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,686
- Oh, it's nonfat.
- Yeah, so they say.

273
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,355
- Well, shall we go?
- Yeah, okay.

274
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,441
Three days he hasn't called me,
and you know why?

275
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,807
Because he thinks I'm too fat.

276
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,380
- He said that?
- No.

277
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,416
But I saw the look on his face
when he put his arm around me.

278
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,882
Then we went to his apartment,
and I sat on one of his chairs...

279
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,285
...and it broke.

280
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,327
And he says,
"Boy, you're a lot of woman."

281
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,195
Hey, so hear anything
on the yogurt?

282
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,703
- No, but I expect to hear any time.
- Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.

283
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,535
- Why do you say that?
- No reason.

284
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,344
Did you hear about that Dinkins?

285
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,673
- What about him?
- You didn't hear?

286
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,114
He's proposing a plan where everyone
in the city should wear nametags.

287
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,984
- Nametags?
- So people can go around...

288
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,588
...saying hello to one another.

289
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,989
Oh, I see. So you go, "Hey, you know
who I saw wilding today? Herb!"

290
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,685
He's becoming a laughingstock!

291
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:42,357
<i>The Times has already stated it could
cost him the election. Nametags!</i>

292
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,896
Hello?

293
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,972
Yes.

294
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,370
Yeah-

295
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,367
Oh, really?

296
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,076
Okay. Thank you very much.

297
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,614
Bye-bye. Well...

298
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,079
...the yogurt verdict is in.

299
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,982
Fat!

300
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,894
The next morning, I woke up...

301
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,295
...and it was going like this.

302
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,391
I can control it
if I really concentrate...

303
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,231
...but otherwise-

304
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,808
Yes, well, I'm going to have to be
perfectly honest with you.

305
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,809
- Please, doctor.
- I've examined you...

306
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,971
...I've looked at your x-rays...

307
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,277
...and I find that there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

308
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,651
Really?

309
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,356
- Nothing?
- Nothing...

310
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,791
...that would indicate
involuntary spasms.

311
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,593
Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?

312
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,467
- No, not really.
- How so?

313
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,231
May I suggest the possibility
that you're faking.

314
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,340
Faking?

315
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:59,239
What makes you think
that I have time...

316
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,879
...to see doctors take x-rays,
make appointments...

317
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,174
...when there's absolutely nothing
wrong with me?

318
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,647
What kind of a person
would do a thing like that?

319
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,652
I don't know what kind of person
would do something like that.

320
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,154
Obviously a very sick person.

321
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,055
A very immature person.

322
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:19,030
A person who has no regard for
wasting other people's valuable time.

323
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,389
- Goodbye.
- Now see here, doctor-

324
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,467
I said, goodbye.

325
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,331
Fine.

326
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,109
Jerry, come on, look.
Let's go to that yogurt store.

327
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,841
I've been thinking about this. This
has gotta be a massive conspiracy.

328
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,985
Who knows how deep it goes?

329
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,282
Hey, look, wait a second.
Kramer, turn that up.

330
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,283
<i>Rudy Giuliani, who underwent
a physical last week...</i>

331
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,552
<i>...received some
startling news today...</i>

332
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,459
<i>...when his cholesterol count
turned out to be a whopping 375.</i>

333
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,535
<i>What effect this will have
on the minds of the voters...</i>

334
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,931
<i>...remains to be seen.</i>

335
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,470
<i>In another development,
Mayor Dinkins has fired...</i>

336
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,768
<i>...his top adviser, Lloyd Braun,
who was believed responsible...</i>

337
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,467
<i>...for the nametag fiasco.</i>

338
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,510
<i>We now take you to
Giuliani headquarters...</i>

339
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,171
<i>...where Rudy Giuliani is
about to make a statement.</i>

340
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,319
<i>It's hard to understand because
I've done everything I normally do.</i>

341
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,717
<i>I've been watching my diet very
carefully, I exercise regularly.</i>

342
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,553
<i>My only indulgence, I guess, would
be that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt...</i>

343
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,989
<i>...but it's nonfat.</i>

344
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:29,323
Nonfat yogurt? Oh, my God. They got
Giuliani, and he doesn't know it!

345
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,561
- Now look what you've done.
- We've gotta do something.

346
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,865
I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.

347
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,003
Nametags! Nametags!

348
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,272
What kind of an idiot thinks anybody
would be interested in that idea?

349
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:46,076
I don't think it's so bad.
People should wear nametags.

350
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,413
Everyone would be a lot friendlier.

351
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,351
"Hello, Sam."
"How you doing, Joe?"

352
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,256
Hey, your arm. It moved again.

353
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,562
I thought you said it went away.

354
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,661
I banged it on the desk
in the doctor's office.

355
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,663
Quiet!

356
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,803
They're starting the press conference.

357
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,067
<i>My campaign staff received
some very disturbing information...</i>

358
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,304
<i>...regarding the fat content in yogurt
that's being sold throughout the city.</i>

359
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,746
<i>I pledge to you now that if I'm elected
mayor, as my first order of business...</i>

360
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,319
<i>...I'll appoint a special task force
to investigate this matter.</i>

361
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,479
<i>I promise you,
my fellow New Yorkers...</i>

362
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,421
<i>...that Mayor Giuliani
will do everything possible...</i>

363
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:32,462
<i>...to cleanse the city
of this falsified nonfat yogurt.</i>

364
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,059
The old yogurt was so much better.
Oh, this is terrible.

365
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,397
- Oh, it stinks.
- Mine too.

366
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,505
- I got one more day.
- I can't eat this.

367
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,834
Hey, Jerry.

368
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,443
Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.

369
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:51,208
- It had fat in it. It's not good for you.
- I don't care!

370
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,174
It was good! I was enjoying it.

371
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,651
Had to interfere,
couldn't leave well enough alone.

372
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,518
I will get even with you for this.
You can count on it.

373
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,919
Hey, you guys, listen to this.
Listen to this.

374
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,189
"Apparently some blood spilled
into Mr. Giuliani's test tube...

375
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,992
...causing his cholesterol count...

376
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,397
...to be 150 points higher
than was initially reported.

377
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,437
Ironically, the mishap, by bringing
the nonfat-yogurt scandal...

378
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,971
...to the public's attention...

379
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,609
...probably clinched the election
for the Republican.

380
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,439
It was the one issue which seemed
to electrify the voters...

381
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,207
...and swept Giuliani into office."

382
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,109
So in effect, the yogurt
won him the election.

383
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,652
I wonder what actually happened
in that lab.

384
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,982
Yeah. Me too.

385
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,289
I can't eat this.

386
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,102
Thanks for ruining my daddy's
business, you fat f**k.

387
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,344
There's nothing more fun
than cursing when you're a kid.

388
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,576
I mean, it's like getting
the keys to the car.

389
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,482
You're doing something
you're not supposed to do.

390
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,351
And there's nothing less fun
than when you're an adult...

391
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,085
...and having to use
those wholesome curses:

392
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,059
Fudge!

393
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,727
Sugar!

394
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,326
Consarnit!

395
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,301
What the hell is " consarnit" anyway?

396
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,531
You stub your toe
and say, "Consarnit"...

397
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,142
...you might as well say, "Yippee!"

398
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,346
If you've been to a foreign country,
the first thing you learn...

399
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,879
...are the curse words. Right?

400
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,883
You travel halfway around the world to
experience some exotic civilization...

401
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,147
...the first thing you ask is,
"How do they say 'doodie' here?"
