1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,093
We never should have
landed a man on the moon.

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,632
It's a mistake.

3
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,331
Now everything is compared
to that one accomplishment.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,569
Everybody goes, "I can't believe
they can land a man on the moon...

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,680
...and taste my coffee."

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,646
We would've been happier if we
hadn't landed a man on the moon.

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,980
We'd go, "They can't make a
prescription bottle that'll open easily?

8
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:26,285
I'm not surprised they couldn't land on
the moon. Things make perfect sense."

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,761
Neil Armstrong should've said,
"That's one small step for man...

10
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,161
...one giant leap for every whining,
complaining SOB on the Earth."

11
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,271
Hey, do you believe I got
"Happy New Year'd" today?

12
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,807
It's February.

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,776
I once got
"Happy New Year'd" in March.

14
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,575
- It's disgusting.
- It's pathetic.

15
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,549
- Hey, is it cold out?
- Really cold.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,156
- Scary cold?
- What's your definition of scary cold?

17
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,252
Hi.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,395
That.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,297
What is that?

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,470
- What?
- When did you get that?

21
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:16,075
This week. My father got
a deal from a friend of his.

22
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,176
It's Gore-Tex.

23
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,969
You know about Gore-Tex?

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,540
You like saying Gore-Tex,
don't you?

25
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,276
Look at you. You can't even
turn around in that thing.

26
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,817
Look at this.

27
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,751
Hey, George, can you feel this?
Can you-?

28
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,855
All right, all right! Knock it off.

29
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,925
Come on, let's go.

30
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,261
We should stop off on the way
and get a bottle of wine or something.

31
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,026
What for?

32
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:46,331
These people invited us for dinner.
We have to bring something.

33
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,196
Why?

34
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,175
Because it's rude otherwise.

35
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,443
You mean just going there
because I'm invited...

36
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,206
- ...that's rude?
- Yes.

37
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,010
You're telling me, instead of them
being happy to see me...

38
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,779
...they'll be upset because
I didn't bring anything.

39
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,183
You see what I'm saying?

40
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,688
The fabric of society
is very complex, George.

41
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,785
I don't even drink wine.
I drink Pepsi.

42
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,124
You can't bring Pepsi.

43
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,194
Why not?

44
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,998
Because we're adults.

45
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,703
What, you're telling me that wine
is better than Pepsi?

46
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,637
No way wine is better than Pepsi.

47
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,037
George, I don't think
we wanna walk in there...

48
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,647
...and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi
in the middle of the table.

49
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,750
I don't like the idea that any time
there's a dinner invitation...

50
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,977
...there's this annoying little chore.

51
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,816
You're getting to be
an annoying little chore yourself.

52
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,883
All right, let's go. Who's driving?

53
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,927
You are. I can't get that thing
in my car.

54
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,923
Where's the heat in this car?
Come on. Warm me up.

55
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,696
- It's cold. Give us a little squeeze.
- Get off of me.

56
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,034
Get off of- Get off of me.

57
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,806
You're comfortable up there,
bubble boy.

58
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,242
Oh, yeah.
You wish you had this coat.

59
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,780
I was just thinking,
the four of us can't show up...

60
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,680
- ...with just one bottle of wine.
- Oh, here we go.

61
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,787
- What?
- Why don't we get them a couch.

62
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,753
We'll rent a U-Haul.
We'll bring them a nice sectional.

63
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,258
We should bring some cake.
Will you stop off at the bakery?

64
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,591
Why don't you just get some
Ring Dings from the liquor store.

65
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,062
Ring Dings?

66
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,699
Ring Dings are better
than anything at a bakery.

67
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,268
I like Ring Dings.

68
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,701
George, you can't show up
at someone's house...

69
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,171
...with Ring Dings and Pepsi.

70
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,072
Hey, your lights are on!

71
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,975
It's a funeral procession.

72
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,244
I got news for you.
I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi...

73
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,819
...I'm the hit of the party.

74
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,115
People would be coming up,
"Between you and me...

75
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,986
...I'm really excited about
the Ring Dings and the Pepsi."

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,687
What are we, Europeans, with
the Beaujolais and the chardonnay?

77
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,588
Oh, Kramer, that's the bakery.
Stop here. Stop here.

78
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,233
- All right.
- Okay, let me out.

79
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,232
- You, whatever your name is.
- Jerry.

80
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,870
Yeah, Jerry. Come with me.

81
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,438
We'll get the wine,
pick you up here in 10 minutes?

82
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,836
- Yeah.
- All right.

83
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,674
I love the smell of bakeries.

84
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,009
Look, Elaine,
the black-and-white cookie.

85
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,981
I love the black-and-white.

86
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,085
Two races of flavor living
side by side in harmony.

87
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,452
It's a wonderful thing, isn't it?

88
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,685
You know, I often wonder what you'll
be like when you're senile.

89
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,521
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Yeah. It'll be a very smooth transition.

90
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,031
Thank you.

91
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,834
All right.
What are we getting?

92
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,362
Chocolate babka.
That's their specialty.

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
- Love that babka.
- Yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,874
But listen. Elaine,
when we get up to the door...

95
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,774
...you hold the cake box.

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,578
- Why?
- I don't know.

97
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:46,207
Just standing there with a box,
holding it by the little string...

98
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,747
- You think it's effeminate?
- It's a tad dainty.

99
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,352
Oh, we forgot to pick a number.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,324
See, that's not fair. We were here
ahead of all these people.

101
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,155
You think I should go
and ask her for hers?

102
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,460
- No, forget it.
- No, no, no. It's not fair.

103
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,832
Just because they have a ticket
doesn't mean they were here first.

104
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,269
We were ahead of them
and them and her.

105
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,308
Come on, let's just go
ask them. Come on.

106
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,072
Excuse me.

107
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,505
Well, I'm not finding a spot here.

108
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,212
What do you wanna do?

109
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,613
- Just double-park.
- No.

110
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,652
- Why not?
- I'll get a ticket.

111
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,653
What if somebody wants
to get out of here?

112
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,554
People get spaces this good,
they never give them up.

113
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,957
That's a fallacy.

114
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,460
All right, I tell you what.

115
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,096
Go into the store,
and I'll wait in the car.

116
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,861
Why don't you go into the store,
and I'll wait in the car?

117
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,000
Because I've got the coat.

118
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,939
- I can sit in the car and not get cold.
- I'll leave the car heater running.

119
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,409
- Does the heater work in this car?
- No.

120
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:52,182
There's a spot right in front
of the liquor store. You see? You see?

121
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,623
- But we were here ahead of you.
- How do I know that?

122
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,281
Well, we saw you come in.

123
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,293
- Well, that's easy for you to say.
- Oh, yeah, right.

124
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,760
That's something I do.

125
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,128
I make up stories to get ahead
in lines at bakeries.

126
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,496
Forty-six.

127
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,567
Wait. Wait a second.

128
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,368
Are you Barbara Benedict?

129
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,570
Yes.

130
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,636
Oh, my God.

131
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,815
I don't - I know you.

132
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,779
I'm - I'm Elaine Benes.

133
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,216
Do you remember? We met
at Linda van Grak's baby shower.

134
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,217
I'm on my way over there right now.

135
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,549
Yeah, me too.

136
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:36,456
- You're Jerry, right?
- David.

137
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,064
Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?

138
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,059
Yes, it is.

139
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,136
You know, we were here
ahead of you.

140
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,909
- You're not getting my number.
- So you still don't believe us.

141
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,479
- Forty-seven.
- That's us.

142
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,139
Oh, okay, fine. Fine.
Go ahead. But listen.

143
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,114
As soon as I get there...

144
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,414
...I'm gonna tell everyone
what a jerk you are.

145
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,889
I'll be there ahead of you and I'll
be telling them what a jerk you are.

146
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,019
I'll have the chocolate babka.

147
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,964
You're lucky, Mrs. Benedict.
It's our last one.

148
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,135
All right, what are we getting?
It's hot in here.

149
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,968
What do you say
we get a Mouton Cadet?

150
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,171
- What's that?
- It's a Bordeaux.

151
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,545
Robust, bold, very dry...

152
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,484
...as opposed to a Beaujolais,
which is richer and fruitier.

153
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:42,287
- All right, here's one. Twelve dollars.
- Twelve dollars?

154
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,328
We should've gone to the bakery.
They're not getting no 12-dollar cake.

155
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,797
I'll pay you back later.
I don't have my wallet.

156
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,111
- Why not?
- I don't like to carry my wallet.

157
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,646
My osteopath says
that it's bad for my spine.

158
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,841
Throws my hips off-kilter.

159
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,481
Throws your hips off-kilter.

160
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:14,083
- So where's your money?
- I never take it.

161
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,922
- So, what do you do?
- Oh, I get by.

162
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,094
See you later.

163
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,428
- See you later.
- See you later.

164
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,831
That's the last babka.
They got the last babka.

165
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,530
I know. They're going in first
with the last babka.

166
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,538
- That was our babka.
- You can't beat babka.

167
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,575
We had that babka.

168
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,212
They're gonna be heroes.

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,577
So, what now? If we can't get the
babka, the whole thing's useless.

170
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,785
- Well, how about a carrot cake?
- Carrot cake?

171
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,912
Why is that a cake? You don't
make carrots into a cake, I'm sorry.

172
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,287
- Black Forest?
- Black Forest? Too scary.

173
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,122
You're in the forest.

174
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,429
- Hey, how about a napoleon?
- Napoleon?

175
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,865
Who's he to have a cake?
He was a ruthless warmonger.

176
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,368
Might as well get a Mengele.

177
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,468
That was our babka.
We had that babka.

178
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,374
- What's this one?
- That? Cinnamon babka.

179
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,942
Another babka?

180
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,947
There's chocolate,
and there's cinnamon.

181
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,588
Well, we gotta get the cinnamon.

182
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,624
Yeah, but they got the chocolate.
We'll be going in with lesser babka.

183
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,260
I beg your pardon.

184
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,420
Cinnamon takes a back seat
to no babka.

185
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,627
People love it. It should be on tables in
restaurants with salt and pepper.

186
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,032
Someone says,
"This is so good. What's in this?"

187
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:36,368
The answer comes back, "Cinnamon,
cinnamon," again and again.

188
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,875
Lesser babka? I think not.

189
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,847
Forty-nine.

190
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,074
I'll have a cinnamon babka.

191
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,319
And a black-and-white cookie
for me.

192
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,212
Peace.

193
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,857
That'll be 13.05.

194
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,090
All right, here you go.

195
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,925
A hundred. I can't change that.

196
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,158
- You can't? All right, let's go.
- Wait a second.

197
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,598
I can get change.

198
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,900
Hey, anybody got change
for a hundred?

199
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,739
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

200
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,540
- You're gonna get us killed.
- What?

201
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,809
Don't go shouting we got a $100 bill.
People will be all over us.

202
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,976
Let's buy something
and we'll get change.

203
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,553
I am not buying something
just to get change.

204
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,886
George, there's a newsstand right
over there. Now, come on.

205
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:35,727
- What are we doing?
- Just get some gum or something.

206
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,736
Pack of gum. Here you go.

207
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,806
What, it's a hundred?
I can't change a hundred.

208
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,872
- Why not?
- You gotta buy more than that.

209
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,442
Here. Get a newspaper.

210
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,583
- Newspaper.
- Not enough.

211
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,982
Clark Bar.

212
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,585
- Clark Bar.
- Keep going.

213
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,794
- I'm up to $2 here.
- Here.

214
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:07,160
<i>- George, get a Penthouse Forum.
- I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.</i>

215
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,665
No, that'll make great
dinner-party conversation.

216
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,061
We'll read the letters
at the dinner table.

217
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,706
- Oh, that's nice.
- You ever read one of these?

218
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,774
It's not real. They're all made up.

219
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,671
Oh, it's real.

220
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:22,171
You know, then there's an unusual
number of people having sex...

221
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,680
...with amputees.

222
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,853
<i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

223
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,017
Newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.

224
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,360
Six seventy-five.

225
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,095
Oh, great. All right, with the wine,
I'm in over $20 now.

226
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,364
- Big coat. Big coat!
- Yes.

227
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,067
I'm sorry. It's a new coat.

228
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,307
It's Gore-Tex.

229
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,378
We better be careful with that thing.

230
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,610
You'll start a war.

231
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,689
See, the key to eating
a black-and-white cookie...

232
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,623
...is you wanna get some black
and some white in each bite.

233
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,787
Nothing mixes better
than vanilla and chocolate.

234
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,894
And yet still somehow,
racial harmony eludes us.

235
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,900
If people would only
look to the cookie...

236
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,733
...all our problems would be solved.

237
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,740
Well, your views on race relations
are just fascinating.

238
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,369
<i>You really should do
an op-ed piece for The Times.</i>

239
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,516
Look to the cookie, Elaine.

240
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,151
Look to the cookie.

241
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,314
What is this?

242
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,957
What?

243
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,422
It's a hair.

244
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,324
Take it back.
Get another one.

245
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,795
- No, we're late. I'll take it off.
- Get another one. It'll take a second.

246
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,593
All right, all right.

247
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,134
- Excuse me.
- Hey, hey.

248
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,500
- I'm on line here.
- No, no, we just bought this.

249
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,198
You sold us a cake with a hair on it.

250
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,775
You have to take a number.

251
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,973
We waited 15 minutes for this.

252
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,512
You sell me a cake with
a hair on it...

253
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,777
...and then you want me to wait?

254
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,852
What are you doing?
You're gonna wait now?

255
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,115
I'm not gonna eat a cake
with a hair on it.

256
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,918
It was a little hair. I took it off.

257
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,288
A little hair?
Do you think that makes it better?

258
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,124
- What if it's your hair?
- What if it's your hair?

259
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,859
What is wrong with my hair? Nobody
takes better care of their hair than me.

260
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,900
You can serve dinner on my head.

261
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,972
You use that misty herbal rainwater
crap they sell in the health food store.

262
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,939
I use Prell, the hard stuff.

263
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,906
Hundred proof, takes your roots out.

264
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,712
Okay, fine. We'll just wait
till she calls the number.

265
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,079
Maybe we should forget
about the cake.

266
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,380
No. I'm bringing cake.

267
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,458
All right, we got the wine.
Aren't we lucky? We got wine.

268
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,624
Imagine if we didn't bring the wine.
We'd be shunned by society.

269
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,928
Outcasts.
"Where's your wine? Get out!"

270
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,701
"I know this is gonna sound
like a crazy fantasy...

271
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,174
...but every word
of this story is true.

272
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,813
A few weeks ago, my girlfriend
mentioned to me...

273
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,677
...how attractive she thought
our new neighbor, Linda, was."

274
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,512
Look- Look at this.

275
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,945
Somebody double-parked
and blocked us in.

276
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,083
Does anybody know
whose car that is?

277
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,986
Maybe there's a note on it.
Oh, brother.

278
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,755
No. No note.

279
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,491
- Can you believe this?
- "Of course, I noticed her too...

280
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,999
...with those ample breasts
and pouty lips.

281
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,195
I don't have to tell you
she was a knockout."

282
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,309
I really cannot comprehend how stupid
people can be sometimes.

283
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,346
- Can you comprehend it?
- No, I can't comprehend it.

284
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,814
We can put a man on the moon,
but we're still basically very stupid.

285
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,111
The guy whose car this is could be
the guy that built the rocket.

286
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,723
- You see what I'm saying?
- He could build the rocket.

287
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,725
He's still stupid for double-parking
and blocking somebody in.

288
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,092
So you understand my point about
building rockets and double-parking?

289
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,031
On one hand, he's smart with rockets.
On the other, he's dumb with parking.

290
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,726
It's cold out here, huh?

291
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,839
Maybe it's not stupidity.
Maybe it's just a blatant disregard...

292
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,634
...for basic human decency.

293
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,708
This is how dictators start.

294
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,607
Think Mussolini would circle
the block six times for a spot?

295
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,179
How about Idi Amin, huh?

296
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,806
If I was running for office, I'd ask for
the death penalty for double-parkers.

297
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,283
If this is allowed to go on,
this is not a society.

298
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,853
This is anarchy!

299
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,321
- Are those shoes comfortable?
- No, not really.

300
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,087
- They look comfortable.
- That's why I got them, but they're not.

301
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,799
Why couldn't we take
the hair off and go?

302
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,458
- No. That's out of the question.
- Why?

303
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,766
Because I had a bad experience
with a hair when I was younger.

304
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,875
- What happened?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

305
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,109
- You can't tell me?
- All right.

306
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,648
I once found a hair in my farina,
and I freaked out.

307
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,015
You found a hair in your farina?

308
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,418
Yeah.

309
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:00,819
- What happened?
- I screamed:

310
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,655
"There's a hair in my farina.
There's a hair in my farina."

311
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,093
I ran out of the house.
I was running and running.

312
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,130
I was little, but I could run really fast.

313
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,234
And I-I just kept running and...

314
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,168
...they found me three hours later
collapsed at a construction site.

315
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,176
- Whose hair was it?
- My mother's.

316
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,236
- Fifty-eight.
- That's us.

317
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,641
Oh, good.

318
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,480
You sold us a hair
with a cake around it.

319
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,254
We'd like another one.

320
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,521
Oh, that's lovely.
That's what you wanna see, yeah.

321
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,624
Yeah, you wanna trade your hair
for some phlegm.

322
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,838
You win the pennant with that trade.
Hair for phlegm.

323
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,268
Here you are.

324
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,466
Okay. All right,
we got the cake now.

325
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,702
Where is George and Kramer?

326
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,240
Hey, double-parker!

327
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,483
Show yourself!

328
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,382
Come on out, I'm freezing.

329
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,721
We are really late now.

330
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,359
- We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
- Why?

331
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,119
You know, Elaine.

332
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,263
What about her?

333
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,990
I'm a little scared of her.

334
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,592
- You're scared of Elaine?
- Yes.

335
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,998
Why?

336
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,900
Did you ever see her
lose her temper?

337
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,064
I was once late because
I bought a Panama hat.

338
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,439
She pulled it down so hard
my head came right through the top.

339
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,842
Let's go inside the liquor store.
I'm freezing.

340
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:33,280
- Why don't you wear a heavier coat?
- I wanted to look good for the party.

341
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,551
Hey, hey, hey. That's great.
That's very nice.

342
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,623
We been waiting 20 minutes
for you people.

343
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,820
- You think you're Mussolini?
- Back off, puffball, it's not my car!

344
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,266
I wasn't talking to you.

345
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,096
I'm going in.

346
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,240
Wait till I get my hands
on that George.

347
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:01,209
I am gonna pull that big hood
over his little head...

348
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,475
...tie the strings...

349
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,913
...and suffocate him.

350
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,049
You remember that Panama hat?

351
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,546
That was nothing.

352
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,415
What?

353
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,325
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know. I don't feel so good.

354
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,893
What's wrong?

355
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,929
My stomach.

356
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,728
I think it was that cookie.

357
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,528
- The black-and-white?
- Yeah.

358
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,770
Not getting along?

359
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,641
I think I got David Duke
and Farrakhan down there.

360
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,844
If we can't look to the cookie,
where can we look?

361
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,075
My stomach.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

362
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,847
- Wait. What about your vomit streak?
- I know.

363
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,388
I haven't thrown up
since June 29, 1980.

364
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,328
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

365
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,366
You almost took my toe off.

366
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,061
Why don't you watch
what you're doing, you lunatic.

367
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,902
Jerry, I think he broke my toe.

368
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,739
Where-? Where you going?

369
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,071
Fourteen years down the drain.

370
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,644
You think chickens have
individual personalities?

371
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,252
I don't know.

372
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,285
Could you tell five chickens apart...

373
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,051
...just by the way they acted?
Or would they all be walking around:

374
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,791
If they have individual personalities,
I'm not sure we should be eating them.

375
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,499
What's the matter with you?

376
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,928
Can I help you guys with anything?

377
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,234
No, no. We bought
the wine here before.

378
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,600
We're blocked in by some car
double-parked.

379
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,366
Just waiting for the
guy to pull out.

380
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,372
Well, wait outside.
This isn't a hang out.

381
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,210
- But my friend here has hypothermia.
- Hypothermia.

382
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,907
All right, guys.

383
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,018
Take it outside.

384
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,451
You're paying for these.

385
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,729
- How was it?
- Good as it gets.

386
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,235
You know, that coat was Gore-Tex.

387
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,139
It's worth a hell of a lot more
than that cheap chardonnay.

388
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,543
You know I'm freezing?
I'm definitely freezing.

389
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,114
I can't stop shaking.

390
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,615
I'm cold too. At least you got a coat.

391
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,651
Let's get in the car.

392
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,255
Oh, my God.
That's Saddam Hussein, the dictator.

393
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,590
I told you. I told you.

394
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,332
I wouldn't walk around
without a coat.

395
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,832
You'll catch your death of cold.
So long.

396
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,329
Can I get you anything else?

397
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,265
- Oh, no, thanks.
- How about a nice box of scram?

398
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,974
Somebody double-parked.
We couldn't help it.

399
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,176
Might've been Saddam Hussein.
We're not sure.

400
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,512
He had a British accent, though.

401
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,351
What-? What happened to you?

402
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,287
Somebody put a cane on my foot...

403
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,262
...just like the one
I'm gonna put up your-

404
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,297
Hey, what happened to your coat?

405
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,437
And what is that smell?
What, are you drunk?

406
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,764
- I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
- What for?

407
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,171
I spilled some chardonnay.

408
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,771
So, what did you get?

409
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,011
- Cinnamon babka.
- Cinnamon?

410
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,412
- Why didn't you get chocolate?
- George.

411
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,348
What? What? What?

412
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,461
Here. Here's your cake.

413
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,894
And your wine.

414
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,160
- See you.
- See you.

415
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,837
I heard a weatherman say...

416
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,041
...that 75 percent of your body heat...

417
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,686
...is actually lost
through the top of the head.

418
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:06,290
Which sounds like you could go
skiing naked if you got a good hat.

419
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,690
But no hat makes a statement
quite like the hat with the flaps.

420
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,128
The hat with the flaps...

421
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,259
...makes a statement
that no other hat makes.

422
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,838
This hat says to the world:

423
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,237
"I would rather have
the heat in my skull...

424
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,708
...than anything society
could possibly offer me."

425
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,904
In fact, if you're on trial
for a serious crime...

426
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,551
...and your lawyer recommends
the insanity defense...

427
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,880
...this is the hat to wear.

428
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,522
Your lawyer should really insist.
He should just go:

429
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,592
"Your Honor, the defense rests."
