1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,296
To me, government...

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,566
...is basically parents for adults.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,404
Especially the IRS. The IRS is like
Ward and June Cleaver...

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,605
...and we're all
Wally and the Beaver.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,645
And your accountant
is Eddie Haskell...

6
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,511
...showing you all these neat tricks
to get away with stuff.

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,844
That's fine, unless you get audited.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,546
Then you don't want some
wise guy in a suit going:

9
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,022
"You have a very
lovely office here, sir."

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,525
Because jail is the government's
way of sending you to your room.

11
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,133
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint...

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,199
...there's really gonna be
something wrong with the Beaver.

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,871
- Does he like you?
- What do you think?

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,173
- Do you like him?
- Yeah, I like him. Definitely.

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,576
I like him a lot.

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,309
- So, what's wrong with him?
- Nothing, and I've looked.

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,749
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,718
- So how'd you meet him?
- In the office.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,721
- So he's a writer?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,690
- Yeah, big surprise.
- I was sitting on the reception desk.

21
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,920
I was looking pretty hot.

22
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,964
- I was wearing my slingback pumps.
- What are those?

23
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,897
Ask your mother.
You live with her now, don't you?

24
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,127
Anyway...

25
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,297
...then this guy comes up to me,
and he starts feeling my jacket...

26
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,966
...between his thumb
and forefinger like this.

27
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,544
- So, what'd you do?
- I said, "What do you think?"

28
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,203
And he said, "Gabardine?"

29
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,249
And I said, "Yeah. " That was it.

30
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,054
- Just felt your material?
- Yeah. Jake Jarmel.

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,021
- Sounds like a cool guy.
- Sounds like a jerk.

32
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,923
Felt your material, come on.

33
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,031
- Jerry, where'd you get that sweater?
- In the back of my closet.

34
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,168
I think that's what the back
of closets are for.

35
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,659
Hey, that's Barry.

36
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,362
Lookit. Barry.

37
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,073
- Hey.
- Hi.

38
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,971
- Who is that?
- That's Barry Prophet, our accountant.

39
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,612
I don't know how can you let
this guy handle your money.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,806
Not my money. He handles
Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.

41
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,541
- Barry, how you doing?
- How are you?

42
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,117
- This is my friend George.
- Hey.

43
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,083
What are you doing
in this neighborhood?

44
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,779
Nothing, really.

45
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,551
- You... You eat here?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,456
- So how's my money?
- Well, it's still green.

47
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,529
- What, do you got a cold?
- No. No.

48
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,633
- Look at that ring.
- Oh, you like that?

49
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,994
Hey, say, where's the bathroom?

50
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,163
Bathroom?
Bathroom's right over there.

51
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,036
Great.

52
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,139
Did you see that?

53
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,177
- See what?
- Yes, I saw that.

54
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,316
- What?
- What was all that sniffing?

55
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,576
- I don't know.
- You don't think...?

56
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,118
Oh, no. Come on, Jerry.

57
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,916
He was definitely sniffing.

58
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:41,326
I mean, what if-?
This guy's got all my money.

59
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,428
Plus, I got some of Kramer's money
with him.

60
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,723
He can write checks to himself
from my account.

61
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,367
I've known this guy since college.
He doesn't do drugs.

62
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,663
- Then what was all that sniffing?
- Maybe it's the cold weather.

63
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,237
Today's not cold.

64
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,432
All right, I gotta get going.
My parents are expecting me.

65
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,340
Don't forget to wash
your hands before supper.

66
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,952
What do you need
all that ketchup for?

67
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,683
This is my ketchup.

68
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,456
I bought this ketchup...

69
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,652
...just so I could have
as much as I want.

70
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,363
So I...
I talked to Phil Kassikoff today.

71
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,059
Phil Kassikoff?

72
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,398
Yeah. You know, my friend,
the bra salesman?

73
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,874
He says they're looking
for somebody...

74
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,602
...so I got you an interview
next Friday with his boss.

75
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,871
- Next Friday? What time?
- Two o'clock.

76
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,814
That's my whole afternoon.
I was gonna look for sneakers.

77
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,952
You can look for sneakers
the next day!

78
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,148
He doesn't know anything
about bras.

79
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,161
I know a little.

80
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,559
Besides, what do you
have to know?

81
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,997
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in
and be able to discuss it intelligently.

82
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,296
Maybe you should take a look
at a few bras.

83
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,405
Where's your bra?
Give him a bra to look at.

84
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,006
I'm not giving him a bra.

85
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,338
- Why not?
- I don't need him looking at my bra.

86
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,172
Fine. He'll go into the interview...

87
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,372
...he wouldn't know
what he's talking about.

88
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,312
Do we have to...?

89
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,543
You don't even know
what they're made from.

90
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,247
- They're made from Lycra spandex.
- Get out of here. Lycra spandex?

91
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,721
I think they are made
from Lycra spandex.

92
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,792
- Wanna bet? How much?
- I'm not betting.

93
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:25,863
- Take a look.
- All right, I'll get a bra.

94
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,899
I don't know what the big problem is
getting a bra.

95
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,592
She doesn't wanna get a bra.

96
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,664
I'm not saying, "Go to the library
and read the history."

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,741
But it wouldn't kill you
to know a little bit about it.

98
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,070
All right, it wouldn't kill me.

99
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,149
How long does it take to find a bra?

100
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,211
What's going on in there?

101
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,685
You ask me to get a pair of
underwear, I'm back in two seconds.

102
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,618
You know about the cup sizes
and all?

103
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,164
- They have different cups.
- Yeah, I know about the cups.

104
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,170
You got the A...

105
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,169
...the B...

106
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,898
...the C...

107
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,743
...the D. That's the biggest.

108
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,879
I know the D is the biggest.

109
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,814
I base my whole life on knowing
that the D is the biggest.

110
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,283
- Here. Here's the bra.
- Let me see it.

111
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,979
"One hundred percent
Lycra spandex."

112
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,148
- Let me see.
- I told you.

113
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,557
Here. You think you know
everything.

114
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,757
That's surprising.

115
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,094
All right, what else?

116
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,600
You got the cups in the front...

117
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,432
...two loops in the back, all right?

118
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,167
- I guess that's about it.
- I got it. Cups in front, loops in back.

119
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,778
You got ketchup on it.

120
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,220
Sniffing? What do you mean,
sniffing?

121
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,516
- Sniffing. With his nose.
- Jerry, he probably had a cold.

122
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,660
- No, he didn't. I asked him.
- So, what are you saying?

123
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,025
- I don't know. You know, what if...?
- Drugs?

124
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,393
- You think he's on drugs?
- I don't know.

125
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,296
- Jerry-
- All I know is he was sniffing.

126
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,596
- Listen, we went in on a CD together.
- I know.

127
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,238
And Newman gave you money too.

128
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,000
See, I didn't even meet this guy.
We trusted you.

129
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,405
Look, it doesn't necessarily
mean anything yet.

130
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,479
- It just means he was sniffing.
- Well, what else? Was he nervous?

131
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,413
Did he use a lot of slang?
Did he use the word " man"?

132
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,885
No, he didn't use " man."

133
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,081
I mean, when he was leaving,
did he say, "I'm splitting"?

134
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,427
No, but at one point,
he did use the bathroom.

135
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,293
- You think that's a bad sign?
- Yes, that's what they do.

136
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,935
They live in the bathroom.

137
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,571
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get our money, right?

138
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,673
I don't know.
This sweater really itches me.

139
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,570
- You want it?
- Yeah.

140
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,910
Hello. Hel-

141
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,815
Well, you notice anything?

142
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,581
You have cleaned up
the whole apartment...

143
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,690
...and you're making dinner.
You're perfect.

144
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,418
You're a perfect man.

145
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,900
- Did anyone call?
- You got a few messages.

146
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,864
- I wrote them down.
- Where are they?

147
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:20,472
Let's see, they are...
Here they are.

148
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,574
Thank you.

149
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,404
Oh, yeah. I'll call you back.

150
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,714
Forget that-
Myra had the baby!

151
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,509
Oh, my God. That's wonderful.

152
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,015
- Who called?
- She did.

153
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,518
She did? Oh, that's so great.

154
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,220
- Where do you keep the corkscrew?
- It's in the drawer on the right.

155
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,795
What?

156
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,555
No, it's nothing.

157
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,962
- No, what is it?
- It's nothing.

158
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,725
Tell me.

159
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,832
Well, I was just curious why you
didn't use an exclamation point.

160
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,573
What are you talking about?

161
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,077
Well, see right here? You wrote,
"Myra had the baby."

162
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,046
But you didn't use
an exclamation point.

163
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,810
So?

164
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,477
So it's - Yeah, it's nothing.
Forget it. Forget it.

165
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,623
You know, I just found it curious.

166
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,453
Wait, what's so curious about it?

167
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,563
Well, I mean, if one of your
close friends had a baby...

168
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,996
...and I left you a message about it,
I would use an exclamation point.

169
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,295
Well, maybe I don't use
my exclamation points...

170
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,597
...as haphazardly as you do.

171
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,269
You don't think
that someone having a baby...

172
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,274
...warrants an exclamation point?

173
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,379
Hey, look, I just jotted down
the message.

174
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,914
I didn't know that I was required
to capture the mood of each caller.

175
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,483
Well, I just thought you'd be a little
more excited about a friend of mine...

176
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,623
- ...having a baby.
- Okay, I'm excited.

177
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,122
I just don't happen to like
exclamation points.

178
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,284
Well, Jake, you should
learn to use them.

179
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,329
Like, the way I'm talking now,
I'd put exclamation points...

180
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,990
...on the ends all of these sentences!
On this one! And on that one!

181
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,500
Well, you can put one on this one:

182
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,195
I'm leaving!

183
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,375
- You're out of your mind.
- Why?

184
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,481
It's an exclamation point.

185
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,278
- It's a line with a dot under it.
- Well, I felt it called for one.

186
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,750
"Called for one. " I thought
I'd heard of everything.

187
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,914
I never heard of a relationship
being affected by punctuation.

188
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,753
I found it very troubling
that he didn't use one.

189
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,724
George is right.
Didn't take you long.

190
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,236
Anything new with that guy
on drugs?

191
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,263
He's not on drugs.

192
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,500
Then why the sniffing?
Who walks around... sniffing?

193
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,770
All right, here.
You call him right now, okay?

194
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,177
- See if he's sniffing right now.
- Good idea.

195
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,520
<i>- Prophet and Goldstein.
- Yes, Barry Prophet, please.</i>

196
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,521
<i>I'm sorry, he's out of town
this week.</i>

197
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,252
<i>- Out of town?
- Yes. He went to South America.</i>

198
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,919
- South America?
- South America?

199
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,758
I'll call back. Thank you.

200
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,026
- He went to South America.
- Yeah!

201
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,436
So what?

202
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,673
- Who goes to South America?
- People go to South America.

203
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:13,141
Yeah, and they come back with
things taped to their large intestine.

204
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,775
So because of a few bad apples...

205
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,143
...you're gonna impugn
an entire continent?

206
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,217
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.

207
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,786
Well, I say we go and get
our money right now.

208
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,122
- Hey. Hey.
- Hello, Newman.

209
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,283
Hello, Jerry.

210
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,993
So any news?

211
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,323
Yeah, he skipped out
and... went to South America.

212
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,726
South America?!

213
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,164
What kind of snow blower
did you get us mixed up with?

214
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,437
Okay, gentlemen, the fact remains
you still have no proof.

215
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,905
This is all speculation and hearsay.

216
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,341
Wait. There's one way to find out.
We set up a sting.

217
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,777
You know, like Abscam.
Like Abscam, Jerry.

218
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,613
What are you gonna do?

219
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,187
You gonna put on phony beards
and dress up like Arab sheiks...

220
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,119
...and sit around
in some hotel room?

221
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,691
- I mean, come on.
- Wait a second.

222
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,022
Maybe there is a way to tempt him
and find out.

223
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:08,257
If we put our three heads together,
we should come up with something.

224
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,441
- What's today?
- It's Thursday.

225
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,012
Really?

226
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,274
Feels like Tuesday.

227
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,817
Tuesday has no feel.

228
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,147
Monday has a feel.

229
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,050
Friday has a feel.

230
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,451
Sunday has a feel.

231
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,458
- I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Shut up, the both of you.

232
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,959
You're making me nervous.

233
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,965
Where is he already? He should've
been out of work by now.

234
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,532
Hey, this is kind of fun.

235
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,398
Yeah. Maybe we ought to become
private detectives.

236
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,970
Yeah, maybe you should.

237
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,199
- Maybe I will.
- Yeah, me too.

238
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,440
All right, what are you
gonna say to him?

239
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,977
Just gonna find out
if he's interested.

240
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,774
Hey, maybe I should go in with him.

241
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,008
- No, you stay in the car.
- Who made you leader?

242
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,677
All right, Newman. One more peep
out of you, you're out of the operation.

243
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,948
There he is.
He's going into that bar.

244
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,822
All right...

245
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,723
- ...I'm going in.
- Be careful, Kramer.

246
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,400
I should've gone in with him.

247
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,630
No, you stay here in the car.
I may need you.

248
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,330
What do you need me
in the car for?

249
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,033
I might need you to get me a soda.

250
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,118
I'll have a brewski, Charlie.

251
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,154
The name's Mitch.

252
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,987
Well, there's nothing like a cold one
after a long day, huh?

253
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,992
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

254
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,257
Yeah, I've been known to drink
a beer or two.

255
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,799
But then again, I've been known
to do a lot of things.

256
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,982
- Cigarette?
- No, no. I never touch them.

257
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,612
Well...

258
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,880
...I suck them down like Coca-Cola.

259
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,019
Well...

260
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,127
...here's to feeling good
all the time, huh?

261
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,009
Looks like you got yourself
a little cold there, huh, fella?

262
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,209
- I don't think so.
- Me neither.

263
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,323
You should try this new
dental floss, Glide. It's fantastic.

264
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,726
- I use Dentotape.
- You should try this.

265
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,896
- I don't wanna.
- Not even once?

266
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,667
- No.
- You know, you're an idiot.

267
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,363
Why, because I use Dentotape?

268
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,203
Right. Anyone who uses Dentotape
is an idiot.

269
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,407
- South America, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

270
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,979
That's a burgeoning continent.

271
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,912
Well, they are expanding
their economic base, yeah.

272
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,381
Tell me about it.

273
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,787
Excuse me, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

274
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,445
I'm hip.

275
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,991
- Hip to what?
- To the whole scene.

276
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,057
- What scene?
- The bathroom scene.

277
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,495
Listen, don't take this personally,
but when I come back...

278
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,901
- ...I'm sitting over there.
- Whatever turns you on.

279
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,013
- No, no, I don't like it.
- What do you mean, you don't like it?

280
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,174
- How could you not like it?
- I like the thick tape.

281
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,471
Hey. What kind of nut are you?

282
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,784
So basically, George,
the job here is quite simple.

283
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,647
Selling bras.

284
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,653
That interests me very much,
Mr. Farkus. Very much indeed, sir.

285
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,814
Have you ever sold
a woman's line before?

286
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,085
No, but...

287
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,752
...I have a very good rapport
with women.

288
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,762
Very good. Comfortable.

289
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,131
And from the first time I laid eyes
on a brassiere...

290
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,931
...I was enthralled.

291
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,833
Tell me about it.

292
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,901
Well, I was 14 years old...

293
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,343
...I was in my friend's bathroom...

294
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,417
...his mother's brassiere
was hanging over the shower rod.

295
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,210
I picked it up.

296
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,252
I studied it.

297
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,215
I thought:

298
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,619
"I like this."

299
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,320
I didn't know in what way
or on what level, but I knew...

300
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,987
...I wanted to be around brassieres.

301
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,828
That's an incredible story.

302
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,299
You have a remarkable passion
for brassieres.

303
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,670
Well, they're more than just
underwear to me, Mr. Farkus.

304
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,974
Two cups in the front...

305
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,204
...two loops in the back...

306
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,573
...how do they do it?

307
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,014
Well, I think I can say...

308
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,210
...barring some
unforeseen incident...

309
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,686
...that you will have a very bright
future here at E.D. Granmont.

310
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,051
Thank you, Mr. Farkus.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

311
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,660
See you Monday, 9:00.

312
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,025
If you don't mind, sir...

313
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,859
...I'll be here at 8.

314
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,724
Excellent.

315
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,128
So long, Mr. Farkus.

316
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,914
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing. What?

317
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,574
Farkus, get out here.

318
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,111
Oh, yes, Ms. De Granmont?

319
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,550
Farkus...

320
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,918
...who is this perverted little weasel?

321
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,754
This is Costanza,
he's our new bra salesman.

322
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,793
He's supposed to start on Monday.

323
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,461
If he's here on Monday, you're not.

324
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,294
Take your pick.

325
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,727
Get out. I'm terribly sorry,
Ms. De Granmont.

326
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,038
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Lippman?

327
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,509
I was just going over
the Jake Jarmel book...

328
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,774
...and I understand you worked
with him very closely on this.

329
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,077
Yes- Yes, I did.

330
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,245
And anyway, I was just reading
your final edit...

331
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:43,055
...and there seems to be an inordinate
number of exclamation points.

332
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:49,765
Well, I-I felt that the writing lacked
a certain emotion and intensity.

333
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,266
You know, it's...

334
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:56,739
"It was a damp and chilly afternoon,
so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"

335
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,570
Right. Well-

336
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,939
You put an exclamation point
after " sweatshirt."

337
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:05,482
That's correct. I felt that the character
doesn't like to be chilly.

338
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,879
I see.

339
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,510
"I pulled the lever on the machine,
but the Clark bar didn't come out!"

340
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,153
- Again, exclamation point.
- Yeah.

341
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,316
Well, you know how frustrating
that can be...

342
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,327
...when you keep putting quarters
and quarters into a machine...

343
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,933
- ...and... nothing comes out.
- Get rid of the exclamation points.

344
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,966
- Okay, I will.
- I hate exclamation points.

345
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,660
Okay.

346
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,706
Just- I'll-

347
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,736
"Dear Barry, consider this letter...

348
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,777
...the termination of our relationship,
effective immediately."

349
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,812
- Exclamation point.
- Right.

350
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,812
You still have no proof.

351
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,112
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy
around me.

352
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,949
"I will expect all funds in the form
of a cashier's check...

353
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,614
...no later than the 18th."

354
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,192
Double exclamation point.

355
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,690
- Will that take care of ours too?
- Yep.

356
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,196
I'll give you yours as soon as
I get my money back.

357
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,061
Want me to mail it?
I'm on my way out.

358
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,636
- Yeah, thanks.
- All right. Be my pleasure.

359
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,709
See you later.

360
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,377
You know, this is-

361
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,574
- Hey, Ralph.
- What's up, fellas?

362
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,650
- That'll be 14.30.
- All right.

363
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,515
- Mushrooms? You got mushrooms.
- Yeah.

364
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,289
- What's the matter, you got a cold?
- No, man.

365
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,984
- Kramer, what is this?
- It's a sweater.

366
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,926
- What is it made out of?
- I don't know. Jerry gave it to me.

367
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,566
- It's mohair, I think.
- Mohair. That figures.

368
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,361
I'm allergic to mohair.

369
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,902
- You mean, you just started sniffing?
- Yeah.

370
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,698
Mohair does it to me every time.

371
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,443
I was wearing that sweater in the
coffee shop when Barry came in.

372
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,570
- Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
- The sweater made him sniff.

373
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,240
See? I told you he wasn't
a drug addict.

374
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,646
Oh, no, the letter.

375
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,118
Newman- It's got
exclamation points all over it.

376
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,191
Not to mention the picture of him
on the toilet.

377
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,694
The what?

378
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,539
- After you.
- Thank you.

379
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,543
Get your hands off of me!

380
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,544
Johnny! Johnny!

381
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,821
What do you mean,
you felt her material?

382
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,550
What? With your fingers, like this?

383
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,957
So what? What's so bad about that?

384
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,791
Who goes around
feeling people's material?

385
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,458
What can be gained
by feeling a person's material?

386
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,967
It's insanity.

387
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,901
Whatever happened to, "My,
that's a lovely dress you have on.

388
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,336
May I have this dance?"

389
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,117
You know, you are really lucky
Newman never mailed that letter.

390
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,945
Sorry I'm late. I just came from
a meeting with my lawyer.

391
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,680
- Hey.
- What is this?

392
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,623
It's a letter from your friend
Barry Prophet's lawyer.

393
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,587
He's filing Chapter 11?

394
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,857
What's going on?
Why is he filing Chapter 11?

395
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,364
Bankruptcy.

396
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,526
Bankruptcy. As in, "I've taken
your money and spent it on drugs."

397
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,303
What? I thought it was the sweater.

398
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,499
- What about the money?
- What about the money?

399
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,735
If I had dissolved my relationship
with him...

400
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,937
...prior to his filing Chapter 11,
I could've got the money back.

401
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,343
Which I would've done...

402
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,509
...if a certain imbecile had been able
to get to a mailbox and mail a letter.

403
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,327
Pair of bear claws, please.

404
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,458
Nice.

405
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,536
- Think so?
- Yeah, what is it?

406
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,839
Half silk, half cotton, half linen.

407
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,237
How can you go wrong?

408
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,044
My accountant actually did...

409
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,487
...take a big chunk of money from me
and use it to buy drugs.

410
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,389
The thing that was hardest for me
to comprehend about this...

411
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:15,056
...is the life choice of drug abuse
and accounting.

412
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,863
It makes sense. Why would
an athlete or musician take drugs?

413
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,402
They have an interesting job.

414
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:24,201
But an accountant? If ever a job
required hallucinogenic support...

415
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,105
...this is the job.

416
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,576
That should be the legal defense.

417
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,443
"You're charged with
possession of illegal narcotics."

418
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,551
"But, Your Honor,
I'm an accountant."

419
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,515
Bang. "Case closed.

420
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,180
Bailiff, give this man his peyote
and tequila back for the drive home.

421
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,793
Sorry to bother you, sir.
Terribly sorry."
