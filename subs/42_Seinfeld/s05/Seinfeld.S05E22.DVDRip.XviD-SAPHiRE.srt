1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,997
It's hard to justify,
at this point in history...

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,402
...the existence of men
and their handkerchiefs.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,339
I mean, they open it up,
blow their nose in it...

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,378
...then put it in their pocket
with their other valuables.

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,539
Wallet, keys, mucous.
Yup, got everything.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,513
Is it because men can't give birth...

7
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,281
...are they just proud of anything
that comes out of us?

8
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,624
We'll actually have a monogram
sewn onto it.

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,194
What is the source of pride here?

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,524
It sticks out of our breast pocket
of our jacket.

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,792
I have a snot rag.

12
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,715
- To your promotion.
- Oh, thank you.

13
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,146
Thank you, Mr. Lippman.
I can't tell you...

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,915
...how much I appreciate this.
I mean, of course, I deserve it.

15
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,783
Well, you're really on your way now.

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,397
You should do something
about that cold.

17
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,369
- You got a raise?
- I don't fool around, baby.

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,737
You said Pendant
was in financial trouble.

19
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,001
But they're being
absorbed by Matsushimi...

20
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,735
...that big Japanese conglomerate.

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,244
- When did that happen?
- Papers are signed next week.

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,848
Are they publishing
Kramer's coffee table book?

23
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,951
Yeah. They'll definitely do it now.

24
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,117
You're on quite a streak.
Job promotion.

25
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,257
- Plus you're back with Jake Jarmel.
- Yeah, it's getting serious.

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,289
We're talking about
moving in together.

27
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,524
You've got it all.
Helen Gurley Brown...

28
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,185
...would be very proud of you.

29
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,931
Speaking of having it all...

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,326
Where were you?

31
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,437
I went to the beach.

32
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,697
The beach.

33
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,666
It's not working, Jerry.

34
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,938
- It's just not working.
- What is it that isn't working?

35
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,880
Why did it all turn out
like this for me?

36
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,142
I had so much promise.

37
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,582
I was personable. I was bright.

38
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,120
Maybe not academically speaking,
but...

39
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,457
I was perceptive.

40
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,324
I always know when someone's
uncomfortable at a party.

41
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,226
- Got a napkin?
- It all became very clear to me...

42
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,925
...sitting out there today that...

43
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:21,904
...every decision I've ever made
in my entire life has been wrong.

44
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:26,176
My life is the complete opposite
of everything I want it to be.

45
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,143
Every instinct I have
in every aspect of life...

46
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,045
...be it something to wear,
something to eat...

47
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,482
...it's all been wrong. Every one.

48
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,246
Tuna on toast, coleslaw...

49
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,253
- ...cup of coffee.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,587
No, no, wait a minute.
I always have tuna on toast.

51
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,787
Nothing's ever worked out for me
with tuna on toast.

52
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,526
I want the complete opposite
of tuna on toast.

53
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,769
Chicken salad on rye...

54
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,839
...untoasted with a side
of potato salad...

55
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,702
...and a cup of tea.

56
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,771
Well, there's no telling
what can happen from this.

57
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,883
Chicken salad
is not the opposite of tuna.

58
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,383
Salmon's the opposite of tuna
because salmon swim...

59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,149
...against the current,
and the tuna swim with it.

60
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,360
Good for the tuna.

61
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,894
George, you know that woman
just looked at you.

62
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,765
So what?
What am I supposed to do?

63
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,597
Go talk to her.

64
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,639
Elaine, bald men with no jobs
and no money...

65
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,935
...who live with their parents...

66
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,910
...don't approach strange women.

67
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,314
Try the opposite.
Instead of tuna salad...

68
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,815
...and being intimidated by women,
chicken salad...

69
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,513
- ...and going right up to them.
- Yeah, I should do the opposite.

70
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,658
If every instinct you have is wrong...

71
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,726
...then the opposite
would have to be right.

72
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,955
Yes.

73
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,123
I will do the opposite.

74
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,498
I used to sit here and do nothing
and regret it for the rest of the day.

75
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,139
So now I will do the opposite,
and I will do something.

76
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,951
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice that...

77
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,144
- ...you were looking in my direction.
- Oh, yes, I was.

78
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,755
You just ordered
the same exact lunch as me.

79
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,120
My name is George.

80
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,491
I'm unemployed,
and I live with my parents.

81
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,935
I'm Victoria. Hi.

82
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,737
Are you kidding? They can't cancel
that show on me now.

83
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,573
It's too late for me to book
anything else for that weekend.

84
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,182
All right, all right. Okay, bye.

85
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,444
Hey. Buddy, it's all happening.

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,451
- What's happening?
- The coffee table book.

87
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,613
It's a go.

88
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,484
- I heard all about it.
- Know what this means?

89
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,891
I'm starting the book tour.

90
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,032
<i>First stop, Regis and Kathie Lee.</i>

91
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,128
<i>You're going
on Regis and Kathie Lee?</i>

92
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,895
Oh, you better believe it.

93
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,539
- I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
- No, no. That's not-

94
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,632
What are you gonna talk about?

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,471
Coffee tables.

96
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,115
Hello.

97
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,717
What? Sure. I'll do it.

98
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,945
I just had something canceled
the same weekend.

99
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,850
Okay. Great. Bye.

100
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,823
Life is amazing. I just lost a job,
and five minutes later...

101
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,155
...get another job,
same weekend, same money.

102
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,561
You know who you are?
Even Steven.

103
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,333
Are you growing a beard?

104
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,999
Why shave every day?
Just grows right back.

105
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,772
I guess.

106
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,344
I'm afraid I'm just not interested
in how I present myself.

107
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,175
If those kind of superficialities
are important to you...

108
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,341
...this probably isn't gonna work.

109
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,712
Hey, watch it. They cut you off.
Did you see that?

110
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,385
Take it easy.

111
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,855
Take it easy.

112
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,753
It's not the end of the world.

113
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,426
Hey, baby, how about
a little tongue action, huh?

114
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,692
Stick your tongue down his throat.

115
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,532
What are we gonna do?
Should we just move?

116
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,074
That won't be necessary.

117
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,241
Shut your traps
and stop kicking the seats!

118
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,475
We're trying to watch the movie!

119
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,176
If I have to tell you again,
I'll show you...

120
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,788
...what it's like.
You understand me?

121
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,187
Now shut your mouths,
or I'll shut them for you.

122
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,520
If you think I'm kidding, just try me.

123
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,957
Try me.

124
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,496
Because I would love it!

125
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,809
Are you sure you don't wanna
come up? It's only 9:30.

126
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,737
I don't think we should.

127
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,480
We really don't know
each other very well.

128
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,144
Who are you, George Costanza?

129
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,620
I'm the opposite of every guy
you've ever met.

130
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,754
- Excuse me. Is your name Elaine?
- Yes.

131
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,554
Were you supposed
to meet a Jake Jarmel here?

132
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,032
- Yeah.
- I'm afraid he's been in an accident.

133
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,434
- An accident? What happened?
- He got sideswiped by a cab...

134
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,667
...but he's all right.
He's in St. Vincent Hospital, room 907.

135
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,239
Okay, thank you.

136
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,745
Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?

137
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,382
Here you go.

138
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,316
So, you know,
the light was clearly green.

139
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,486
I started walking, he skidded,
and went right into my hip.

140
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,456
That is so terrible.

141
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,330
It's so terrible, Jake.
I mean, how can people be so stupid?

142
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,028
It's just sickening.

143
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,969
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

144
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,713
So when do you think
you're gonna get out of here?

145
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,749
- Where did you get those?
- At the movies.

146
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,182
Didn't you get the message
before you went in?

147
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,719
Yeah.

148
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,622
- Then when did you get those?
- Right after that.

149
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,560
So you heard that
I was in a car accident...

150
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,325
...and then decided to stop off
for some Jujyfruit?

151
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,201
Well...

152
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,335
...the counter was right there and-

153
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,274
I'd think, under the circumstances,
you would've run out of the building.

154
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,436
Apparently, it didn't
have any effect on you.

155
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,946
- No, no. It did.
- If you got into a car accident...

156
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,574
...I can guarantee you
I wouldn't stop for Jujyfruits.

157
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,017
- But, Jake-
- I would like to be alone now, please.

158
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,086
- But, Jake, I didn't -
- Good night.

159
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,655
- What do you say we call it a night?
- Good idea. I'm kind of tired.

160
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,061
- How'd you do?
- Won 50.

161
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,701
- Lost 72.
- Won 37.

162
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,702
- Lost 15.
- Broke even.

163
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,166
- Can I bring out our next guest now?
- Please.

164
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,742
Young guy, got a new book
coming out, and it's about-

165
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,075
And this is the best part.
It's a coffee table book...

166
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,808
- ...about coffee tables.
- Is that clever?

167
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,413
I think that is so clever.

168
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,952
I think so too.

169
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,714
- Did you meet him backstage?
- I did.

170
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,517
He looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?

171
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,592
- I love his hair.
- Oh, I do too.

172
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,558
This guy could be a little bonkos.

173
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,256
Anyway, if you will,
would you please welcome Kramer.

174
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,629
- Hey.
- How are you?

175
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,138
Look, Kramer's here.

176
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,277
- Hi.
- Hello.

177
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,185
I don't know. It's the hair
or something. I don't know.

178
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,219
Yes. Kramer.

179
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,789
So a coffee table book
about coffee tables.

180
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,894
- Where'd you get this idea?
- Well, I'll tell you, Regis.

181
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,428
Actually, this is a true story.

182
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,294
- I was skiing at the time.
- When I'm skiing, Kramer...

183
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,935
...I'm trying not to kill myself.
You're writing books.

184
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,306
You kids, don't go out and try that.

185
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,474
You stay in school.

186
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,239
Have you always been interested
in coffee tables?

187
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,972
Really, I love coffee tables,
and I thought I was the only one.

188
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,447
See, the beauty of my book is,
if you don't have a coffee table...

189
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,554
...it turns into a coffee table.

190
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,926
- Is that fabulous?
- Look at this.

191
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,663
Is that fabulous?

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,825
- Fabulous.
- I want one of those.

193
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,403
Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?

194
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,608
This coffee table is full of pictures
of celebrities' coffee tables.

195
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,039
- That's right.
- I'm not in there. Where's mine?

196
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,180
It's on file right here.

197
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,811
I'm telling you, this guy's bonkos.
He really is.

198
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,885
- But he's adorable.
- Yes he is. He's a nice-looking guy.

199
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,989
All over my Kathie Lee Casuals.

200
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,390
We'll be right back in a moment.

201
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,862
- So it's over?
- Yeah.

202
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,334
- It got pretty nasty.
- What did you go back for, Jujyfruit?

203
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,000
It's not like I went across the street.
I bought them and got in a cab.

204
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,804
Why didn't you eat it in the cab?

205
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,743
Because I got popcorn too.
I ate that first.

206
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,449
- What is all this?
- I played cards last night.

207
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,087
- Yeah? How'd you do?
- Broke even.

208
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,850
- You always break even.
- Like yesterday, I lost a job...

209
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,356
...and then I got another one.

210
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,018
Then I missed a TV show,
and later on they reran it.

211
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,630
Today I missed a train,
went outside and caught a bus.

212
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,733
It never fails. I always even out.

213
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,697
- Give me 20 bucks.
- What for?

214
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,497
Just give me 20 bucks.

215
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,819
What the hell was that?

216
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,720
Let's see if you get
the 20 bucks back.

217
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,649
You could've thrown a pencil
out the window...

218
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,317
...and seen if that comes back.

219
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,027
Things were going so good for me.
I got the job promotion.

220
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,828
We were talking about
moving in together.

221
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,027
Maybe next time
someone's in a car accident...

222
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,605
...you won't stop off for candy first.

223
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,801
Hey, I just found $20.

224
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,943
I tell you this,
something is happening in my life.

225
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,811
I did this opposite thing last night.

226
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,952
Up was down, black was white,
good was-

227
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,348
- Bad?
- Day was-

228
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,886
- Night.
- Yes.

229
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,487
- So you did the opposite of everything.
- Yes.

230
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,095
And listen to this.
Her uncle works for the Yankees...

231
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,924
...and is getting me a job interview.

232
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,429
A front office kind of thing.
Assistant to the traveling secretary.

233
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,934
A job with the New York Yankees!

234
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,834
This has been the dream of my life
ever since I was a child.

235
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,407
It's all happening
because I'm completely ignoring...

236
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,637
...every urge towards common sense
and good judgment I've ever had.

237
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,011
This is no longer just some
crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry...

238
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,579
...this is my religion.

239
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:12,821
Well, I guess your messiah
would be the Antichrist.

240
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,860
That's funny. Come on. Let's go.

241
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,559
Elaine. Look, a 20.

242
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,293
Oh, my God.

243
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,640
- Hey, boss.
- Kramer, come in.

244
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,278
How you doing there, big guy?

245
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,011
- Hey. Yeah. Have a seat.
- Alrighty.

246
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,015
You got yourself a cold?

247
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,349
Well, that's quite a honk.

248
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,653
- Thank you.
- Get yourself some vitamin C...

249
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,958
...with rose hips and bioflavonoids.

250
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,903
The reason I asked you in here
is I caught your appearance...

251
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,870
<i>- ... on Regis and Kathie Lee.
- It was pretty good.</i>

252
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,174
And anyway...

253
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,644
...the thinking here
is that it would be best...

254
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,182
...if you didn't do any more
of these shows.

255
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,843
- Because of the coffee thing?
- Kramer, I'm sorry.

256
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,512
<i>What about Sonya Live?
You're not canceling Sonya Live.</i>

257
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,421
- It's out-
- She's a doctor. I got a thing for her.

258
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,870
Why don't you tell me about some
of your previous work experience.

259
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,662
Alrighty.

260
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,674
My last job was in publishing.

261
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:41,142
I got fired for having sex in my office
with the cleaning woman.

262
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,643
- Go on.
- All right. Well, before that...

263
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,912
...I was in real estate.
I quit because my boss...

264
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,421
...wouldn't let me use
his private bathroom. That was a-

265
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,218
Do you talk to everybody like this?

266
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,595
- Of course.
- My niece told me you were different.

267
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,792
I am different, yeah.

268
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,433
I gotta tell you,
you are the complete opposite...

269
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,398
...of every applicant we've seen.

270
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,933
Mr. Steinbrenner, sir.

271
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,938
There's someone
here I'd like you to meet.

272
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,270
This is Mr. Costanza.
He's one of the applicants.

273
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,603
Nice to meet you.

274
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:20,616
Well, I wish I could say the same,
but I must say, with all due respect...

275
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,085
...I find it hard to see the logic
behind some of the moves...

276
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,417
...you have made
with this fine organization.

277
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,689
In the past 20 years, you have caused
myself and the city of New York...

278
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,798
...a good deal of distress,
as we have watched you...

279
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,434
...take our beloved Yankees
and reduce them...

280
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,571
...to a laughingstock,
all for the glorification...

281
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,706
...of your massive ego.

282
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,305
Hire this man.

283
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,272
- Tina Robbins is here to see you.
- Who's that?

284
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,112
My ex-roommate.
She moved out four years ago.

285
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,151
I've been subletting
my apartment from her.

286
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,550
- See you.
- Yeah.

287
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,021
- Hey.
- Please.

288
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,917
- Hi, Tina.
- Hi, Elaine.

289
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,290
So I haven't seen you in a while.

290
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,192
Elaine, we have a problem.

291
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,301
- Well, what is it?
- You're getting kicked out.

292
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,802
Kicked out? Why?

293
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,067
- There's been a number of complaints.
- Yeah? Like what?

294
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,870
Well, like last Thanksgiving
you buzzed up a jewel thief.

295
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,474
I didn't know who he was.

296
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,139
That's why there's a buzzer.

297
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,483
- What else?
- Apparently, the week after that...

298
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,588
...you buzzed up
some Jehovah's Witnesses...

299
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,280
...and they couldn't get them out.

300
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,222
- What else you got?
- Well, let's see.

301
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,394
I'll tell you what the big advantage
of homosexuality is.

302
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,125
If you're going out
with someone your size...

303
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,067
...right there,
you double your wardrobe.

304
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,403
- I suppose.
- Oh, come on.

305
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,136
That's a huge feature.
When they approach a new recruit...

306
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,145
...I'm sure that's one
of the big selling points.

307
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,348
- Jerry.
- Yes.

308
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,615
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

309
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,191
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

310
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,218
That's okay.

311
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,956
- What?
- It's fine. No problem.

312
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,464
- I'll meet somebody else.
- You will?

313
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:19,035
Sure. See, things always
even out for me.

314
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,808
It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice
dating you for a while...

315
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:28,375
- ...and good luck.
- Yeah, you too.

316
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:38,155
- The New York Yankees?
- The New York Yankees.

317
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,924
Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle...

318
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,062
...Costanza?

319
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,189
I'm the assistant
to the traveling secretary.

320
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,858
I'm going on the road trips.
I'll be on the plane.

321
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,005
I'm working in Yankee Stadium.
This is a dream. I'm busting.

322
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,664
- Jerry, I'm busting.
- I can't believe it.

323
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,070
Yeah.

324
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,505
<i>- Yeah?
- It's me.</i>

325
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,669
- Come on up.
- I'm out of my parent's house.

326
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,747
I'm taking that apartment
on 86th Street.

327
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,010
- That's a great place.
- I'm back in business, baby.

328
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,649
Don't get too excited
about this stuff.

329
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,689
You know, things have
a way of evening out.

330
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,450
Hey!

331
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,921
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hi.

332
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,596
How are things going?

333
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,527
You wanna know
how things are going?

334
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,259
I'll tell you how things are going.
I am getting kicked...

335
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,302
- ...out of my apartment.
- Why are they doing that?

336
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,804
I don't know.
They have a list of grievances.

337
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,632
- The jewel thief?
- Yeah, the jewel thief.

338
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,869
- What else?
- I put Canadian quarters...

339
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,070
...in the washing machine.

340
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,907
I gotta be out
by the end of the month.

341
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,817
Well, you could move in
with my parents.

342
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,490
Was that the opposite
of what you were going to say...

343
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:55,360
...or was that just
your natural instinct?

344
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,835
Instinct.

345
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,429
Stick with the opposite.

346
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,003
Elaine, don't get too down.
Everything will even out.

347
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,807
See, I have two friends.

348
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,041
You were up, he was down.

349
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,708
Now he's up, you're down.

350
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,878
See how it all evens out for me?

351
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,527
Mr. Lippman, the people
from Matsushimi are here.

352
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,892
All right. Tell them I'll be right there.

353
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,794
Oh, man.

354
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,491
Well, this is it, Elaine.

355
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,603
You know, without this merger,
we'd be out on the street.

356
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,009
Boy, they sure saved us.

357
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,446
Mr. Lippman, you forgot
your handkerchief.

358
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,740
Mr. Lippman.

359
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,015
You forgot your handkerchief.
It's on my desk.

360
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,997
Lippman-san.

361
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,365
Lippman-san.

362
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,507
Mr. Lippman, it is with great pride
that we undertake this partnership...

363
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,577
- ...with your company.
- I'm sorry.

364
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,942
I can't shake your hand right now.
Germs.

365
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,212
No, I-

366
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,994
- Is that the end of it?
- It's the last one.

367
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,222
I can't believe you're moving out.

368
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,658
Kramer, is this true?

369
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,233
Is it really happening?

370
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,302
It's like a dream.

371
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,998
- Oh, it's true.
- All right, let's go.

372
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,574
Don't get in trouble
with the Yankees.

373
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,439
You be nice.

374
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,340
I'm not gonna be nice.
That's how I got the job.

375
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,781
- Jerry, did you hear this?
- He knows what he's doing.

376
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,388
I just want the both of you to know...

377
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,525
...how much you mean to me...

378
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,923
...and I love you both
very, very much.

379
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,257
Opposite.

380
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,699
I must've had eight in my mouth.

381
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,963
I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk.

382
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,164
Why'd you have to eat so many?

383
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,208
Because they're Jujyfruit.
I like them.

384
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,409
I didn't know it would start
a chain reaction...

385
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,676
...that would lead to the end
of Pendant Publishing.

386
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,187
Not to mention the end
of Kramer's book.

387
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,585
You knew he had a cold. How did you
expect him to blow his nose?

388
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,360
Do you know what's going on here?

389
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,961
Can't you see what's happened?

390
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,489
I've become George.

391
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,057
Don't say that.

392
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,499
It's true. I'm George.

393
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,195
I'm George.

394
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,834
Greetings, people. Greetings.

395
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,136
Greetings and salutations.

396
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,375
What a beautiful day
for a ball game.

397
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,641
Let's play two.

398
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,512
I'll have the chicken salad
on rye, my usual.

399
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,483
You know what I get, darling.

400
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,225
So I had a little conversation today
with Mr. Don Mattingly.

401
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,122
He's the first baseman.

402
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,293
We talked about his new batting
stance. I'm not crazy about it.

403
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,730
But I said, "Donnie, go with it
till it stops working."

404
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,699
Donnie Baseball.
He's a hell of a guy.

405
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,671
Wait, wait. That's too much.
Mine was more than yours.

406
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,499
Let's call it even.

407
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,516
Coffee is a drink that encourages
a lot of accessories around it.

408
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,751
Coffee cake, coffee table,
coffee table book, klatches of people.

409
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,359
Say what you want about alcohol,
but not only aren't there...

410
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,467
...a lot of optional accessories,
alcohol actually helps you...

411
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,230
...get rid of things.
Family, home, job, driver's license.

412
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,839
The only thing you
have to remember to get...

413
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,566
...is more alcohol.

414
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,212
And maybe a rag
for your squeegee.
