1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,334
How about the seedless
watermelon? What an invention.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,131
Scientists are working on this.

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,403
Other scientists devote their lives
to fighting cancer, AIDS.

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,205
These guys go,
"No, I'm focusing on melon.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,712
Oh, sure, thousands of people
are dying needlessly...

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,646
...but this, that's gotta stop.

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:24,421
You ever try and pick a wet one up
off the floor? It's almost impossible.

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,752
I'm devoting my life to that."

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,153
So I guess if they can get rid
of the seeds, the rind is going next.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,595
What do we need that for?
They're not gonna stop...

11
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,962
...until they're making
ready-to-eat fruit cups...

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,127
...growing right out of the ground.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,010
- So, what's her name?
- Karen.

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,476
- She nice?
- Great.

15
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,205
- So you like her?
- I think so.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,847
You don't know?

17
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,316
I can't tell anymore.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,554
- Well, do you feel anything?
- Feel? What's that?

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,328
Let me ask you this. When she
comes over, you cleaning up a lot?

20
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,156
- Yeah.
- Straightening up or cleaning?

21
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,661
- Cleaning.
- You do the tub?

22
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,027
- Yeah.
- On your knees, Ajax...

23
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,396
- ...hands, scrubbing, the whole deal?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,663
Okay. I think you're in love.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
- Tub is love?
- Tub is love.

26
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,174
You got a nice girl
and a clean apartment.

27
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,973
Yep.

28
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,173
Just one little problem.

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,176
- Sexual?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,083
Well...

31
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,893
...I've never really felt confident...

32
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,826
...in one particular aspect.

33
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,439
- Below the equator?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,039
Nobody does.

35
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,842
You know, nobody knows
what to do.

36
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,213
You just close your eyes,
you hope for the best.

37
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,946
I really think they're happy
if you just make an effort.

38
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,860
I don't know.

39
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,620
Last time I got the tap.

40
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,962
You got the tap?

41
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,759
You're going along,
you think everything's all right...

42
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,270
...and all of a sudden
you get that tap.

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,608
It's like, " All right, that's enough.
You're through."

44
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,212
Yeah.

45
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,341
- The tap is tough.
- It's like the manager coming out...

46
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,146
- ...and asking you for the ball.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,946
Maybe she wanted to move on
to other business.

48
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,182
No, no, this wasn't moving on.

49
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,990
I got the hook.

50
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,187
I wish I could get a lesson in that.

51
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,589
It's a very complicated area.

52
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,200
You could go crazy trying
to figure that place out.

53
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,161
It's a hazy mystery.

54
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,272
Anyway, I think everything else
is okay...

55
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,172
...unless, of course, she's faking.

56
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,834
- Who's faking?
- Nothing.

57
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,776
- Faking what?
- Nobody's faking.

58
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,709
- Orgasms?
- She's not faking.

59
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,115
- How do you know?
- I know. I can tell.

60
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,348
It's one of my powers.

61
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,424
Why? Did you ever fake?

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,227
- Of course.
- Really?

63
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,088
- You've faked?
- On occasion.

64
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,391
- And the guy never knows?
- No.

65
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,535
How can he not know that?

66
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,136
Because I was good.

67
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,568
I guess after that many beers,
he's probably a little groggy anyway.

68
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,938
Well, you didn't know.

69
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,779
What's that?

70
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,477
You didn't know.

71
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:45,722
- Are you saying-?
- I think I'll have a piece of cake.

72
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,382
- With me?
- Well...

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,460
- You faked with me?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,153
- You faked with me?
- Yes.

75
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,629
- No. You faked it?
- Yes. I faked it.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,462
That whole thing, the whole
production, it was all an act?

77
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,300
Not bad, huh?

78
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,441
What about the breathing, the panting,
the moaning, the screaming?

79
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,237
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

80
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,908
I'm stunned. I'm shocked.

81
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,513
How many times did you do this?

82
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,919
- All the time.
- All the time?

83
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,912
I think I'll have
a chocolate malted here.

84
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,249
But I'm so good.

85
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,757
I'm sure you are.

86
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,164
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you.
I just didn't have them back then.

87
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,333
She faked.

88
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,472
- Maybe they've all been faking.
- I'm sure they're not.

89
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,642
Maybe Karen is faking.

90
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,239
- She was probably joking.
- No, no. It was no joke.

91
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,612
- She didn't have any?
- No, none.

92
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,949
- She faked them all?
- Faked them all.

93
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,221
Well, so she faked them. So what?

94
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,522
The woman had an orgasm
under false pretenses.

95
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,188
That's sexual perjury.

96
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,863
You know, I heard her screaming
from my apartment.

97
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,136
She woke me up a few times.

98
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,139
How did she do it?
She's like Meryl Streep, this woman.

99
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,936
And I know how to work
the equipment.

100
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,737
I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union.

101
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,642
I mean, if she'd told me,
maybe I could have done something.

102
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,874
Yeah, I could've helped you out.

103
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,753
- What could you have done?
- I could've given you some pointers.

104
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,984
I know how to press those buttons,
buddy.

105
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,532
Well, I'm feeling very inadequate
about the whole thing. Don't:

106
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm supposed to do something with
her later. I don't even wanna see her.

107
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,841
Hello?

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,704
Oh, hello, Elaine.

109
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,742
So we having dinner tonight?

110
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,108
I don't know.
I'm not really in the mood.

111
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,681
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

112
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,247
You're not still thinking
about earlier, are you?

113
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,388
What, the grilled cheese?
No, they always burn the toast.

114
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,057
No, the other thing.

115
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,853
Oh, that. Well...

116
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,259
Oh, come on, Jerry. You're making
too much of a big deal about it.

117
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,366
<i>- I guess. So you wanna meet at 7:30?
- Okay.</i>

118
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,697
- All right. Bye.
- All right, see you later. Bye.

119
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,332
Renee, can you
come here a second?

120
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,407
Let me ask you something.

121
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,401
Have you ever, you know...

122
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,747
- ...faked it?
- Yeah, sometimes.

123
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,646
- Really, like when?
- If we went to a Broadway show...

124
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,448
- ...if we had really good seats.
- Yeah, well...

125
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,154
You know, if it's enough already,
and I just wanna get some sleep.

126
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,071
- I really don't feel like seeing her.
- You know, I faked it.

127
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,013
- What?
- Yeah.

128
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,671
- You faked it?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,942
- Why would you do that?
- Well, you know...

130
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,679
...if it's enough already,
and I just wanna get some sleep.

131
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,318
Yeah, but why would you-?

132
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,265
- Bad peach?
- It's terrible!

133
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,333
- Did you get that at Joe's?
- Of course I got it at Joe's.

134
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,474
Surprising.
His fruit's usually the best.

135
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,440
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna return this.

136
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,480
- You're returning used fruit?
- Jerry, this peach is subpar.

137
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,214
- So, what do you want me to do?
- I want restitution.

138
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,256
Restitution? You want restitution?

139
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,620
- Why should I give you restitution?
- It's no good.

140
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,627
- Once I put it out, it ends for me.
- It's still your fruit.

141
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,493
- You gotta stand behind your fruit.
- I stand behind my fruit.

142
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,225
- So?
- Hey, you got a bad peach...

143
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,860
...that's an act of God. He makes
the peaches. I sell the peaches.

144
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,597
You got a problem, you talk to him.

145
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,242
You know, this whole place
is going... downhill.

146
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,470
I could've come in here last week
with a bad plum, but I let it go.

147
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,479
Take your business elsewhere.
I don't want your business.

148
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,480
- Now you don't want my business?
- I don't.

149
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,178
And at this moment, you're banned
from this store. You're banned!

150
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,323
But what am I gonna do for fruit?

151
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,916
You seem like you really enjoyed
your risotto.

152
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,916
You have a very contented air
over there.

153
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,955
You look very contented,
very satisfied.

154
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,217
- Are you satisfied?
- I'm very satisfied.

155
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,525
I'm sure if you weren't satisfied, you
would say something, wouldn't you?

156
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,065
- I probably would.
- Sure.

157
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,396
But then again, I'm an enigma.

158
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,635
Hey, listen, instead of the movie...

159
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,780
...maybe we'll go back and...

160
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,779
...you know...

161
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,218
Maybe.

162
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,050
So...

163
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,391
...you feel okay
about that whole thing...

164
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,055
...what we do in there.

165
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,599
You're generally okay
with everything in there?

166
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,694
Generally.

167
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,273
Do you feel the way you feel
after the risotto?

168
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,072
Well, no. I feel full after the risotto.

169
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,409
Yeah.

170
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,987
Oh, God.

171
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,528
Satisfied?

172
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,934
Hey, you know what? You wanna go
see that new Meryl Streep movie?

173
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,606
- Meryl Streep?
- You don't like her?

174
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,869
She's okay.

175
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,606
God, I love her, Jerry.
She's so authentic.

176
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,377
You believe everything is actually
happening to her. No acting there.

177
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,182
- Yeah. You don't want coffee, do you?
- I really admire actors, you know.

178
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,292
It's just such an incredible skill
to pull that off.

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,121
Yeah, yeah. Can we get off of this?

180
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,054
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

181
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,924
You're not still thinking
about that, are you?

182
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,570
- No, no.
- Oh, good.

183
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,097
Give me another shot.

184
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,816
- What?
- Another shot. I want another shot.

185
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,646
- You mean...?
- Yes.

186
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,880
- Oh, no. I don't think so.
- Come on.

187
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,321
One shot. I could do it.
I know I could do it.

188
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,031
Jerry, we're friends. We can't do that.
It would ruin our friendship.

189
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,099
Oh, friendship.
Friendship, schmiendship.

190
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:13,163
- No, that's important to me.
- We won't ruin the friendship.

191
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,330
- Yes, we will.
- Elaine.

192
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,408
No, Jerry, it is out of the question.

193
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,170
You know what sex does
to a friendship. It kills it.

194
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,541
Half-hour. Give me a half-hour.

195
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,148
- No.
- Okay, 15 minutes.

196
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,682
I guarantee you, 15 minutes,
I can make it happen.

197
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,616
No.

198
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,815
You're worried I'll be able to do it,
aren't you?

199
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,418
No, it doesn't matter.
Jerry, I don't care.

200
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,257
No, that's it. That's it.
You like having this over me.

201
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,697
- You don't want me to do it.
- That is so ridiculous.

202
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,335
- Come on, Elaine!
- No.

203
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,869
- Elaine.
- No!

204
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,063
- It's Jerry's fault.
- Jerry?

205
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,759
Jerry and Elaine.
They made me nuts.

206
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,396
Oh, I don't care, George.
Really, it's all right.

207
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,405
So you feel okay?

208
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,535
Well, it's not like after the risotto.

209
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,578
Well, good night.

210
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,614
I still don't understand why we
had to walk out on that movie.

211
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,953
Oh, that Meryl Streep,
she's such a phony baloney.

212
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,361
Good night.
Thanks for a really fabulous evening.

213
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,966
- Oh, what, you're upset?
- Yes, I'm upset. Can't you tell?

214
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,034
No, I can't. Maybe you're faking.

215
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,634
I'm really, really sorry
I told you that.

216
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,275
- I'm sorry too.
- Well, stop being such a baby.

217
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,469
- You're a baby!
- You're a baby!

218
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,442
It's all your fault.

219
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,919
You and Elaine, all that orgasm talk.

220
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,617
She did have an orgasm, she didn't.
Orgasm this, orgasm that.

221
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,318
I got so focused on it.

222
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,760
I started to panic and... I lost it.

223
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,059
I tried everything.
I was talking to him.

224
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,395
"Please wake up. Do something."

225
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,395
They're mysterious little fellows,
aren't they?

226
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,336
I hate him.

227
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,536
You know, it happens to everybody.
Happened to Houdini.

228
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,408
And he could get out of a trunk
with his hands in chains.

229
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,675
But he had a problem with that.

230
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,343
- The miracle is that it ever happens.
- It's like a magic trick.

231
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,388
Sometimes I think it would be easier
to bend a spoon mentally...

232
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,651
...than to make that transformation.

233
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,986
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,596
Listen...

235
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,730
...if I give you money, will you
go out and get me some fruit?

236
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,101
- Why can't you get it?
- Well, I got banned from the store.

237
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,868
I can't go back in there now.

238
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,909
- What happened?
- We had a fight over the peach...

239
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,674
...and Joe doesn't want
my business.

240
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,082
- Hey, is that a joke about Houdini?
- No.

241
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,057
- I told you not to say anything.
- What am I gonna do for fruit?

242
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,092
- You'll have to go to the supermarket.
- The supermarket?

243
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,458
Impossible. They don't have a decent
piece of fruit at the supermarket.

244
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,565
The apples are mealy.
The oranges are dry.

245
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,031
I don't know what's going on
with the papayas.

246
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,639
You gotta go to Joe's.
You gotta get me some fruit.

247
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,968
So, what, am I gonna buy
all your fruit now?

248
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:41,101
Well, if Houdini couldn't do it,
what chance do I have?

249
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,447
Hello? Oh, hi, Patty.
Thanks for calling me back.

250
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,955
I wanted to ask a question.
When we were going out...

251
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,150
...did you have orgasms?

252
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,995
Okay. Thanks. No, that's it.

253
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,758
Yeah. Okay, bye.
Patty Lawrence had them.

254
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,233
- I'll make you a fruit list, all right?
- Yeah.

255
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:07,738
Hello, Elaine?
Patty Lawrence had orgasms.

256
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,397
What do you think about that?

257
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,806
And I got calls in to six other women.
I bet they confirm an orgasm too.

258
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,809
So, what do you have
to say now, Elaine?

259
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,947
Hello?

260
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,352
- I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
- All right, now here's the list.

261
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,354
All this? It's too much.

262
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,823
- What do you need five mangoes for?
- I like mangoes.

263
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,692
Avocado? I don't know how
to pick out an avocado.

264
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,661
- Well, they gotta be soft.
- How soft?

265
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,356
But not too soft.

266
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,367
See, better too hard
than too soft.

267
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,506
I'm not going through this
every week. I'll you that right now.

268
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,699
What are these, plums?
What is that?

269
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,276
Yeah. Now, get the ones
that are red on the inside.

270
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,345
How do I know
what they look like inside?

271
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,277
What do they look like
on the outside?

272
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,111
- Oh, and get some plantains.
- Plantains?

273
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,547
- Yes.
- What's a plantain?

274
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,620
It's in the banana family.
It's a delicacy.

275
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,381
You're not getting any plantains.

276
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,861
- Hey, Joe.
- How's it going?

277
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,726
Good. Just getting some fruit
for myself.

278
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,901
Gotta have fruit in the house.

279
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,738
I like it as a snack. Wholesome...

280
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,142
...natural, chock-full of vitamins.

281
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,747
All right, let's see...

282
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,045
Mangoes.

283
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,414
Four plums with red on the inside.

284
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,528
An avocado.

285
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,829
Just right.

286
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:46,595
And three plantains ought to do it.

287
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,702
- All right, just hold it right there.
- What?

288
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,672
This fruit isn't for you.

289
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,645
- What are you talking about?
- You think I don't know, huh?

290
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,751
Mangoes, plantains, plums with
the red on the inside? That's Kramer.

291
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,049
- I can't buy mangoes and plantains?
- All right, get out.

292
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,558
- You're making a big mistake, Joe.
- I don't want your business either.

293
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,255
- Are you banning me from the store?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

294
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,798
- I'm banned?
- You're banned.

295
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,071
- All right, where do you want it?
- Put it over there.

296
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,709
Yes.

297
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,776
- This stuff is heavy.
- Oh, great.

298
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,609
What do you got? Look at these.
These mangoes are beautiful.

299
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,649
Oh, those are beautiful.
You did good.

300
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,844
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

301
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,888
- All right, I gotta get going.
- What are you doing?

302
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,992
I got a date with Karen.

303
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,185
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

304
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,126
There's nothing happening
down there.

305
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,131
You're thinking about too much,
putting too much emphasis on it.

306
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,202
I knew this was gonna happen
someday. It was inevitable.

307
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,602
I've known it ever since I was
a little kid. I've been waiting for it.

308
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,566
This mango is delicious.

309
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,406
That reminds me. I'm not getting
you guys any more fruit.

310
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,777
That guy was eyeballing me
the whole time. Gave me the creeps.

311
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,809
All right, you owe me 28.60.

312
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,386
Gee, sorry, I don't have any cash.

313
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,987
I only got hundreds.

314
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,122
You see, I-I knew it.

315
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,456
Come on, we're gonna pay you.
Have some mango.

316
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,225
- I don't want any mango.
- Come on, take some. It's good.

317
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,965
Yeah.

318
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,399
It's very good.

319
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,040
Juicy. Ripe.

320
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,634
Boy, this Joe's got
some terrific fruit.

321
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,573
What?

322
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,215
I feel like I got a B12 shot.

323
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,647
- This is like a taste explosion.
- I told you.

324
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,315
What is it?

325
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,624
I think it moved.

326
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,120
Oh, my God. I think it moved.
Here, give me the big piece.

327
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,131
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, George.

328
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,132
I'm back, baby! I'm back!

329
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,037
- Do you want some mango?
- No, thanks.

330
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:06,802
Well, well. If it isn't the first lady
of the American theater.

331
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,214
What brings you here?

332
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,580
Just gonna return some of your things
that were in my house.

333
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,180
And I've got some things
of yours here.

334
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,880
- I know.
- Well, I'll get them.

335
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,457
- I'm waiting.
- All right then.

336
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,352
- You got my fins?
- Yeah, I got your fins.

337
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,862
- Do you have my poker chips?
- I got your poker chips.

338
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,364
- You got my goggles?
- They're next to the fins.

339
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,993
- You got my cards?
- They're next to the poker chips.

340
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,032
All right.

341
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,978
- Guess that just about does it.
- I guess.

342
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:48,075
- Okay, well, see you around.
- Yeah, see you.

343
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,724
All right, let's go.
I'll give you half an hour.

344
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,222
- What?
- Come on.

345
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,230
- Are you serious?
- Look, Jerry...

346
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,131
...we have to have sex
to save the friendship.

347
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,797
Sex to save the friendship.

348
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,837
Well, if we have to, we have to.

349
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,684
Oh, George.

350
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,024
Please, it's not necessary.

351
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,389
What's not necessary?

352
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,464
The little extra moan
you threw in there.

353
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,295
Laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

354
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,030
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on.

355
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,935
You don't think I bought all that.

356
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,974
- Bought what?
- No, you're very good.

357
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,705
Very good with the moanings
and the gyrations.

358
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,247
You really had me going there
for a minute.

359
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,775
You think I was faking?

360
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,151
Come on. With the,
"Oh, George. Oh, George!"

361
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,916
Come on.

362
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,358
Not that I don't appreciate the effort
that was put into the performance.

363
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,190
I'd like you to leave.

364
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,670
- What?
- I said, I would like you to leave.

365
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,864
- Just get your clothes on and get out.
- But why?

366
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,635
Because I said so!

367
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,478
- I can't find my glasses.
- Well, hurry up.

368
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,775
- Let me look for my glasses.
- Get out.

369
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,683
Get out.

370
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,618
Get out.

371
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,925
It's all George's fault.

372
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,936
All that talk about impotence,
it got to me.

373
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,700
And that orgasm stuff.
Orgasm this and orgasm that.

374
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,707
It's a lot of pressure.

375
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,106
I'm a little hungry.

376
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,543
You wouldn't happen to have
any of that mango left?

377
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,094
The female orgasm,
it's kind of like the Batcave.

378
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,854
Very few people know where it is.

379
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,827
And if you're lucky enough
to see it...

380
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,126
...you probably don't know
how you got there...

381
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,769
...and you can't find your way back
after you leave.

382
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,006
There are two types of female
orgasm, the real and the fake.

383
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,079
And I'll tell you right now,
as a man, we don't know.

384
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:32,148
We do not know. Because to men,
sex is like a car accident...

385
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,979
...and determining the female orgasm
is like being asked:

386
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,088
"What did you see after the car
went out of control?"

387
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,952
"I heard a lot of screeching sounds.

388
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,254
I remember I was facing
the wrong way at one point.

389
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,193
And in the end,
my body was thrown clear."
