1
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,534
You're on a desert island.

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,835
You can bring five books.
Which five do you take?

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,535
I gotta read five books?

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,839
All right, one.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,405
Come on.

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,074
I got it. Three Musketeers.

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,982
-You've read that?
-No, I'm saving it for the island.

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,783
All right, let's start
this whole thing over.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,688
Best Chamberlain:
Wilt, Richard, or Neville?

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,850
For the desert island?

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,792
-Okay.
-Richard.

12
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,761
You know, he was in
The Three Musketeers.

13
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,162
Exactly. Save me having
to read the book.

14
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,565
What's going on over there?

15
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,331
I don't know. I gotta see somebody.

16
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,714
So, Marcy, you should have
seen me in the hot tub today.

17
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,178
-Why?
-I was naked.

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,751
-Oh, George.
-I saw it.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,048
-How'd he look?
-Okay. I wouldn't see it again.

20
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,090
A friend of mine thought she got
Legionnaires' disease in a hot tub.

21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,353
Really, what happened?

22
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,759
Yada, yada, yada.
Just some bad egg salad.

23
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,296
I'll be right back.

24
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,233
-Nice girl.
-Lovely.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,429
I notice she's big on
the phrase, "Yada, yada."

26
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,597
-ls "yada yada" bad?
-No, "yada yada"'s good.

27
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,073
-She's very succinct.
-She is succinct.

28
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,075
Yeah, it's like
you're dating USA Today.

29
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,273
-Hey.
-Hey, Tim.

30
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,351
-George, you know Tim Whatley.
-Yeah, dentist to the stars.

31
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,285
-What's up?
-I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.

32
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,657
-Excuse me?
-I'm a Jew.

33
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,657
I finished converting two days ago.

34
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,653
Oh, well, welcome aboard.

35
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,698
-Thanks. So I'll see you tomorrow?
-Yeah, I have a cavity, lower left.

36
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,963
-Were you just at the health club?
-Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,437
-We must have just missed you.
-I didn't do much.

38
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,870
I just sat in the sauna.

39
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,773
You know, it was more like
a Jewish workout.

40
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,345
I'll see you.

41
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,013
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days.
He's already making Jewish jokes.

42
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,124
So what? When someone turns 21,
they usually get drunk the first night.

43
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,955
Booze is not a religion.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,563
Tell that to my father.

45
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,695
Anyway, guess what.
Beth Lookner called me.

46
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,963
Beth Lookner. I'm still
waiting out that marriage.

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,640
What are you talking about?
That marriage ended six months ago.

48
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,401
She's already remarried.

49
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,210
Where was l?

50
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,477
It was when you were engaged.

51
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,243
Oh, I gotta get on that lnternet.
I'm late on everything.

52
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,320
Anyway, so Beth
and her new husband, Arnie...

53
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,686
...have listed me as a reference
for an adoption agency.

54
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,156
They're trying to get a baby.

55
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,262
Oh, God, a baby. That can
add two years to a marriage.

56
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,726
Hey. Elaine, all right.

57
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,594
Who looks better
in this shirt, me or Mickey?

58
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,999
We're double-dating tonight.

59
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,539
If we wear the same shirt,
we'll look like idiots.

60
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,674
Turn around.

61
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,981
Well, you're both so striking.

62
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,780
Yeah, tell me about it.

63
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,889
We just picked up two women
at The Gap.

64
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,190
How did you decide which one
of you would date which girl?

65
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,931
So I'm on Third Avenue, minding my
own business and yada, yada, yada.

66
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,800
I get a free massage and a facial.

67
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,536
What a succinct story.

68
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,571
So I'm surprised
you drive a Cadillac.

69
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,147
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.

70
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,308
Are you close with your parents?

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,112
Well, they gave birth to me
and yada, yada.

72
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,279
Yada what?

73
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,587
Yada, yada, yada.

74
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,394
It's a nice place.

75
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,766
Really nice.

76
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,502
-I like your shirt.
-Oh, thank you.

77
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,135
It's a hundred percent cotton.
And some wool.

78
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,644
Well, you two seem
to have the same taste.

79
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,585
-Well, I like it too.
-Oh, well, I have the same shirt.

80
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,520
Yeah, well, I'm wearing it.

81
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,917
Well, I like your shirt too.

82
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,354
Well, so do l.

83
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,434
Did I mention I'm a serious actor?

84
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,670
-Really?
-I enjoy polo.

85
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,639
I like the beach.

86
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,514
My aunt has been ill of late.

87
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,681
I own a tuxedo.

88
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,551
Anything to drink?
Some wine perhaps?

89
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,452
-I like merlot.
-I love merlot.

90
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,083
-I'm crazy about merlot.
-I live for merlot.

91
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,186
We're out of merlot.

92
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,761
We'll clear out for your interview.

93
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,530
-Okay.
-Make us sound good.

94
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,607
-Oh, come on.
-Bye.

95
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,607
-Bye, Beth. Bye, Arnie.
-Bye.

96
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,108
Nice people.

97
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,216
So you know Beth and Arnie
pretty well?

98
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,749
Oh, yeah, yeah.

99
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,611
Do you socialize with them often?

100
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,813
Yeah, yeah,
we go out to dinner a lot...

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,153
...usually Chinese.
Well, sometimes Thai.

102
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,390
And we go to the movies.
Arnie's a real film buff.

103
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,925
Actually, I remember this one time.

104
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,229
This is funny.

105
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,833
We went to see
the movie Striptease.

106
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,671
I don't know if you've seen it.
It doesn't matter. Anyway.

107
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,042
And it was during
the opening credits...

108
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,079
...it was before
the movie even started.

109
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,343
And I was whispering
something to Beth...

110
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,956
...and Arnie leans over to me
and he goes, "Would you shut up?"

111
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,225
I mean, he barely even knew me.
Where did he get off--?

112
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,875
But they're great people.

113
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,105
You're in here.

114
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,580
-What are you doing here?
-I knew you had an appointment.

115
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,948
Well, this is very awkward.

116
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,080
I'll leave when the guy comes in.

117
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,752
Hey, I gotta tell you.
I am loving this yada yada thing.

118
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,157
You know, I can gloss over
my whole life story.

119
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,299
-Look at that.
-Hey, don't play with that.

120
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,229
That's going in my mouth.

121
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,964
-What is this thing?
-All right. That's enough.

122
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,538
-Just get going. Get out of here.
-All right.

123
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,402
-Hey, Tim. Quick question.
-Hey.

124
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,538
Is it normal for your
teeth to make noises...

125
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,577
...Iike a hissing or a chirping?

126
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,146
George.

127
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,452
Fine, I'll make an appointment.

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,816
All right. It is cavity time.

129
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,453
Here we go.

130
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,723
Reminds me,
you hear the one about the rabbi...

131
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,265
...and the farmer's daughter, huh?

132
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,437
"Those aren't matzo balls."

133
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,075
-What?
-Tim, do you think you should be...

134
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,675
...making jokes like that?

135
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,005
Why not? I'm Jewish. Remember?

136
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,143
-I know, but--
-Jerry, it's our sense of humor...

137
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,514
...that sustained us
as a people for 3000 years.

138
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,046
-Five thousand.
-Five thousand, even better.

139
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,795
Okay. Chrissy...

140
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,624
...give me a shtickl of fluoride.

141
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,736
And then he asked the assistant
for a shtickl of fluoride.

142
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,038
Why are you so
concerned about this?

143
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,677
I'll tell you why.

144
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,646
Because I believe Whatley converted
to Judaism just for the jokes.

145
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,310
-Hello.
-Would you be interested...

146
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,649
...in a subscription
to the New York Times?

147
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,381
Yes.

148
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,127
-Well, I don't believe that.
-lf you'd got in the back seat...

149
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,733
...we could've figured this out.

150
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,166
Well, why were you holding
the door open for?

151
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,205
Not for you. Who holds
a door open for a man?

152
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:32,572
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture,
but I guess I was wrong.

153
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,904
Let's just put their names in a hat.

154
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,844
I don't even know their names.

155
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,609
Look, why don't you take
the one on the left?

156
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,051
-I'm not sure she's my type.
-Oh, everybody's your type.

157
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,747
What the hell does that mean?

158
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,621
-You've been married three times.
-That's it. It's go time.

159
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,524
-All right. Take it easy. Easy, easy.
-Hey, hey, hey!

160
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,632
No, come on, let him go.
You wanna throw? Let's throw!

161
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,930
Hey, hey! Hold on a second.

162
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,200
All right, look. I got an idea.

163
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,311
Why don't you just
show up early for your next date...

164
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,916
...sit across from each other
and see who the girls sit next to.

165
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,378
-That's not bad.
-All right. So we let the girls decide.

166
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,546
Yeah, why should we
knock ourselves out?

167
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,920
-I wanna wear that shirt next time.
-No one wears the shirt next time.

168
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,551
-Right, because they already saw it.
-We'll look like idiots.

169
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,390
Well, we.... We were engaged
to be married.

170
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,898
We bought
the wedding invitations and...

171
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,273
...yada, yada, yada. I'm still single.

172
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,136
So, what's she doing now?

173
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,280
Yada.

174
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,146
-I get it.
-I love talking to you.

175
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,053
Me too. So speaking of exes...

176
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,589
...my old boyfriend
came over late last night...

177
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,822
...and yada, yada, yada.
Anyway, I'm really tired today.

178
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:13,270
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?

179
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,304
Well, our adoption
application was denied.

180
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,316
-Really?
-The adoption agent seems to feel...

181
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,612
...that Arnie has a violent temper.

182
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,290
So we're just asking our friends...

183
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,790
...what they may have said
to the adoption agent.

184
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,025
Well, l....

185
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,962
You know, I just told them
what kind people you are...

186
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,036
...and how Arnie's a big movie buff...

187
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,164
...and yada, yada, yada. That is it.

188
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,314
How you doing?

189
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,211
I have some discomfort in my molar.

190
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,211
You like Tootsie Rolls, don't you?

191
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,981
Father Curtis,
why don't you come in?

192
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,451
Father Curtis, good guy.
Oh, which reminds me.

193
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,993
Did you hear the one about the pope
and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat?

194
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,097
I'll tell you later.

195
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,833
Whatley.

196
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,867
What are they doing here?

197
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,771
Told you we should've
gotten here early.

198
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,968
All right. Okay, now what are
we going to do?

199
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,477
All right. Don't panic.

200
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,842
Let's just decide now.
Which one do you want?

201
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,181
-I'll take Julie.
-I knew you wanted her.

202
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,548
-That's who I wanted.
-All right. I'll take Karen.

203
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,088
No, you think I'm falling for that?
I'll take Karen.

204
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,818
Fine. I'll take Julie.

205
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,894
All right. Which one is Julie?

206
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,532
I don't know.

207
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,525
-Why don't we just grab a chair?
-You first.

208
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,194
No, you first.

209
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,931
-How you doing?
-Good evening.

210
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,113
Stop.

211
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,222
Well, you ladies look lovely tonight.

212
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,927
So Whatley says to me,
"Hey, I can make Catholic jokes.

213
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,660
I used to be Catholic."

214
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,130
Now, see, I don't think
it is a Catholic joke.

215
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,638
I think it's more
of a Raquel Welch joke.

216
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,844
What was it?
"No, I said, 'Hand me the buoys."'

217
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,249
"Buoys."

218
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,218
Don't you see
what Whatley is after?

219
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,051
Total joke-telling immunity.

220
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,285
He's already got
the big two religions covered.

221
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,487
If he ever gets Polish citizenship,
there'll be no stopping him.

222
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,328
So, what are you going to do?

223
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,566
I think this Father Curtis
might be very interested to hear...

224
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,331
...what Whatley has
the pope doing with Raquel Welch.

225
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,239
Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine.

226
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,538
Thought you guys might wanna
have lunch. Give me a call. Bye.

227
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,939
They're not getting a baby,
so you're taking them to lunch.

228
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,009
I thought it would be nice.

229
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,977
-Poor Beth.
-Hey, Arnie's just as upset.

230
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,056
Oh, screw him.

231
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,186
Listen to this.

232
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,591
Marcy comes over, tells me her
ex-boyfriend was over late last night...

233
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,460
...and "Yada, yada, yada,
I'm really tired today."

234
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:27,436
-What do you think she's tired from?
-Well, obviously the yada yada.

235
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,566
You don't think
she'd yada yada sex?

236
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,907
I've yada yada-ed sex.

237
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,343
-Really?
-Yeah. I met this lawyer.

238
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,642
We went out to dinner.
I had the lobster bisque.

239
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,809
We went back to my place.
Yada, yada, yada...

240
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,386
...I never heard from him again.

241
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,991
But you yada yada-ed
over the best part.

242
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,559
No, I mentioned the bisque.

243
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,828
Well, I gotta do something.

244
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,705
Well, I gotta do something.

245
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,033
George is already in there.

246
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,746
No, Mickey and l.
We can't work it out.

247
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:12,509
You know, I'm thinking of asking that
Karen out by myself. She's the one.

248
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,118
You were leaning towards Julie.

249
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:18,450
Well, I was. But the one I thought
was Julie turned out to be Karen.

250
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,453
Well, it was a hell of a yada yada.

251
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,188
He's moving to Seattle.
He wanted to say goodbye.

252
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,958
I was just getting out of the shower
and yada, yada, yada--

253
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,464
All right. Enough. Enough.

254
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:34,800
From now on, no more yada yadas.
Just give me the full story.

255
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,067
Okay. Well...

256
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,370
...when I got out of the shower,
I was dripping--

257
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,207
Not that story. Another story.

258
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,975
Tell me about the free facial.

259
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,153
Okay, well, like I said,
I was on Third Avenue...

260
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,653
...and I stopped by
a large department store.

261
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,724
-Which one?
-Bloomingdale's.

262
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,485
Very good. Go on.

263
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:01,156
-And-- Oh, I stole a Piaget watch.
-What's that?

264
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,393
And then I was on such a high...

265
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,664
...that I went upstairs
to the salon on the fifth floor...

266
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,107
...and got a massage and a
facial and skipped out on the bill.

267
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,809
Shoplifting.

268
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:24,478
Well, what about you?
You told me that you were engaged.

269
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,284
What was the rest of that?

270
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,665
Excuse me, Mother?

271
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,096
-Sister.
-Sister. Right.

272
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,832
Do you know when
Father Curtis has office hours?

273
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,305
Well, not until tomorrow.

274
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,374
I really need to speak with him.

275
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,066
You know, that's a kneeler.

276
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,112
Tell me your sins, my son.

277
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,376
Well, I should mention
that I'm Jewish.

278
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,043
-Oh, that's no sin.
-Oh, good.

279
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,117
Anyway, I wanted to talk
to you about Dr. Whatley.

280
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,521
I have a suspicion...

281
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,357
...that he's converted
to Judaism purely for the jokes.

282
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,625
And this offends you
as a Jewish person?

283
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,497
No, it offends me as a comedian.

284
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:57,007
And it'll interest you to know
that he's also telling Catholic jokes.

285
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,208
-Well--
-And, I mean, they're old jokes.

286
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,550
I mean, the pope and
Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.

287
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,657
I haven't heard that one.

288
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,653
Oh, I'm sure you have.
They're out on the ocean...

289
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,128
...and yada, yada, yada and she--

290
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,234
And she says, "Those aren't buoys."

291
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,341
-Father.
-One second.

292
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,580
Well, if it would make you feel
better, I could speak to Dr. Whatley.

293
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,152
I have to go back and have
a wisdom tooth removed.

294
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,982
Good luck.
You know the difference...

295
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,990
...between a dentist
and a sadist, don't you?

296
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,321
Newer magazines.

297
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,095
That's funny.

298
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,532
Now if you would excuse me.

299
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,433
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.

300
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,477
-Hi.
-Hi, Kramer.

301
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,854
Got a minute?

302
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,254
Actually, my parents are over,
but would you like to meet them?

303
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,656
-Yeah.
-Mom, Dad.

304
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,295
Hi.

305
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,534
Elaine, I have to ask you
about something.

306
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,643
-What?
-The yada yada.

307
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,644
-Yada yada?
-What exactly happened down there?

308
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,385
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I talked to him...

309
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:46,650
...and blah, blah, blah.
He asked about you guys and:

310
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,124
More questions. Blah, blah, blah.

311
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,557
All right. Shut up.

312
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,631
Shut up? Again you are telling
me to shut up?

313
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,393
-What?
-You yelled at me...

314
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,127
...that time at the movies.

315
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,205
That's why you're not
getting the baby.

316
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,066
And you told that
to the adoption guy?

317
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,140
-Slipped out.
-Oh, God.

318
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,906
What am I gonna tell Beth?

319
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,086
Well, Arnie, look, I'll go down
and talk to this adoption guy...

320
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,348
...and make sure
it all gets straightened out.

321
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:23,427
-Just don't screw it up this time!
-See, again you're yelling.

322
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,995
Not a fan of the yelling.

323
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,605
Are you about done?

324
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,598
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

325
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,873
Because I'm just a sadist
with newer magazines.

326
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,453
Father Curtis told me your little joke.
I really didn't appreciate it.

327
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,946
Well, what about
all your Jewish jokes?

328
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,615
I'm Jewish. You're not a dentist.

329
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,729
You have no idea what my people
have been through.

330
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,126
-The Jews?
-No, the dentists.

331
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,800
You know, we have the highest
suicide rate of any profession.

332
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,808
Is that why it's so hard
to get an appointment?

333
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,577
So I'll.... I'll see you
tonight, huh? Okay.

334
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,144
-Date with Karen?
-No, Julie.

335
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,558
-She's the one.
-What happened to Karen?

336
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,320
Well, Mickey and her have more in
common. Her parents are little people.

337
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,429
Oh, small world.

338
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,332
So little people can have
"non-little-people" children?

339
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,298
Oh, yeah, and vice versa.

340
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,769
Yeah, Mother Nature's
a mad scientist, Jerry.

341
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,702
So you won't believe
what happened with Whatley.

342
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,835
It got back to him that I made this little
dentist joke and he got all offended.

343
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,814
Those people can be so touchy.

344
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:56,580
-"Those people." Listen to yourself.
-What?

345
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,882
You think that dentists are
so different from me and you?

346
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,461
They came to this country just like
everybody else in search of a dream.

347
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,928
-Whatley's from Jersey.
-Yes, and now...

348
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,499
...he's a full-fledged American.

349
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,761
Kramer, he's just a dentist.

350
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,735
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.

351
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,005
I am not an anti-dentite.

352
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,611
You're a rabid anti-dentite.

353
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,572
Oh, it starts with a few jokes
and some slurs:

354
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,049
"Hey, denty."

355
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,314
Next thing you know, you're saying
they should have their own schools.

356
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,288
-They do have their own schools.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

357
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:42,025
Oh, come on. One little baby,
whatever you have in stock.

358
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,498
-Miss Benes, please.
-Lookit, lookit, Brian.

359
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:50,669
These people are getting
a baby, period.

360
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:54,539
Now, we can do this the easy way...

361
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:59,047
...or we can do this...

362
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,878
...the fun way.

363
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,589
I'm sorry to bother you.
But you always said...

364
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,596
-...you'd be there for me.
-What's wrong?

365
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:19,032
-I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
-Talk to me.

366
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,607
He met with Elaine,
and I asked him what happened.

367
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,608
And he yada yada-ed me.

368
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,405
Could they be having an affair?

369
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,377
I wouldn't put
anything past anybody.

370
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,116
But we just got married.

371
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,548
Well, obviously, that was a mistake.

372
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,918
You need to forget about Arnie. The
important thing is you're moving on.

373
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,218
Why would Elaine do that to me?

374
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,521
Forget about Elaine.
Let's just focus on us.

375
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,789
-Come on, big hug.
-Hey, Jerry.

376
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,728
Where's Kramer?
I've got exciting news.

377
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,801
-I'm in the middle of something.
-Karen and I are getting married.

378
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,406
Oh, congratulations.
Her marriage just fell apart.

379
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,936
-How many is that for you?
-Two.

380
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,003
You're a lightweight.
Come on, honey.

381
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,813
This church give you any ideas?

382
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,318
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey.

383
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,625
What are you doing here with Beth?

384
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,660
Beth and Arnie broke up.

385
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,065
So they don't want a baby?

386
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,714
I think I'm gonna be sick.

387
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,952
Hey, where's Marcy?

388
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:48,183
She went shopping
for some shoes for the wedding...

389
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,023
...and yada, yada, yada,
I'll see her in six to eight months.

390
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,363
-Hey, Kramer, over here.
-I'd just as soon not sit next to you.

391
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,232
Kramer.

392
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,977
-Look, there's Mickey and his parents.
-Oh, a nice-looking family.

393
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,641
Very handsome.

394
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,218
How you doing?

395
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,186
Hey, Kramer.

396
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,124
You must be so proud.

397
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,599
We never thought he'd settle down.

398
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,795
Well, not again.

399
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:40,239
Oh, Mickey. Excuse me.
I can't take this.

400
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,347
Hi, Mr. Abbott.

401
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,118
That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S.

402
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,885
Tim Whatley was
one of my students.

403
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,495
And if this wasn't
my son's wedding day...

404
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:03,066
...I'd knock your teeth out,
you anti-dentite bastard.

405
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,670
What was that all about?

406
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,740
Oh, I said something about dentists,
and it got blown all out of proportion.

407
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,779
Hey, what do you call a doctor
who fails out of med school?

408
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,312
-What?
-A dentist.

409
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,474
-That's a good one.
-Yeah.

410
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,348
-Dentists.
-Yeah, who needs them?

411
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,456
Not to mention
the blacks and the Jews.

412
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:46,235
-Where's Beth?
-She ran out to get her head shaved.

413
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,773
We are gathered here today
to unite this couple...

414
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,611
...in the bonds of holy matrimony.

415
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,484
Those wisdom teeth
are tough to get out.

416
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:01,183
Marriage is not an institution
to be entered into lightly.

417
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,795
Yada, yada, yada.
I pronounce you man and wife.

418
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,540
I really wanted you.
