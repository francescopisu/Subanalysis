1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:09,266
Hey, if I were a gigolo, how much
do you think I could charge a night?

2
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:12,337
-Here or in Japan?
-What's the difference?

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,878
Well, the Japanese
are more enlightened.

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:18,449
They can see beyond the physical.

5
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,019
Forget Japan.
How much would you pay?

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,123
Oh, I don't know. A dollar.

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,691
I think I'm worth at least 300.

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,690
I don't think so.

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,300
-Hey, that's for all night.
-I know.

10
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,298
-You're demeaning me.
-You're a gigolo.

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,369
Well, you hired me.
I'm the victim here.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,130
Did I force you into this life?

13
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,003
Yes. You and every woman like you.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,082
-Look how dark it's getting already.
-It's not daylight-savings time yet.

15
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,311
When does it start?

16
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,387
Don't know.
They tell you the night before.

17
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,723
Well, I'm sick of waiting.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,258
I am springing ahead right now.

19
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,261
Oh, I'm sure
that won't cause any problems.

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,729
Oh, God, it's Mike Moffet.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,801
Don't tell me you're still mad
at him for calling you a phony.

22
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,459
Jerry, that was five years ago.

23
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,232
I'm not a phony. I don't want
anything to do with this guy.

24
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,466
Mike! Mike.

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,238
Kramer, Jerry, how's it going?

26
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,176
Fine. And I'm not just saying that.

27
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,815
Guess what. I just started
my own business. I'm a bookie.

28
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,078
No openings in arson?

29
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,781
Either of you guys wanna place a bet,
I'm your guy.

30
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,950
No, no, no. No bets for me.
I got a disease.

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,023
I'm feeling a bit queasy myself. Maybe
I'll see you in another five years.

32
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,933
Jerry's still mad
about that phony thing?

33
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,335
Are you kidding?
It's all water near a bridge.

34
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,476
-Oh, what time do you got?
-Oh, yes.

35
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,773
-It's almost 6.
-Whoa, I'm really late.

36
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,517
These designs look great.

37
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,885
-Peggy, you really saved me.
-lt was no problem.

38
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,152
-Mr. Peterman is gonna love them.
-Thanks, Susie.

39
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,640
You won't believe this,
but as I'm leaving, she calls me Susie.

40
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,146
I don't see you as a Susie.
Sharon, maybe.

41
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:35,481
What am l, a bulimic, chain-smoking
stenographer from Staten lsland?

42
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,152
-Who are you describing?
-Someone I know.

43
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,519
-Named Sharon?
-I'd rather not say.

44
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,990
Hey.

45
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,065
-What's in the bag?
-New tuxedo for the Pinstripe Ball.

46
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,202
Steinbrenner is throwing
a huge party at Tavern on the Green.

47
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,769
Kind of a Yankee prom?

48
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,066
It's not a prom. It's a ball.

49
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,709
-You taking Allison?
-Yes, of course I'm taking Allison.

50
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,243
This woman is genetically
engineered to go to a ball.

51
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,711
-Tall, blond, lithe.
-Live?

52
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,110
-Lithe.
-Live?

53
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,343
-Lithe.
-Oh, lithe.

54
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,881
-Well, you two will have a great time.
-lt can't be worse than this.

55
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,721
Wait till you see the dress
that she's got. It's backless.

56
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,623
I'm finally gonna make
a great entrance.

57
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,232
Backless? You gonna back her in?

58
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:25,499
Elaine, when a woman makes
a ball entrance, she twirls.

59
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,197
-She's not gonna twi--
-She'll twirl.

60
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,144
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants.

61
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,475
He wants everyone to twirl around.

62
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,876
-All right.
-Great.

63
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,484
Hey, did you get your boss's
Knick ticket for Kramer?

64
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,051
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

65
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,989
-Say, George--
-Oh, courtside.

66
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,887
Is that the best you could do?

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,587
-George, we need to talk.
-What?

68
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,061
I really think we need to talk.

69
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,234
-She wants to talk?
-She doesn't want to.

70
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,965
-She needs to talk.
-Nobody needs to talk.

71
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,574
Who would want to?

72
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,473
-She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
-What did you do?

73
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,844
I told her I was out of soda. I went out
to get some, and I never went back.

74
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,250
-All night?
-Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.

75
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,091
-And she wants to break up with you.
-Can you believe it?

76
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,756
I'm supposed to be having lunch
with her now at Pomodoro.

77
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,425
Everybody breaks up at Pomodoros.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,091
-So, what am I gonna do?
-You really like this girl.

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,465
No, I like the ball.

80
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,869
This is my one chance
to make a great entrance.

81
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,601
My whole life, I've never made
a great entrance.

82
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,177
You've made some fine exits.

83
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,945
So, what?
You can't keep avoiding her.

84
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,344
Why not?

85
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,543
If she can't find me,
she can't break up with me.

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,783
And if we're still going out,
she has to go to the ball.

87
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,958
Hey. Oh, listen, did you get
my ticket from Allison?

88
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,357
-Right here.
-All right.

89
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,624
Courtside.

90
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,325
Don't let this girl get away.

91
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,967
She'll have to find me first.

92
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,537
Oh, by the way, you owe Mike $1 00.

93
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,111
-What for?
-I bet for you on tonight's game.

94
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,910
Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers
by more than 35, it pays 1 0-1.

95
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,178
That's some sweet action.

96
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,646
But I don't want any sweet action.

97
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,656
Well, I couldn't do it.
I got a gambling problem.

98
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,316
So you put down my money?

99
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,062
You don't have a problem.

100
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,357
Not with that, no.

101
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,100
Susie.

102
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,932
Susie.

103
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,002
Hi, Peggy.

104
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,009
Look, I should have
said this yesterday--

105
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,239
Did you get this memo
from Elaine Benes?

106
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,181
You know, it's amazing
Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.

107
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,685
She practically ran the company
into the ground.

108
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,949
Well, I thought
she did a pretty good job.

109
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,593
I heard she was a disaster, Suz.

110
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,992
Lookit. It's not Suz, all right?

111
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,394
It's Susie.

112
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,264
My name is Susie.

113
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,110
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

114
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:26,149
Please leave a message
At the beep

115
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,083
I must be out
Or I'd pick up the phone

116
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,884
Where could I be?

117
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,553
Believe it or not, I'm not home

118
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,960
Pick up.
I know you're screening for Allison.

119
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,662
-Hey.
-So coffee shop?

120
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,463
No, I can't. She knows I go there.
It's not secure.

121
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,835
Hey, I got another call coming in.
I gotta let the machine get it. Bye.

122
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,909
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,949
Please leave a message
At the beep

124
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,349
I must be out
Or I'd pick up the phone

125
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,582
Where could I be?

126
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:10,422
Believe it or not, I'm not home

127
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,292
George, are you there?

128
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,562
I hate that stupid message.

129
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,726
I know you're avoiding me.
I'm at the office.

130
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,771
Please call me.
I've gotta talk to you.

131
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,344
Hi, Allison.

132
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,644
Oh, I guess you're not at home.

133
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,414
I probably should have
tried you at the office.

134
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,454
Anyway, good to hear from you.

135
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,388
Really looking forward to the ball.

136
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,531
Can you believe this woman?

137
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,069
The nerve. Talking about you behind
your back, and right to your face.

138
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,071
No. Suz.

139
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:59,610
I mean, Susie,
Suzanne, Susanna. Fine.

140
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,875
But there is no way
I'm gonna be a Suz.

141
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,415
No. No Suz.

142
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,487
I mean, what am l? Some pom-pom
waving, back-seat bimbo?

143
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,247
-Who are you describing?
-Someone.

144
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,324
-Named Suz?
-No, still Sharon.

145
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,453
-Hey.
-Hey, I thought you went to the game.

146
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,427
No, I was kicked out for fighting
with one of the players.

147
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,500
-Wait. Wait. Wait. Who?
-Reggie Miller.

148
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,226
-Cheryl Miller's brother?
-Yeah.

149
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,702
Hey, hey, hey. Wait. Wait. Wait.
What happened?

150
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,174
Well, first of all, for some reason,
they started the game an hour late.

151
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,609
And, I don't know,
I was sitting next to Spike Lee.

152
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,340
He and Reggie were jawing
at each other. I got involved.

153
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,850
Wait. Wait. Wait.
What do you mean, "involved"?

154
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,354
Well, I ran out onto the court
and threw a hot dog at Reggie Miller.

155
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,322
Involved.

156
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,018
Then they threw me and Reggie
and Spike out of the game.

157
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,858
So that's it?

158
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,262
Well, you know, I felt pretty bad
about everything.

159
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,265
Then the three of us
went to a strip club.

160
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,103
Can you believe that?

161
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,075
I didn't know Cheryl Miller's
little brother played basketball.

162
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,213
Knicks killed them, 1 1 0-73.

163
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,474
Well, without Reggie Miller,
it's a blowout.

164
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,140
No, Jerry, that's 37 points.

165
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,808
The Knicks covered. You won.

166
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,218
See, that's a cool G, daddy-o.
Now, you gotta let it ride.

167
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,449
-On what?
-Jerry, I don't wanna lose this feeling.

168
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,754
Let's go to the OTB,
put money on the ponies.

169
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,591
Yeah, all right.

170
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,132
-They just closed.
-Oh, too bad.

171
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,734
Mr. Peterman,
you wanted to see me?

172
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,639
Apparently Peggy down in Design...

173
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,245
...got into a little bit of a tiff yesterday
with somebody named Susie.

174
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,776
-Susie.
-Yes.

175
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,976
And between you, me and
the lamppost, and the desk...

176
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,986
...Peggy says this Suz
isn't much of a worker.

177
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,251
It's Susie.

178
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,361
Nevertheless, Elaine,
the house of Peterman is in disorder.

179
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,555
First thing tomorrow morning,
I wanna see you, Peggy and Susie...

180
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,529
...right here in my office.

181
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,767
All of us?

182
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:11,971
Allison, hi.

183
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,079
Listen, I'm sorry about what happened
at the game last night.

184
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,714
Could I have that ticket tonight?

185
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,146
The Rockets are in town
and that Hakeem Olajuwon...

186
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,286
...he's got a real attitude.

187
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,213
Kramer, have you seen
George around?

188
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,620
-I can't get ahold of him.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

189
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,989
Well, he visits the guy across the hall
from me like every 1 0 minutes.

190
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,261
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

191
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,128
Hey, Jerry.

192
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,293
Hey, Mike.
How about those Knicks?

193
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,268
How about them?

194
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,169
-Look, Jerry, I can't pay you.
-Why not?

195
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,709
-Because I don't have the money.
-Mike, you say you're a bookie...

196
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,904
...you take a bet
and then you can't pay.

197
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:53,040
I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds
a little, how you say, phony.

198
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,983
Just give me till Friday.
Please, please?

199
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,316
You know, you're supposed
to be the bookie.

200
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,517
-Act like one.
-I'm sorry.

201
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,162
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.

202
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,357
-There's something wrong this trunk.
-Oh, let me see.

203
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,563
So, Kramer,
why'd you ask me out to dinner?

204
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,631
And why Pomodoro?

205
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,676
How could you say that to me?

206
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,872
Allison spoke to me
and she wanted me to speak to you.

207
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,283
Now, we all know
that this relationship isn't working.

208
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:34,256
So Allison and I think that the best
thing to do is just make a clean break.

209
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,122
Can't we discuss this?

210
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:40,026
We just don't think you're ready
for a serious relationship.

211
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,863
I didn't even know
you wanted to get serious.

212
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,196
So, what am I in this for?

213
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:51,074
You know, I'm getting to a point in
my life where I need something more...

214
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,541
...than just a good time.

215
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,044
-Are you?
-What, me?

216
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,581
No, no.

217
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,048
But she is.

218
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,918
I can't believe this is happening.

219
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,785
George, we're sorry.

220
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,220
We're through.

221
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,122
Kramer, please.

222
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,657
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,233
Mr. Peterman, Peggy.

224
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,537
I guess we should
just get this over with.

225
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,573
Just hold on a minute.

226
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,473
We're still one short.

227
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,508
No, we're not.

228
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,946
Susie has been very rude to me.

229
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,951
Well, Elaine has nothing
but good things to say about Susie.

230
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,283
Look.

231
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:44,521
We don't have to name names
or point fingers...

232
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,063
...or name names.

233
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:53,396
Me and her have had our problems.
She and I have had our problems.

234
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,200
You and I and she and you.

235
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,969
Don't you drag me into this.

236
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,375
This is between you
and her and her.

237
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:06,314
Yes. And I am convinced
that if she were here with us today...

238
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,885
...she would agree with me too.

239
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,054
-Who?
-Her.

240
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,660
-Where is she?
-This is part of the problem.

241
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,126
I thought I was part of this problem.

242
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,891
You're a huge part of the problem.

243
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,800
But I think that at its core...

244
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,803
...this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem...

245
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,875
...that requires
a Susie-and-Elaine solution.

246
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,070
And who better to do that than...

247
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,912
...Elaine and Susie,
Susie and Elaine.

248
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,385
Well, now that we have
that cleared up...

249
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,718
...why don't the three of us
have lunch?

250
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,884
What?

251
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,895
Oh, I'm coming.

252
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,225
I gotta go.

253
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,330
She is the best.

254
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,934
What was your name again?

255
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,937
Mike's outside. He wants to talk.

256
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,635
Then why doesn't he just come in?

257
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,112
-Because he's scared, Jerry.
-Why is he scared?

258
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,353
Come on, Mike.

259
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,921
-Did you do this?
-Yeah, but--

260
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,426
-You broke his thumbs.
-lt was an accident.

261
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,758
Is that what you call it
when somebody doesn't pay up?

262
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,458
I'll get the money. I got a hundred
in my pocket if you wanna reach in.

263
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,227
I don't want it that way.

264
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,998
Okay, how about Mike fixes your trunk,
we call it even, nobody has to get hurt.

265
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,472
-Fine.
-Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.

266
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,374
I won't forget this. I'm gonna
fix your trunk good. Real good.

267
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,443
See, that was nice, Jerry.

268
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,382
Oh, by the way, I broke your trunk.

269
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,987
It's just a car.

270
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,228
-Hi.
-Hi.

271
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,705
-It's funny running into you here.
-Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,139
It's funny.

273
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,742
You look good.

274
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,214
Do l? Thanks.

275
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,881
-You too.
-Oh, yeah.

276
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,662
It's getting kind of late.
I really have to be going.

277
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,595
-Yeah.
-So it's nice seeing you again.

278
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,601
Hey, you know,
maybe I'll call you sometime.

279
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,467
George, it's over. It's just--

280
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,868
It's over.

281
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,141
What do you think, Jerry?

282
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,182
I don't know,
I just see you guys together.

283
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,391
Stupid thumbs.

284
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,864
Somebody help. Help!

285
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,302
So Peterman bought it?

286
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,773
I can't believe
you got away with that.

287
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,539
Well, I'm very fortunate
to be surrounded by such stupidity.

288
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,239
Yeah, I know how you feel.

289
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,178
Help!

290
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,414
-You hear something?
-What?

291
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,488
Jerry.

292
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,147
Jerry.

293
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,623
Oh, the trunk's broken. It's rattling.

294
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,319
Jerry, I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

295
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,897
They're starting to give Susie
assignments now.

296
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,432
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Eliminate her.

297
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:44,830
What?

298
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,631
Get rid of Susie.

299
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,670
Make her disappear.

300
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,173
-But I kind of like her.
-She's gone.

301
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,004
-Jerry.
-Gone.

302
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,309
The bumper sticker.

303
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,347
Oh, God, I'm in trouble.

304
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,683
Kramer, open up.
I know you're in there.

305
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,026
George?

306
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,962
Come on. It's 5:00 in the morning.
What's the matter with you?

307
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,069
It's only 4.

308
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,035
I've been walking around all night.

309
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,767
I've been thinking about Allison
and me and you.

310
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,478
Come on, George.

311
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,137
Please, give me another chance.

312
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,114
I know I'm gonna regret this.

313
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,283
All right.

314
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,749
Thank you.

315
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,122
-I'm gonna make you both so happy.
-Okay. All right. I'll see you later.

316
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,890
Elaine, where's Susie?

317
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,435
I want her to head up our new
fingerless-glove division.

318
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,663
I thought I was in line
for that assignment.

319
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,264
No.

320
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,679
All right, then, I was gonna wait
to tell you this...

321
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,706
...but last night, Susie....

322
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,149
She took her own life.

323
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,424
-We're taking George back.
-What?

324
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,430
He's gonna make us very happy.

325
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,305
Look at this turnout.

326
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,965
Where did Susie find the time
to meet all these people?

327
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,601
My real funeral's
not gonna come close to this.

328
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,909
Oh, my God.

329
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,176
Susie?

330
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,786
I'm not Susie. I'm Elaine.

331
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:48,222
-But I've been calling you Susie.
-Hadn't noticed. Excuse me.

332
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,361
I guess I never met Susie.

333
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,261
Suz?

334
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,426
I actually had a little thing
with her for a while.

335
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,000
Her too.

336
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:10,338
What can you say
about a girl like Susie?

337
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,687
Hey.

338
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,453
-Where's Allison?
-No, Allison, she didn't wanna come.

339
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,959
But you took me back.

340
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,361
Well, yeah, I did,
but she's a tough nut.

341
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,864
How do you like the tuxedo?

342
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,196
It's a rental,
but I've had it for 1 5 years.

343
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,304
-All right.
-Where are you going?

344
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,907
The ball, silly.

345
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,567
No, no, no.
You're not going in there.

346
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,641
George, I thought
you were gonna change.

347
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,142
For her, not for you.

348
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,449
Let's just try and have
a nice time for once.

349
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,316
We'll talk about this
when we get home.

350
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:30,223
All right, look. Wait. Wait. Kramer.
Wait a minute. You are not going in.

351
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,568
What an entrance.

352
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:42,897
-And who might this be?
-Oh, I'm with him. Yeah.

353
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:51,471
And also much like me,
Susie hated going to the market.

354
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,782
-Elaine, may I say a few words?
-Oh, God, yes, Mr. Peterman.

355
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,121
I don't think I'll ever
be able to forget Susie.

356
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,692
And most of all,
I will never forget that one night...

357
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,890
...working late on the catalog...

358
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:13,527
...just the two of us,
and we surrendered to temptation.

359
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,675
And it was pretty good.

360
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,510
Yeah, but he didn't sleep
with both of them.

361
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,445
But I never heard her cries for help...

362
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,059
...and now Susie is gone.

363
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,660
Hold on!

364
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,492
Susie didn't commit suicide.

365
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,325
She was murdered...

366
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,901
...by Jerry Seinfeld!

367
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,496
Not only that, I broke his thumbs.

368
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,745
Elaine, guess what.

369
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,584
I've decided to form a charitable
foundation in Susie's honor...

370
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,751
...and as Susie's best friend,
I want you to be involved.

371
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,630
Mr. Peterman...

372
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,763
...I'm Susie.

373
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,596
She's me.

374
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,107
I feel the same way.

375
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,569
And that's why this foundation
will meet around your schedule.

376
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:32,615
Nights, weekends,
every free moment you have.

377
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:42,417
Suz!
