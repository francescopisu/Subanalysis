1
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:08,162
I started out working in mortgage
bonds, but I just found that so limiting.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:11,208
My friend Kramer and I were
discussing that the other day.

3
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,209
He was with Brandt-Leland
for a while.

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,579
Well, then my mentor suggested
that I move into equities.

5
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,379
Best move I ever made.

6
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,544
-Mentor? You mean your boss?
-Oh, no, no, no.

7
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,485
Cynthia's a successful
businesswoman...

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,750
...who's taken me under her wing.

9
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,020
-So Cynthia's your mentor?
-And I'm her protégé.

10
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,053
You must have someone like that.

11
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,393
You know, who guides you
in your career path.

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,263
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,407
I still don't understand this.
Abby has a mentor?

14
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,547
Yes. And the mentor
advises the protégé.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,615
Is there any money involved?

16
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,378
-No.
-So, what's in it for the mentor?

17
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,885
Respect, admiration, prestige.

18
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,155
Would the protégé
pick up stuff for the mentor?

19
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:06,594
I suppose if it was on the protégé's
way to the mentor, they might.

20
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,500
Laundry? Dry cleaning?

21
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,329
It's not a valet, it's a protégé.

22
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,199
All right.

23
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:18,076
Listen, I gotta get some reading done.
You mind if I do this here?

24
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,974
I can't concentrate in my apartment.

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,344
-"Risk management"?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,711
Steinbrenner wants everyone
in the front office...

27
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,513
...to give a lecture
in their area of business expertise.

28
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,918
What makes them think
you're a risk-management expert?

29
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,657
I guess it's on my résumé.

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,931
-Hello?
-Please hold for Elaine Benes.

31
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:46,838
You know what? I can't do this.
I can't read books anymore.

32
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,837
Books on tape
have ruined me, Jerry.

33
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,104
I need that nice voice. This book
has my voice. I hate my voice.

34
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,942
-So get this book on tape.
-You can't. It's a textbook.

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,950
Hey, Jer, are you going
to this Bob Sacamano party?

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,985
Am I going? It was three nights ago.

37
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,522
What? You're kidding.
I just got this invitation today.

38
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:09,788
Oh, I was so excited.
It's really a beautiful invitation.

39
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,193
Oh, it was a lovely affair.

40
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,399
Oh, wait a minute.

41
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:20,335
This postmark is three weeks old.
Man, this happens all the time.

42
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,998
Janine, who the hell
runs the mailroom?

43
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,474
-Eddie Sherman.
-All right. Send him up here.

44
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,671
-You gonna do a little yelling?
-I'm gonna do a little firing.

45
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,306
That is so cool.
Can you put me on the speaker?

46
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,113
Oh, yeah. Sure.

47
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,920
Give me a break.

48
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,159
Hey, Copernicus.

49
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,999
-Eddie Sherman is here.
-Oh, great. Send him in.

50
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,342
-You wanted to see me?
-Eddie, yes.

51
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,248
I am so sorry, but I'm afraid
we're gonna have to...

52
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,282
...promote you.

53
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,624
So, what did you say?

54
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,229
Well, I called him
all the way up to my office...

55
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,525
...so I had to tell him
something important.

56
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,368
So I promoted him.

57
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,399
-What? What did you--?
-Copywriter.

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,104
He's writing copy?

59
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:36,379
Well, it can't be any worse than the
pointless drivel we normally churn out.

60
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,114
Check it out.

61
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,189
-"Jewish singles night"?
-I expect you both to be there.

62
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,826
-I'm not Jewish.
-Well, neither am l.

63
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:52,021
-Well, why are you going?
-I'm not. I'm running it.

64
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,192
-What are you talking about?
-Lomez, he usually runs it...

65
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,801
...but he's in the Everglades.

66
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,470
-Lomez is Jewish?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,871
Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.

68
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,571
At the Knights of Columbus?

69
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,710
Yeah. Frank Costanza,
he's getting me a room in his lodge.

70
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,614
Jerry, you know, I'm really
counting on you to come to this.

71
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,379
-Kramer, you know--
-Jerry, look.

72
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,217
I'm cooking all the food myself.

73
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:23,124
"A tempting schmeer
of authentic Jewish delicacies."

74
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,632
Do you like tsimmes?

75
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,595
My mentor says
the duck is outstanding here.

76
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,940
I'm not really a duck fan.
The skin seems sort of human.

77
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,967
Oh, look who's here. Cynthia.

78
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,806
-Hello, Abby.
-Hello.

79
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,971
Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman,
my mentor.

80
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,982
-Hello.
-Hi, Jerry. Nice to finally meet you.

81
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,813
Come join us.
We can pull up a chair.

82
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,512
Well, great.
My boyfriend's just parking the car.

83
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,450
Actually, Jerry, you might know him.
He's a comic too.

84
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,221
-No kidding.
-Kenny Bania.

85
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,694
Bania?

86
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,725
Hey, Jerry. How's it going?

87
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,496
You gonna join us for dinner?
The duck here is the best.

88
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,900
The best, Jerry.

89
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,175
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you.

90
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,907
I noticed that you have
a textbook on tape.

91
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,414
May I ask where you got that?

92
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,485
Reading for the Blind.
They can get any book on tape.

93
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,316
I tell you, I am hooked
on these books on tape.

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,187
Tell me about it. These things
have ruined me for Braille.

95
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,492
Reading for the Blind?

96
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,528
I take an eye test, I flunk it.
The next thing you know...

97
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:39,604
...I am swinging to the sweet sounds
of risk management.

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,606
-So I finally met the mentor.
-What's she like? Impressive?

99
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,110
Oh, yeah. She's dating Bania.

100
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,039
-Bania?
-Yeah.

101
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:55,176
I had to spend two hours at dinner
last night with that specimen.

102
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,155
-What'd you have?
-Chicken.

103
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,950
How could she look up
to a person...

104
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,457
...who voluntarily
spends time with Bania?

105
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,855
-Marsala?
-Piccata.

106
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,862
If anything,
I should be dating a mentor...

107
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,365
...and Bania should be
setting pins at a bowling alley.

108
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,368
-All right. I got a test to fail.
-Hey, good luck with that.

109
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,803
Thanks. Dad.

110
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,034
What are you,
in an athletic sweat suit?

111
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,439
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,705
He came to get his check
for the banquet hall.

113
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:27,842
You know, I got 1 83 responses.
Oh, it's gonna be a rager.

114
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,884
Kramer, how are you gonna cook
Jewish delicacies for 1 83 people?

115
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,625
You're right. That's a lot of pupiks.

116
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,424
Hey, Frank, you know anybody
who can help me cook?

117
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,327
Cook? No. I don't know any cooks.

118
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,866
I don't know anything
about cooking!

119
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,765
What's the matter with him?

120
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,870
My dad was a cook
during the Korean War.

121
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,476
Something very bad happened.

122
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,909
Ever since,
you can't get him near a kitchen.

123
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,242
-Shell-shocked?
-Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,783
But that has nothing to do with it.

125
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,021
That's good work, guys.
That ought to do it for today.

126
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,418
-Alrighty?
-Wait.

127
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,355
You didn't ask me about my ideas.

128
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,992
Oh, Eddie, well, it's your first day.

129
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,156
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

130
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,666
"It's a hot night. The mind races.

131
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,800
You think about your knife...

132
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,539
...the only friend
who hasn't betrayed you.

133
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,447
The only friend
who won't be dead by sun-up.

134
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:42,859
Sleep tight, mates,
in your quilted chambray nightshirts."

135
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,663
What am I gonna do?
He is a disaster.

136
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,673
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe
he's in line for another promotion.

137
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,412
You know what?
You are exactly right.

138
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,980
That is what I should do.
I should promote him.

139
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,045
I'll give him another office
on another floor, and he can sit there...

140
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,678
...with his nice title
and his bayonet...

141
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,348
...and stop freaking me out.

142
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,663
Nothing at all.

143
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,228
Well, George,
your vision is quite impaired.

144
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,000
If you'll just sign this
insurance form. Here's a pen.

145
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,776
You're a very handsome man,
by the way.

146
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,126
What the hell is going on here?

147
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,795
Look out!

148
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,867
-What are you doing?
-I got three kitchens going.

149
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,836
I got brisket going at Newman's,
I got kugel working at Mrs. Zanfino's...

150
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,378
...and this is kreplach.

151
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,540
Here, try some of this.

152
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,983
-No, I don't want to.
-Eat, eat, you're skin and bones.

153
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,819
-Oh, this is awful.
-Oh, Jerry, it's kreplach.

154
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,463
It's an acquired taste. Yeah.

155
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,972
Did you follow the recipe?

156
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,870
The recipe was for four to six people.

157
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,069
I had to multiply it for 1 83 people.

158
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,510
I guess I got confused.

159
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,078
It tastes like dirt.

160
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,084
Well, I also dropped it
on the way over.

161
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,313
Jerry, I'm in trouble.
I got no skills.

162
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:55,119
I can't peel, I can't chop,
I can't grate, I can't mince.

163
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,592
I got no sense of flavor, obviously.

164
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,532
You know, I gotta talk to Frank.

165
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,531
-Kramer, you can't--
-I gotta talk to him.

166
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,033
I know that he can help me--

167
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,865
I think there's a dead animal
in the elevator.

168
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,405
My stuffed cabbage.

169
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,846
-So great dinner last night.
-Yeah, it was all right.

170
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,540
I told Cynthia we'd double
with her and Bania Saturday...

171
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,982
-...and then catch his act.
-No. No.

172
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,281
-No way. No Bania.
-What?

173
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,915
Have you seen his act? He's got
a 1 2-minute bit about Ovaltine.

174
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,119
He's a pug, a patsy, a hack.

175
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,459
Cynthia would not date a hack.

176
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,725
Would. Does. Is.

177
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,070
Before we get started...

178
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,502
...I am happy to tell you
that Eddie Sherman...

179
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,801
...is no longer writing
for this catalog.

180
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,103
-It's about time.
-He's upstairs.

181
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,678
I made him director
of corporate development.

182
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,907
You promoted him?

183
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,482
Well, no. I would hardly--

184
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,055
-I bust my hump every day.
-Relax.

185
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,250
As far as I'm concerned,
you and your deranged protégé...

186
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,225
...can run the catalog
by yourselves.

187
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,955
I quit!

188
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,360
-I'm with him.
-Me too.

189
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,728
What? Hey.

190
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,764
Hey. Hey!

191
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,235
Chapter one.

192
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,574
In order to manage risk,
we must first understand risk.

193
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,778
How do you spot risk?

194
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,942
How do you avoid risk,
and what makes it so risky?

195
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,146
-This guy sounds just like me.
- To understand risk, we must first...

196
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,382
-...define risk. Risk has...
-This is horrible.

197
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,187
-...existed virtually--
-Stop it. Stop it. Shut up!

198
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,326
Come on, Frank, I need you.

199
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,523
I mean, the war was 50 years ago.

200
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,104
In my mind,
there's a war still going on.

201
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,762
All right, what happened, Frank?

202
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,931
What is it that you can't get over?

203
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,454
Inchon, Korea, 1 950.

204
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,288
I was the best cook
Uncle Sam ever saw.

205
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,292
Slinging hash for the fighting 1 03rd.

206
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,233
As we marched north,
our supply lines were getting thin.

207
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,964
Well, one day,
a couple of Gl's found a crate.

208
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,405
Inside was 600 pounds
of prime Texas steer.

209
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,011
At least, it once was prime.

210
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,113
The use date
was three weeks past.

211
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,418
But I was arrogant. I was brash.

212
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,287
I thought if I used
just the right spices...

213
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,855
...cooked it long enough....

214
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,825
What happened?

215
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,195
I went too far. I overseasoned it.

216
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,102
Men were keeling over
all around me.

217
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,703
I can still hear
the retching and screaming.

218
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,312
Frank!

219
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,992
I sent 1 6 of my own men
to the latrines that night.

220
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,119
They were just boys.

221
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,595
Frank, you were a boy too.

222
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,395
And it was war.
That was a crazy time for everyone.

223
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,504
Tell that to Bobby Colby.

224
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,409
All that kid wanted to do was go home.
Well, he went home, all right.

225
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,373
With a crater in his colon
the size of a cutlet.

226
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,315
They had to sit him on a cork
for the 1 8-hour flight home.

227
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,047
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred
Jewish singles need you.

228
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,657
This is your chance
to make it all right again.

229
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:51,324
No. No. I'll never cook again.

230
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,398
Never! Now get out of my house!

231
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,365
Out. Get out. Go.

232
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,073
So you saw Bania's act.

233
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,170
He got two minutes
into that Ovaltine thing...

234
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,908
...and I just couldn't take it anymore.

235
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,386
I told you. It's like getting beaten
with a bag of oranges.

236
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,915
Why is he so obsessed
with Ovaltine?

237
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,084
He just thinks that anything
that dissolves in milk is funny.

238
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,756
Anyway, Cynthia and I got into
this big argument afterwards...

239
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,727
-...and I think it's over.
-No more mentor?

240
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,532
-Looks that way.
-At least you and I are okay again.

241
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,470
Actually, I was kind of thinking...

242
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,372
...that maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

243
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,773
Why?

244
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,813
Well, I'm feeling a little disoriented.

245
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,611
It's just weird for me
not to have an advisor.

246
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,549
I can tell you what to do.

247
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,087
-It's more than that.
-I can tell you what to think.

248
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,626
I need someone I can trust.

249
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,566
I got a big problem here, Jerry.
The tapes are worthless.

250
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,432
Kind of in the middle
of something here, George.

251
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,813
-George.
-I gotta run anyway.

252
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,008
I can't believe you feel
you really need a mentor.

253
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,178
I just need someone who can give me
some kind of direction.

254
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,589
I'll see you.

255
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,421
Yeah, see you.

256
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,258
-So, what's your problem?
-No problem.

257
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:40,161
I think I got something here
for the Bengalese galoshes.

258
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,276
"It's tough keeping your feet dry...

259
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,676
...when you're kicking in a skull."

260
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,415
You know, Eddie,
that might be just a tad harsh.

261
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,555
For women's wear.

262
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,627
Well, I'm not married to it.

263
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:08,460
Well, in that case,
why don't we take the phrase:

264
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,725
"Kicking in a skull"...

265
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,428
...and we tweak it.

266
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,701
You know, just a hair,
to something like what?

267
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:22,210
Like "strolling through
a dewy meadow."

268
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,549
Dewy meadow.

269
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,984
Here's your omelet.

270
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,557
-It's dry.
-That's the way I always make it.

271
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,586
Well, it sucks.

272
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,565
What did you say?

273
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,601
Your meatloaf is mushy,
your salmon croquettes are oily...

274
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,171
...and your eggplant parmigiana
is a disgrace to this house!

275
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,209
Well, that's too bad, because I'm
the only one who cooks around here.

276
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,837
Not anymore. Give me that spatula.

277
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,648
I'm back, baby!

278
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,952
You're sure, with your schedule,
you'd have time to take on a protégé?

279
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,024
I'll make time. Because, Abby,
I was once like you.

280
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,722
Wide-eyed, naive.

281
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,131
I didn't know the first thing
about a subject as fundamental...

282
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,966
...as risk management.

283
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,439
I'm not familiar with it.
You'll have to explain it.

284
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,373
I'll tell you what.

285
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,536
Why don't you read this book...

286
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,275
...and let's just see
if you can explain it to me.

287
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,319
-All right.
-Okay.

288
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,549
Hey, Jerry.

289
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,481
-Hey, Bania.
-Did you hear what happened?

290
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,457
The mentor saw my act.
She dumped me.

291
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,119
Oh, that's a tough one.

292
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:49,131
Maybe she's right.
Maybe I am a complete hack.

293
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,769
I'm the absolute worst.
The worst, Jerry.

294
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,838
Well, it's just that you got
so many things with the milk.

295
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,669
You got that Bosco bit,
then you got your Nestlé's Quik bit.

296
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,470
By the time you get to Ovaltine--

297
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,341
You think you can give me
a hand with my material?

298
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,356
-You still need a cook?
-Oh, yeah. Come on in, Frank.

299
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,253
-You got T-Fal?
-Calphalon.

300
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,486
-No. Follow me.
-Oh, yeah.

301
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,254
Try that.

302
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,998
"Why do they call it Ovaltine?

303
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,401
The mug is round, the jar is round.

304
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,974
They should call it Roundtine."

305
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,738
That's gold, Jerry. Gold.

306
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:43,044
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel"
and "scar tissue"...

307
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:48,049
...with "string of pearls"
and "raspberry scones."

308
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,393
George Costanza is your mentor?

309
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,726
Yeah. He's great.

310
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,459
I am learning so much.

311
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,901
About what? How to calculate
5 percent of a restaurant check?

312
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,531
You know what your problem is?

313
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,236
You just have no respect
for the protégé-mentor relationship.

314
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,041
As a matter of fact,
I happen to have a protégé of my own.

315
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,683
-Who?
-A Mr. Kenneth Bania.

316
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,549
Bania?

317
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,186
I'm gonna mentor
this kid to the top.

318
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,592
Well, I don't think I wanna date
a mentor whose protégé is a hack.

319
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:29,097
I don't think I wanna date a protégé
whose mentor is a Costanza.

320
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,159
I don't know how...

321
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,464
...but there's some kind of
chemistry between us.

322
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,904
We turned out
one hell of a catalog.

323
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,704
Cool.

324
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,176
Hey, Ed, let me ask you something.

325
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,875
What's with the fatigues
and all the psychotic imagery, huh?

326
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,850
I don't wanna talk about it.

327
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,650
Come on. Don't be a baby.

328
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,690
I went out on a couple of dates
with this woman.

329
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,127
I thought she really liked me.

330
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,792
And then things kind of cooled off.

331
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,033
That's it?

332
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,304
Well, it's tough
meeting somebody you like...

333
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,103
...Iet alone somebody Jewish.

334
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,544
This food is fantastic.

335
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,384
-Have you tried the hamantaschen?
-I can't get off the kishkes.

336
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,492
-Hey, Jerry.
-Bania.

337
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,287
I just stopped by to thank you.

338
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,488
That risk-management stuff
you wrote for me is killer.

339
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,332
Risk management?

340
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,832
It's gold, Jerry. Gold.

341
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,166
I got all these corporate gigs,
and even Cynthia took me back.

342
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,807
So you went from the mailroom...

343
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,808
...to director of corporate
development in two days?

344
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,045
-That's right.
-How much are they paying you?

345
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,511
I'll double it.

346
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,317
-These latkes are going like hotcakes.
-Where's the powdered sugar?

347
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,782
You know, you could take a break.

348
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:03,189
No breaks. I feel reborn.
I'm like a phoenix rising from Arizona.

349
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,691
Quitting?

350
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,459
I can't churn out
that pointless drivel anymore.

351
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,934
What--? You can't quit.
You're all I've got.

352
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,198
I need you.

353
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,505
Gross.

354
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,948
No!

355
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,194
No! Don't eat it. It's no good.

356
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,763
-No good. No good. No way.
-Frank, stop it.

357
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,368
-Stop--
-No. No. No.

358
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,299
Frank!

359
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,142
Our next speaker is George Costanza
on the subject of risk management.

360
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,057
"Ovaltine.

361
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,661
Have you ever had this stuff?

362
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,038
Why do they call it Ovaltine?

363
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,083
They should call it Roundtine.

364
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,353
You know what I'm talking about."

365
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,292
He's my protégé.
