1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,607
Well, it's a magnificent stone.

2
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,516
They put it up this morning.

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,880
It's just a magnificent stone.

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,349
Jerry?

5
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,290
George...

6
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,198
...we'll leave you alone with her.

7
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,461
-What?
-I'm sure there are things...

8
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,866
...you'd like to say.

9
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,537
No, I'm good.

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,109
Really. Jerry?

11
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,711
Jerry?

12
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,161
Thank you, no.

13
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,333
And then right after
the All-Star break we...

14
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,667
...we just swept the Orioles.

15
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,303
Four games.

16
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,945
In Baltimore.

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,074
So....

18
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,452
Boy, that was awkward.

19
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,921
I don't mind the cemetery.

20
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,557
In fact, now I see
why people like golf.

21
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,526
It's just nice to be outside
in a well-landscaped area.

22
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,097
What were you saying
to the Rosses anyway?

23
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,962
Oh, man, I don't know.

24
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,367
I told them, "Her death takes place
in the shadow of new life.

25
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,372
She's not really dead
if we find a way to remember her."

26
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,635
-What is that?
-Star Trek II.

27
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,176
Wrath of Khan.

28
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,474
Right. Kramer and l
saw it last night.

29
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,480
Spock dies.
They wrap him up in a towel...

30
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,610
...and they shoot him out the bowels of
the ship in that big sunglasses case.

31
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,886
It was a hell of a thing
when Spock died.

32
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,193
Yeah.

33
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,532
Well, anyway...

34
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,295
...the stone is up. Paid my respects.

35
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,967
-I guess that's it, huh?
-So it's over?

36
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,974
I have mourned for three long months,
summer months too.

37
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,339
Anybody could grieve in January.

38
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,209
It's time for George
to start being George again.

39
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,213
All right. So let's do something later.

40
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,612
-How about a movie?
-Yes!.

41
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,878
Nothing says "George" like a movie.

42
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,487
-Movie?
-Yeah, you in?

43
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,284
No, no, no, I can't.
I got my martial arts class.

44
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,893
George is going to the movies.

45
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,019
So how's your karate class going?

46
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,665
Karate, Jerry, karate.

47
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,267
It's the lifetime pursuit
of balance and harmony.

48
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,096
But with punching and kicking.

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,899
Jerry.

50
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,006
Karate is not here:

51
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,403
It's here:

52
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,168
And here:

53
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,209
And here:

54
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,042
All right. I gotta go to the airport
and pick up Elaine.

55
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,706
What, she's been away?

56
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,714
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.

57
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,924
I think you're wrong. We just went
to the fireworks the other day.

58
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,184
That was July 4th.

59
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,360
I'm out of here. When I get back
I don't wanna see you here:

60
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,061
Here or here:

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,473
It was unbelievable.

62
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:33,044
Six weeks of traveling through Mexico
all on Peterman's peso.

63
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,204
Did you get any good ideas
for the catalogue?

64
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,315
-Tons.
-Anything you couldn't have gotten...

65
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,714
...tearing open a bag of Doritos
and watching Viva Zapata?

66
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,079
You don't respect my work
at all, do you?

67
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,384
-No, I don't.
-No.

68
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,384
So, what's been going on
around this dump?

69
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,052
How's your fiancée?

70
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,721
My what?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,128
Jeannie? Your fiancée?

72
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,100
Oh, yeah. That.

73
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,570
Well....

74
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,433
All right. Spill it, Jerome.

75
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,272
There's really not that much to tell.

76
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,505
About a month ago
we were here having lunch...

77
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,842
...and all of a sudden we both
just blurted out:

78
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,110
-I hate you.
-I hate you.

79
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,048
-See you.
-See you.

80
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,591
It was unprecedented.
I mean, it was the first...

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,319
...truly mutual breakup
in relationship history.

82
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,986
No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.

83
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,597
You've never felt remorse.

84
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,291
I know. I feel bad about that.

85
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,294
I bet your parents were upset, huh?

86
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,872
-You haven't told them yet, have you?
-No.

87
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,942
So I pressed through the rushes.

88
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,675
There below me, the shimmering
waters of Lake Victoria.

89
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,445
Oh, for the love of God, man.

90
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,316
Just tell me what the product is.

91
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,856
It's a washcloth.

92
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,961
No washcloths.

93
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,188
Well, Mr. Peterman...

94
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,958
...I've got a really good idea
for a hat.

95
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:06,128
Oh, my neck is one
gargantuan monkey fist.

96
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,671
It combines
the spirit of old Mexico...

97
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,401
...with a little big-city...

98
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,805
...panache.

99
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,846
I like to call it the "urban sombrero."

100
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,245
No, no. No pears.

101
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,786
-Mr. Peterman?
-No apples.

102
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,284
Where's my pineapple?

103
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,621
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?

104
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,098
Yes, yes, go on. Go on. Go on.

105
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:41,673
Well, see, it's businessmen
taking siestas.

106
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,242
You know, it's the urban sombrero.

107
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,637
Mr. Peterman?

108
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,275
I'm feeling something,
something I haven't felt for a long time.

109
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,647
-Pride?
-No.

110
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,720
Autonomy, complete
and total autonomy.

111
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,551
Well, you're your own boss now.

112
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,694
-I wanna go to a tractor pull.
-Go ahead.

113
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,523
-I am staying out all night.
-Who's stopping you?

114
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,656
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese,
just bite into it like it's an apple.

115
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,268
Whatever.

116
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,370
-Oh, God.
-What?

117
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,438
-It's Dolores.
-Who?

118
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,632
Mulva.

119
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,437
-Jerry, hi.
-Hi, Dolores.

120
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,102
George, you remember Dolores.

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,907
-Dolores.
-Hi.

122
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,549
I heard you got engaged.

123
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,945
Yes, Dolores, I did.

124
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,144
It didn't work out, though, Dolores.

125
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,652
Oh, that's too bad.

126
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,258
You know, we should
get together some time.

127
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,757
-See you.
-See you.

128
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,952
Bye, Dolores.

129
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,061
I thought Mulva hated you.

130
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,824
Yeah, so did l.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,228
You know what?

132
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,336
I bet it was the engagement.

133
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,904
I've shown I can go all the way.

134
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,973
-All the way?
-Not our all the way.

135
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,370
Their all the way.

136
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,408
I got the stink
of responsibility on me.

137
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,909
You were engaged for a minute.

138
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,447
-I was engaged for a year.
-You stink worse than I do.

139
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,450
I'm feeling
something else here, Jerry.

140
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,788
Elaine, Mr. Peterman on line one.

141
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,481
Hello, Mr. Peterman,
how are you feeling?

142
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,254
Elaine, I'll be blunt.
I'm burnt out. I'm fried.

143
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,331
My mind is as barren
as the surface of the moon.

144
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,531
I can run that catalogue no longer.

145
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,499
What? Who's gonna do it?

146
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,764
-What about you?
-Me?

147
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,773
-Why me?
-Why, indeed.

148
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,209
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.

149
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,745
I've already left, Elaine.

150
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,780
I'm in Burma.

151
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,446
-Burma?
-You most likely know it as Myanmar.

152
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,681
But it will always be Burma to me.

153
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,120
Bonne chance, Elaine.

154
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,855
You there, on the motorbike,
sell me one of your melons.

155
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,662
Mr. Peterman?

156
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,767
-Where?
-Burma.

157
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,402
Isn't it Myanmar now?

158
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,834
Jerry, he wants me
to run the catalogue.

159
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,064
I mean, it's crazy.
I can't be in charge.

160
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,833
No, certainly not.

161
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,603
-I can't give people orders.
-No one's gonna listen to you.

162
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,247
I am not qualified
to run the catalogue.

163
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,680
You're not qualified
to work at the catalogue.

164
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,119
Hey.

165
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,555
-What's wrong?
-Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma.

166
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,624
And now he wants me
to run the catalogue.

167
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,125
-Where?
-Myanmar.

168
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,195
Is that the discount pharmacy?

169
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,432
Well, I'm just going to tell him no.

170
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,034
I can't run the catalogue.

171
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,329
Whoa, "can't"?

172
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,905
When did that word
enter your vocabulary?

173
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,666
What? Is the job too difficult?

174
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,669
What? You don't have
enough experience?

175
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,144
You're not smart enough?

176
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,977
Where's your confidence?

177
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,949
Elaine, let me tell you a story.

178
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,681
-When I first started karate....
-Karate?

179
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,087
Yeah, karate. I had no support.

180
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,060
Not from him,
not from Newman, no one.

181
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,563
First time I sparred
with an opponent I was terrified.

182
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,567
My legs, they were like noodles.

183
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,298
Then I looked inside,
and I found my katra.

184
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,971
-"Katra"?
-Yeah, your spirit, your being.

185
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,113
That part of you
that says, "Yes, I can."

186
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,249
Sammy Davis had it.

187
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:16,921
So I listened to my katra,
and now...I'm dominating the dojo.

188
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,584
I'm class champion.

189
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,890
Well, you know, I have watched
Peterman run the company.

190
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,622
Sure, you have.

191
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,764
I know how to do it.

192
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:33,668
Pair of pants, stupid story,
a huge markup. I can do that.

193
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,605
You follow your katra
and you can do anything.

194
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,005
-Now get out of here.
-Okay.

195
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,410
That kid is gonna be all right.

196
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,244
No, she's not.

197
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,979
Come on, Kramer.

198
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,347
-Hey there.
-Come on.

199
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,684
-Mom's down in the car.
-Okay, Joey.

200
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,291
You have class at the same time?

201
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,587
No, we're in the same class.

202
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,127
You're in the same class?

203
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,424
He almost beat me.

204
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,761
Kramer, you're fighting children?

205
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,662
We're all at the same
skill level, Jerry.

206
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,431
He's 9 years old.

207
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,304
You don't need karate.
You can just wring his neck.

208
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,678
I got car pool.

209
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,013
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.

210
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,384
Hey, can we stop for ice cream
on the way home, Mom?

211
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,851
-I don't know about--
-Please.

212
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,788
-Please, please.
-Please. Please.

213
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,950
-All right.
-Yeah!

214
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,797
You're taking the job?

215
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,489
You got that straight.

216
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,465
Now, I want four new ideas
from each of you by 6:00.

217
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,696
No, make that six ideas by 4:00.

218
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,740
All right. Let's move.
Move! Move! Move!

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,708
Are you prepared for kumite?

220
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,143
-Yes, Sensei.
-Yes, Sensei.

221
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,977
Fighting stance.

222
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,644
Begin.

223
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,995
Winner.

224
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,436
It's open.

225
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,680
-Rosses.
-Hello, George.

226
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,087
Come in. Come in.

227
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,314
We tried to call,
but the line was busy.

228
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,685
Oh, oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

229
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,759
Sit down, please.

230
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,691
Cheese there?

231
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,259
We know the last three months
have been hard on you.

232
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,403
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.

233
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,038
And they've been hard on us too.

234
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,369
It's a terrible tragedy
when parents outlive their children.

235
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,980
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents
go long before I do.

236
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,674
That's why we decided
to create a foundation...

237
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,081
...to preserve Susan's memory.

238
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,551
Oh, that's wonderful.

239
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,487
And, of course, we want you
to be an integral part.

240
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,650
Yes, integ--

241
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,592
How--? How integral?

242
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,425
You'll be on the board of directors.

243
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,830
Great. Great.

244
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:21,029
Oh, oh, oh, gosh,
you know, it's just....

245
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,640
My duties with the Yankees--

246
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,969
Oh, don't worry, George.

247
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,307
The foundation will revolve
around your schedule.

248
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,645
Evening, weekends,
whenever you have free time.

249
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,921
I can't believe this is happening.

250
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,252
Well, it wouldn't have without
your friend Jerry's inspirational words.

251
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:46,460
He said to us, "She's not really
dead if her shadow is--"

252
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,334
-What was it, dear?
-Something about a way, wasn't it?

253
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,903
And a light and a--

254
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,300
Who the hell knows.

255
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,775
But what's important is that
your relationship with Susan...

256
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,708
...doesn't have to end.

257
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,509
So will you be sure
to thank Jerry for us?

258
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,846
The second I see him.

259
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,728
-Hey.
-Hey.

260
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,527
How's your day? Good?

261
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,794
Actually, yeah, I'm meeting Mulva
here in a few minutes.

262
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,869
So...

263
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,131
...Wrath of Khan?

264
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,537
Yeah, was that a beauty or what?

265
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,205
What was that line again? Something
about finding your way in a shadow?

266
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:41,251
No, no, no, it's, "She's not really dead
if we find a way to remember her."

267
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,648
That's it.

268
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,983
That's the line...

269
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,752
...that destroyed my life.

270
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,963
Problem?

271
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,264
The Rosses have started up
a foundation...

272
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,527
...and I have to sit
on the board of directors.

273
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,694
Hey, board of directors, look at you.

274
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,966
Yeah, look at me.
I was free and clear.

275
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,406
I was living the dream.
Stripped to the waist...

276
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,741
...eating a block of cheese
the size of a car battery.

277
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:12,281
Before we go any further, I'd just like
to point out how disturbing it is...

278
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,578
...that you equate
eating a block of cheese...

279
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,313
...with some sort
of bachelor paradise.

280
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,122
Don't you see? I'm back in.

281
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,522
-All because of Wrath of Khan?
-Yes.

282
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,027
Well, it was the best
of those movies.

283
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,866
Khan!

284
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,967
George?

285
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,737
George?

286
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,979
I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of...

287
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,175
-...the Susan Ross Foundation.
-Wink?

288
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,344
-Wyck.
-Wyck.

289
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,149
Now, as you know, the Rosses
had considerable monies.

290
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,657
Well, l-- I know
they have some monies.

291
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,025
They had more than some monies.
Many, many monies.

292
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,996
And they planned to give
a sizable portion of their estate...

293
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,501
...to you and Susan
after the wedding.

294
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,633
So if Susan and I had--

295
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:13,471
I mean, if the envelopes hadn't....

296
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,841
-Then we....
-Yes.

297
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,347
-And now?
-Not.

298
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,345
It's all been endowed
to the foundation.

299
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,489
-Even this townhouse.
-This townhouse?

300
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,818
Yes, this would
have been your wedding gift.

301
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,289
-And now?
-Not.

302
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,757
Not.

303
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,655
Also endowed.

304
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,500
George, I know how much
Susan meant to you.

305
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,069
This can't be easy.

306
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,331
You know, it really can't.

307
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,370
So who broke it off?

308
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,135
That's the thing. It was mutual.

309
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,644
Oh, come on. Everybody knows
there's no such thing...

310
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,304
...as a mutual breakup.

311
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,541
-Tell me the truth.
-I am.

312
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,185
It was the world's first.

313
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,785
You know, when
I heard you got engaged...

314
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,949
...I thought maybe you'd matured,
but obviously there's no growth here.

315
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:05,119
I can't argue with that, but the fact
remains I was completely....

316
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,463
Mulva.

317
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,303
-Hello.
-Please hold for Elaine Benes.

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,971
Oh, I don't believe this.

319
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,345
-Jerry?
-Hey.

320
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,319
Hey, guess who just finished
laying out her first issue...

321
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,321
...of the J. Peterman Catalogue.

322
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,982
-How does it look?
-It's a peach.

323
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,493
-What's that?
-I say, it's a peach.

324
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,599
Let me ask you something. When
I told you my breakup was mutual...

325
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,530
-...did you believe me?
-No, no, no.

326
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,069
It's weak. No one's gonna buy it,
and you shouldn't be selling it.

327
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,900
I gotta do some research here.

328
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,339
Hey, hey. Me, talking?

329
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,839
You know...

330
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,914
...between you and me...

331
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:01,109
...I always thought Kramer
was a bit of a doofus.

332
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,880
But he believed in me.

333
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,284
You did not.

334
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,756
So as I see it,
he's not the doofus...

335
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,020
...you are the doofus.

336
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,130
-Oh, I'm the doofus?
-Yes.

337
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,893
You, Jerry, are the doofus.

338
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,800
You know, it occurs to me
that Kramer is at karate right now.

339
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,108
Well, maybe I'll just go down there
and thank him in person.

340
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,369
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

341
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,108
Kramer?

342
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,618
-Elaine.
-What are you doing?

343
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,279
Well, I'm-- I'm dominating.

344
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,220
You never said
you're fighting children.

345
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,419
Well, it's not the size
of the opponent, Elaine.

346
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,894
It's the ferocity.

347
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,691
This is what you used
to build me up?

348
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,462
This is where you got
all that stupid "katra" stuff?

349
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,630
No, no, no, that's from Star Trek III.

350
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,337
-The Search for Spock.
-Search for Spock?

351
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,413
Yeah, yeah, I know. Jerry will tell you
that the Wrath of Khan...

352
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,109
-...is the better picture, but for me, l--
-You doofus.

353
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,887
Okay, question number eight:

354
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,461
What if I told you my fiancée
left me for another man?

355
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,793
Does that make me more likable,
less likable, as likable?

356
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,434
Let's start over here this time.

357
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,326
More.

358
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,165
Less.

359
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,706
-Same.
-Are we about through here?

360
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,676
I thought you said your mom
was meeting us in the alley.

361
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,218
She had a little change of plans.

362
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,852
What's going on?

363
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,787
Hey, Timmy, Clara.

364
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,062
That was some kind of workout
we had tonight, huh?

365
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,857
Now we finish it.

366
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,866
Get him.

367
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,900
Mama!

368
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,069
I wouldn't eat anything
you caught in that pond...

369
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,302
...out in front of the condo.

370
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,937
All right. Look, Elaine's here.
I gotta get going.

371
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,211
By the way, I'm not getting married.
Tell Mom. Bye.

372
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,881
So....

373
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,155
-Did you stop by the dojo?
-Yup.

374
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,491
-How's your confidence level?
-Shot.

375
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,657
-Self-esteem?
-Gone.

376
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,167
Doofus?

377
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,065
All right. So what?

378
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,538
You put out the catalogue.
How bad could it be?

379
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,083
What is that?

380
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,376
The urban sombrero.

381
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,513
I put it on the cover.

382
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,627
Well, nobody sees the cover.

383
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,190
What happened to you?

384
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,991
I got whupped.

385
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,933
You should have seen
the rage in their little eyes.

386
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,868
And those tiny little fists of fury.

387
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,770
What is that?

388
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,944
It's the new cover
of the J. Peterman catalogue.

389
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,876
It is Elaine's choice.

390
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,277
Let's congratulate her.

391
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,554
This is all your fault.

392
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,712
You told me
I could run the company.

393
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,950
Well, then I was way off.

394
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,154
Well, I'll see you.

395
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,158
I gotta go lay down.

396
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,893
Are you and George
going out later?

397
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,731
No, he's still stuck
at the foundation.

398
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,873
You ought to go down there
and help him out.

399
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,473
He's a widower.

400
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,009
Widower? Wait a second.

401
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,882
Okay, let's see. The beach house,
48 acres, Southampton.

402
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,780
That should fetch a fair price.

403
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,584
-Would I have had access to that?
-Of course. Would have been yours.

404
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,247
And now?

405
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,756
Not.

406
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,520
Got it.

407
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,194
-Hello.
-Hey, Georgie.

408
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,234
I'm doing some research
at the coffee shop.

409
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,837
Your story's the one.

410
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,701
-My story?
-Yeah, your widower story...

411
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,432
...has tested through the roof.

412
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,737
When are you getting out of there?

413
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,278
Excuse me, Wyck,
are we almost done here?

414
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,681
No, no, not even close.

415
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,787
I can't go.

416
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,723
What do you mean, you can't go?

417
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,228
There's two really cute girls sitting
at the counter eating grilled cheese.

418
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,696
Cheese, George.

419
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,858
Cheese.

420
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,301
Okay, next item,
Susan's doll collection.

421
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,067
Estimated value, 2.6 million.

422
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,303
What do you say
we go through this doll by doll.

423
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,320
It was nothing unusual.

424
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,692
Every afternoon
for the last 24 years...

425
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,664
...I'd shut the door to my office
and sneak a little shuteye.

426
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,326
No one was the wiser.

427
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:23,838
But then my wife
gets me this urban sombrero.

428
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,978
The next thing I know,
my ass is out on the street.

429
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,976
I tried one too.

430
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,275
I woke up and found
my walking papers tacked to the brim.

431
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,612
Stupid J. Pendleton.

432
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,617
It's "Peterman."

433
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,087
It's J. Peterman.

434
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,857
I never thought
a hat would destroy my life.
