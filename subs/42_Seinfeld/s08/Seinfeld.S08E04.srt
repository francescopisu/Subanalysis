1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,768
-I wouldn't walk over there.
-Why not?

2
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,341
Because it's the most dangerous part
of the sidewalk.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,137
A cab hops a curb:

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,473
You've had your last egg sandwich.

5
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:18,208
What about over there? You know,
air conditioners fall out all the time.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,321
I'd much rather get hit by an 80-pound
air conditioner than a two-ton cab.

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,014
No, no, cab's coming up right here.

8
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,920
Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs...

9
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,527
...a monkey to answer the phone,
I'm back in business.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,190
I'd much rather take one in the head,
like I did in '79.

11
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,335
You were living
in the Village then, right?

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,302
I don't really remember.

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,406
Toxic-waste green.

14
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,278
That is disgusting.

15
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,979
You know, revulsion has now become
a valid form of attraction.

16
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,454
Well, then, you're driving me wild.

17
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,426
I had them done for
the big Peterman bash I'm throwing.

18
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,891
Why are you having a party?

19
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,328
Oh, I drive my people hard,
and then I reward them.

20
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,660
-Like with dogs.
-Yeah, exactly.

21
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,234
Party?

22
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,169
-Yeah.
-Food?

23
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,907
-Bar?
-Yeah.

24
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,703
George?

25
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,245
He's gonna show up anyway.

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,473
George, I just don't
want you interfering.

27
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,709
How could I possibly interfere?

28
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,785
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?

29
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,754
These are fantastic. Fantastic.

30
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,194
You know, I'd love to get a jump
on the next batch.

31
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,094
Where do you come out of?

32
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,563
She's been ignoring this section
all evening.

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,207
-Quesadilla?
-No thanks.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,444
-Hi, my name is George.
-Anna.

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,877
I don't recall seeing you
around the office.

36
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,384
Do you work in the mailroom?

37
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,854
Not quite. I-- I'm a friend
of Elaine Benes.

38
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,789
Oh, that's nice. Excuse me.

39
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,623
So....

40
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,598
How about leading us in a toast?

41
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,994
Oh, sure.

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,999
Hey, guys, I wanna make a toast.

43
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,967
Here's to those who wish us well...

44
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,634
...and those who don't
can go to hell.

45
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,274
All right. Who's dancing?

46
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,679
Come on, who's dancing?

47
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,879
You want--? You want me to get it
started? I'll get it started. All right.

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,404
Come on, guys.
What's the holdup?

49
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,409
Sweet, fancy Moses.

50
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,250
Hey. You get the tickets?

51
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,915
-Who needs two?
-Oh, mamacita! Let me see them.

52
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,719
Special sneak preview
of Death Blow.

53
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,489
Death Blow. When someone
tries to blow you up...

54
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,155
...not because of who you are...

55
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,927
...but because
of different reasons altogether.

56
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,565
Yeah? Come on up.

57
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,106
Hey, Jerry, you think you could get
an extra ticket for my friend Brody?

58
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,210
Know what I had to go
through to get these?

59
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,209
But he's a big fan of the genre.

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,281
You know, I'd consider it
a personal favor to me.

61
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,778
Yeah, I guess I do owe you. Yeah.

62
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,087
Listen, you want me to stay here
till George gets up?

63
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,954
-No, I'm okay.
-There's no problem, really.

64
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,492
I'm fine.

65
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,861
-He's right in there, boy.
-Yeah, okay.

66
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,523
Hey, how was the party?

67
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,096
The food was good.

68
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,794
Yeah, so, I didn't miss anything?

69
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,136
Well, actually, you did miss
one little nugget of entertainment.

70
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,102
Have you ever seen Elaine dance?

71
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,980
Elaine danced?

72
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,080
It was more like a full-body
dry heave set to music.

73
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,152
Did she do the little kicks
and the thumbs?

74
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,288
-Wait, you mean you know about this?
-For some time.

75
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,097
It was about five years ago.

76
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,006
I never knew what to say to her
about it.

77
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,043
It was one of those problems
I hoped would just go away.

78
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,380
Well, sometimes you can't help
these people till they hit rock bottom.

79
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,043
And by then you've lost interest.

80
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:54,955
Take a ride with me later.
I borrowed my father's car, '68 GTO.

81
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,459
What made him get that thing?

82
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,121
Well, during that period when my folks
were separated, he went a little crazy.

83
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,491
Not a very long trip.

84
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,099
-Brody's in.
-I don't even have the extra ticket yet.

85
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,763
Well, you better get on the horn.

86
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,669
I'm telling you, Jerry,
I'm getting a vibe.

87
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,248
If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff
completely lost respect for me.

88
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,009
How could that be?

89
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,884
Well, Jerry, I mean,
it's like the feeling is palpable.

90
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,048
Could it have something
to do with the party?

91
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,716
No, George was there.
He said he had a great time.

92
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,160
It's George. I bet you this is
somehow George-related.

93
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,392
-Oh, what are you talking about?
-He's like a virus.

94
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,833
He attaches himself
to a healthy host company...

95
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,668
...and the next thing you know,
the entire staff is infected.

96
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,173
Now you're talking crazy.

97
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,677
All right. Then, Jerry, if that's not
what it is, you tell me. What is it?

98
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,283
There's my call waiting,
I gotta get going. Bye-bye.

99
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,351
Have a minute
to approve some copy?

100
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,857
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

101
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,389
So did you have a good time
at the party last night?

102
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,296
It was a real kick.

103
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,371
Hey, did you happen to speak
to my friend George?

104
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,201
As a matter of fact, I did.

105
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,107
Well, listen, you would be wise
to keep your distance from him.

106
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,042
Why? He seems harmless.

107
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,809
Oh, he's not. He's very harmful.

108
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,185
-Really?
-Oh, trust me.

109
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,014
He's a bad seed,
he's a horrible seed.

110
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,156
He's one of the worst seeds
I've ever seen.

111
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,983
And you two are friends?

112
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,888
Yeah, we're good friends.

113
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,231
So this Anna called me
from out of the blue.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,234
-Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
-With extreme prejudice.

115
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,373
-Maybe Elaine put in a good word.
-No, no. See, that's the thing.

116
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,271
Anna told me Elaine said I was one
of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.

117
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,242
Interesting.
She doesn't care for you.

118
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,847
Then a stern warning.

119
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,414
Suddenly a phone call.

120
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,279
Seems Elaine's made you
the bad boy.

121
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,423
And Anna digs the bad boy.

122
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,692
I'm the bad boy.

123
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,624
I've never been the bad boy.

124
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,494
You've been the bad employee,
the bad son, the bad friend.

125
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,464
Yes. Yes, yes.

126
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,968
The bad fiancé, bad dinner guest,
bad credit risk.

127
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,366
Okay, the point is made.

128
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,941
The bad date, the bad sport,
the bad citizen.

129
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,777
The bad tipper.

130
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,610
Half of show business is here.

131
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:35,151
Oh, there's Brody. Brody, over here.

132
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,612
-Hey, Kramer.
-Yeah.

133
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,987
And you must be Jerry.
Thanks for the ticket.

134
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,890
That's quite a feedbag
you're working on there.

135
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,894
It's for all of us. Is there a problem?

136
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,831
Brody. Brody, come on,
he's just kidding.

137
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,801
He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.

138
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,634
I'm a joke maker.

139
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,440
All right, here we go.

140
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,671
Death Blow.

141
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,856
Hey.

142
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,823
What the hell is he doing?

143
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,485
Relax, he does that all the time.

144
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,130
Does what?

145
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,861
He's making a copy of the movie
for sale on the street.

146
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,998
May I see you outside
for a moment, please?

147
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,473
-No, I want to watch the movie.
-Outside!

148
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,168
Come on.

149
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,679
-Hey, have you seen Anna?
-Just left to meet your friend George.

150
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,009
To meet George?

151
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,514
I knew it. Where did they go?

152
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
-The park, why?
-Don't you see?

153
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,011
George is in the bloodstream.

154
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,554
You stay away from him too.

155
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,420
What do you mean,
bootlegging the movie?

156
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,528
It's a perfectly legitimate business.

157
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,028
-It's not legitimate.
-It's a business.

158
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,394
-Where did you meet this guy?
-Friend of a friend.

159
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,502
You know Corky Ramirez
up on 94th Street?

160
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,535
One day he and l
are playing pachinko--

161
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,036
Kramer.

162
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,876
Man, we're missing the deathblow!

163
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,071
I don't believe it.

164
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,381
You know, I'm not supposed to be
talking to you.

165
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,716
No one's putting a gun
to your head.

166
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,557
Do I scare you?

167
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,324
No.

168
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,993
A little.

169
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,500
Nice car.

170
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,272
Yeah.

171
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,904
She's a sweet ride.

172
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,407
Is that your orthopedic back pillow?

173
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,079
Maybe.

174
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,517
Well, is it, or isn't it?

175
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,644
I guess not.

176
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,684
-Stay away from her.
-Hey, I didn't do nothing.

177
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,088
-Get in the car.
-But--

178
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,254
You heard me, young lady.
Get in the car.

179
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,730
And you! You should know better.

180
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,096
I don't want you infecting my staff.

181
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,334
Lighten up.

182
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,851
Go get them, Death Blow.

183
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,356
So, Death Blow, we meet again.

184
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,788
Are you okay?

185
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,953
I got a cramp.

186
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,996
Well, it's no wonder.
You ate that entire bag of candy.

187
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,467
There it goes again.

188
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,401
Kramer, you gotta drive me home.

189
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,802
What is going on over here?

190
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,205
Jerry, finish shooting
the movie for me.

191
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,642
Are you nuts? No way
I'm holding that thing.

192
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,804
Jerry, the man is in pain.

193
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,712
If he didn't lick his fingers
before reaching in the bag...

194
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,115
...we would have eaten some.
Serves him right.

195
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,089
What are you, some kind
of tough guy?

196
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,658
Okay. Let's everybody just relax.

197
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,860
-Jerry, take the camera.
-All right, I'm taking the camera.

198
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,557
All right, come on, let's go.
Thanks, buddy.

199
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,165
Oh, man.

200
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,536
Hey.

201
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,005
So how was the rest
of Death Blow?

202
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,741
How was the rest of Death Blow?

203
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,215
Who got the final deathblow?

204
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,877
I thought that Hawaiian guy
had it coming to him, huh?

205
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,115
You make me get a ticket
for this friend...

206
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,260
...and then the guy forces me
to bootleg a movie at gunpoint?

207
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,555
He's quite a character, isn't he?

208
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,927
He came by here last night at 3:00
in the morning to pick up the tape.

209
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,533
I was scared out of my mind.

210
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,459
I'll get it.

211
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,133
-Yup.
-It's Brody.

212
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,070
Yeah, come on up.
It's Brody, he's coming.

213
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,710
What? Are you crazy?
I don't want to see this guy again.

214
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,209
Jerry, you did him a favor.

215
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,041
He probably wants to thank you.

216
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,944
What if I didn't do it right?

217
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,085
It's your first time. He'll understand.

218
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,846
People with guns don't understand.

219
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,991
That's why they get guns.
Too many misunderstandings.

220
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,092
-Hey, Brody.
-Hi.

221
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,320
Jerry, I have to talk to you
about the tape.

222
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,489
-Yeah.
-I've never seen such beautiful work.

223
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,658
-What?
-You're a genius.

224
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,397
The zoom-ins, the framing,
I was enchanted.

225
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,873
Well...

226
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,476
...I did the best I could.

227
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,074
I got another project for you.
Here, go ahead.

228
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,807
It's a movie called Cry, Cry Again.

229
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,283
I was gonna give it to one of my
other guys, but it's an arty movie...

230
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,423
...and quite frankly,
they don't have the sensibility.

231
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,389
-May I use your phone?
-Yeah, yeah. It's under the couch.

232
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,928
Look at you.
You got another gig, huh?

233
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,036
I don't want another gig.

234
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,535
I'm not doing this.

235
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,005
But you have a gift. Look, Jerry,
this is not your little comedy act.

236
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,144
We're talking feature films here.

237
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,370
We're talking federal crime here.

238
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,684
I'll expect that tape
by 3:00 tomorrow.

239
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,580
-May I borrow this, please?
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

240
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,553
You need a glove?

241
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,591
"l pressed through the rushes,
and there...

242
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,665
...the native dancers whirled
before me...

243
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,463
...Iimbs flailing, arms akimbo...

244
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,731
...feet kicking up dust."

245
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,206
What? What is so funny?

246
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,708
Sorry, I got hung up.

247
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,745
At Yankee Stadium.

248
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,412
This? It's mine.

249
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,145
Oh, really? Because it looks
a little big for you.

250
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,484
It looks like something
a short, stocky...

251
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,786
...slow-witted, bald man...

252
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,722
...might wear.

253
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,497
He's not stocky.

254
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,601
Who did that? Who did that?

255
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,010
The French guy fell off his bike.

256
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,181
Oh, man, that's precious.

257
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,946
No, no, no...

258
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,353
...no, no, no.

259
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,460
What were you thinking
when you shot this?

260
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,461
-What? That's fine.
-You know what this scene is about?

261
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,031
Yeah, it's about a guy
buying a loaf of bread.

262
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,828
No. Bread is his soul.

263
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,803
He's trying to buy back
a loaf of his soul.

264
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,067
Wha-- Where?

265
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,069
No way you're giving this tape
to Brody and telling him I shot it.

266
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,808
-He's not gonna know the difference.
-I don't care about Brody.

267
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,474
I was up on 96th Street today.

268
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,621
There was a little kid, couldn't
have been more than 1 0 years old.

269
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,586
He was asking a street vendor
if he had any other bootlegs...

270
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,318
...that looked as good
as Death Blow.

271
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,289
That's who I care about.

272
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,658
The little kid who needs bootlegs...

273
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,232
...because his parent
or guardian won't let him see...

274
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,063
...the excessive violence
and strong sexual content...

275
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,000
...you and I take for granted.

276
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,070
So you'll do the movie?

277
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,574
Oh. Oh, man. I sat in gum.

278
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,945
I have to.

279
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,648
But I'm gonna need
to storyboard this whole thing.

280
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,478
-Where are my Magic Markers?
-Right here.

281
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:25,022
Well, I have lost
complete control of my staff.

282
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,181
Why did I let George go
to that party?

283
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,456
I mean, we were
having so much fun.

284
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,530
I mean, we were wining,
we were dining, we were dancing.

285
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,234
Please.

286
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,340
-What?
-This...thing.

287
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,444
-It's dancing.
-No, no. That ain't dancing, sally.

288
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,204
I dance fine.

289
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,506
You stink.

290
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,682
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

291
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,825
Jerry?

292
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,628
Jerry?

293
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,724
I'm a good dancer, right?

294
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,029
I forgot to make my bed.

295
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,739
Jerry, do I stink?

296
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,406
All right. You're beyond stink.

297
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,175
But I really enjoy dancing.

298
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,750
And that's not helping either.

299
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,554
That's why you're having trouble with
your staff, not because of George.

300
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,658
It's that bad?

301
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,225
Have you ever seen yourself?

302
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,563
Please, please.
Not in my home.

303
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,959
I gotta throw this stuff in the laundry.
I'll be right back.

304
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,947
I have George Costanza
still holding.

305
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,273
George, hi.

306
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,015
I have Anna here. There's something
I want to say to both of you.

307
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,449
Yo, Anna.

308
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,056
Hi, George, what are you up to?

309
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,058
You don't wanna know.

310
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,224
Well, listen, I feel
really horrible about...

311
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,395
...trying to keep you two apart,
and I just wanted to apologize.

312
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,267
What--? What are you
talking about?

313
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,899
Well, George, I just want you
to hear me say to Anna...

314
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,774
...that you're a good
and decent person.

315
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,608
Pick up the phone, Elaine.
Pick it up.

316
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,978
I never should have given Anna
the impression...

317
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,744
-Pick it up!
-...you're a bad seed...

318
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,251
...I mean, you're a fine seed.

319
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,980
Elaine, get off the speaker!

320
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,826
-What?
-You are ruining everything.

321
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,486
What? I'm trying to help.
Why are you being so difficult?

322
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,997
Yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that.
Difficult, I'm a difficult seed.

323
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,329
George, I don't have time for this.

324
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,801
Anna, do you want to
talk to George?

325
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,233
-No, I don't think so.
-No, she doesn't want to.

326
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,037
-Okay. Bye, George, we'll see you.
-I'm a bad man.

327
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,981
So where's the tape?

328
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,142
Oh, no, I didn't shoot this one.
I'm just scouting the location.

329
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,885
-I need the tape.
-You'll get your tape.

330
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:14,617
But here's what I need.
I'm gonna need three cameras...

331
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,660
...two on the floor, one in the balcony,
and I want headsets...

332
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,095
...for the guys running them.
I want to be able to talk to them.

333
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,524
Are you out of your mind?

334
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,637
-Kramer, l-- You know....
-Yeah. I know, Jerry, it's okay.

335
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,263
Yeah, look, Brody,
Jerry wants to do the bootleg.

336
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,934
He's dying to do it, but if you don't
make him happy, the work suffers...

337
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,206
...and then nobody's happy.

338
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,013
Just shoot the damn thing
so I can get it out on the street.

339
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,176
All right, that's it.
I can't work like this.

340
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,719
-Jerry--
-I'm off the project.

341
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,186
Jerry!

342
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,392
-I want the tape.
-Yeah, l-- I know.

343
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,965
Well, I'm the good boy again.

344
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,362
Can you believe that?

345
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,197
They think they can get anyone
to shoot these bootlegs.

346
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,101
Anna actually has respect
for me now.

347
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,764
It's all over.

348
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,400
The whole business has changed.
It's all about money now.

349
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,173
The sad thing is,
it's the kids that suffer.

350
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,010
Listen, man, you gotta shoot
this movie for me.

351
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,020
Brody, he's a reasonable man,
but he's insane.

352
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,420
I'm not doing this anymore.
I don't know what I was thinking.

353
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,527
It's illegal, it's dangerous....

354
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,260
Did you say dangerous?

355
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,556
I'm a bootlegger.

356
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,362
-You're a what?
-Bootlegging a movie, baby.

357
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,970
Isn't that illegal?

358
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:37,097
I could do hard time for this one.
And community service.

359
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,167
Is this your FiberCon?

360
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,175
Get out of my way!

361
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,418
Jerry, George got arrested.

362
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,647
-What?
-Yeah. He went down at the Beekman.

363
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,621
He tried to lam,
but they cheesed him.

364
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,756
Oh, now I see.

365
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,595
-Yeah?
-It's Brody. I'm coming up.

366
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,995
What are we gonna do?

367
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,863
Well, I gotta give him something.

368
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,664
Come on. Where's that tape I shot?

369
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,169
I think that's it.

370
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,331
Let's check it out.

371
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,385
Sweet, fancy Moses.

372
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,060
Jerry, she taped over
the whole ending.

373
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,027
-Where's the tape?
-Well, it's--

374
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,565
-ls that it?
-Yeah, yeah.

375
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,532
Here it is, Brody.

376
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,766
One copy of Cry, Cry Again.

377
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,169
How'd it turn out?

378
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,640
-Great.
-Great, yeah.

379
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,837
Although the whole story
kind of comes apart at the end there.

380
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,983
Out of nowhere there's this lone
dancer who appears to be injured.

381
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,015
Yeah. It's a disturbing image.

382
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,020
Yeah. So you cry,
and then when you see the dancing...

383
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,521
...you cry again.

384
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,023
It's all right, George.
You'll just pay a fine, and that'll be it.

385
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,466
Why did the policeman
have to yell at me like that?

386
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,368
-Anna.
-Oh, thanks for coming to pick me up.

387
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,201
-I can explain everything.
-All right.

388
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,105
We'll talk about it at the office.

389
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,577
-Okay, where's my boy?
-Oh, my God.

390
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,381
I'm sitting at home reading
a periodical, and this is the call I get?

391
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,645
My son is a bootlegger?

392
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,322
Ow, Dad!

393
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,324
-Who put you up to this? Was it her?
-All right.

394
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,393
Wait, I think
you've got it backwards.

395
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,052
George isn't clever enough
to hatch a scheme like this.

396
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,792
-You got that right.
-What the hell does that mean?

397
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,732
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

398
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,735
You saying you want a piece of me?

399
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,835
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.

400
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,612
You want a piece of me?

401
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,043
You got it!

402
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,321
But he's an old man, Elaine.

403
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,791
Well, he wrote the check,
and I cashed it.

404
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,396
Look, here's that bootlegged
Death Blow that I shot.

405
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,591
-Cry, Cry Again, I want to see that.
-No, you don't.

406
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,668
-You shot Death Blow?
-Yeah.

407
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,771
-lt was brilliant.
-Thank you.

408
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,930
-You were big.
-I'm still big.

409
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,474
It's the bootlegs that got small.

410
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,272
-How are things at the office? Normal?
-Yeah, pretty much.

411
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,779
Although I still get the vibe
every once in a while.

412
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,042
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
