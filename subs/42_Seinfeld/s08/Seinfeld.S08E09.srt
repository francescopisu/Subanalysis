1
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,807
Say me, you and Kramer
are flying over the Andes.

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,568
Why are we flying over the Andes?

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,942
We got a soccer game in Chile.
Anyway, the plane crashes.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,551
-Who are you gonna eat to survive?
-Kramer.

5
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,518
-So fast? What about me?
-No.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,523
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:31,096
Kramer's got more muscle, higher
protein content. It's better for you.

8
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,325
-Well, I would eat you.
-That's very nice, I guess.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,732
Why wouldn't you eat me?
I'm your best friend.

10
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,168
If other people are having some,
I'll try you.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,137
Thank you.

12
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,833
-Can I have a piece of that?
-No.

13
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,214
George, I can't have sex.

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,124
With me, or in general?

15
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,354
I went to the doctor today.
I have mono.

16
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,362
Nucleosis?

17
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,060
-I hope that's not a problem for you.
-No, no.

18
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,306
So how long is this not gonna be
a problem for me?

19
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,546
-Six weeks?
-Yeah, six weeks.

20
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,738
So what?
You've gone six weeks before.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,544
I can do six weeks
standing on my head.

22
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:29,279
I'm like a sexual camel.
That's not the point.

23
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,583
At least there was the possibility.

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,851
-You gonna break up with her?
-I don't know.

25
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,291
-I don't wanna be one of those guys.
-What guys?

26
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,454
Like us.

27
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,566
-So it's just mono.
-Mono?

28
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,793
Well, if anybody needs
any medical advice...

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,066
...Laney met a doctor,
and he's unattached.

30
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,971
I thought the whole dream
of dating a doctor was debunked?

31
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:54,671
No, it's not debunk. It's totally bunk.

32
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,316
Isn't bunk bad?
Like, "that's a lot of bunk"?

33
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,543
No, something is bunk,
then you debunk it.

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,085
-What?
-I think.

35
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:10,552
Lookit. I'm dating a doctor, and I like it.
Let's just move on.

36
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,333
-Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
-Jerry.

37
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,231
Something came up for Tuesday
at the Dayton Civic Centre.

38
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,770
-That's Ohio, Jerry.
-I've heard of Ohio, Katie...

39
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,103
...but Tuesday's no good.
I'm doing Career Day at my junior high.

40
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,608
Okay, Jerry, that's fine.

41
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,439
-All right.
-Katie works for Jerry.

42
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,811
-Yes, all right, Katie. Thank you. Yes.
-Sorry for the late notice.

43
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,781
-Bye. Bye.
-Okay, you're the--

44
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,858
-They asked you to do Career Day?
-Yeah, it's no big thing.

45
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,788
With due respect, I went there...

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,121
...and I work for
a World Series-winning team.

47
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,161
And you were integral.

48
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,938
Jerry, so nice of you
to come down here.

49
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,303
I'm on next, right?

50
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,675
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Amiry,
from the Bronx Zoo....

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,045
-The guy with the lizard?
-Yes.

52
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:10,178
Well, he started feeding it crickets,
and the children just love him...

53
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,983
...and we're out of time.

54
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,058
So can you come back tomorrow?

55
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,133
I'm getting bumped?
You're bumping me from Career Day?

56
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,803
So do most doctors like ER,
or do you guys just think it's fake?

57
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,000
I couldn't tell you.
You know, I'm not really a doctor.

58
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,974
Then I'm not really attracted you.

59
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,642
I'm serious, Elaine.
I went to med school...

60
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,981
...but I still have to pass
my licensing exam.

61
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,884
When do you take this exam?

62
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,426
I've taken it three times.
I almost passed the last one.

63
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,531
But you're basically a doctor.
I mean, people do call you doctor?

64
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,429
-Well....
-Can I introduce you as doctor?

65
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,400
-Yeah.
-All right. That's all I wanted to know.

66
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,040
Mono.

67
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,102
It was fantastic.

68
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,578
-We wound up talking all night.
-You're enjoying the not enjoying.

69
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:14,186
You know, just by conversing, you can
really learn a lot about a person.

70
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,946
I'm finding that out.

71
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,846
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

72
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,252
How was Career Day?

73
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,986
I didn't get on.
The lizard guy went long.

74
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:28,357
-You got bumped from Career Day?
-lt was a mix-up, I'm sure.

75
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,133
Sounds like they're trying to
screw with your head.

76
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,207
Now, why would a junior high school
wanna screw with my head?

77
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,742
Why does Radio Shack
ask for your phone number...

78
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,141
...when you buy batteries?

79
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,546
I don't know.

80
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,281
Hey, hey.
Kramer, what are you doing?

81
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,083
-You can't smoke in here.
-Oh, go on.

82
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:57,218
-Hey, take it outside.
-Come on, Larry. You know me.

83
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,059
It bothers people,
and it's against the law.

84
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,634
You can make all the laws you want.
He's still gonna bother people.

85
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,981
-What, did they kick you out too?
-Yeah, they kicked us all out.

86
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,614
Thanks for coming back.
Graham cracker?

87
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,757
No, let's just do it.

88
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,586
What? What is going on?
What is that about?

89
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,628
Fire drill. Sorry.
Single file, everyone.

90
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,427
-But I was promised a slot.
-Single file, Jerry.

91
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,434
Fire drill. You believe that?

92
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,477
-Who is Pericles?
-Pericles is correct.

93
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,774
Like fire in a school
is such a big deal.

94
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,310
-You got any matches?
-Middle drawer.

95
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,420
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

96
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,556
We were looking for
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

97
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,089
Thanks.

98
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,190
-Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
-Jerry.

99
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,058
I heard what happened at the school.
They can't bump you.

100
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,997
-That is so unprofessional.
-Oh, relax, Katie. It's not a problem.

101
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,227
-What is Borax?
-Yes, you are right.

102
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,928
They bump you in junior high...

103
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,473
...next, you're being bumped in
high schools, colleges, trade schools.

104
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,543
Before you know it,
Letterman won't return your calls.

105
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,204
-You got an ashtray?
-I don't have any ashtrays.

106
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,441
Cereal bowls.

107
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,812
Jerry, don't freak out.
I'll take care of you.

108
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,318
-Katie, don't--
-All right. Thanks.

109
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,883
What is tungsten or wolfram?

110
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,721
We were looking for:
What is tungsten or wolfram?

111
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,959
Is this a repeat?

112
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,866
No, no, no. Just lately
I've been thinking a lot clearer.

113
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,029
Like this afternoon--
What is chicken Kiev?

114
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:52,473
--I really enjoyed watching
a documentary with Louise.

115
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,943
Louise. That's what's doing it.

116
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,645
You're no longer preoccupied with sex,
so your mind is able to focus.

117
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,415
-You think?
-Yeah. Let's say this is your brain.

118
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,185
Okay?
Now, from what I know about you...

119
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,852
...your brain consists of two parts.

120
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,692
The intellect, represented here...

121
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,060
...and the part obsessed with sex.

122
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,763
Now, granted...

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,434
...you have extracted an astonishing
amount from this little scrap.

124
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,877
But with no-sex Louise,
this previously useless lump...

125
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,985
...is now functioning
for the first time in its existence.

126
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,518
Oh, my God.

127
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,956
I just remembered where I left
my retainer in second grade.

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,789
I'll see you later.

129
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,300
-Hey, I need some more matches.
-What is going on in there?

130
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,563
I met some people smoking
on the street...

131
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,104
...so I invited them
up to my apartment to smoke.

132
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,107
-Why?
-Somebody had to.

133
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,735
Just because a person's a smoker
doesn't mean he's not a human being.

134
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,347
It doesn't?

135
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,076
These people aren't gonna
let themselves be flicked...

136
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,776
...into the ashbin of society.

137
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,286
-Why not?
-Well, you can confine them.

138
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,152
You can punish them.
You can cram them into the corner...

139
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,123
...but they're not going away, Jerry.

140
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,423
-All right.
-Yeah.

141
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,663
When they hand out
those cadavers...

142
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,804
...do you choose if it's a man
or woman?

143
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,964
I don't know.
Dead bodies really gross me out.

144
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,078
-Oh, my God.
-What's wrong?

145
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,683
Oh, it's Sue Ellen Mischke,
this old braless friend I hate.

146
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,650
-Elaine? Hi.
-Oh, hi, Sue Ellen, hi.

147
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,485
Oh, Rick, this is an old,
old friend of mine. Elaine Benes.

148
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,060
Rick is a periodontist.
He does Giuliani's gums.

149
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,824
Well, this is my boyfriend,
Dr. Ben Galvant.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,629
-Oh, well, I'm an intern.
-Hey, stop kidding, Ben.

151
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,131
He's a doctor.
He's a very good doctor.

152
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,369
Carlito's just passed out.
Can anyone help?

153
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,505
-Oh, there's a doctor right here.
-No, there's not.

154
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,810
Can't you at least tell them
what to do?

155
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,613
-Like what?
-Shouldn't he elevate his legs?

156
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,484
Right. Elevate your legs.

157
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,729
I hope Carlito feels better.

158
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,631
-Ben really wishes he could've helped.
-I thought he was a doctor.

159
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,499
Oh, he is.

160
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,868
You know, kind of.

161
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,534
I mean, I call him doctor.

162
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,741
George.

163
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,447
Of course, absolute zero.

164
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,858
-What? What is with all these books?
-I stopped having sex.

165
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,795
All right. I'll see you, Phil.
I've got room for two...

166
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,270
...but the only thing I have
is in the non-filter section.

167
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,703
Hey, hey, how you doing?

168
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,934
What, you got
a smokers' lounge in there?

169
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,739
Oh, yeah, people really seem
to be enjoying themselves.

170
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,940
You know, they come in once,
it's like they're addicted.

171
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:23,283
Jerry. Oh, there you are.
You didn't answer your phone.

172
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,617
I was out.

173
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,952
Jerry, great news.

174
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:33,190
-I got you an assembly.
-An assembly?

175
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,268
Two hours in front of the entire
junior high, grades six through eight.

176
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,961
-That's sixth grade, seventh grade--
-I understand.

177
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,733
But what am I gonna talk about
for two hours?

178
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:47,072
And it is already in the school paper.
They cancelled Rick James.

179
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,909
-"Super Freak"?
-Yes.

180
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,916
What is your answer to number 74?

181
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,783
-Metabolic acidosis.
-No.

182
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,790
Hypokalemia.

183
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,155
Not metabolic acidosis.

184
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,225
Oh, man,
I'm never gonna pass this thing.

185
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:12,337
Oh, yes, you are.
We'll just stop having sex.

186
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:18,602
You guys. Hitting is not about muscle.
It's simple physics.

187
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,941
Calculate the velocity, V,
in relation to the trajectory, T...

188
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,277
...in which, G, gravity, of course,
remains a constant.

189
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,613
-It's not complicated.
-Now, who are you again?

190
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,785
George Costanza,
assistant to the traveling secretary.

191
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,262
Are you the guy who put us
in that Ramada in Milwaukee?

192
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,369
You wanna talk about hotels,
or you wanna win some ball games?

193
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,402
Hey, we won the World Series.

194
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,870
In six games.

195
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,679
So if you like to tell jokes,
and you love to make people laugh...

196
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,378
...stand-up comedy may be
the career for you.

197
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,985
Thank you.

198
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,755
Nine minutes.

199
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,592
How am I gonna fill two hours?

200
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,704
Hello? I could take an hour
off your hands.

201
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,840
Let the kids see a real, live Yankee.

202
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,033
And give you the chance to see
some real disappointed kids.

203
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,203
Yes, I take your order, please?

204
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,748
Excuse me, darling, do l--?
Do I detect a Portuguese accent?

205
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,121
No, don't mention it.

206
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,059
-Portuguese?
-Yeah, my cleaning lady is Portuguese.

207
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,225
I must have picked it up.

208
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,461
How come he's getting so smart?

209
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,902
I stopped having sex with Ben
three days ago...

210
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,508
...and I don't know no Portuguese.

211
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,406
-Are you all right?
-I don't know. I just--

212
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,609
The last couple of days my mind
has been kind of, you know...

213
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,218
...not good.

214
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,294
Wait a second.
I know what's happening.

215
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,364
The no-sex thing is having
the reverse affect on you.

216
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,728
What? What are you talking about?

217
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,893
To a woman,
sex is like the garbage man.

218
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,233
You take for granted that when
you put some trash on the street...

219
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,342
...a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna
come along and pick it up.

220
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,172
But now, no sex,
it's like a garbage strike.

221
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:40,375
The bags are piling up in your head.
The sidewalk is blocked.

222
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,386
Nothing's getting through.
You're stupid.

223
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,354
-I don't understand.
-Exactly.

224
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,332
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

225
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,560
Hey, you should come over.
Tonight's pipe night.

226
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,800
-What happened to your face?
-What?

227
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,171
It looks like an old catcher's mitt.

228
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,141
What?

229
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,947
Look at that.
My face is all craggily. It's crinkly.

230
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,987
It's from all that smoke.

231
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:22,059
You've experienced a lifetime
of smoking in 72 hours.

232
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,752
What did you expect?

233
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,831
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer,
but not this.

234
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,897
Jerry, you know,
my face is my livelihood.

235
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,308
Everything I have I owe to this face.

236
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,412
It's my allure, my twinkle, you know.

237
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,515
You know, and your teeth,
your teeth are all brown.

238
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,514
Look away, I'm-- I'm hideous.

239
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,961
Hey, Ben, I need a four-letter word.

240
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,399
"Winnie-the-" blank.

241
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,234
-Pooh.
-Poo.

242
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,169
No, it's Winnie-the-Pooh.

243
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,042
So the hospital called.

244
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,281
Turns out some stupid intern
screwed up my test.

245
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,789
I never had mono.

246
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,794
So now we can, you know.

247
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,068
So, what did you do?

248
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,003
I told her
I would have to think about it.

249
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,941
But ultimately you're gonna choose
in favor of sex, right?

250
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:51,811
I don't know. Perhaps I can
better serve the world this way.

251
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,084
You mean, not subjecting women
to your sexual advances?

252
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,223
A simple joke from a simple man.

253
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,785
So you're never gonna
have sex again?

254
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,021
Well, Jerry...

255
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:09,133
...there was a pretty good chance I was
never gonna have sex again anyway.

256
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,702
You ready for the assembly
and what you'll say about the Yankees?

257
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,238
Sports are so pedestrian.
I prepared some science experiments...

258
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,309
...that will illuminate the mind
and dazzle the eye.

259
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,209
I wrote a 20-minute bit about
how homework stinks.

260
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,675
Oh, my vacation was restful,
resplendent, magnificent.

261
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,322
In fact, next time I'm planning on
going to Corfu.

262
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh, no.

263
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,350
-We gotta talk.
-No way, Kramer.

264
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,621
You brought me only misfortune
and humiliation. Now, get out.

265
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,560
-But, Jackie.
-I said, out.

266
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,668
Jackie, I think I got a case
against the tobacco companies.

267
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,336
-The who?
-The tobacco companies.

268
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,011
I've been wanting a piece of them
for years.

269
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,030
Did that cigarette label mention
any damage to your appearance?

270
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,134
-No, no, it didn't say anything.
-So you were a victim...

271
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,635
...and now your face is
sallow, unattractive, disgusting.

272
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:27,407
-So, Jackie, you think we got a case?
-Your face is my case.

273
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
-Hey.
-Hey, how are you doing?

274
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,017
Not good. I'm a moron.

275
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,050
Don't worry about it.

276
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,287
Once he passes the test,
you'll have sex and you'll be fine.

277
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,661
Well, that kind of brings us
to why I'm here.

278
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,929
You got 1 1 minutes?

279
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,097
What for?

280
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,577
Oh, come on.

281
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,909
I just wanna clear my head.
It has nothing to do with you.

282
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,081
I think it has something to do
with me.

283
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,212
You could read the paper
through the whole thing, if you want.

284
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,120
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
This is too weird.

285
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,191
All right.

286
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,425
Is Kramer home?

287
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,040
You know, Louise,
I think you'll find this amusing.

288
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,907
-ln early Euclidean geometry they--
-George, I have to have sex.

289
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,047
I used to share
that very same outlook...

290
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,615
...but now I have so many things
to occupy my mind.

291
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,276
-For instance, the atom.
-Goodbye, George.

292
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,615
I hate you.

293
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,992
Fascinating turn of events.

294
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,293
Ms. Wilkie, your tobacco company
has turned this beautiful specimen...

295
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,406
...into a horrible, twisted freak.

296
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,440
Who could love me?

297
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:14,116
I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer
projects a rugged masculinity.

298
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,725
Rugged? The man's a goblin.

299
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,020
He's only been exposed to smoke
for four days.

300
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,131
By the time this case gets to trial, he'll
be nothing more than a shrunken head.

301
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,361
All right, Mr. Chiles,
you'll have our offer by tomorrow.

302
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,598
-Good day, gentlemen.
-Yeah, bye-bye.

303
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,266
Jackie. Jackie, you did it.
We're rich.

304
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:43,346
You better believe it. Jackie's cashing
in on your wretched disfigurement.

305
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,846
Congratulations! You passed.

306
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,753
Elaine, Elaine, I don't think
we should see each other anymore.

307
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,053
What?
You're breaking me up with me?

308
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,688
But I sacrificed and supported you
while you struggled.

309
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,460
What about my dream
of dating a doctor?

310
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,832
I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew
that after I became a doctor...

311
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,838
...I would dump whoever I was with
and find someone better.

312
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,910
That's the dream
of becoming a doctor.

313
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,845
Lookit.
Are we gonna have sex or not?

314
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,486
Jerry, when the glee club's finished
singing, George goes on, then you.

315
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,022
-Hey.
-Where have you been? You're on next.

316
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,682
I got lost on the way over.

317
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,263
Got lost? We went to school here
for three years.

318
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,994
What are these?
Take me to your leader.

319
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,372
Oh, my God, you had sex.

320
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,909
-You had sex with Louise.
-No, the Portuguese waitress.

321
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,879
The Portuguese waitress?

322
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,848
I calculated my odds
of ever getting together...

323
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,047
...with a Portuguese waitress.
Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.

324
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,521
George, George, you're on.

325
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,684
-Oh, I'm not going on.
-What did you come down here for?

326
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,831
To tell you
about the Portuguese waitress.

327
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,058
It's good to have you back.

328
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:13,500
-One of you has to go on.
-All right. I'll do it.

329
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,267
Hey, kids,
what's the deal with homework?

330
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,810
You're not working on your home.

331
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,282
That was a great lunch, Jackie.
Thanks.

332
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,853
It's puzzling we haven't
gotten that offer yet.

333
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,924
Well, Mrs. Wilkie
from the tobacco company called me.

334
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,423
And we had a little powwow.

335
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,585
A powwow?
Who told you to have a powwow?

336
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,993
I didn't tell you to have a powwow.

337
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,565
-She made an offer. I took it.
-How much?

338
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,067
-No, no, no. There was no money.
-No money? Then, what did we get?

339
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,803
Check it out.

340
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,447
This is the most public yet
of my many humiliations.

341
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,255
Cancelled? But I was supposed to
be on tomorrow night.

342
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,987
Yeah, but then,
some people were telling me about...

343
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,826
...that little flap out there
at the junior high school assembly.

344
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,937
And before that,
you were bumped by a lizard?

345
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,304
It was a--
Actually, it was a monitor lizard.

346
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,534
Those things, deadly, dangerous.

347
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,511
A long time ago, my uncle and a date
are driving, like, through Mexico.

348
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,046
They see one on the road.

349
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,776
Drags him out of the car
and chews his face off.

350
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,921
Listen. We'll call you if anything
opens up. Okay, Jimmy?

351
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,580
-Jerry.
-Right. Jerry.
