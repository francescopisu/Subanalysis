1
00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:03,997
The transplant, the hair plug...

2
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:08,674
...is really quite amazing.
Hair on your shower soap yesterday...

3
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:10,814
...can be in your head tomorrow.

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:12,322
How do they do the transplant?

5
00:00:12,485 --> 00:00:14,690
Did they have the guy take
a shower, get his soap...

6
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:16,194
...rush it in by helicopter?

7
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:19,390
You know, keep the soap alive
on the soap-support system?

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,758
Then eventually move it over?

9
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,892
''We got the hairs,
but I think we lost the Zest.''

10
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,744
Sometimes the body
rejects the transplant...

11
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:30,776
...with organs. Is it possible
that a head could reject...

12
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,354
...a hair transplant?

13
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,448
The guy's just standing
around. Suddenly:

14
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,598
It lands in someone's
frozen yogurt.

15
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,254
You see, the gaskets
that you have here...

16
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:49,083
...are asymmetrical.

17
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,933
-Really?
-So I took off the motor relay...

18
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:56,286
...on the compressor because
you've got some discoloration.

19
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:58,683
-Oh, whatever you have to do.
-I was working...

20
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:00,408
...with one mount at a time.

21
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,614
You know, because
you don't want to disturb...

22
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:06,164
-...the position of the compressor.
-No, you don't.

23
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,707
Hey, what are you listening to?

24
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:12,056
My show from last night.

25
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:14,872
-Oh, you taped it?
-Yeah, I was doing some new material.

26
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:17,208
Did you ever do that thing
on the toes that I said?

27
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,529
You know, how, like, the big toe
is, like, the captain of the toes.

28
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:24,408
But sometimes the toe
next to the big toe gets so big...

29
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,328
...that there's, like,
a power struggle.

30
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:28,596
And the second toe assumes
control of the foot.

31
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:30,802
-The coup d'e-toe.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,174
-Did you do it?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:34,832
-So?
-Nothing.

34
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:37,103
Nothing at all.

35
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,767
-I need the phone.
-Who you calling?

36
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:40,344
China.

37
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,616
-China?
-Yeah, I値l pay for it.

38
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,338
-What for?
-What for?

39
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:46,894
I値l tell you what for.
For hair.

40
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,038
-Hair?
-The Chinese have done it, my friend.

41
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,722
-The Chinese have done it.
-Done what?

42
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,702
-Discovered the cure for baldness.
-Did you see that last night?

43
00:01:55,864 --> 00:01:58,862
It was on CNN. This
Chinese doctor, Zang Zhao...

44
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,372
...has cured baldness.

45
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,836
-What's this?
-Oh, I just got it.

46
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,591
Spector gave it to me.

47
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,513
He's giving everything away.

48
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:09,098
He's becoming a minimalist.

49
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:11,468
Is that the guy
who likes fat women?

50
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:12,978
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,687
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict
with the minimalism?

52
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,092
You. You should have watched
that report on CNN last night.

53
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,397
I did. I知 trying to call China.

54
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,254
You can't call China now.

55
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,753
It's like, what, 3:00
in the morning there.

56
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,953
-Oh, my God.
-What?

57
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:34,256
Oh, God.

58
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,839
Man.

59
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,976
Oh, brother.

60
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,148
I can't believe
what I知 hearing.

61
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:45,352
This woman's talking to me
on my tape recorder...

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,697
...while I was on stage.

63
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,838
This is wild.

64
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:50,982
I never heard
anything like this. Listen.

65
00:02:51,152 --> 00:02:54,184
<i>I want to slide my tongue</i>
<i>around you like a s</i>--

66
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:57,923
Oh, my God.

67
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,038
-Let me hear.
-Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,626
-Who is this woman?
-I don't know. I have no idea.

69
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,480
I was just listening,
and she came on.

70
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,981
This is like a <i>Penthouse</i> letter.

71
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:10,764
-Why can't I meet women like this?
-Come on.

72
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,780
Wait! Wait!

73
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,872
-Where was the tape recorder?
-Back of the room, on the ledge.

74
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:19,076
She must have been sitting
right in front of it.

75
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:20,868
-My God.
-All right, come on.

76
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,272
-It痴 my turn.
-All right. All right. All right.

77
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,184
-How you gonna find out who this is?
-Good question.

78
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,972
Where's the volume?

79
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,869
What do the Chinese
have to gain...

80
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,368
...by faking a cure
for baldness?

81
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,985
lf it was real, they'd never
let it out of the country.

82
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,364
Imagine no baldness.

83
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:41,568
It would be like
a nation of supermen.

84
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,398
-Hi, boys.
-Hello.

85
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:45,665
-Hello.
-What's happening?

86
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:48,003
Tell her.
I want to hear her reaction.

87
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,357
This woman left this sexy
message on Jerry's tape--

88
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:52,988
Not that, you idiot!

89
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,200
-What?
-The Chinese!

90
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,860
The Chinese bald cure!

91
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,517
-Oh, I thought you meant that--
-No, I meant the bald cure.

92
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:01,508
We were talking
about the bald cure!

93
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,848
What did she say?

94
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:05,060
Seinfeld.

95
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,227
Hey, is that Beder?

96
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,023
I can't believe it.

97
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,097
Get me a cup of decaf.

98
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,560
So did you hear this message?

99
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,034
Man, it was unbelievable.

100
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,493
-Really?
-I can't get over it.

101
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:20,985
Sexy?

102
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,610
This woman drove us
out of our minds.

103
00:04:23,778 --> 00:04:25,851
Like, how did she sound?

104
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,596
She had this throaty,
sexy kind of whisper.

105
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,736
Really? Like....
Like:

106
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:34,972
Jerry...

107
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:38,716
...I want to slide my tongue
around you like a snake.

108
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,055
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,069
You?

110
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:57,172
You?

111
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,740
That was you!

112
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:02,007
-How did you--?
-I stopped in the club to see him.

113
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,082
I was standing in the back
while he was on.

114
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,489
There was this tape
recorder there.

115
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:08,279
And I got this impulse.

116
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,700
-What?
-No, nothing. Nothing.

117
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:19,097
Now listen, promise me
you won't tell him.

118
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,852
I want to have
a little fun with this.

119
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:24,307
I had no idea you
were filled with such...

120
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,962
...sexuality.

121
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,972
Oh, that was nothing.

122
00:05:30,138 --> 00:05:31,732
So listen,
what about this bald thing?

123
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:35,126
Some bald thing, a bald thing.
I don't know. It痴 nothing.

124
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,486
-Remember Beder?
-Beder?

125
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:38,998
Yeah, you remember Beder.

126
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,232
I told you he went
to the track that one time...

127
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,961
...and he was yelling
at this jockey.

128
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,357
And the jockey got off the horse
and started chasing him.

129
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,228
So listen. What about this girl
on your tape recorder?

130
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,180
Oh, Elaine.

131
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:58,124
What do you think an enraptured
female fan of mine might say?

132
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,110
I don't know.

133
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,594
She went on in some detail
about certain activities...

134
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,666
...illegal in some states,
for consenting adults.

135
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,877
Things you would
know very little about.

136
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:11,117
-Oh, really?
-Well...

137
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,422
...this type of thing
is very common...

138
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,726
...when you're in show business.

139
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,152
So, what?
You gonna ask her out?

140
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,079
No, she didn't leave
her name or number.

141
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:22,184
Bummer. Okay.

142
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,402
Good luck finding her.
I知 taking off.

143
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,795
-Where are you going?
-Home.

144
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,396
What are you going home for?

145
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,082
I just came from the gym--

146
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,703
-Unless I can shower at your place.
-Sure.

147
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,260
Oh, my God.

148
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,516
Oh, man.

149
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,857
I don't get it.

150
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:50,153
Why would a woman do that and then
leave no way to get in touch with her?

151
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,107
Maybe she realized
she couldn't have you...

152
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,921
...and jumped off the
George Washington Bridge.

153
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,059
Yes. Operator.

154
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,790
Beijing.

155
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:03,106
-Why are you doing this?
-Why do I do anything?

156
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,650
For women.

157
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,786
Elaine, have you ever
gone out with a bald man?

158
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,128
-No.
-Know what that makes you? A baldist.

159
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:11,974
Oh, this I need.

160
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,653
Hello, is this
the hair restoration clinic?

161
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,991
Yeah, yeah.
Does anyone speak English?

162
00:07:18,156 --> 00:07:19,910
You're taping.

163
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,148
Just be yourselves.

164
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:24,518
Oh, okay.

165
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,720
Well, we're talking
with Elaine Benes...

166
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,670
...adult film star...

167
00:07:31,304 --> 00:07:32,765
...on the set
of her new picture...

168
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,237
<i>...Elaine Does</i>
<i>the Upper West Side.</i>

169
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,654
<i>Hi, how you doing?</i>

170
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:42,205
Well, I知 doing fine.

171
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:44,830
Do you speak English?
English!

172
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,005
Oh, here's the director,
Jerry Seinfeld.

173
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,181
Jerry, you discovered
Elaine Benes.

174
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,844
Well, yes I did. That's true.

175
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:54,274
Couple of guys I knew
in the Coast Guard told me about her.

176
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,865
And I sensed that she had
the anger and intensity...

177
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:02,885
...that I needed
to make this film work.

178
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:04,833
English!

179
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,849
Does anybody speak English?

180
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,191
Nobody speaks English.

181
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:11,104
So, what scene are you getting
ready to shoot now, Elaine?

182
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:14,398
<i>In this scene, my costar,</i>
<i>who's right over here....</i>

183
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:17,313
Follow me.
Is George Costanza.

184
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:19,548
<i>And he plays an airline pilot...</i>

185
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,144
<i>...who's just returned</i>
<i>from Rome.</i>

186
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:24,697
<i>And I'm about to show him</i>
<i>how much I've missed him.</i>

187
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,586
That's my Chinese food.

188
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,583
So, George, is this your
first movie with Elaine?

189
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,326
<i>I don't know.</i>

190
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:40,279
So, Elaine, in your movies,
is the sex real, or is it simulated?

191
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,619
<i>Oh, it's always simulated...</i>

192
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:44,246
<i>...except with George.</i>

193
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,269
<i>That's in my contract.</i>

194
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,860
<i>All right, Kramer.</i>
<i>That's enough.</i>

195
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,136
That's enough. Yeah, hello?

196
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:51,480
Yeah, hello?

197
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:52,922
English!

198
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:54,579
Does anyone speak English?

199
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:56,276
-How much do I owe you?
-$ 1 5.<i>9</i>0

200
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,713
-$ 1 5.<i>9</i>0?
-Excuse me?

201
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:01,145
-Do you speak Chinese?
-Chinese? Yeah.

202
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,715
Oh, look!

203
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,975
I知 on with Beijing
at the hair restoration clinic.

204
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,546
Could you talk to them for me...

205
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:09,975
...and tell them
I壇 like to place an order?

206
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:23,091
They've got a billion people over
there. He found a relative.

207
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,407
lf you send money,
they send cream.

208
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:28,854
They send me. All right.

209
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,509
Ask them, does it really work?

210
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,662
They say you grow hair.
Look like Stalin.

211
00:09:39,384 --> 00:09:41,772
Ask them,
are there any side effects?

212
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,454
Impotence.

213
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:52,011
Oh, funny.
He's a funny guy, yeah.

214
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,189
Get a money order
from the Bank of China.

215
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:56,147
Be here three days
after they get check.

216
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:57,737
All right, thank you. Thank you.

217
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,952
Excuse me.

218
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,164
Kind of an expensive call.

219
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:24,935
<i>Thanks for driving me home.</i>

220
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,479
<i>What did I do to deserve this?</i>

221
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:28,103
<i>You do plenty.</i>

222
00:10:29,201 --> 00:10:32,461
So, what are you doing?
You're-- You're going in.

223
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,479
Well, yeah. I guess so.

224
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,362
Why, you want to do something?

225
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:40,455
Yeah, I don't--
I don't know. What?

226
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,202
There's really nothing to do.

227
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:46,854
Yeah, no. There's--
There's nothing.

228
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,809
Can you think of anything?

229
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,008
No, no. Not really.

230
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,509
I am up for anything.

231
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,522
Really?

232
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,793
I have to say...

233
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:04,681
...you were really good
doing that porno thing.

234
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:06,568
You're-- You're talented.

235
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,454
I was just kidding around.

236
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,035
That thing you said about
the sex not being simulated....

237
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:15,527
That was really funny.

238
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:19,303
Yeah, that was fun.

239
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:24,585
So I値l speak to you
through Jerry and everything.

240
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,370
Okay.

241
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:28,739
-Thanks a lot for the ride.
-Yeah, anytime.

242
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,614
Thanks a million. I appreciate this.

243
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,691
You're sure this was
the woman at the table...

244
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,000
...where I had
my tape recorder?

245
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:45,856
Okay, great.

246
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,876
Thanks, again. Bye.

247
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:53,406
Who do these women
think they're dealing with?

248
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,114
Did she think she was gonna leave
this incredibly erotic message...

249
00:11:58,275 --> 00:12:00,284
...on my tape,
and I was just gonna let it go?

250
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:03,554
Not bloody likely.

251
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,948
What is that?

252
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,156
-It痴 my cockney accent.
-No, no. That's no good.

253
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:10,559
Let's hear yours.

254
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:12,992
Not bloody likely.

255
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,842
That's the worst cockney accent
I ever heard in my life.

256
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:22,362
Hey, Georgie boy,
guess what I got.

257
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,252
Guess what I got.

258
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,627
Oh, is that the bald stuff?

259
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,353
From China.
All the way from China.

260
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,981
Wait, wait.
Let me get the camera.

261
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:32,893
No, don't get the camera.
We don't need the camera.

262
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:35,444
I know you're skeptical,
but I believe in the Chinese.

263
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:36,825
Yes, I am skeptical.

264
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,837
Why do you have to be
so suspicious of everyone?

265
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,037
This is a great man,
Zang Zhao.

266
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:43,929
He wants to help bald people.

267
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:46,745
Wait, wait. Let's videotape
your head for the before picture.

268
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:48,567
So we can watch
how it grows and stuff.

269
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,770
-Here, sit down.
-All right.

270
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,876
All right, lean back.

271
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,528
A little bit to the right.

272
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,665
Now make sure
you get this area here.

273
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,558
-That's where he needs help.
-All right.

274
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,782
Well, he's a happy
camper, huh?

275
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:13,109
Happy camper. Yeah,
I don't hear that expression enough.

276
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,184
Remember that guy
who took my jacket?

277
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:16,880
The one I found
at my mother's house?

278
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,419
-Yeah.
-My mother told me...

279
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:20,211
...that he got arrested
for mail fraud.

280
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,100
-No kidding.
-Yeah, he's in jail.

281
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:24,118
What about the jacket?
He take it with him?

282
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,550
That's what I intend
to find out.

283
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,757
Well, you can see it.

284
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,902
Are you gonna
walk around like that?

285
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,603
And it stinks.

286
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:37,173
Can you smell that?

287
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,123
You stink.

288
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,181
How long are you supposed
to leave it on for?

289
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:44,909
All day.

290
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,610
-Hello?
-<i>Hello, it's Elaine Marie Benes</i>.

291
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:52,235
-Well, hello.
-<i>Hello</i>.

292
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:53,898
<i>Did you find out</i>
<i>who that woman was?</i>

293
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,923
Yes, I got her number.

294
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,026
-Hey, is that Elaine?
-Yeah.

295
00:13:58,196 --> 00:13:59,887
Hi, Elaine!

296
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,536
<i>So I guess you figure</i>
<i>you're in for a pretty wild night.</i>

297
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:04,877
Well, as I said...

298
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,911
...this type of thing is
very common in show business.

299
00:14:08,562 --> 00:14:11,017
<i>Well, listen, I'm at Arlene's.</i>
<i>You want me to stop by?</i>

300
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,560
-Sure.
-<i>Okay</i>, <i>bye</i>.

301
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,182
Bye.

302
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:16,649
-Did she say ''hello''?
-What? Oh, I don't know.

303
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:21,132
What do you mean? She heard me
say hello. Did she say hello back?

304
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,270
I don't know.
Who keeps track of hellos?

305
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,637
Isn't it polite to say hello
when somebody says hello?

306
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,158
She's coming up.

307
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,292
-Elaine's coming up?
-Yeah, why? What's wrong?

308
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,544
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere, nowhere. I値l be right out.

309
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,259
How often do you
cut your toenails?

310
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,342
I would say every two and a half
to eight weeks.

311
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:50,729
Because the other night
I was sleeping with Marion...

312
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:53,740
...and I rolled over, and l
cut her ankle with my big toe.

313
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,449
The big toe, the captain.

314
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:00,425
-What?
-The captain of the toes.

315
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:06,528
-Hello?
-<i>Jerry?</i>

316
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,942
-Yeah.
-<i>Jerry, listen.</i>

317
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,310
<i>I got too much to do.</i>
<i>I can't come over. Forget it.</i>

318
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,652
Oh, okay, too bad.

319
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:13,759
<i>So when are you</i>
<i>gonna call her?</i>

320
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,197
As soon as I get off
the phone with you.

321
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,815
-<i>Good luck.</i>
-Okay.

322
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,708
-Bye.
-<i>Bye</i>.

323
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:24,515
-What happened? You took it off?
-Yeah. That was enough.

324
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,561
That's it? You gave up?

325
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:28,550
No, I知 working on a system.
Who was that?

326
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:31,810
That was Elaine. She changed
her mind. She's not coming over.

327
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,308
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hello, is this Alisha?

328
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:44,062
-<i>Yes.</i>
-This is Jerry Seinfeld.

329
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,005
-So?
-I don't get this woman.

330
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:58,432
We're having a great time,
couple of laughs. Everything's nice.

331
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,319
End of the night,
I go in for contact.

332
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,075
I get the pullback.

333
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:05,913
This woman, she said the filthiest
things I ever heard in my life.

334
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:08,413
And I get the pullback.

335
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,027
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George</i>.

336
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:13,719
Come on up.

337
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,510
What is he doing here now?

338
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,567
So you blew it?

339
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:20,699
She must be psychotic
or something.

340
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:22,968
Let me have the number.

341
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:24,597
I知 not giving you the number.

342
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:26,522
I know how to handle
these psychotics.

343
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:33,944
Sheriff.

344
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,461
What's with the hat?

345
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,073
Boy, you stink.

346
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:45,690
-What are you doing here now?
-I have to talk to you.

347
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,641
Let's take a look here,
see what we got.

348
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:51,957
Wait a second.

349
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:54,969
I think I see
something here, George.

350
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:59,190
-Let's go to the videotape.
-Oh, Kramer. No, no.

351
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,672
-What's up?
-I can't tell you now.

352
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:04,598
-He'll be back in 1 0 seconds.
-Start it.

353
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:05,940
-I can't.
-Oh, come on.

354
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:09,105
He'll be over there for a half-hour.
He gets lost over there.

355
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,439
-Come on. What is this about?
-All right.

356
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,309
I致e become attracted to Elaine.

357
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,574
All right.

358
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:22,128
-Sit down.
-Could we do this later?

359
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,204
No, I got the tape right here.

360
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,285
Kramer, let's do this later.

361
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:27,830
Okay, now....

362
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:30,901
This is the tape
that we made earlier.

363
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,387
And I think...

364
00:17:33,557 --> 00:17:36,208
...that I see a couple of buds...

365
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,726
...right here.

366
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,519
-Really? You think?
-Yeah.

367
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,335
Kramer, I would like to talk
to George for a minute, please.

368
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:46,125
-About what?
-It痴 kind of private.

369
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,917
Like the big toe captain? What?

370
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:51,019
-Oh, so you're doing my bit?
-I知 not doing the bit!

371
00:17:51,507 --> 00:17:53,231
All right.
Okay, all right.

372
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:55,785
I知 gonna take
a look at this, huh?

373
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,280
-Does she know?
-No.

374
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,036
-How did it happen?
-I can't say.

375
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,504
-Well, why can't you say?
-Because I promised her.

376
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,902
-I thought you said she doesn't know.
-She doesn't.

377
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,367
-So how can you promise her?
-Because she asked me to.

378
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,601
What is this,
an Abbott and Costello routine?

379
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,350
All right, you really want to know?

380
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,866
It all started
when she told me...

381
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,522
...that she was the voice
on your tape recorder.

382
00:18:25,135 --> 00:18:26,181
What? Elaine?

383
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,698
Yeah. She made me promise not
to tell. It was supposed to be a joke.

384
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,780
-That was Elaine?
-Yeah, let me hear.

385
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,080
-Wait a second! Give me a second--
-You heard it 50 times already--

386
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,732
She's my ex-girlfriend.
I think I have precedence.

387
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,318
-Yeah?
-<i>Hi, it's Elaine</i>.

388
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,525
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

389
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:49,031
Yeah.

390
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:51,655
Don't tell her I told you!
She'll kill me!

391
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:53,956
Okay, I promise!

392
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,854
Oh, man.

393
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,510
Oh, God.

394
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:08,389
Oh, brother.

395
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,237
-What's the matter?
-I got a pain in my side...

396
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:17,696
-...from, you know--
-Hi, George.

397
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,588
Hi, how you doing?

398
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:23,109
Something stinks in here.

399
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,055
What are you doing here?

400
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:32,764
I was the one who talked
into your tape recorder.

401
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,624
I know. George told me.

402
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:41,886
-You told him?
-He threatened me.

403
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,496
Where did you come up
with all that stuff?

404
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,903
-Oh, that was nothing.
-Elaine....

405
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:51,264
-I have to tell you something.
-George, no.

406
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:52,988
-No, no.
-George, I知 telling you--

407
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:54,528
What is it?

408
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,382
I知 very attracted to you.

409
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,267
I found a hair!

410
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:00,540
Yes!

411
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:03,073
Okay, come here. Come here.
Take a look at this.

412
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,976
Ever since I found out that you left
the message on Jerry's tape recorder--

413
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:12,955
-That was you?
-It was a joke.

414
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,646
Wait.

415
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,485
Oh, my God.

416
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,862
Oh, yeah.

417
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:24,885
Elaine, I can't believe
that that is you.

418
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,620
I think I値l get going.

419
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,479
Stick around a while.

420
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:38,033
-It痴 early.
-We'll order Chinese.

421
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,889
Give me the tape.
Give me the tape.

422
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:54,452
A woman left a message
on my phone machine...

423
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:56,275
...with kind of a breathy voice.

424
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,573
No matter what a woman says, if it's
in that breathy voice, you know....

425
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:00,752
''You have cancer.''

426
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,710
''Really?''

427
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:05,939
Sounds pretty good.

428
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:09,975
The stewardess could lean over
and whisper in my ear:

429
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,509
''Would you put
on your seat belt.

430
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:14,672
We're about to go
into a mountain.''

431
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,813
I壇 go, ''Really, so
what are you doing later...

432
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:19,831
...by the ruptured remains
of the fuselage?

433
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,773
How about some peanuts
over by the black box?

434
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:24,972
I値l meet you there.''
