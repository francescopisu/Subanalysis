1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,423
Do you think...

2
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:07,035
...that the security guards
in art museums...

3
00:00:07,203 --> 00:00:10,270
...really ever stop anybody
from taking the paintings?

4
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:14,144
l mean, are they going, ''Hey, where
do you think you're going with that?

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,246
Come over here.
Give me that Cezanne.''

6
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,167
l mean, look at the job
that this man is hired to do.

7
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,664
He's getting $5 an hour to protect...

8
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:26,440
...millions of dollars
of priceless art, with what?

9
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:29,322
He's got a light mocha
brown uniform...

10
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:32,269
...and a <i>USA Today.</i>
This is what he's got.

11
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:36,294
Crooks must look at this guy and go,
''We get past the folding chair...

12
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,855
...and the thermos of coffee,
we can get a Rembrandt.''

13
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:51,889
Kramer, would you hold still?
l can't do this if you keep moving.

14
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:55,279
You sure you don't want me
to take my clothes off?

15
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,079
Because l'll do it.

16
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:00,725
No, that's the last thing
in the world l want you to do.

17
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,444
Well, why don't you take
your clothes off?

18
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:06,744
l don't know, l don't think
Jerry would like that.

19
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,821
Well, it'll be our little secret.

20
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,201
God!

21
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:18,810
Button fly!

22
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,251
Why do they put buttons on a fly?

23
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,001
lt takes 1 0 minutes
to get these things open.

24
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:26,536
l like the button fly.

25
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:28,901
-What?
-That is one place on my wardrobe...

26
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:32,264
...l do not need sharp,
interlocking metal teeth.

27
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:35,018
lt's like a mink trap down there.

28
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,539
l'm gonna develop kidney problems.

29
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:40,138
-What are you doing today?
-Nothing.

30
00:01:40,302 --> 00:01:43,599
l have to go meet Nina. Want to come
up to her loft, check out her paintings?

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,511
-l don't get art.
-There's nothing to get.

32
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,300
lt always has to be explained to me...

33
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,185
...and then l have to have someone
explain the explanation.

34
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:55,700
She does abstract stuff. ln fact,
she's painting Kramer right now.

35
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,863
-What for?
-She sees something in him.

36
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:01,586
So do l, but l wouldn't
hang it on a wall.

37
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,009
Are you getting the eyes?

38
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:06,773
Because they're brown.

39
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,770
Really, they're dark brown,
like rich Colombian coffee.

40
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:14,717
Tell me about Elaine.

41
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,081
You know, she and Jerry
were a big thing...

42
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,136
...like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

43
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:23,902
-But they're still friends.
-Yeah, yeah. They're like this:

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,225
-Don't you think that's strange?
-Why? What's the difference?

45
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:32,128
Are you still friends with any
of your ex-girlfriends?

46
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:34,879
Well, you know, l....

47
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:37,220
l have many relationships.

48
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:41,866
-l tell you, l'm a little nervous.
-Why?

49
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,898
You know, the friend meeting
the new woman.

50
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,005
l feel like l'm getting fixed up
for a friendship.

51
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:50,542
l don't know how long
this is gonna last.

52
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,942
Really?
l thought you liked her.

53
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,089
l do, but she's got,
like, a jealousy thing.

54
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,618
She doesn't like me having
fun with anyone but her.

55
00:02:57,907 --> 00:03:00,210
You know, it's a miracle
you're not married.

56
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,857
Hey, l'm not obligated
to buy anything, am l?

57
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:10,512
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi.

58
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:12,176
-This is my friend George.
-Hello.

59
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,256
Nice to meet you.
l've heard a lot about you.

60
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,118
Hey, look at this guy!

61
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,666
l brought George up to see
some of your paintings.

62
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,653
Oh, are you interested?

63
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,674
Yeah, sure.
Sure, l'm interested.

64
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,560
George, you gonna buy a painting?

65
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:32,316
Yeah, sure.

66
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:36,511
-Are you an art lover?
-l am an art adorer. l adore art.

67
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:40,485
Great. Take a look around.
Pick something out you like.

68
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:43,591
May l?

69
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,502
Get out of here.

70
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:48,549
Here. Play with this.

71
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:51,050
-What's this?
-My father gave me four tickets...

72
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:53,734
...to the Yankee game
for Saturday afternoon.

73
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,685
Owner's box, first row,
behind the dugout.

74
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,401
Saturday! l'm working.
l'm going out of town.

75
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:02,605
Well, l won't go without you.
You guys want them?

76
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,177
Yeah.

77
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,925
They're right behind the dugout,
George. First row.

78
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,776
Behind the dugout? Are you kid--?
How did you get them?

79
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:13,259
My father's the Yankees' accountant.
lt's the owner's box.

80
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:17,109
All my life l've dreamed of sitting
front row, behind the dugout.

81
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:20,177
You like that one?

82
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,208
Look at where we are!

83
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:28,690
He's not stopping. He keeps
going and going and going.

84
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,905
We're not in the first row?

85
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,902
-No, no. These are your seats.
-She said first row behind the dugout.

86
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:36,765
lt's the second row. lt's just as good.

87
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,128
l was primed for the first row. l was
gonna put my feet on the dugout.

88
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,392
Shut up. These are great.
You can't get any better than this.

89
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,598
There's better. Right there.
That's better.

90
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,976
All right.

91
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:48,646
Oh, boy.

92
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:51,361
-All right. Who wants a dog?
-Yeah. Here you go.

93
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,156
What a great day.

94
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:55,908
l could've been at my boss'
son's <i>bris</i> right now.

95
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,666
That what you were
supposed to do?

96
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,014
Yeah.

97
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,964
What makes him think anyone wants
to witness a circumcision?

98
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,101
l'd rather go to a hanging.

99
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,989
ls it that unattractive
to have to take it off?

100
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,191
Have you ever seen one with it?

101
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,638
No.

102
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,326
You wouldn't even
know what it was.

103
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,395
Anyway, l called him back.

104
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:22,195
l told him l had to visit my father
in the hospital in Maryland.

105
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,622
You better catch it here, Charlie,
because this ain't Philadelphia!

106
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,346
-George?
-Yeah?

107
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:30,363
Hi. l'm Leonard West.

108
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:33,590
-Nina's father.
-Hi, hi, Mr. West. l'm sorry.

109
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:35,164
-This is my friend Elaine.
-Hi.

110
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:39,484
Hey, .230 ain't gonna
cut it in this town, babe!

111
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,174
This is Kramer.

112
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:42,938
Hey, how you doing?

113
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,521
Yes! Yes!

114
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:50,784
-How are the seats?
-Okay.

115
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,804
-Great. They're great.
-l hear you bought...

116
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,236
-...one of Nina's paintings.
-lt's being framed now.

117
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,806
l don't even know what it costs.

118
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:58,821
Not too expensive, is it?

119
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,676
Not if you have a lot of money.

120
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:04,035
lt was cheaper for me
when she was an actress.

121
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,287
Well....

122
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:11,981
-Enjoy the game.
-Thanks.

123
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,413
l think you better take
off the Orioles cap.

124
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:15,886
Yeah. l better.

125
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,958
No, no. Seriously.
You're in the owner's box.

126
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,105
l don't think it's a good idea.

127
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:23,178
-You're not serious.
-Yes, yes, yes, l am.

128
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,634
-Did he say that?
-No, but he gave me the seats.

129
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:29,141
l don't think he'd like you
wearing an Orioles cap.

130
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,245
-Maybe you should ask him.
-l don't have to.

131
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:33,172
Are you gonna take
the hat off or not?

132
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:34,581
No. l'm not gonna
take it off.

133
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,208
Why should l?
That's ridiculous.

134
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:37,939
Just take the cap off.

135
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,661
George, l am at a baseball game.

136
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:42,421
-This is America.
-Look!

137
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,891
Either you take the cap off
or you leave.

138
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,364
l'm not taking it off.

139
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,894
-Elaine, just take the cap off.
-No! Get off of my hat!

140
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,714
-What's--?
-What do you mean?!

141
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,408
-Stop it!
-Just take it off!

142
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,873
-There's your cap!
-Let's go.

143
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:59,070
Oh, my God. All right,
get your hands off of me!

144
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:02,271
-l'm leaving.
-Wait a minute. We just got here.

145
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:03,868
Do you want us to go with you?

146
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,273
-No, you stay.
-Get your cap, George.

147
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,416
-Well, l was just thinking--
-Yeah. Stay!

148
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:10,658
All right, all right, we'll go, we'll go.

149
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:22,157
And then the ball hits him in the head,
and he falls right over the railing.

150
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:25,166
-ls he okay?
-Well, yeah, he's fine.

151
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:28,560
We took him to the emergency room.
The x-rays were all negative.

152
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,282
lt was quite a day.

153
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,485
This is the most amazing story
l've ever heard.

154
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,693
Why did he want you to take
off the baseball cap?

155
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,236
-That is so insane.
-l know.

156
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,472
Can you imagine that?

157
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:46,297
-How you feeling?
-Oh, yeah. l'm fine. l'm fine.

158
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:48,117
Hi, Carol.

159
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,524
Hey, look. We made the paper.

160
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,607
Look at this. Page two, sports section.
We're all in the picture.

161
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,183
-Picture?
-Picture.

162
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,680
-Our picture's in there? What?
-Yeah.

163
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,104
l cannot believe this.

164
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:04,348
-There's George.
-Look at him.

165
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:06,371
Oh, my God!
Lippman could see this!

166
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,901
He thinks l was visiting my father.
Oh, my God!

167
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:13,570
l make up one little white lie,
and they put my picture in the paper!

168
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:17,095
Hi, Mr. Lippman.

169
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:19,877
How's your father?

170
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:23,815
My-- My father.

171
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,316
Yeah. You went to see him, right?

172
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,071
Yeah.

173
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,606
-l went to visit him.
-So...

174
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:34,763
-...what was wrong with him?
-Well, you name it. You know....

175
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:39,471
Neuritis, neuralgia.

176
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:43,083
But he's feeling better now, right?

177
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,141
Yes. Yeah. lt's such a miracle.

178
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:47,987
You know, my visit must have
buoyed his spirits.

179
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:50,261
Buoyed.

180
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:53,268
-What did l say?
-You said ''boy'd.''

181
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,862
-l did?
-Yeah.

182
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,862
Well, l got a plane to catch.

183
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,368
-Where are you going?
-Going to Houston for a few days.

184
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,190
Publishers' convention.

185
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:13,954
Can l have my sports section?

186
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,338
-Oh, yeah.
-Sports section.

187
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:21,405
l'm saving it for the plane. l never
miss the Sunday sports section.

188
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:23,878
There's nothing to read.
lt's yesterday's news.

189
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,824
The Yankees won, the Mets lost,
Rickey Henderson's unhappy.

190
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:28,481
Right. Right.

191
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,888
What are you doing?

192
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:35,590
That is the third time today
l have done that.

193
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,812
l keep, you know, grabbing
newspapers and just tugging at them.

194
00:09:40,976 --> 00:09:42,570
Well, l gotta go.

195
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:45,936
Okay. Yes, well, you know,
have a nice trip.

196
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,701
Alrighty. l'll just
hold down the fort.

197
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,323
l sense great vulnerability...

198
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:00,497
...a man-child crying out for love...

199
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,694
...an innocent orphan
in the postmodern world.

200
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,933
l see a parasite.

201
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,934
A sexually depraved miscreant...

202
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:16,440
...who is seeking only to gratify his
basest and most immediate urges.

203
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,065
She was a guest of my father's.

204
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:22,563
-She should've taken the cap off.
-lt's preposterous...

205
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,693
...to ask someone to take off a
baseball cap at a baseball game.

206
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,106
How can you defend that?

207
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,923
His struggle is man's struggle.

208
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,194
He lifts my spirit.

209
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:35,330
He is a loathsome, offensive brute.

210
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,084
Yet l can't look away.

211
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,025
Look, l'm tired of all this fighting.

212
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:45,452
Maybe we should end this before
we really start hating each other.

213
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:49,261
You wouldn't want that, because you
always have to remain friends.

214
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:52,688
l like to remain friends
with people l was friends with.

215
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:56,269
Hey, why don't you just go then?

216
00:10:56,436 --> 00:11:00,399
And give this to George.
Tell him he owes me $500.

217
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:05,110
He transcends time and space.

218
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:08,376
He sickens me.

219
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,537
l love it.

220
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,966
Me too.

221
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,829
Five hundred dollars?

222
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,495
-What?
-That's what she told me.

223
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,180
l'm not paying $500 for this!

224
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:26,754
lt's a piece of junk!

225
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,305
-That's what it costs.
-Why did you take it?

226
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:32,543
-You broke up with her.
-l wasn't thinking. l don't know.

227
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,012
You weren't thinking.

228
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:38,979
l mean, she framed it
and everything.

229
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,967
l'm not buying this.
No way. Forget it.

230
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,505
No way l'm buying this.

231
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,871
l mean, look at it! What is it?

232
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,588
lt's a bunch of squiggly lines.

233
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:49,545
Are you telling me you
couldn't paint this?

234
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,027
You want me to paint you something?
l'd love to paint you something.

235
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,083
l'm not paying for this.

236
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,031
lf you were going out with her,
it'd be a different story.

237
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:01,038
This was in front of your door.

238
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,632
-Hey, Kramer.
-Hi, Mike.

239
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:07,627
Wow, a letter from Nina!

240
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:12,178
Man, that is the ugliest thing
l've ever seen.

241
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,600
-Oh, my God.
-What?

242
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,007
This is amazing.
You can't believe this.

243
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,172
Listen to this. ''l don't know what
you expect to find, Jerry.

244
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,571
You know what you want better than
me, but there's one thing l do know.

245
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,807
l can stand here watching
you try to destroy...

246
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:28,983
...everything l've ever
wanted in my life...

247
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:33,213
...wanting to smash your face with my
fists because you won't even make...

248
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,696
...the slightest effort to opt for
happiness and still know l love you.

249
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,290
You mean so much to me,
l'm willing to take your abuse...

250
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:40,836
...insults and insensitivity.''

251
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:43,300
-Wow.
-She's deep.

252
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:47,589
''Because that's what you need to
do to prove l'm not gonna leave you.

253
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:50,788
l'm sick and tired of running from
places and people and relationships.

254
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:53,344
You want me,
then fight for me, beca--

255
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:57,891
Because l'm sure as hell
fighting for you.

256
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,430
l think we're both worth it.''

257
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:11,633
You know, Jerry,
she sounds like a poet.

258
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:14,252
Boy, no one's ever written me
a letter like this.

259
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,210
Maybe l was wrong about her.

260
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:19,157
Get in there and give her a call.
Pick up the phone and call her.

261
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:22,517
-Should l?
-Yes, you're damn right you should!

262
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:25,233
Fight for her, Jerry!
She's sure the hell fighting for you!

263
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:26,745
All right!

264
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:29,877
l'll call her.

265
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,690
Don't go in there.
You're gonna get shot.

266
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,348
l told you.

267
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,381
-Yeah.
-<i>It's George.</i>

268
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,038
Come on up.

269
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:59,528
Well, now we gotta get
a posse together.

270
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,481
l love a good posse.

271
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,549
What's the appeal of the posse?

272
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,026
The appeal of the posse?

273
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:08,078
Posse has tremendous appeal.

274
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:11,884
Get away from the job, you camp out,
you're with friends.

275
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:17,161
Come on, it's a week-long game of
hide and go seek on horseback.

276
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:20,430
Hello, George.

277
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:22,386
Hey. Hey, Nina.

278
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,253
l owe you some money, don't l?

279
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:32,852
-Well, l really love that piece.
-Me too. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

280
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:36,151
You know, in fact, l've been
thinking about it, and...

281
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,706
...you know, l feel like
l'm stealing from you.

282
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:42,261
Five hundred dollars! This is
gonna be worth thousands soon.

283
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:45,530
You know what? On second thought,
l can't even accept this.

284
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:49,494
No, no, no. George, a deal's a deal.
l want you to have it.

285
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:52,731
This could be in a museum someday.
lt's not safe with me.

286
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,650
lt should really be
in a doorman building.

287
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,269
Honestly, George,
the money's not important.

288
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:00,097
Who said anything about money?

289
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:03,461
-Yeah.
-<i>It's Elaine.</i>

290
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,803
Come on up.

291
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:06,496
-Elaine?
-Yeah.

292
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,477
She does not believe in telephones,
does she?

293
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:13,191
She likes the pop-in.
l've told her how l hate the pop-in.

294
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:14,819
He likes the pop-in too.

295
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,413
Just popped in now.
l'm a big pop-in guy.

296
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,494
-He is.
-What about Kramer?

297
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,901
Huge pop-in guy.

298
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,286
Well, l was leaving anyway.
So we're on for tomorrow?

299
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:28,754
-Yeah.
-Okay. Bye.

300
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,111
Hello.

301
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,599
Chatty gal.

302
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,383
Lippman's coming back tomorrow.
l'll be fired.

303
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,455
lf he noticed it,
he would have called you.

304
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,016
No. He wants to torture me.

305
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,355
Will you give me the clicker?

306
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:49,013
l hate it when you have the clicker.
You're too fast.

307
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,085
Get out!
l'm a great clicker.

308
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,238
l have great instincts.

309
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,473
How dare you impugn my clicking.

310
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,169
You're all over the dial.
You don't know what you want.

311
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:02,561
You never stay on anything longer
than five seconds. Just give me that.

312
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:04,580
-Let go.
-Come on. l want it, Jerry!

313
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:06,564
-Let go, Elaine!
-Then let George do it!

314
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,450
-George can't click!
-Give it to me!

315
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,525
Give it! Give it! Give it!

316
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:12,355
Pinheads.

317
00:16:13,193 --> 00:16:14,852
<i>Maybe I can't...</i>

318
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:19,206
<i>...analyze and theorize and...</i>

319
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,794
<i>...speculate on why we</i>--

320
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:24,006
Wait a second. Go back to that.
Go back to that.

321
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,150
<i>Hey, you read all those books,</i>
<i>not me.</i>

322
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,913
lt's <i>Chapter Two</i>.
lt's Neil Simon.

323
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,186
<i>But one thing I do know.</i>

324
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,143
<i>I know how I feel.</i>

325
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:35,113
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

326
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:38,132
-What?
-My God. The letter. That's the letter!

327
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,787
-What letter?
-This is the letter she wrote to me.

328
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,893
She stole it from the movie!

329
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:44,373
<i>Because you don't even make....</i>

330
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,254
''The slightest effort
to opt for happiness...

331
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,833
...and still know that l love you!''

332
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:53,108
This is incredible.

333
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:56,890
l always thought there was something
funny about this letter.

334
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:58,811
She's copied it right out of
<i>Chapter Two</i>.

335
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:00,863
She's a thief! A bunco artist.

336
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,359
Maybe l won't send her that check.

337
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:09,340
You know, it's not really that terrible.

338
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,825
What are you talking about? She
completely misrepresented herself.

339
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,933
l don't opt for happiness.
l opt for happiness.

340
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,755
James Caan doesn't
opt for happiness.

341
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:22,980
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:25,066
She wouldn't take the cap off?

343
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:29,834
No. But didn't she know they
were the owner's seats?

344
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:32,584
Oh, that's unbelievable.

345
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,338
Yeah, okay. All right, Lenny.

346
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:36,846
Thanks again.

347
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:38,732
Take care.

348
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:43,441
That's Lenny West, my accountant,
who's a hell of a guy.

349
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,026
He handles the Yankees too.
lt's his biggest account.

350
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,416
So every once in a while,
they throw him a couple of seats...

351
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,880
...and last weekend,
he gave them to his daughter.

352
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:56,919
She's an artist, by the way.
Anyway...

353
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:59,734
...her daughter gives them
to some friends, you know?

354
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,137
One of her friends shows up...

355
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,374
...wearing a Baltimore cap.

356
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,773
You're from Baltimore, right?

357
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,958
lt's Towson.
That's near Baltimore.

358
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:13,886
But you're an Oriole fan, right?

359
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,440
Well, fan....
You know, my father--

360
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:19,580
Anyway, she refused
to take the cap off.

361
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,243
She caused a whole big scene.

362
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:23,486
Really? That's so impudent.

363
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:27,137
Yeah. So Lenny gave me
the tickets for tomorrow night.

364
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:30,371
l'm inviting Frank and Marsha.
Want you to come.

365
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:36,616
l've got plans, though, Mr. Lippman.

366
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,210
Well, break them.

367
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,871
You missed the <i>bris</i>.
l want you at the game.

368
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,261
Okay. Okay.

369
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,815
-Good.
-Okay, Mr. Lippman.

370
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:53,645
And, Elaine, you know the Baltimore
cap you got in your office...

371
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:56,367
...wear it. l'm gonna have
a little fun with him.

372
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,847
That will be fun.

373
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,527
How's it coming?

374
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,635
Good. Good.

375
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:11,484
Seen any good movies lately?

376
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,780
No. Not really.

377
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,310
-You?
-No.

378
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:19,578
l like a good comedy.

379
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:22,299
You know, like a Neil Simon.

380
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:25,337
-You like Neil Simon?
-Neil Simon?

381
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:27,075
Some of his stuff.

382
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,059
l've seen most of it.

383
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:32,070
l guess my favorite
would have to be...

384
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:34,141
...<i>Chapter Two.</i>

385
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,119
Have you ever seen that?

386
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:40,929
l don't know. Maybe.

387
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:42,663
l have.

388
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:45,771
Funny. Funny.

389
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,909
ln fact, it was on TV
just the other night.

390
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:49,770
Happened to catch it.

391
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:53,166
l couldn't help but notice...

392
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,501
...a stunning similarity....

393
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,488
Well, we've made our decision.

394
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,309
We want the <i>Kramer</i>.

395
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,161
Five thousand? Why would anybody
buy Kramer for $5000?

396
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,158
Boy, the Yankees cannot
buy a hit tonight.

397
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:15,540
So is it all over between you
and Marsha Mason?

398
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:17,849
Yeah.

399
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:20,956
And by the way, can you get
this thing out of my house?

400
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,613
l'll make a deal with you.

401
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:25,631
-l'll sell it to you for 1 0 bucks.
-Please.

402
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:30,845
<i>Seems to be a lot of trouble in the</i>
<i>area just behind the Yankee dugout.</i>

403
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,017
Behind the dugout? That's where
we were sitting the other night.

404
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,346
<i>We're not gonna show it, don't want</i>
<i>to encourage that kind of behavior.</i>

405
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,156
<i>It's a young lady, and she's really</i>
<i>going at it with the security guard.</i>

406
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,899
<i>She's a feisty one. They're getting the</i>
<i>other security guard to come down.</i>

407
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,309
<i>How do you like that, Seaver?</i>

408
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,896
<i>And, boy, she's something,</i>
<i>and a Baltimore fan at that.</i>

409
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,140
<i>Holy cow!</i>

410
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:59,849
When l was 1 7, l ran away from home
and hopped a steamship to Sweden.

411
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:04,236
-This steak is excellent, by the way.
-More potatoes?

412
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,832
Yeah, yeah, sure. Please.

413
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:10,096
Yes, yes, go on. You hopped
a steamship to Sweden?

414
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:14,253
lt was a big one.

415
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:17,107
Baseball season's starting.
l'm very excited about that.

416
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:20,023
Did you ever sneak down
to better seats at the game...

417
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,909
...and get caught by the usher?

418
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,240
When you're a kid, you're getting
chased from every place anyway.

419
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:27,706
When you're an adult,
it's really embarrassing.

420
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,805
You have to pretend like there's
some confusion.

421
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,359
You put on this whole act.
You're looking at the tickets.

422
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:37,464
''l don't understand how this
could have happened.

423
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,489
Let me see. l see the problem.

424
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,586
These are very good seats.
l have very bad seats.

425
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:45,245
That's the misunderstanding.''
