1
00:00:02,058 --> 00:00:03,401
As a kid, my favorite ride...

2
00:00:04,877 --> 00:00:07,335
...was the bumper car. Remember?
Going around in a circle.

3
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:09,547
There was always one kid
that could not do it.

4
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:10,928
Do you remember this kid?

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,951
As soon as the ride gets started...

6
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:15,417
...he'd be, like, stuck
in a pack of empty cars.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,271
Just--

8
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:21,143
''Excuse me.

9
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:23,452
Excuse me. It won't go!

10
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:25,121
Come on!

11
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:27,653
It's almost over!''

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,760
He always ends up
with the attendant...

13
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,482
...hanging off that big pole
helping him steer it.

14
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,486
''Stop crying.''

15
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,342
Then there's always
that other--

16
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:41,914
One other really bad car--

17
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,506
The helpless father-and-son team.

18
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,534
This is another car just
not going anywhere.

19
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,805
They're never organized.
Who's on the wheel?

20
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:49,402
Who's pressing on the gas? Just:

21
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:51,485
''Son, turn the wheel.''

22
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:58,349
All right, Coney Island?

23
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:01,134
Okay, you can take the B or the F
and switch for the N...

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,545
...at Broadway and Lafayette.

25
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:04,621
Or you can go over the bridge
to DeKalb...

26
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,452
...and catch the Q
to Atlantic Avenue...

27
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:09,491
...then switch to the IRT,
2, 3, 4 or 5.

28
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:10,874
But don't get on the G.

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,083
That's very tempting,
but you wind up on Smith...

30
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,457
...and 9th Street.
Then you gotta get on the R.

31
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,885
Couldn't he just take the D
straight to Coney Island?

32
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,545
Well, yeah.

33
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,713
Okay. What time is your
job interview, George?

34
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:27,053
<i>9</i>:45.

35
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,498
Don't whistle on the elevator.

36
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,343
-Why not?
-That's what Willy Loman told Biff...

37
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,655
...before his interview
in <i>Death of a Salesman</i>.

38
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,027
You're comparing me to Biff Loman?
Very encouraging.

39
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:38,845
The biggest loser in the history
of American literature.

40
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,283
-I gotta get going.
-What time's the lesbian wedding?

41
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:43,748
-<i>9</i>:30.
-Lesbian wedding.

42
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:46,731
How do they work the bride and groom
on that? Do they flip a coin?

43
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:48,870
Yeah, they flip a coin.

44
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:52,361
What, was that not politically correct?
It’s a legitimate question.

45
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:55,987
I’m so tired. I’m gonna fall asleep
on that train.

46
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:58,577
I feel when lesbians are looking at me,
they're thinking:

47
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,539
''That's why I’m not a heterosexual.''

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,410
All right, Jerry, come on.
Pick up the check so we can go.

49
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,068
-I’m paying for breakfast?
-Yeah.

50
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:09,729
-Yeah.
-Why do I always pay?

51
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,754
What am l, made of money?

52
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,475
You bunch of deadbeats.

53
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,782
How many tickets you paying today?

54
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:21,330
Let's see. Speeding, running a
red light, no license, no registration...

55
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,012
...no plates, no brake lights,
no rear-view mirror.

56
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:27,225
Look at that one.

57
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:29,818
-''No doors''?
-Yeah, I’m fighting that one.

58
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,897
You know, this is gonna cost me
over 600 bucks.

59
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,672
I can't carry change in these pants.
It falls out.

60
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,227
-Here you go.
-There you go.

61
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:42,702
Thank you.

62
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:46,995
That guy's not blind.

63
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,708
So can I convince anybody
to come down to Coney Island?

64
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,116
Gotta pick up my car
at the pound. George?

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,104
I can't believe they found
your stolen car.

66
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,576
Not only did they find it...

67
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,131
...it was simonized,
and the front end was aligned.

68
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:01,699
-That's amazing.
-So, what do you say?

69
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:04,203
Ride on the Cyclone.
Hot dog at Nathan's on me.

70
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,604
Who are you, Satan?
I’m close to a job here.

71
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:09,008
-It’s my second interview.
-All right, Biff.

72
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,198
Elaine? Merry-go-round?

73
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,410
I can't. I’m the best man.

74
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:17,879
Kramer. Bumper cars.

75
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:21,017
I gotta go to court. I’ll get in trouble.
What's the matter with you?

76
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:23,294
It could be years till I get
back to Coney Island.

77
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:24,739
I can't go on the rides alone.

78
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:27,655
<i>42nd Street. Change for the D</i>
<i>and the double R...</i>

79
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:30,123
<i>...the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,</i>
<i>the C, K and F train.</i>

80
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,018
Well....

81
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,471
See you.

82
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,749
Hey!

83
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:46,021
Yeah!

84
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,242
-You looking for a job?
-Me? Why?

85
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,575
Well, you're reading
the classifieds.

86
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,821
Oh, no. No, no.

87
00:05:43,988 --> 00:05:46,861
I was just looking for the stock page.
Here it is.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,824
Looking for the quotes.

89
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:50,395
Gotta check the quotes.

90
00:05:50,556 --> 00:05:52,314
Love a good quote.

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,685
IBM up a quarter.

92
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,320
What do you know?

93
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:59,552
You didn't look like someone
who needed a job.

94
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:02,788
Me? No, I don't.

95
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:07,114
Doing very well. Very well, yeah.

96
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,781
So you're in the market?

97
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:12,115
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I’m in the market.

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,459
Which market?

99
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,886
Which market? The.... The big one.

100
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:19,391
The big market with the big board.

101
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:23,004
Bull market, bear market.
You name the market, I’m there.

102
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,437
So do you work for one of
the big brokerage houses?

103
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,880
They wish.

104
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,419
I hate the big brokerage houses.

105
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:31,012
Hate them with a passion.

106
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,876
Big brokerage houses
killed my father.

107
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,569
-Really?
-Well, they hurt him bad.

108
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:37,710
Really hurt his feelings.

109
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,917
It’s a long story.
I don't like to talk about it...

110
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,184
...but I swore I would never work
for a big brokerage house.

111
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:47,257
See, all they care about is money.

112
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:50,237
I’m about more than money.
I’m about...

113
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,586
...people.

114
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,859
So I’ve always gone my own way...

115
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,169
...and I’ve never looked back.

116
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:19,816
I started riding these trains
in the '40s.

117
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:24,042
Those days, a man would give up
his seat for a woman.

118
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,791
Now we're liberated.
We have to stand.

119
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,265
It’s ironic.

120
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:30,740
What's ironic?

121
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,917
This. That we've come all this way,
we made all this progress...

122
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:36,983
...but, you know, we lost
the little things, the niceties.

123
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,969
No, I mean,
what does ''ironic'' mean?

124
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:45,158
Where you off to
with such a nice present?

125
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:47,366
-Birthday party?
-A wedding.

126
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,260
-A wedding?
-Yeah.

127
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:52,239
I didn't think people
still get married.

128
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,508
It’s hard today
with the men and women.

129
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,043
You're telling me.

130
00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:00,725
-So they're a nice couple?
-Oh, very nice.

131
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,231
What does he do,
if you don't mind my asking?

132
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:04,957
-She.
-She?

133
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:08,871
She. She works, he doesn't.
He sounds like my son.

134
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:10,950
There is no ''he.''

135
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:12,841
There's no he?

136
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,049
So who's getting married?

137
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,842
Two women.

138
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:19,533
It’s...

139
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:21,046
...a lesbian wedding.

140
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,983
Lesbian wedding?

141
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,760
Yep. Yep, I’m...

142
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,911
...the best man.

143
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:34,599
Great.

144
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:40,200
My luck. I don't talk to a soul
on the subway for 35 years...

145
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:42,957
...I get the best man
at a lesbian wedding.

146
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,784
No, no. You don't understand.

147
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,478
I’m not a lesbian!

148
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,686
I hate men, but I’m not a lesbian.

149
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:36,140
<i>I'm really looking forward to this.</i>

150
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,063
<i>I love weddings.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll meet somebody.</i>

151
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:41,433
<i>Maybe not.</i>

152
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,290
<i>Oh, man. We're stopping?</i>

153
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,719
Well, this is where I get off.

154
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:54,535
-You do?
-Yeah.

155
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,671
Hey, why don't you...? Oh, nothing.

156
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,244
No, no. What?

157
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,715
Well, I was gonna say,
''Why don't you get off with me.''

158
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,789
But you're obviously very busy
on your way...

159
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,872
...to some important meeting
or something.

160
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:07,990
Yeah. Well....

161
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,527
See, I knew it was a bad idea.

162
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,309
Hey, what's another million,
give or take? I get off...

163
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,364
...when and where I wanna get off.

164
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,720
I’m stuck. Could you just pull it
a little--?

165
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:26,128
This'll just be a second.

166
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,277
Don't-- Don't start the train!

167
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:29,618
Don't start the train!

168
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:32,596
Here it is. Here it is,
the four horse in the first race.

169
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,839
-Pappernick.
-How do you know he's gonna win?

170
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:36,536
My UPS guy. Lance.

171
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:38,944
The guys who own the horse
are his regular customers.

172
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,769
Every horse he's ever given me
has won.

173
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,692
-Yeah?
-Yeah. They've been sandbagging...

174
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:45,281
...looking for a good spot.
He's been getting in light...

175
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:48,555
...because they're using a bug boy.
The workouts have been unpublished.

176
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:51,025
They're ready to run with him.
Gonna break his maiden.

177
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,525
He's gonna go for a great price,
maybe 30-1 .

178
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,111
-I’m telling you, it's a lock.
-But it rained last night.

179
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,706
Exactly. This horse loves the slop.

180
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:01,214
It’s in his bloodlines.
His father was a mudder.

181
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,550
-His mother was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder?

182
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:06,500
What did I say? Let's go to the office.
I’m gonna call my bookie.

183
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,126
Hey, don't tell anybody.

184
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:13,765
Oh, man.

185
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:33,924
Okay.

186
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,576
You realize, of course, you're naked.

187
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:51,253
Naked, dressed,
I don't see any difference.

188
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,241
You ought to sit here.

189
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,818
There's a difference.

190
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:57,891
You got something
against the naked body?

191
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:00,356
I got something against yours.

192
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,339
How about a couple of deep knee
bends, maybe some squat-thrusts?

193
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:05,478
Who's got time for squat-thrusts?

194
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:08,018
All right, how about
skipping breakfast?

195
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:10,965
I’m guessing you're not a
''half-grapefruit and black coffee'' man.

196
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,373
I like a good breakfast.

197
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:15,224
I understand.
I like a good breakfast...

198
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:18,621
...long as you don't wind up trapped
in a room in overalls and pigtails...

199
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:20,542
...being counseled by Dick Gregory.

200
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,198
I’m not ashamed of my body.

201
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,113
Exactly. That's your problem.
You should be.

202
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,319
Don't get up.

203
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,627
Please, allow me.

204
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,170
<i>Oh, this is great.</i>

205
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,313
<i>This is what I need,</i>
<i>just what I need.</i>

206
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,133
<i>Okay, take it easy.</i>
<i>I'm sure it's nothing.</i>

207
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,027
<i>Probably rats on the track.</i>

208
00:12:44,192 --> 00:12:46,082
<i>They're stopping for rats.</i>

209
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:48,444
<i>God, it's so crowded.</i>

210
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:50,624
<i>How could there be</i>
<i>so many people?</i>

211
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,216
<i>This guy really smells.</i>

212
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:55,245
<i>Doesn't anyone use deodorant</i>
<i>in the city?</i>

213
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,962
<i>What is so hard?</i>
<i>You take the cap off, you roll it on.</i>

214
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,621
<i>What's that? I feel something</i>
<i>rubbing against me.</i>

215
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,343
<i>These disgusting animals.</i>
<i>These people should be in a cage.</i>

216
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:05,717
<i>We are in a cage.</i>

217
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:07,638
<i>What if I miss the wedding?</i>

218
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,181
<i>I got the ring. What'll they do?</i>

219
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:11,736
<i>You can't get married</i>
<i>without a ring. Oh, God</i>--

220
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,920
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

221
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,429
<i>I feel faint.</i>

222
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:18,409
<i>Okay, take it easy.</i>
<i>It'll start moving soon.</i>

223
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:21,389
<i>Think about people in concentration</i>
<i>camps, what they went through.</i>

224
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,337
<i>And the hostages! What would</i>
<i>you do if you were a hostage?</i>

225
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,087
<i>Think about that. This is nothing.</i>

226
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:29,745
<i>No, it's not nothing, it's something.</i>

227
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:32,502
<i>It's a nightmare. Help me!</i>

228
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:35,422
<i>Move it! Come on!</i>
<i>Move this f****** thing!</i>

229
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:36,960
<i>Why isn't it moving?!</i>

230
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:39,711
<i>What could go wrong with a train?</i>
<i>It's on tracks.</i>

231
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,816
<i>There's no traffic.</i>
<i>How could a train get stuck?</i>

232
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,646
<i>Step on the gas!</i>

233
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:47,685
<i>What could it be? You'd think the</i>
<i>conductor would explain it to us.</i>

234
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:50,860
<i>''I'm sorry, there's a delay.</i>
<i>We'll be moving in five minutes. ''</i>

235
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:54,381
<i>I wanna hear a voice.</i>
<i>What's that on my leg?!</i>

236
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:05,923
Nice.

237
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:09,379
Your company sends you
on the road often, huh?

238
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:13,453
Nice. Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there.

239
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,139
Make yourself comfortable.

240
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:19,245
<i>Make myself comfortable?</i>
<i>What does that mean?</i>

241
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:22,484
<i>Does she want me to take my clothes</i>
<i>off? Is she taking her clothes off?</i>

242
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,855
<i>What if I take mine off</i>
<i>and she still has hers on?</i>

243
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:27,414
<i>I'd look like an idiot.</i>
<i>She'd get offended and leave.</i>

244
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,343
<i>So maybe I should leave them on.</i>

245
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:31,877
<i>But what if she takes hers off?</i>
<i>She'll feel humiliated.</i>

246
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:34,665
<i>''Make yourself comfortable?''</i>
<i>This woman's unbelievable.</i>

247
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,519
<i>This ''comfortable'' thing</i>
<i>could ruin me.</i>

248
00:14:36,684 --> 00:14:39,721
<i>I got it. I'll take my shoes off</i>
<i>and sit on the bed.</i>

249
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:41,068
<i>There. That's comfortable.</i>

250
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:43,754
<i>She can't accuse me</i>
<i>of being uncomfortable.</i>

251
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:51,581
I gotta tell you,
I’m pretty comfortable.

252
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:54,204
Oh, yeah, it's all set.

253
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,379
-They've got the bug boy on it.
-The bug boy?

254
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,040
Yeah, the little fellow's
been riding his heart out.

255
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,153
-They're gonna break his maiden.
-Really?

256
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:02,731
-Yeah.
-It’s a little slow out.

257
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:05,001
-Rained last night.
-This baby loves the slop.

258
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:08,106
Loves it. Eats it up.
Eats the slop. Born to slop.

259
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,488
His father was a mudder.

260
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,958
-His father was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder.

261
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,497
His mother was a mudder?

262
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,191
What did I just say?

263
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,167
Hey. All right.

264
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:21,089
Six hundred, Pappernick to win.

265
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,608
They still have no pitching.
Gooden's a question mark.

266
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,009
You don't recover from those
rotator cuffs so fast.

267
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,347
I’m not worried about
the Mets' pitching.

268
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:34,160
-They got no hitting.
-No, they got hitting. Bonilla, Murray.

269
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,564
-They got no defense.
-Defense, please.

270
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,415
-They need speed.
-Speed? They've got Coleman.

271
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,654
-They need a bullpen.
-Franco's no good?

272
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:44,094
-They got no team leaders.
-They got Franco.

273
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,786
What they need is a front office.

274
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:48,289
-But you gotta like their chances.
-I love them.

275
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:51,874
lf they win it this year, I’ll sit naked
with you at the World Series.

276
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,025
It’s a deal.

277
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:58,189
<i>Why couldn't I take a cab?</i>

278
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:01,391
<i>For $6, my whole life</i>
<i>could have changed.</i>

279
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,760
<i>What is that on my leg?</i>

280
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,188
<i>I'll never get out of here.</i>

281
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:10,330
<i>What if I'm here</i>
<i>for the rest of my life?</i>

282
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,992
<i>Maybe I'll get out in five seconds.</i>

283
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,615
<i>One banana, two banana...</i>

284
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,958
<i>...three banana, four banana...</i>

285
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:19,651
<i>...five banana.</i>

286
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,919
<i>No. I'm still here.</i>

287
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,545
<i>Still here.</i>
<i>When will they start moving?</i>

288
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,053
<i>Move!</i>

289
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:30,772
<i>Move! Move!</i>

290
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,395
<i>It's moving.</i>

291
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:35,386
<i>It's moving!</i>

292
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:37,433
<i>Yes!</i>

293
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:38,944
<i>Yes.</i>

294
00:16:40,935 --> 00:16:42,530
<i>Mother******!</i>

295
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,282
Gee, I hope you have the key
for these things.

296
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:54,414
Oh, don't worry, I do.

297
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,720
My mother used to walk
around our apartment...

298
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,137
...in her bra and panties.

299
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:01,948
She didn't look anything like you.
She was...

300
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:05,315
...really disgusting, really bad body.

301
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:10,217
You know, if you can imagine an
uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth.

302
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:12,389
Remember Shirley Booth in <i>Hazel</i>?

303
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,119
Really embarrassing,
because I had the only mother...

304
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,324
...in the neighborhood
who was worse than Hazel.

305
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:20,497
-You can imagine the taunts I'd hear.
-Like what?

306
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,074
Like:

307
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:24,886
''Hey, your mother's
uglier than Hazel.''

308
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:27,868
''Hazel really puts your mother
to shame.'' You know.

309
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:36,968
What's going on?

310
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:40,332
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, but I have to get going.

311
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:43,856
Get going? But we haven't really,
you know....

312
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:45,495
Eight dollars?

313
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,764
-Eight dollars?
-What are you doing, robbing me?

314
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:50,105
I wasted my whole morning
on you for $8?

315
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,822
Wait a second.
What are you doing?

316
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,523
-I’m taking your clothes.
-No, no, that's my only suit!

317
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,503
It cost me $350!
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!

318
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:01,221
-Bye, George.
-You can't just leave me here.

319
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:04,139
Will I see you again?

320
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,530
<i>It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet...</i>

321
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:15,483
<i>...Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony</i>
<i>and then a long way to Flagrant.</i>

322
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:18,366
-Come on!
-<i>Into the stretch...</i>

323
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:21,631
<i>...with an 1/8th of a mile to go,</i>
<i>Stepagain, Passionel battling it out.</i>

324
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:24,452
<i>Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's</i>
<i>starting to make some ground...</i>

325
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:27,970
-<i>...but Stepagain is the leader....</i>
-Come on.

326
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,309
-Come on! Yes!
-<i>Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings.</i>

327
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:33,712
-Yes! Yes!
-<i>Stepagain, just falling back.</i>

328
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:35,984
-Yes!
-<i>Pappernick flashing home.</i>

329
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:39,603
<i>Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick</i>
<i>and Stepagain to the line....</i>

330
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:43,383
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-<i>The winner is Pappernick.</i>

331
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:46,556
Yes, yes! I won. Hey!

332
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:54,664
Yeah.

333
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:32,635
I haven't had a hot dog
at Nathan's in 20 years.

334
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,141
First, we ride the Cyclone.

335
00:19:35,745 --> 00:19:37,209
Chilly out.

336
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,665
French fries.

337
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:50,477
Hey, hey!

338
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,099
Give me the money.

339
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:56,089
Freeze! Police!

340
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:04,352
No, I never got the car.
We had such a good time...

341
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:07,368
...by the time I got to
the police garage, it was closed.

342
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:09,573
Too bad.

343
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,742
You wouldn't believe what this guy
put away at Nathan's.

344
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,085
Look at what we won.
You want him?

345
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:16,594
Get that out of my face.

346
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:20,759
So you missed the wedding.
You'll catch the <i>bris</i>.

347
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,403
<i>Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!</i>

348
00:20:30,886 --> 00:20:33,890
How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist
down your throat, you little punk?

349
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,027
George.

350
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:38,377
Biff.

351
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:41,265
What, did you whistle
on the elevator?

352
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,437
I have my spare key
in your apartment, right?

353
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:45,172
Yeah, in the kitchen drawer.

354
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:46,996
-Give me your key.
-What happened?

355
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,330
Never mind what happened,
just give me the key.

356
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:53,531
-Come on, I’ll go with you.
-Here. Pay.

357
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,739
Wait, wait. Give me that.

358
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,615
All right.

359
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:09,296
So I take the subway
down to Coney Island...

360
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:11,603
...to go on the Cyclone.
I’m riding on the subway.

361
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,839
I’m sitting on the D train
for an hour and 1 5 minutes...

362
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:17,464
...to go on a scary ride.

363
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:19,707
Okay, how dumb is that?

364
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:23,042
You know that first sharp drop
on the Cyclone? Fell asleep.
