420
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,337
-No!
-Vandalay!

421
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,711
Say Vandalay!

422
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,047
No, you're way, way, way off!

423
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,765
Yeah, that's the right number,
but this is an apartment.

424
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:34,071
-No, say--
-Vandalay! Say--

425
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,178
Vandalay Industries!

426
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:39,093
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

427
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,972
How did you know who they wanted?!

428
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,428
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

429
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:05,787
Just sign here, please.

430
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,700
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.

431
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,480
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?

432
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:15,060
-I could sell latex like that.
-Just sign that.

433
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:26,040
-Who is this?
-It’s my daughter.

434
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,404
This is your daughter?

435
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,030
My God!

436
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:34,231
My God!

437
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,782
I hope you don't mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

438
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,404
You think so?

439
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,113
Would you take this picture away
from me? Just take it away.

440
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,516
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.

441
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,784
Let me just sign this and go.

442
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,130
You know...

443
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,369
...she doesn't even have a boyfriend.

444
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:56,182
Okay. Okay.

445
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,714
Who do you think you're talking to?

446
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:01,215
You trying to make a joke,
Mrs. Sokol? It’s not funny.

447
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,553
I can tell you that.

448
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,415
I’m serious. She doesn't.

449
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:07,936
You know, it's one thing to not
give me the extension.

450
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,162
But to tease and
to torture me like this...

451
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:12,734
...there's no call for that.

452
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,165
Would you like her phone number?

453
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:22,013
Mrs. Sokol,
I don't know what to say.

454
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:26,912
-Where should I sign this thing?
-No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it.

455
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,943
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.

456
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:33,048
Even if you get a job after
you've been unemployed...

457
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:36,446
...they take unemployment out
of your check every week...

458
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,457
...and show it to you in that little box.

459
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,738
How good can it be for your
confidence that every paycheck...

460
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,872
...has the word ''unemployment''
on it?

461
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:49,953
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!

462
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:52,350
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

463
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,337
I have a friend who's unemployed.

464
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,222
He's collecting unemployment
insurance.

465
00:23:56,386 --> 00:24:01,886
This guy has never worked this hard
in his life to keep this thing going.

466
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:07,193
He's down there every week waiting
on the lines and getting interviewed...

467
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,233
...and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

468
00:24:10,402 --> 00:24:15,705
lf they had any idea the effort
and energy that he is expending...

469
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,974
...to avoid work, I’m sure they'd give
him a raise. I’m sure of it.

470
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,916
The guy is doing a tremendous job...

471
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,459
...not working.

472
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,289
So tell me more
about this game six.

473
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:31,268
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the tenth.

474
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:34,045
We're one out away
from losing the series.

475
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:43,581
Hello. How are you?

476
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,641
So, what do you think?

477
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,917
Do you love her?

478
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,451
Yes, I do love her.

479
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,843
You have a very nice place here.

480
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,914
So who do you think she looks like?

481
00:24:58,084 --> 00:24:59,514
Lyndon Johnson.

482
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,970
What? Lyndon Johnson?

483
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,286
He's joking.

484
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:07,770
No, I’m not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.

485
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:11,257
Jerry, I can't believe it took you
so long to see the baby.

486
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:14,658
I kept saying to Michael, ''When is
Jerry going to see the baby?''

487
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:16,346
I was saying the same thing.

488
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:18,852
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.

489
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:22,308
-You don't have to take a picture.
-I don't know where it is.

490
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,252
It’s in the bottom drawer
of our dresser.

491
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:27,007
Hurry up!

492
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,857
He's such an idiot.

493
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:34,012
Jerry, you want to pick her up?

494
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,939
-I better not.
-I’ll pick her up.

495
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:37,564
<i>No!</i>

496
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,602
Thank you for a wonderful time,
George.

497
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,977
Glad you enjoyed it.

498
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:46,242
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

499
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:48,195
Billions and billions.

500
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,300
Would you like to come up?

501
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:54,244
Would I like to come up?

502
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:57,091
I would love to come up.

503
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,781
I’m...I’m fighting not to.

504
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,513
Fighting.

505
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,238
Unfortunately, l...

506
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,678
...I have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.

507
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,434
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

508
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,429
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

509
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,021
I’m not saying I want to do it
for the rest of my life...

510
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:19,046
...but hardware fascinates me.

511
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,544
Wouldn't you love to make a key?

512
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:26,465
Will you call me as soon
as you get home?

513
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,658
-Tonight?
-Yes.

514
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:35,199
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?

515
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:39,680
You kill me. You really kill me.

516
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:42,911
Well, good night.

517
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:51,208
It was an accident. Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.

518
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:53,758
Oh, she's gonna be all right.

519
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:57,281
Here, baby. Here.
Here, baby.

520
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,200
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?

521
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,177
I have a friend who's got a baby.

522
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,065
''Gotta see the baby.

523
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:09,151
You've got to come over
and see the baby.''

524
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:14,345
Nobody ever wants you to come over
and see their grandfather, do they?

525
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,376
''You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.

526
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:19,368
He's so cute.

527
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,964
1 68 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.

528
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,506
He's 1 000 months.

529
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:30,344
You know, the mid 80s is such
a good time for the grand-people.

530
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,199
The mid 80s, you gotta see them.

531
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,982
He went to the bathroom
by himself today.''

532
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,908
You know what's tough about seeing
people when they have a baby...

533
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,173
...is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

534
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,413
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

535
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,107
''What do you think of him?''

536
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:49,130
I’d like to meet a couple that goes:

537
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,489
''You know, we're not that happy
with him, frankly.

538
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:55,949
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.

539
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,758
You want him? We don't even
want him. You want him?''

540
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,355
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.

541
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:05,987
Yeah, it was.

542
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:09,731
<i>Gosh, should I kiss her good night?</i>

543
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,779
<i>Is he going to try and kiss me?</i>

544
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:16,300
-I love Cajun cooking.
-Really?

545
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,249
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

546
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,228
Oh, my father's half-drunk.

547
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,244
Maybe they should get together.

548
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,451
<i>Go ahead. Kiss her.</i>

549
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:30,923
<i>I'm a baseball player, damn it.</i>

550
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:33,574
<i>What's he waiting for?</i>

551
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,628
<i>I thought he was a cool guy.</i>

552
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:40,908
<i>Come on. I won the MVP in '7 9.</i>
<i>I can do whatever I want to.</i>

553
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,123
<i>Well, this is getting awkward.</i>

554
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,798
Well, good night.

555
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:51,178
Good night.

556
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:58,990
<i>Who does this guy think he is?</i>

557
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,159
<i>I'm Keith Hernandez.</i>

558
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,161
Who else?

559
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,726
Mookie. Mookie was there.

560
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:09,482
You know him?

561
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,905
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.

562
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:16,075
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.

563
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,623
-He's the one who got that hit--
-I know. He got the hit in game six!

564
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,860
So then what happened?

565
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,069
Nothing. The he took me home.

566
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,259
So did you two...

567
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:32,907
...have....

568
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,106
What?

569
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,146
You know.

570
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:40,906
Milk?

571
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,663
-No.
-Cookies?

572
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:49,865
Did he kiss you good night?

573
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:51,790
I don't know.

574
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:54,701
What do you mean, you don't know?

575
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:58,316
All right. He kissed me, okay?

576
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,942
Well, what kind of a kiss?

577
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:04,107
Was it a peck? Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?

578
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,986
Between a peck and a make-out.

579
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,224
So you like him.

580
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:12,810
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.

581
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,352
Now you're jealous of him?

582
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:17,133
I’m jealous of everybody.

583
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,759
Hello.

584
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,864
Oh, hi. What's happening?

585
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,239
What?

586
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:32,589
Sure.

587
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,469
Yeah, okay.

588
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:38,254
Then.... I’ll see you then.

589
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,663
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

590
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,005
Bye.

591
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,952
-Who was that?
-That was Keith.

592
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:48,111
-What's going on?
-He wants me to help him move.

593
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,442
Help him move?

594
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:52,912
Move what?

595
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:55,596
You know, furniture.

596
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,829
So, what did you say?

597
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,363
I said, yes, but I don't feel right
about it.

598
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:03,793
I mean, I hardly know the guy.

599
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:06,674
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

600
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,619
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.

601
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:14,829
And you feel you're not
really ready for--

602
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,654
Well, we went out one time.

603
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,570
Don't you think that's coming on
a little too strong?

604
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,287
Hey.

605
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,708
What's going on?

606
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:28,562
Keith Hernandez just asked me
to help him move.

607
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,257
What?

608
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,881
Well, you hardly know the guy.

609
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,807
What a nerve!

610
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:40,821
You see? Wasn't I right
about this guy? Didn't I tell you?

611
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,157
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?

612
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,343
-I said, yes.
-You said yes?!

613
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:50,515
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

614
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:53,875
I mean, how can you prostitute
yourself like this?

615
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,110
Are you gonna start driving him
to the airport?

616
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:58,357
I’m not driving him to the airport.

617
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,242
Oh, boy. I don't know.

618
00:32:00,757 --> 00:32:03,092
-Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
-What?

619
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,597
Don't mention it to anybody.

620
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,060
I wish you never mentioned it to me.

621
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,341
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.

622
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,576
And I will call you
as soon as I get home.

623
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,335
Don't bother.

624
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,544
Bother? What kind of bother?

625
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,080
I would prefer it if you didn't.

626
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,756
-Why? Is anything wrong?
-It’s over, buddy. Done.

627
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,556
Finished. So long. Goodbye.
<i>Adios. Sayonara</i>.

628
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,471
-Why?
-I’ve been thinking about it.

629
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,671
You got no job.
You got no prospects.

630
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,849
You're like Biff Loman.

631
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,791
I went to the hardware store
interview.

632
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:51,222
You think I’m going to spend my life
with somebody...

633
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:54,384
...because he can get me a deal
on a box of nails?

634
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:56,913
I thought we were a team.

635
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,016
lf I ever need a drill bit, I’ll call you.

636
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:01,875
Carrie, could you do me a favor?

637
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,376
Could you not mention this
to your mother?

638
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:09,173
You know, I hate to brag...

639
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,856
...but I did win 11 straight
Gold Gloves.

640
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,473
I wouldn't have brought it up,
but since you mentioned it.

641
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,620
I didn't mention it.

642
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,281
Well, I won them anyway.

643
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,932
Well, so what? I mean...

644
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:25,138
...you played first base.

645
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:27,672
I mean, they always put
the worst player at first base.

646
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,551
That's where they put me,
and I stunk.

647
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:35,605
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

648
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,698
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

649
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,388
...and I know you'll never be there.

650
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:44,688
The way I figure it,
I’ve already been there.

651
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,827
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

652
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:53,110
Well, I’d watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

653
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:56,210
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

654
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:01,906
You know, I hate to say this...

655
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:04,726
...but I really think that
we're hitting it off.

656
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:07,707
-Get it? Get it?
-Clever.

657
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,922
-What are you doing?
-What's that?

658
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,474
-You smoke?
-Yeah.

659
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,362
I didn't know you smoked.

660
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,106
Is that a problem?

661
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:28,468
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.

662
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:30,425
-How do you know?
-Who wouldn't like him?

663
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:31,963
I like him, and I’m a guy.

664
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,005
I suppose he's an attractive man.

665
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:38,132
Forget that. He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1 <i>9</i> 7<i>9</i>.

666
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,912
I’m making wisecracks in some
nightclub. This guy was in game six.

667
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,122
They're a perfect match.
They go together.

668
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:46,903
Like one of these brother and sister
couples that look alike.

669
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:50,419
I hate those couples. I could never be
one of those couples.

670
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,340
There are no bald women around,
you know.

671
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:58,870
I know this sounds a little arrogant,
but I never thought she'd find...

672
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,525
...someone she liked better
than me. But, you know...

673
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:03,963
...I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.

674
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,817
You know what I’d like to do?

675
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,053
I’d really like to have sex
with a tall woman.

676
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:13,011
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5''.

677
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,032
Really?

678
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,369
What was the tallest woman
you ever slept with?

679
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,029
I don't know, 6'3''.

680
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,850
Wow! God!

681
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,336
See, this is all I think about:
Sleeping with a giant.

682
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,379
It’s my life's ambition.

683
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:32,056
So I guess it's fair to say you've set
different goals for yourself than...

684
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,907
...say, Thomas Edison, Magellan,
these type of people.

685
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,144
Magellan? You like Magellan?

686
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:40,695
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

687
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:43,575
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.

688
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,557
-De Soto? What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.

689
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:49,140
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

690
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,045
All right. I gotta go down
to the unemployment office.

691
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,695
-You want to take a walk?
-No, I got some stuff to do.

692
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,711
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment
at 3. I’m helping him move.

693
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,504
What?

694
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,238
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!

695
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:08,573
-I know. Isn’t that something?
-Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

696
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:12,348
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.

697
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,160
Soon he'll have you driving him
to the airport.

698
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,783
I’m not driving him to the airport!

699
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,704
I gave. I gave everything I could,
Mrs. Sokol.

700
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:27,583
-Nothing was good enough for her.
-Sign here, please.

701
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:30,364
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.

702
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,790
I’ll tell you, she's very particular,
your daughter. Very particular.

703
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,026
Is she looking for some
big hotshot businessman?

704
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,648
Well, I’ve got my pride too.
I’m not gonna beg her.

705
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:41,468
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

706
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:49,435
You like baseball?

707
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:52,668
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

708
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,743
I saw every inning that year.

709
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:59,805
It’s funny, because I happen to be
very good friends with...

710
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,914
...Keith Hernandez.

711
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:04,637
You know Keith Hernandez.

712
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,177
Know him?

713
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,921
Would you...like to meet him?

714
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,484
Oh, come on. Come on.

715
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,852
I can produce Keith Hernandez,
right here...

716
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:16,768
...within the hour.

717
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,457
All right.

718
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,866
You got one hour.

719
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:24,316
All right, Mrs. S.

720
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:28,921
I and my good pal
Keith Hernandez...

721
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,975
...will be right back.

722
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,198
1 2<i>9</i> West 81 st Street, and hurry.

723
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,395
Or not.

724
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,195
You better bring your gloves.
It’s freezing out there.

725
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:03,227
It shouldn't take too long.
I’d say maybe, oh, four hours.

726
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:07,967
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.

727
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:10,142
We got two dressers and the bed.

728
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:13,572
-Is there a box spring?
-What's that?

729
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,740
-A box spring?
-Yeah, there's a box spring.

730
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:19,259
But it's attached to the headboard,
and we'll have to take that apart.

731
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,890
Then we got the couch.

732
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:24,128
-Is that a sectional?
-Yeah, 1 2 pieces.

733
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:27,873
-A marble coffee table.
-Is that a thick marble?

734
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,624
Three inches thick.
Got it in Italy.

735
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,335
But the big problem is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

736
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:36,162
When you move it,
it tends to open up...

737
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:38,749
...so it's going to be difficult
getting it downstairs.

738
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:41,250
Stairs?

739
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:45,790
-There's no elevator?
-No, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

740
00:38:50,182 --> 00:38:52,158
-I’m sorry, I can't do this.
-What?

741
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:54,881
I can't do it! I can't!
It’s too soon.

742
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,055
I don't know you.

743
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,445
I can't help you move, I’m sorry.
I can't! I just can't.

744
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,549
-Hello.
-Hello.

745
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:15,780
Oh, you don't remember me.

746
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,880
-No. Should l?
-Yeah, yeah, you should...

747
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,982
...because I certainly remember you.

748
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:24,933
Let me refresh your memory.

749
00:39:25,352 --> 00:39:29,246
June 1 4th, 1 <i>9</i>8 7.

750
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,548
Mets-Phillies. You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

751
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,851
Then you're coming up
the parking lot ramp.

752
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:37,405
You said, ''Nice game, pretty boy.''

753
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:41,414
-You remember.
-And then you spit on us.

754
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,365
-Hey, I didn't spit at you.
-Yeah, right.

755
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,312
-No, no. Then who was it?
-Look, the way I remember it...

756
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:49,376
...I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.

757
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,401
<i>That's when you called me</i>
<i>''pretty boy. ''</i>

758
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:54,312
<i>Hey, that ticked me off.</i>
<i>I was turning to say something...</i>

759
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,354
<i>...and as I turned around...</i>

760
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,985
...I saw Roger McDowell behind
the bushes over by that gravelly road.

761
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,413
<i>Anyway, he was talking to someone,</i>
<i>and they were pointing at you.</i>

762
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:11,520
<i>I tried to scream out,</i>
<i>but it was too late.</i>

763
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,152
<i>It was already on its way.</i>

764
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,531
I told you.

765
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:20,971
-<i>It was McDowell.</i>
-<i>But why? Why McDowell?</i>

766
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:24,674
Maybe because we were sitting
in the right-field stands...

767
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,144
...cursing at him in the bullpen
all game.

768
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:30,593
He must have caught a glimpse of us
when I poured that beer on his head.

769
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,109
-It was McDowell.
-Oh, boy.

770
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:39,393
-Look, Keith, we're sorry.
-Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.

771
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,604
Guys, don't worry about it.

772
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,707
-Well, I guess I better get going.
-What are you doing?

773
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:47,244
-I gotta move.
-You want any help?

774
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:50,149
-I’d love some. You sure?
-I’d love to help you.

775
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:51,526
Yeah, me too!

776
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,601
Okay, guys. We got to be careful
of one thing.

777
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:56,969
Some of the stuff is very fragile
We'll have to handle it like a baby.

778
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:58,855
Hey, no sweat.

779
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:12,198
Hello.

780
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,951
Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on?

781
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:16,678
No, he just left.

782
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,340
You broke up with him?

783
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,069
Me too!

784
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,527
What happened?

785
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:27,817
Oh, smoking. You know, you're like
going out with C. Everett Koop.

786
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,955
Me? No.
I couldn't go through with it.

787
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,124
I just didn't feel ready.

788
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,180
So, what are you doing now?

789
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:36,939
Oh, great idea. Okay.

790
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,825
I’ll meet you there in, like,
30 minutes.

791
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,583
Okay, bye.

792
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:43,430
Keith! Keith!

793
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:46,914
-What happened? Where's Keith?
-You just missed him. He just left.

794
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:49,805
What do you need him for?

795
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,545
Keith! Keith! Up here!

796
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,271
Look, could you do me a favor?

797
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,675
I need you to go to the
unemployment office with me!

798
00:41:58,351 --> 00:41:59,725
l-- I’m Jerry's friend!

799
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,741
The guy from the locker room!

800
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,464
I’m the chucker!

801
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:05,606
It'll take five minutes!

802
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:08,678
Wait! Wait!

803
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,701
Well, Biff...

804
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,543
...what's next?

805
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:28,874
I don't know.

806
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:32,716
Excuse me.

807
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:34,441
I was walking behind you, and you...

808
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:36,779
...dropped your wallet.

809
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:43,307
When you're moving,
your whole world becomes boxes.

810
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:46,538
That's all you think about,
is boxes. Where are there boxes?

811
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:49,575
You just wander down the street,
going in and out of stores.

812
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:52,745
''Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?''

813
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:56,176
I mean, you can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

814
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:59,337
''Shut up! I’m looking for boxes!''

815
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,987
So after a while, you become
really into it. You can smell them.

816
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,647
You walk into a store:

817
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:06,826
''There's boxes here.

818
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:10,791
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it! I can smell them!''

819
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,036
You become, like, obsessed.

820
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:16,202
'‘I love the smell of cardboard
in the morning.''

821
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,502
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:

822
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,357
''That's a nice box.

823
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:25,134
Does anybody know where
that guy got that box?

824
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,471
When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

825
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:29,642
It’s got some nice handles on it.''

826
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:34,061
And that's what death is, really.
It’s the last big move of your life.

827
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:35,657
The hearse is like the van.

828
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:37,321
The pallbearers are close friends.

829
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,720
The only ones you could really ask
to help you with a big move like that.

830
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,891
And the casket is that great,
perfect box...

831
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,881
...you've been looking for
your whole life.

832
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:47,726
The only problem is
once you find it, you're in it.
