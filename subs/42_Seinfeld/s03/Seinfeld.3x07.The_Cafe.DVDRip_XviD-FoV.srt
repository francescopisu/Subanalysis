1
00:00:03,756 --> 00:00:06,410
There's always one location
in your neighborhood, one store...

2
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,683
...that's constantly changing hands.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,373
Everybody has this in their
neighborhood. let’s a leather store...

4
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:13,649
...then it's a yogurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

5
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,186
let’s constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

6
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:18,652
let’s like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

7
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:22,910
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

8
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,451
Nobody knows what happened.

9
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:28,741
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from <i>Close Encounters</i>--

10
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:32,521
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

11
00:00:32,687 --> 00:00:36,521
...in a daze, going, ''I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic.''

12
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:40,300
She thinks I’m nice.

13
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:43,963
-Women don't want nice.
-Amazing.

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,910
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

15
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:50,083
-Poor guy.
-Why is nice bad?

16
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:53,314
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,173
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

18
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,096
What? A little cologne.

19
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:58,500
Manly.

20
00:00:58,701 --> 00:01:00,973
-Monica wants me to wear it.
-Why didn't you say no?

21
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,382
I’m too nice.

22
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:05,616
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

23
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,213
...for him to send back money.

24
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,296
This is horrible.

25
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,778
She wants me to take an IQ test.

26
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,398
let’s because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,507
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

28
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,486
let’s part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

29
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,499
I’ve never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady....

30
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:25,613
I can't talk to you anymore.

31
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:28,232
All right, I’m sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

32
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,996
She's gonna find out I’m a moron.

33
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,111
People think I’m smart,
but I’m not smart.

34
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,128
Who thinks you're smart?

35
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:36,884
I won't break 1 00 on this thing.

36
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,575
-What thing?
-You don't listen anymore.

37
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,600
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

38
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:44,067
I’m sure I have a low IQ.

39
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:46,270
I’ve been lying about my SAT scores
for 1 5 years.

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,443
-What did you get?
-What did I get, or what do I say I got?

41
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,883
-What do you say?
-I say 1 40<i>9</i>.

42
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:54,185
-1 40<i>9</i>, that's a good score.
-You're telling me.

43
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:55,914
What did you really get?

44
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,523
-You're my friend.
-Of course.

45
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,475
-I tell you everything, right?
-I hope so.

46
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,545
Well, this I take to the grave.

47
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,431
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

48
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:08,118
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

49
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,146
Why do you keep watching?

50
00:02:10,308 --> 00:02:12,449
I don't know. I’m obsessed with it.

51
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:17,482
let’s like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

52
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,784
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

53
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,863
...you root for him for a second.

54
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:23,464
Then you flush.

55
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:26,863
Well, it's a spider.

56
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,844
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

57
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,469
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

58
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:36,986
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

59
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:38,626
Bazooka Joe.

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,904
-The buzzer?
-let’s your house.

61
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:52,941
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

62
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,407
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.</i>

63
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,954
Come on up.

64
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:59,803
-<i>Casus belli.</i>
-What's that?

65
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:03,517
let’s Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

66
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,995
Come on, go in.

67
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,105
Go in.

68
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:10,663
-Have you gone in there?
-No. I’m afraid we'll start talking...

69
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,166
...and I’ll wind up going partners
with him.

70
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:15,400
Hey.

71
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:24,468
I could probably shoot him from here.
I’d be doing us both a favor.

72
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:31,034
I’m wearing some cologne,
all right?

73
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,190
Sure. Fine.

74
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:35,400
<i>Casus belli</i>.

75
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:39,013
<i>Casus belli</i>.

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,253
-What's that?
-Since when do you wear cologne?

77
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:44,013
Why is what I do so important?

78
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,354
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

79
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,343
Let me just be. Let me live.

80
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,334
-How'd you do on that IQ test?
-I didn't take it yet.

81
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,164
-What IQ test?
-What's <i>casus belli</i>?

82
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,465
-Oh, it's nothing.
-Is it about me?

83
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,836
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

84
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,786
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

85
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:09,553
let’s just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

86
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:12,817
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

87
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,124
-Oh, that sounds like fun.
-Yeah, fun.

88
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,286
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

89
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:22,305
-You'll do well. You're smart.
-No, see, he's not smart.

90
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:25,731
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

91
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:27,685
What did you get on your SATs?

92
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:29,989
It varies.

93
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:35,148
-I don't even know my IQ.
-Mine's 1 45.

94
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:38,547
-One forty-five!
-Get out of here.

95
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,916
-You get out of here.
-You get out of here.

96
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,370
Maybe you should
take the test for me.

97
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,610
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

98
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:50,178
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

99
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,585
...out the window?

100
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,852
-You became a legend after that.
-Yeah.

101
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,770
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

102
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:01,738
-Why don't we do it again?
-What?

103
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,500
You could take the IQ test for me.

104
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,518
I’ll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

105
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,989
-You serious?
-Why not?

106
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:10,010
Where would I take the test?

107
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,989
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

108
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,160
-No, too noisy.
-Take it at the Dream Cafe.

109
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,541
You won't hear a peep.

110
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:21,543
-Hey, what do you think?
-Hey, I love a good caper.

111
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:27,211
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

112
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:28,872
You'll do it?

113
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:32,334
-What the hey.
-Yeah! Beautiful!

114
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:34,447
Sorry.

115
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,766
-Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
-Well, I’ve been looking forward to it.

116
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,074
How did you hear about us?

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,185
People. People are talking.

118
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:54,150
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

119
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,396
-Nonsmoking would be great.
-Very good.

120
00:05:56,627 --> 00:06:00,209
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

121
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:03,125
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

122
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,142
-Thank you.
-Our specials are tacos...

123
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:08,345
...moussaka and franks and beans.

124
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,421
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

125
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,399
-The turkey.
-Well, the turkey it'll be.

126
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:18,118
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

127
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:21,289
I’m sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

128
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:23,598
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

129
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:25,708
Very kind.

130
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:29,843
<i>Very kind. I am a kind man.</i>

131
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:32,893
<i>Who else would do something</i>
<i>like this? Nobody.</i>

132
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:35,389
<i>Nobody thinks about people</i>
<i>the way I do.</i>

133
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,251
<i>Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.</i>

134
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,804
<i>You're eating a turkey sandwich.</i>
<i>You want a Nobel Prize?</i>

135
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:42,441
You go in the living room,
I’ll take the test in here.

136
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,814
But why?

137
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:46,506
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

138
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:50,505
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

139
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,020
Are you kidding me?

140
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:56,752
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

141
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:59,479
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

142
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,754
Well, I think you're wrong
about that.

143
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:06,844
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I’d really like to get started, please.

144
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,065
-Good luck.
-Don't need it.

145
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,436
What's going on?
I’ve been here 20 minutes.

146
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,709
I’m sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

147
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:20,662
-What time do you want me back?
-Twenty to 3.

148
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,134
-Okay.
-Thanks again.

149
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,560
And don't settle for 1 45.
You can do better. You're a genius.

150
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:34,497
Thank you, Babu.

151
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:39,465
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

152
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:42,349
-It is indeed my pleasure.
-Oh, please.

153
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,197
Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

154
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:50,192
-Our specials today--
-Oh, no, no. I’ll just have tea and toast.

155
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,368
-Tea and toast.
-Eat something! Babu.

156
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,022
Okay.

157
00:07:57,315 --> 00:08:00,188
Well, I’ll have the rigatoni.

158
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,844
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

159
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,847
So you got the test. You're cheating.

160
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:10,253
I know.

161
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,820
-Hey.
-Hey.

162
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:17,111
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,891
Jerry, let me ask you something.

164
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:22,749
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.

165
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,790
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

166
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:31,369
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

167
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,412
-So?
-Well, I’m not giving it back.

168
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,041
Why not?

169
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,859
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

170
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:42,360
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

171
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,002
-You all right?
-Yeah. Okay.

172
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,992
What?

173
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,322
Anyway, it's been two years.

174
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:59,305
I mean, isn't there, like,
a statue of limitations on that?

175
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,061
Statute.

176
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,173
-What?
-Statute of limitations.

177
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,197
let’s not a statue.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,211
No, it's statue.

179
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:11,478
Fine. let’s a sculpture of limitations.

180
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:15,553
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

181
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:19,740
Now, you're smart. Is it ''statue''
or ''statute'' of limitations?

182
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:23,560
-Statute.
-Oh, I really think you're wrong.

183
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,817
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

184
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:30,382
What test?

185
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:34,641
-An IQ test.
-Why are you taking an IQ test?

186
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,950
-let’s for George.
-George?

187
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,767
Look, can I explain it to you later?

188
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:41,912
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

189
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,359
Would you please?!

190
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:46,372
-Is it for a job or something?
-Later!

191
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,425
-You're positive it's statute?
-Yes! Yes!

192
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,401
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth--

193
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,666
-George?
-Yeah?

194
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,068
The door's locked.

195
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:13,824
Oh, it's locked?

196
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,322
I need to get something.

197
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,850
Monica, I’m really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

198
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:22,795
-George!
-Wish I could.

199
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,759
Babu!

200
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:36,474
lf you don't mind....
Okay.

201
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:40,357
-I’ll get this.
-Oh, my God! let’s all over the test!

202
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,102
-I’m terribly sorry.
-Oh, man!

203
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,759
-I’m out of time, anyway.
-Please forgive me. Please.

204
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,718
Go ahead. I’ll take care of it.

205
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,595
Please, I’m very sorry.

206
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,070
Tell your friends.

207
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,790
let’s all right.
She was cheating anyway.

208
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:09,090
You're a very kind man.

209
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:10,985
Babu....

210
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:15,471
-You're Pakistani, right?
-Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

211
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,636
Babu, may I say something?

212
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:21,077
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

213
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,435
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

214
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,416
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

215
00:11:28,577 --> 00:11:31,483
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

216
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:34,623
-There are no Pakistani people here.
-It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,895
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

218
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:39,501
...in the whole neighborhood.

219
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,900
Yes.

220
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:45,391
You see everything, don't you?

221
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:49,743
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

222
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:55,772
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

223
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,808
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

224
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,438
Very special.

225
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,517
<i>I am such a great guy.</i>

226
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,330
<i>Who else would've gone to the</i>
<i>trouble to help this immigrant?</i>

227
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:12,012
<i>I am special. My mother was right.</i>

228
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:16,626
<i>Of course, I've never had</i>
<i>Pakistani food. How bad could it be?</i>

229
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,927
-It was an accident.
-What, did you go on a picnic?

230
00:12:25,157 --> 00:12:27,527
Babu Bhatt did it.

231
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,683
Babu Bhatt?

232
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:35,271
-How am I going to explain this?
-Time's up, George.

233
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,579
Okay.

234
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:46,170
-Here you go.
-How did you do?

235
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:49,273
-Piece of cake.
-What happened to the test?

236
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:52,096
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

237
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,003
Food? What food?

238
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,704
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:58,348 --> 00:12:59,560
Where did you get food?

240
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:02,093
-From my pocket.
-Your pocket?

241
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:06,576
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

242
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:10,770
-And coffee?
-Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

243
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:15,614
-Where did you get the coffee?
-Where did I get the coffee?

244
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,431
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

245
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,765
-How did you get there?
-I walked.

246
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:23,876
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

247
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:27,561
-I climbed out the window.
-You climbed out the window?

248
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:30,350
-Of course.
-Why didn't you go out the door?

249
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,335
The door?

250
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:37,558
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

251
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,941
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

252
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,707
The average person sees a situation
like this...

253
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,722
...they walk right by it.

254
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,502
-Not me.
-You're very special.

255
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:58,000
Hey, do me a favor.

256
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:01,365
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

257
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:03,539
Of course. I always do.

258
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,384
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

259
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:10,009
-Just give it back to him.
-He'll have to kill me.

260
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:18,568
-Hey, Georgie!
-I’m coming up.

261
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:21,222
How did you do on the IQ test?

262
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:23,084
Eighty-five!

263
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:31,001
-What?
-Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

264
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,526
Eighty-five?

265
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:37,441
Well, well, well....

266
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:39,683
He's coming up?

267
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,407
Well, I’m no genius...

268
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:46,251
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

269
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,802
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

270
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,210
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

271
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,224
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

272
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:04,190
Oh, hello, professor.

273
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,922
-George, I cannot believe--
-Please.

274
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:14,351
-No, there's gotta be a mistake.
-You should have seen her face.

275
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,300
It was the same look
my father gave me...

276
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:19,186
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

277
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:23,697
But an 85?

278
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,974
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

279
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:31,167
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

280
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,921
It was a madhouse.

281
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,262
Jerry, it was.

282
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:38,819
-Let me take it again.
-Forget it.

283
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:41,960
Oh, come on. Come on.
I’ll guarantee you 1 40.

284
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,106
-What do you have to lose?
-You could do worse!

285
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,246
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

286
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:51,675
-All right, I’ll ask her.
-Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

287
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:55,638
Take it here. I’ll leave.
There'll be no distractions.

288
00:16:02,537 --> 00:16:05,836
Well, congratulations, my friend.

289
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,262
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

290
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:11,693
You see how I listen?

291
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:14,677
I work very hard,
borrow more money.

292
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:18,908
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

293
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,966
-You wish to eat?
-Let me tell you something, Babu.

294
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:27,519
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

295
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,572
Very good.

296
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,191
<i>Very good?</i>

297
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:35,848
<i>No, not very good...</i>

298
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,449
<i>...very great.</i>

299
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,722
<i>I am very, very great.</i>

300
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,879
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

301
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:57,418
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

302
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,782
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

303
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,407
Anybody goes outside that circle:

304
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:05,778
''You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

305
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,498
You went outside the circle, okay?''

306
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:23,720
-What are you doing?
-Quiet. Don't say anything.

307
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:27,564
-What's going on?
-Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

308
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,316
I’m not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

309
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,393
-Open up, Kramer!
-What did you come in here for?

310
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,432
Well, I thought I’d throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

311
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:40,281
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I’ve gotta get out of here.

312
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:43,554
-I thought you took the test.
-I had to take it again.

313
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,052
-How come?
-What's the difference?!

314
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,067
-Well, you can't leave now.
-What?

315
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,624
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

316
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:53,166
Never!

317
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:58,287
Come on, George, open up.

318
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:08,992
-Well?
-How you doing?

319
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,351
Where's the test?

320
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:15,037
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

321
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:18,147
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee....

322
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,220
Babu....

323
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:28,879
Babu.

324
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:34,357
Babu...

325
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:39,933
...you know, I’ve gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

326
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,886
...it's just a little stringy.

327
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:45,863
-You have any chicken?
-The shrimp is stringy?

328
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,302
-Well, maybe you refrigerated--
-Quiet!

329
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,152
-No, l--
-You shut up!

330
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:54,484
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

331
00:18:54,648 --> 00:18:58,515
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

332
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,719
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

333
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,444
There are no people!

334
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,717
-I think I’ll just take the check.
-You bad man!

335
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,152
You very, very bad man.

336
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:15,568
<i>Bad man? Could my mother</i>
<i>have been wrong?</i>

337
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,189
Are you looking for George?

338
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,181
Well....

339
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,230
Kind of.

340
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,697
George left.

341
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,736
Is that the test?

342
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:41,164
This?

343
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:43,822
Yeah.

344
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:46,733
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

345
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,157
I hope you do a lot better this time.

346
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:55,807
Actually, I think I did.

347
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,765
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

348
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:10,474
You know what it was?
Bad location.

349
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,876
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

350
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,407
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

351
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:20,602
-Oh, sorry.
-I’m going upstairs.

352
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:26,428
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

353
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:29,607
One fifty-one.

354
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,977
-One fifty-one?
-Yeah.

355
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,271
That's a good score.

356
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,481
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

357
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,923
-Italian.
-No, Chinese.

358
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,200
You know what would be great?

359
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:58,598
let’s tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

360
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,840
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

361
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:04,075
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

362
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:08,176
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

363
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:12,790
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

364
00:21:13,535 --> 00:21:15,195
''Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

365
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,015
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

366
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:23,331
I’m renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?''
