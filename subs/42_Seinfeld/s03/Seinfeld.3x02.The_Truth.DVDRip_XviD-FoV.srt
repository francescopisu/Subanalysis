1
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,713
Good evening. Welcome to the show.
The extra buttons.

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,073
Yeah.

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:14,712
What kind of a sicko, really,
would save these...

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,300
...have them in a huge file?

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,470
Drawers that wide.
You know, you just....

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,448
''Where the hell is that but--''

7
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:27,673
I mean, is it that hard to get
black, round buttons...

8
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:29,626
...that they make it
into a whole thing?

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,350
Like this is such a great jacket.

10
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,511
These buttons are so unique,
so one-of-a-kind.

11
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:37,979
You'll never find them.
We'll save you the trouble...

12
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:41,175
...of knocking your brains out.
We know they're going to fall off too.

13
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,927
That's the other point that
they're trying to make here.

14
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:51,511
Everyone in my family's creative.

15
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,775
And even though I’m working
as an accountant right now...

16
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:58,203
...I’d really like to eventually
work exclusively...

17
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,569
...on my papier-mâché hats.

18
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,489
I don't understand.
Papier-mâché hats?

19
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:10,897
What if it rains?

20
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:15,063
They're art.
You hang them on the wall.

21
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:16,726
Art.

22
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:20,219
It's my creative outlet,
one of my passions.

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,656
Any money in it?

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,922
''Who so belongs only to his age...

25
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,728
...reverences only its popinjays
and mumbo jumbos.''

26
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:31,926
Of course. Right.

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,568
-Thomas Carlyle, 1 864.
-Tommy C.

28
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:42,804
These are the receipts from '85.

29
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,171
-And I’m gonna do '86.
-I’m sorry.

30
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,819
I thought it was a legitimate charity.
I didn't know you'd get audited.

31
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:51,191
I don't blame you. I blame myself.

32
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:53,591
-No, blame me.
-Okay, I blame you.

33
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:56,144
-No, no, don't blame me.
-What was I supposed to do?

34
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:57,875
I was on my first date with Elaine.

35
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,563
You come barging in here,
asking me to contribute money...

36
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,250
...to a volcano relief fund
for Krakatoa.

37
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:04,945
It was supposed to erupt.

38
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,740
I find the whole thing embarrassing.

39
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:08,913
Well, you know what
my feelings are about this.

40
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,260
I don't even pay taxes.

41
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,663
Yeah. That's easy when
you have no income.

42
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:16,721
-Hi.
-Hi.

43
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,152
Kramer, do me a favor, will you?

44
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:23,096
lf you insist on making pasta
in my apartment...

45
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,374
...please don't put the tomato sauce
on the pasta while it's in the strainer.

46
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:31,986
All the little squares have
hardened red sauce in them.

47
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,807
What's so funny?

48
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:38,166
Oh, I don't know. Kramer dating
your roommate, it's funny.

49
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,140
It’s a riot, Alice.

50
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,958
When do you put the sauce on?

51
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:44,655
Any other time.

52
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:48,460
No, no, no. I like to strain the sauce.

53
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:52,207
And I could really live without...

54
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:56,849
...the tribal music and the make-out
sessions in the living room.

55
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,447
Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

56
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:08,023
-What are you doing? What is all this?
-Oh, he's helping me sort my receipts.

57
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,590
I’m being audited.

58
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,922
You're being audited? What for?

59
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:15,316
Oh, I contributed money to a charity
that turned out to be fraudulent.

60
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,479
-It’s really very boring.
-When was this?

61
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:20,851
A long, long time ago...

62
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:24,048
...in a galaxy far, far away.

63
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:29,298
I remember you donated to some
volcano thing on our first date.

64
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,731
Volcano? Really?

65
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:34,735
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't tell me that that was--

66
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,659
Something to drink?

67
00:03:36,823 --> 00:03:38,612
What, did you think
that would impress me?

68
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,084
You've got me all wrong.

69
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:43,373
I was thinking only
of the poor Krakatoan.

70
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:45,485
Like you'd make this donation
for 50 bucks...

71
00:03:45,654 --> 00:03:47,509
...and I’d start tearing my clothes off?

72
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,256
Those brave Krakatoans...

73
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,069
...east of Java...

74
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,304
...who sacrificed so much,
for so long.

75
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,096
Now you're being audited
because of it.

76
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,498
-See, that's karma.
-No, that's Kramer.

77
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:07,794
-So, what are you gonna do?
-It’s all taken care of.

78
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:09,201
How is that?

79
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:12,683
An old friend of mine,
whom you may have met...

80
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,406
...George Costanza,
has recently become intimate...

81
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,940
...with a female accountant
who was formerly...

82
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,556
...a highly placed official
with a little outfit...

83
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,660
...known as the IRS.

84
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,731
And as we speak,
at this very moment...

85
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:31,179
...he is handing over to her
all of my pertinent tax information...

86
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,484
...and she has assured us...

87
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:37,903
...that the matter is well within
her field of expertise.

88
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:40,526
Why is she doing this?

89
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:42,634
I don't know. It must be love.

90
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:45,259
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

91
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,400
You're great...

92
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,505
...but I’m riddled
with personal problems.

93
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,904
-What's wrong? What did I do?
-Nothing. It’s not you.

94
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:57,865
It’s me. I have a fear of commitment.

95
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,817
-I don't know how to love.
-You hate my earrings, don't you?

96
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,017
-No, no.
-And you didn't comment...

97
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:04,365
...on the chopsticks.

98
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:08,623
I love the chopsticks. I personally
prefer a fork, but they look very nice.

99
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:13,104
You're not telling me the truth.
I must have done something.

100
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:16,619
-I have a fear of intimacy. l--
-Don't give me clichés.

101
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:18,412
I have a right to know.
What did I do?

102
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,855
Nothing. It’s not you.

103
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,393
I want the truth!

104
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,522
The truth? You want the truth?!

105
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,316
It is your earrings!

106
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,791
It is your chopsticks.

107
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,474
But it's so much more.
You're pretentious.

108
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,786
You call everyone by their full name.

109
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,335
You called my doorman Sammy,
''Samuel.''

110
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:39,084
But you didn't even say Samuel.
You went ''Samuel.''

111
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:40,842
Papier-mâché?

112
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,377
What is papier-mâché?

113
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:45,899
Keep going.

114
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:49,295
I think I made my point.

115
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:52,331
I’m sorry if I was a little harsh.

116
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,369
No. I asked for the truth.

117
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,805
Thank you for being so honest.

118
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:00,358
Can l...?

119
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,271
-Can I walk you back to work?
-I really prefer to go alone.

120
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,116
How much do I owe?

121
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,655
Oh, please.

122
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,725
Four dollars is fine.

123
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:15,977
lf this audit had happened to me and
I didn't have this woman to help me...

124
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:19,690
...I would've killed this man. I would've
strangled him with my bare hands.

125
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,798
-I don't blame you.
-Ever been through an audit?

126
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,561
-No.
-It’s hell.

127
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:27,110
It’s the financial equivalent
of a complete rectal examination.

128
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,938
I would've killed this man.

129
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,511
Torn him limb from limb.

130
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:33,705
Ripped the flesh right off his bones.

131
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,483
-Yeah?
It's George.

132
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,957
Come on up.

133
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,247
There he is, the man himself...

134
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,237
...George Louis Costanza.

135
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,636
Here I am, about to go
to the electric chair...

136
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:49,352
...and my oldest friend
is dating the governor.

137
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:54,445
My whole life has been
a complete waste of time.

138
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,228
And there's so much more to go.

139
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:59,049
Now I know what I’m supposed
to do. It is so simple.

140
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:02,924
Tell the truth. That's all.
Just tell the truth.

141
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,290
-You give her my tax papers?
-What?

142
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,210
My papers?

143
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,994
What?

144
00:07:10,158 --> 00:07:11,881
Oh, the papers.

145
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,570
-You didn't give her the papers?
-No, I did.

146
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,393
So?

147
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:20,301
I broke up with her.

148
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,237
-You what?
-I broke up with her.

149
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,867
I’m being audited...

150
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,557
-...and you broke up with her?
-It’s okay. It’s fine.

151
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:39,467
-She'll do it. I’m sure she'll still do it.
-Why? Why will she still do it?

152
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,793
She hates you now. People don't
do you favors after you dump them.

153
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:44,451
No, no. We left on good terms.

154
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,476
How is that possible?

155
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,932
Because l--
I told her the truth.

156
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,325
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

157
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:54,597
-It’s unheard of.
-She asked me to.

158
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:56,008
So you lie.

159
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:59,521
-What did you tell her?
-I told her that she was pretentious.

160
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:01,067
Pretentious?

161
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:04,676
The woman has my tax papers.
You told her she's pretentious?

162
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:06,251
The IRS...

163
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,681
...they're like the Mafia.
They take anything they want.

164
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,179
How would you like it if
someone told you the truth?

165
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,925
-What? What could they say?
-There are plenty of things to say.

166
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:16,426
Like what? I’m bald?
What is it specifically?

167
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:18,595
Is there an odor I’m not aware of?

168
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,865
-George, please.
-Give me one.

169
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:23,299
-You sure?
-Yes.

170
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:24,961
Okay.

171
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:29,098
You're extremely...

172
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,205
...careful with money.

173
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:34,377
I’m what?

174
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,611
-Forget it.
-I’m cheap? You think I’m cheap?!

175
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,168
How could you say that to me?
I can't believe this!

176
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,673
-How could you say that to me?
-You asked me to.

177
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,690
-You should've lied.
-So should you!

178
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,923
Okay, wait a second.
What happened to my papers?

179
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,610
-I’m not really working right now.
-I know.

180
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,593
When I was working, I spent, baby!

181
00:08:53,514 --> 00:08:56,099
Yeah, I know.
Champagne, limos, cigars.

182
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,760
What happened to the papers?

183
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,297
She put them in her pocketbook.
I guess she took them.

184
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,451
-A pocketbook or a handbag?
-Is that relevant? She took them.

185
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,880
Call her office.

186
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,479
Give me the phone.

187
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:18,245
Yeah, hi, I’d like to speak to Patrice.

188
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:20,482
What?

189
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:23,208
Oh, really.

190
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,920
Oh, okay. Thank you.

191
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,384
What? What?

192
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,069
She never came back from lunch.

193
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,824
This is no good.

194
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,215
This is no good.

195
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,246
Call her house.

196
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,709
Hi. Are you okay?

197
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:50,719
No, no. No--

198
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,414
She hung up.

199
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:00,000
Not good.

200
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,871
All right, look,
there's nothing to be worried about.

201
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,080
She's just a little annoyed right now.

202
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,157
Tomorrow, I’ll personally
go over there.

203
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:11,264
I’ll apologize. I’ll get the papers.

204
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,724
Don't worry. Don't worry.

205
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,118
Not good.

206
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,068
Yeah, it's a windshield.

207
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:27,043
I can see that. What's it for?

208
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,116
I found it on the road.

209
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,485
-Yeah?
I just finished working out.

210
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,404
-Are you busy?
-No. Come on up.

211
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:41,762
Can you believe somebody
threw this out?

212
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:46,075
I’m gonna make a coffee table
out of this and surprise Tina.

213
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,417
Well, wouldn't it be invisible?

214
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,648
I mean, what, are you gonna just
sense it's in front of the couch?

215
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,855
Well....

216
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:03,835
Hello.

217
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,017
Hello.

218
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,107
What's with you two?

219
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:15,007
-You haven't told him?
-Told me what?

220
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,580
Go ahead, tell him.

221
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,921
I saw her naked.

222
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,107
He saw me naked.

223
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:33,978
Kramer saw me naked.

224
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,769
Well, it was an accident.

225
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:39,714
Who walks into a woman's bedroom
without knocking? I wanna know.

226
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,043
I thought it was a closet.

227
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,798
Completely naked?

228
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:47,548
Completely naked.

229
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:51,617
Jerry, how can I go on?

230
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:58,273
All right, if it's gonna make you feel
any better, you can see me naked.

231
00:11:58,435 --> 00:12:00,060
No, thank you.

232
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,968
-No, I want you to see me naked.
-No, no, no.

233
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:04,349
-I wanna show you.
-No! Jerry!

234
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,653
Hold it. Just a second.

235
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:09,982
Let's not lose our heads here.

236
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,798
Kramer, you know you're always
welcome in my home...

237
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:15,297
...but as far as Mr. Johnson
is concerned...

238
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,727
...that's another story.

239
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:23,422
-What is this?
-It’s a windshield.

240
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,851
It’s going to be
your new coffee table.

241
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,469
I’m gonna kill myself on that thing.
You can't even see it.

242
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,095
You'll sense it.

243
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,361
Well? What happened?
Was she there?

244
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,384
No. No, she wasn't.

245
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:42,749
-You didn't get my papers?
-No, I didn't.

246
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,040
Well, where is she?

247
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,488
A mental institution.

248
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:54,240
Why is it so difficult,
uncomfortable to be naked?

249
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,343
It’s because we have clothes on...

250
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:59,993
...you can always make those little
adjustments, which people love to do.

251
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,325
You feel like you're getting it together.
''Yeah, I look pretty good.

252
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,594
Feeling good, looking good.''

253
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,983
But when you're naked, it's like--
It’s so final. You're just, ''Well...

254
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:11,933
...that's it.

255
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:15,040
There's nothing else I can do.''

256
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,102
That's why I like to wear
a belt when I’m naked.

257
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:19,864
Because I feel
it gives me something.

258
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,748
Some, you know,
''I’m naked, but, you know....''

259
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,229
I’d like to get pockets to hang
off of the belt. That would be--

260
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,254
Wouldn't that be the ultimate thing?

261
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:31,382
To be naked
and still be able to do this.

262
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:34,551
I think that would really help a lot.

263
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:39,034
A mental institution?

264
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,363
You know what they do in there?
Did you see Cuckoo's Nest?

265
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,827
They put those electrodes
in your head.

266
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,714
It’s not really a mental institution.

267
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,537
It’s more like a depression clinic.

268
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,019
She went out to Woodhaven and
checked herself in. I’m sick over this.

269
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:54,100
-Who told you this?
-Her roommate.

270
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:55,994
I’ve driven women
to lesbianism before...

271
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:58,045
...but never to a mental institution.

272
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:04,282
My friend Bob Sacamano
had shock treatments.

273
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:07,577
But his synapses were so large,
had no effect.

274
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:12,378
You know, I hate to raise
a crass financial concern...

275
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:17,146
...but was there any information
as to the whereabouts of my papers?

276
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,591
She put them in her pocketbook. She
probably took them out there with her.

277
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,893
-So, what now?
-I don't know.

278
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,239
Can we go out there?

279
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:27,640
-Where?
-Woodhaven.

280
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,164
We could.

281
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,561
I’m very nervous about this.

282
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,953
I’ve never spoken
to a mental patient before.

283
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,862
My cousin Douglas
was in a place like this one time.

284
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,640
Came over to my house for dinner,
there was no soda...

285
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:45,779
...and he went berserk.

286
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:48,599
He was screaming, ''Where's
the Pepsi? Where's the Pepsi?''

287
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,219
I should be in a place like this.

288
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,590
I envy this woman.

289
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:56,499
Get to wear slippers all day.

290
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,901
Friends visit, they pity you.

291
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:03,735
Pity's very underrated. I like it.
It’s good.

292
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,994
Plus, they give you those word-
association tests. I love those.

293
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:09,236
They're great.
There's no wrong answer.

294
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:12,022
-Potato.
-Tuberculosis.

295
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,994
-Blanket.
-Leroy.

296
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,074
-Grass.
-Tuberculosis.

297
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,569
Oh, boy. Here she comes.

298
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:31,991
Oh, my God.

299
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:40,560
Oh, Kram....

300
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,692
Kramer! Kramer, could you please...

301
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,265
...put something on?

302
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:57,622
Well.... Oh, boy.

303
00:15:57,785 --> 00:16:00,054
Listen, you want some leftovers?

304
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:03,316
I made some African food.
There's yambalas and sambusa.

305
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,397
Sweetie.

306
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:09,715
-Are you coming back to bed?
-Yeah, yeah. I’ll be right there, babe.

307
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,224
Hi, Elaine.

308
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,615
What did you think
of the coffee table?

309
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:21,460
It’s invisible.

310
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:22,933
So is everything cool or what?

311
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,584
Yeah, you seem
a little bit dysfunctional.

312
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,552
-Well....
-Come on, Elaine...

313
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,313
...just tell us the truth.

314
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,449
The truth?

315
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,045
You want the truth?

316
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:38,701
Who are you?

317
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,377
This is my friend...

318
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,259
...Jerry.

319
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,651
Why are you talking like that?

320
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:51,954
And what do you want?

321
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,527
Want? What could I possibly want?

322
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:57,779
I just came because I heard so many
nice things about you from George.

323
00:16:58,136 --> 00:16:59,696
Gorge thinks I’m pretentious.

324
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,861
Pretentious. Who isn't pretentious?
I mean...

325
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:06,708
...if everyone that was pretentious
was in a mental institution--

326
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:09,806
Obviously,
this isn't a mental institution.

327
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:14,574
You're trying to take it back because
you're feeling guilty I’m in here.

328
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,815
-No, that's not it at all.
-Don't lie, George!

329
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,095
I’m not a liar.

330
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,986
We're cool. Everything's cool.

331
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,539
-No problem. We're good.
-Just chatting.

332
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,019
Very friendly.

333
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,146
Alrighty.

334
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,894
No reason for us to raise our voices.

335
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:33,362
I know what you said.
You can't change that.

336
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,533
What I said.
I say stupid things all the time.

337
00:17:35,702 --> 00:17:37,873
I can't go two minutes
without saying something dumb.

338
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,780
It’s one stupid thing after another.

339
00:17:41,942 --> 00:17:44,527
So let me ask you, when you come
to one of these places...

340
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,319
...do you bring your pocketbook?

341
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,782
You should be the one criticizing me.

342
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:51,470
I’m lucky to even know
someone like you.

343
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,550
-Do you mean that?
-Of course.

344
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:56,205
-I’m incapable of guile.
-He's never guiled.

345
00:17:57,173 --> 00:18:01,035
You know, some women keep a lot of
important papers in their pocketbooks.

346
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:03,092
Like, for example...

347
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:06,187
...someone else's
personal financial papers.

348
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:08,622
Papers.

349
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,658
Oh, Jerry. You're the Jerome
with the tax problem.

350
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:14,515
You know,
after that date with George...

351
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,295
...I got so cuckoo,
I threw out all your papers.

352
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,849
So I’d love to help you,
but I’ll just need the copies.

353
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,246
There are no copies.

354
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,522
So...

355
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:28,105
...are you saying you want
to continue seeing me?

356
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,603
Who makes copies?

357
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:34,185
The truth is...

358
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,429
...I think...

359
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,483
...you make a very nice couple.

360
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,608
Oh, Kramer.

361
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,249
-Here, Kramer?
-No, no.

362
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,483
Let's go to the couch.

363
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:07,050
Yes, I’m trying to get
a copy of a receipt...

364
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:10,284
...for a computer that I bought there.

365
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,217
It was 1 98 7.

366
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,698
I remember I talked to a guy,
had, like, a maroon sport jacket...

367
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:22,542
...and he might have had a toupee.
Oh, it was a weave?

368
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:26,603
Okay, well, then I’ll come by.

369
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,980
Okay, bye.

370
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,856
Anybody want to take a walk down
to 48th Street?

371
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:33,392
I think I may have tracked
down another receipt.

372
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,590
I can't. I got to go visit Tina
in the hospital.

373
00:19:36,753 --> 00:19:38,727
-George?
-I’m going to a poetry reading...

374
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,141
...with Patrice.

375
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,214
First-time poets.

376
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:45,320
It’s in a burnt-out building
down by the docks.

377
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:47,629
It’s supposed to be good.

378
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:52,839
Are you going to the hospital now?

379
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,496
-Yeah, I suppose I am.
-All right. Great, great.

380
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,842
We'll share a cab.

381
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,699
You going by 48th.
You can give me a ride.

382
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,141
I’m getting in on that.

383
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:02,093
-Yeah.
-You know you're chipping in.

384
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,263
You're going that way anyway!

385
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,220
Come on.

386
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:09,867
I was audited last year.
I have been through an audit.

387
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,934
At first, I thought, ''Well,
IRS kind of sounds like Toys 'R' Us.

388
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:16,202
Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe they
have a sense of fun about it.''

389
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,953
You know?
But it's bad. It’s an ordeal.

390
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,837
And they don't do anything
to keep your spirits up...

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,560
...through the ordeal.

392
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,377
I think they should take all
your receipts and put them...

393
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:28,682
...in one of those big,
Lucite sweepstake drums...

394
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,603
...and just kind of crank
it around there.

395
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:33,996
Give you a feeling like you might win
something. You know what I mean?

396
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,882
Then they can pull them out and go:

397
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,625
''Oh, I’m sorry.
That's another illegal deduction...

398
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:44,580
...but we do have some lovely
parting gifts for you. Jail.''
