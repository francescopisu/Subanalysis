1
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,693
At the health club,
people are working out...

2
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:07,751
...and they're training,
getting in shape...

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,775
...but strangely, nobody's really
getting in shape for anything.

4
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:14,660
The only reason that you're
getting in shape...

5
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:17,343
...is that so you can get through
the workout.

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,672
So we're working out...

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,149
...so that we'll be in shape
for when we have to do our exercise.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,135
This is the whole thing.

9
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:29,923
The other thing I don't get
is why we're so careful...

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,049
...about locking up our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

11
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:40,613
What exactly is the black market
on these disgusting gym clothes?

12
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:43,112
I’ll give my car to any guy
in front of a restaurant...

13
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,543
...because he's got a short
red jacket.

14
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,112
''He must be the valet guy.''

15
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:49,575
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes...

16
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,492
...I got one of these locks...

17
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:54,275
...you could put a bullet through it
and it won't open.

18
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,903
That stuff is safe.

19
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,032
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.

20
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:06,144
I had three inches on that guy.

21
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,874
See, you two were hogging the ball.

22
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,147
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

23
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:11,591
All you do is dribble.

24
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:15,070
I have to dribble. lf I give it to you,
you just shoot. You're a chucker.

25
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,650
-Oh, I’m a chucker.
-That's right.

26
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,534
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

27
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:19,910
I can't believe you
called me a chucker.

28
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,497
No way I’m a chucker! I do not chuck.
Never chuck!

29
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,416
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck! No chuck!

30
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,778
You chuck.

31
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:31,272
-Kramer, am I a chucker?
-Oh, you're a chucker.

32
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,443
My God, I’m a chucker.

33
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:39,076
-All these years, you never told me?
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.

34
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,784
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

35
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:48,360
Believe me, I didn't see anything.

36
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:50,247
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

37
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,506
-No. Did you?
-Yeah, I snuck a peek.

38
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:55,880
-Why?
-Why not?

39
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,352
What about you, George?

40
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:00,457
Yeah, l...

41
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,107
...snuck a peek.

42
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:06,660
But it was so fast, I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

43
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,454
I made a conscious effort not to look.

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,857
There's certain information
I just don't wanna have.

45
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:12,865
Okay....

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,047
I gotta go meet Newman.

47
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,280
-I’ll see you later. Have a good one.
-All right.

48
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:20,296
Yeah.

49
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,074
Look at this guy.

50
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,237
Does he have to stretch in here?

51
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,481
-You know who that is?
-Who?

52
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:31,171
That's Keith Hernandez.

53
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:34,444
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

54
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,683
Yeah, that's him.

55
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:39,115
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

56
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,027
Wow! Keith Hernandez!

57
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,914
-He's such a great player.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,283
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.

59
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:49,066
Wow, I’d love to be a Civil War buff.

60
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,646
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

61
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,487
So Biff wants to be a buff?

62
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,463
Well, sleeping less than 1 8 hours
a day would be a start.

63
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,838
I only got two weeks left
of unemployment.

64
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,875
I gotta prove I’ve been looking
for a job to get an extension.

65
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,215
Hey, should we say something
to him?

66
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:13,033
Oh, I’m sure he loves to hear
from fans in the locker room.

67
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,404
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

68
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,965
He's Keith Hernandez.

69
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,201
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

70
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,566
-So?
-What, you're comparing yourself...

71
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,037
...to Keith Hernandez?

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,851
The guy's a baseball player,
Jerry, baseball!

73
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,766
I know what he is. I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.

74
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,798
What, you're making some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

75
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,980
The guy was in game six, two runs
down, two outs, facing elimination!

76
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,322
Excuse me.

77
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,560
I don't want to disturb you.
I’m Keith Hernandez.

78
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,860
And I just want to tell you what
a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

79
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,187
-Really?
-I’ve always wanted to do what you do.

80
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,321
Do what I do?! You're one
of my favorite ballplayers of all time!

81
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,767
Mine too.

82
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,657
-I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
-Really?

83
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,772
Thank you.

84
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,875
You know, Keith,
what I’ve always wondered is...

85
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:15,628
...with all these ball clubs
flying around all season...

86
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:18,347
...wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

87
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,164
Are you performing in New York now?

88
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,435
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.

89
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,734
But think about it:
26 teams, 1 62 games a season.

90
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:34,282
You'd think eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

91
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,832
I live on the East Side.

92
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,204
I’ll give you my number...

93
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,279
...and just tell me whenever
you want to go.

94
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,101
-Or maybe just get together for coffee.
-Oh, that'd be great.

95
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,425
Well, it's only a matter of time.

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,182
Who's this chucker?

97
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,861
It’s been three days,
and he hasn't called.

98
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,532
Well, maybe you should call him.

99
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,285
I can't. I can't.

100
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,964
-Why not?
-I just feel like he should call me.

101
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,376
What's the difference?

102
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,290
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.

103
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:14,129
lf he wants to see me,
he has my number. He should call.

104
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:19,564
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.

105
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,681
I can't stand these guys.

106
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,429
You give your number to them,
and then they don't call.

107
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:27,241
Why do they do that?

108
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,518
I’m sorry, honey.

109
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,285
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.

110
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,461
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

111
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,347
-I know.
-Why did he come over to me?

112
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,544
I mean, here I meet this great guy,
this ballplayer...

113
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,597
-...best guy I ever met.
-Yeah. I know.

114
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:48,718
Well, that's it. I’m never giving
my number out to another guy again.

115
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:52,880
I’ve given my number out to guys,
and it takes them a month to call.

116
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,522
Good. Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month...

117
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,549
...he's got a prayer.

118
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,415
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.

119
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,746
Oh, what, they don't have phones
out of town?

120
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,685
I love how people say
they're too busy. ''Too busy.''

121
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,830
Pick up a phone!

122
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,650
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

123
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,226
-Why don't you just go and call him?
-I can't call here. It’s a coffee shop.

124
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,905
-I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
-Just ask if he wants to get together.

125
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,886
For what, dinner?

126
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,446
Dinner's good.

127
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:31,244
Don't you think that's coming on a little
too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff?

128
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,974
Jerry, he's a guy.

129
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:38,320
I know, but this is all very confusing.

130
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,974
When you're in your 30s,
it's very hard to make a new friend.

131
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,170
Whatever the group is you've got now,
that's who you're going with.

132
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,857
You're not interviewing,
not looking at any new people.

133
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:51,090
You're not interested in seeing
any applications.

134
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,744
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.

135
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,440
They don't know the activities.

136
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,870
lf I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
''Hey, look, I’m sure you're very nice.

137
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,196
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now.''

138
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,507
When you're a kid...

139
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,803
...you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid...

140
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,035
...what are the qualifications? ''lf
someone's in front of my house...

141
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,590
...that's my friend.
They're my friend. That's it.

142
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,412
Are you a grownup?
No? Great. Come on in!

143
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:18,926
Let's jump up and down on my bed!''
And if you have anything in common:

144
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:22,512
''You like cherry soda? I like
cherry soda! We'll be best friends!''

145
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:31,121
You only have two more weeks
before your benefits run out.

146
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,196
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps,
to get...

147
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,729
...a 1 3-week extension,
if that's possible.

148
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,121
So where have you been looking
for work?

149
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,046
You know what I’ve discovered,
Mrs. Sokol?

150
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:43,291
It’s not so much the looking...

151
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,628
...as the listening.

152
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:47,610
I listen for work.
As I’m looking...

153
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,618
...and listening-- I’m also looking.
You cannot discount looking.

154
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,689
It’s a combination.
It’s looking. And listening.

155
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,089
Listening. And looking.
But you must look.

156
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,455
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

157
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,724
Specific. Let's see....

158
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,801
I’ve walked in and out
of so many buildings.

159
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,377
They all blend in together.

160
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:06,066
Just give me one name.

161
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,050
One name. Absolutely.

162
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,580
Let's see, there's....

163
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:11,926
Vandalay Industries.

164
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,481
I just saw them. I got very close there.
Very close.

165
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:16,561
What type of company is that?

166
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,026
Latex. Latex manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

167
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:23,122
-And you interviewed there?
-Yes, for a sales position.

168
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,667
Latex salesman.

169
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:28,570
The selling of latex
and latex-related products.

170
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,731
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!

171
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:35,130
Now I’m going to need an address
and a phone number for this...

172
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:36,470
...Vandalay company.

173
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,354
You like gum?

174
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:41,688
Because I have a friend in the gum
business. I got a gum guy!

175
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,820
I make one phone call, have boxes
of gum delivered right to your door.

176
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,581
The address?

177
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,624
The address is....

178
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,356
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

179
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:58,259
-No.
-Jose Jimenez.

180
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,691
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.

181
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,479
The address.

182
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,836
Vandalay is...

183
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:11,543
...1 2<i>9</i> West 81 st Street.
It’s a very small industry, Vandalay.

184
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,466
It’s why I wanted
to work for them.

185
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,452
A phone number.

186
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,232
That's...KL5...

187
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,822
...8383. Are you planning on
calling them soon?

188
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,128
Because they have
very strange hours.

189
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,539
As soon as I’m done with you.

190
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,258
Sure. Well....

191
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,594
You know, I’ll check in with you
next week.

192
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,273
I gotta run now because
I got a full plate this afternoon.

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,214
-Okay.
-All right. Really good to....

194
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,114
He'll call you back!

195
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,629
It’s a par five.

196
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,416
So, you know, I step up to the tee...

197
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,900
...and I hit a beautiful drive
right down the middle of the fairway.

198
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,439
-I mean, you know my hook, right?
-Elaine?

199
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,351
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

200
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,263
Jerry, he's a guy.

201
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,705
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook.

202
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,109
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.

203
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,795
-Jerry! Jerry!
-George?

204
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,329
-<i>Kramer, put Jerry on!</i>
-I’m in the middle of something.

205
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,759
-Call back.
-<i>Kramer, no</i>--<i>!</i>

206
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,409
So the ball takes off,
and I’m waiting for it to turn.

207
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:28,956
Would you--!

208
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,881
All right. Well, I’ll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.

209
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,569
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.

210
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,625
She's wondering when
we'll go see the baby.

211
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,754
-See the baby. Again with the baby.
-Who are they?

212
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:45,019
A guy who used to live in the building
keeps calling us to see the baby.

213
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:48,285
''You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?''

214
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,943
Can't they just send us a tape?

215
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:52,666
Maybe if you wait a few months,
it won't be a baby anymore.

216
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,517
-Then you won't have to see it.
-Because he'll be all grown-up.

217
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:56,959
Yeah....

218
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:00,575
Hey, Kramer, what do you think
of this shirt?

219
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:07,293
It’s too busy.

220
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,695
You're trying too hard
to make an impression on him.

221
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,063
-You're not being yourself.
-What guy?

222
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:15,611
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

223
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,179
Who are you talking about?

224
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,801
Keith...Hernandez.

225
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,818
Keith Hernandez?

226
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:25,599
Keith Hernandez!

227
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,247
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?

228
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,453
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.

229
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,304
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I’m begging you.

230
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,646
Please. Please!

231
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,051
You know what?

232
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,839
Bad mistake. My mistake.

233
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,176
Go back. Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

234
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:49,211
This lane stinks. Go back to your lane.
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

235
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:53,053
Go! Go! Go! Make this light!
Make this light! Oh, man!

236
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,071
That's it! Get out!

237
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,278
-What do you mean, get out?
-Get out of the cab!

238
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,103
What? I’m not getting out of this cab.

239
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:02,139
No! No! You cannot throw me out!

240
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,546
No! Get....

241
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,399
Hello, Newman.

242
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:07,776
I hate Keith Hernandez.

243
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,659
-Hate him!
-I despise him.

244
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:12,862
-Why?
-Why? I’ll tell you why.

245
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,436
-Let me tell her.
-No, you can't--

246
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,256
-You always tell.
-All right, tell it.

247
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,397
-Just tell it.
-All right.

248
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:22,940
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

249
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,242
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

250
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:28,578
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

251
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:31,711
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

252
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,661
Our day was ruined.

253
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,884
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

254
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,484
Now we're coming down the ramp.

255
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,379
<i>Newman was in front of me.</i>

256
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,484
<i>Hernandez was coming toward us.</i>

257
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:48,640
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, ''Nice game, pretty boy.''

258
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:53,314
<i>Hernandez continued past us</i>
<i>up the ramp.</i>

259
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:56,446
Then, a second later,
something happened...

260
00:12:56,615 --> 00:13:00,358
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

261
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,211
...from that day forward.

262
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:04,479
-What was it?
-He spit on us!

263
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,190
<i>And I screamed out, ''I'm hit!''</i>

264
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:14,975
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

265
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,424
What a story.

266
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,210
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

267
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,644
...the whole premise of your account.

268
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:27,328
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

269
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,984
...as I’ve heard this story
a number of times.

270
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,999
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

271
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,462
According to your story...

272
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:38,494
<i>...Hernandez passes you</i>
<i>and starts walking up the ramp.</i>

273
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,901
Then you say you were struck...

274
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,299
...on the right temple.

275
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,755
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

276
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:50,817
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the fourth rib.

277
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,109
The spit then came off the rib...

278
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:58,471
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

279
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,312
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

280
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,299
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

281
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,408
...in midair, mind you...

282
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,334
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

283
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:20,260
That is one magic loogie.

284
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,028
Well, that's the way it happened.

285
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,999
What happened to your head
when you got hit?

286
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,887
Well, my head...

287
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:36,808
<i>...went back, to the left.</i>

288
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,460
-Say that again.
-Back and to the left.

289
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:42,179
Back and to the left.

290
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:46,025
Back and to the left.

291
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,946
So, what are you saying?

292
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,766
I’m saying...

293
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,380
...that the spit could not have
come from behind.

294
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,745
That there had to have been
a second spitter.

295
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,630
<i>Behind the bushes,</i>
<i>on the gravelly road.</i>

296
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:09,608
lf the spitter was behind you,
as you claim...

297
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:13,221
...that would've caused your head
to pitch forward.

298
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:18,018
So the spit could've only come
from the front and to the right.

299
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:21,091
But that's not what they
would have you believe.

300
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,778
I’m leaving.

301
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,446
Jerry's a nut.

302
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:27,949
Wait, wait, wait.

303
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,493
The sad thing is,
we may never know the real truth.

304
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,746
Did anybody call
asking for Vandalay Industries?

305
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:43,660
-No, what happened to you?
-All right, listen closely:

306
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:46,060
I was at the unemployment office.

307
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:49,418
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandalay Industries...

308
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,332
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

309
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,861
...you have to answer,
''Vandalay Industries.''

310
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,226
-I’m Vandalay Industries?
-Right.

311
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,495
-What is that?
-You're in latex.

312
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,223
-Latex?
-Right.

313
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:04,075
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know! You manufacture it!

314
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:08,132
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?

315
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,637
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

316
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,640
-I’ll hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.

317
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,295
I don't think so.

318
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,563
Why would I do that?

319
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,149
Because I asked you to.

320
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,491
lf you think I’m looking for someone
to just sit...

321
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:27,504
...pushing papers around,
you can forget it.

322
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:30,512
I’ve got enough headaches
just trying to manufacture the stuff.

323
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,018
-Yeah?
-It’s Keith.

324
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,525
All right, we're coming down.

325
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,965
Keith Hernandez?

326
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,518
-Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go.
-Where are you going?

327
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,215
They're giving me a ride downtown.

328
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:45,102
You know, there had to have been
a second spitter. Who was it?

329
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,443
Who had the motive?

330
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,674
That's what I’ve been trying
to figure out the past five years.

331
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,751
What the hell are you two
talking about?

332
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,846
-That was really fun. Thanks.
-Yeah, it really was.

333
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,444
<i>Should I shake his hand?</i>

334
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:00,911
Well....

335
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,764
You want to catch a movie
this weekend?

336
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,905
Have you seen <i>JFK</i>?

337
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,137
No, I haven't.

338
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,864
<i>This weekend. Wow!</i>

339
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,608
Sure. That would be great.

340
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:17,773
<i>Damn. I was too overanxious.</i>
<i>He must have noticed that.</i>

341
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,007
I mean, if you want to.

342
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,994
-Well, how about this Friday?
-Yeah, Friday's okay.

343
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,605
<i>Go ahead, shake his hand.</i>
<i>I'm Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

344
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,809
<i>I've been on</i> The Tonight Show.

345
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,976
Well, good night.

346
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:33,456
Good night.

347
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,634
Oh, Jer, by the way...

348
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,551
...the woman we gave
a ride to earlier....

349
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:38,925
-Elaine.
-Yeah.

350
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,710
-What's her story?
-I don't know. We used to go out.

351
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:44,941
Would you mind if I gave her a call?

352
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,473
-For a date?
-Yeah.

353
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,229
Oh, no....

354
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:50,989
Go ahead.

355
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:52,649
You got a pen?

356
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,162
You sure you don't mind?

357
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,098
So then we went to dinner.

358
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,985
-Who paid?
-We split it.

359
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:09,609
Split it. Pretty good.

360
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:13,041
-Did you talk about game six?
-No. I gotta wait until it's the right time.

361
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:17,842
-Yeah?
-<i>It's Elaine.</i>

362
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,378
Come on up.

363
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,916
So then what?

364
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,052
Nothing. Then he took me home.

365
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,137
Shake his hand?

366
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,763
Yeah.

367
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,779
What kind of a shake does he have?

368
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:31,539
Good shake. Perfect shake.

369
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:33,840
Single pump, not too hard.

370
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:38,031
Didn't have to prove anything,
but firm enough to know he was there.

371
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:39,953
So...

372
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,093
...you're gonna see him again?

373
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:46,547
He asked me if I was doing anything
Friday night.

374
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,332
The weekend!

375
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,042
So then, as I was getting out
of the car--

376
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,581
-Hi!
-Oh, hi, Elaine.

377
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:55,919
Hi, Elaine.

378
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,942
So how was your date?

379
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,681
What date? It’s a guy.

380
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:04,432
So you know.... He called me.

381
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,482
-Already?
-Keith called you?

382
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,647
This guy really gets around.

383
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,679
-Do you mind?
-No, I don't mind. Why should I mind?

384
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,661
What did he say?

385
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,685
He asked me out for Saturday night.

386
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,445
-You going?
-No.

387
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,746
-I told him I was busy.
-Oh, really?

388
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,853
So we're going out Friday.

389
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:36,017
-Friday?
-Yeah.

390
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,095
He's going out with you on Friday?

391
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,005
-Yeah?
-He's supposed to see me on Friday.

392
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,317
-I didn't know.
-We made plans!

393
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,553
-Well-- I’ll cancel it.
-No, don't cancel it.

394
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,678
Well, this is a little
awkward, isn't it?

395
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,705
Well, frankly, it is.

396
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:59,383
I’ve never seen you jealous before.

397
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,519
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.

398
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,899
You didn't even watch it.

399
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,821
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

400
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:07,538
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

401
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,198
Any Hennigan's around here?

402
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,816
Vandalay Industries.

403
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,593
Kell Varnsen speaking.

404
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:32,179
May we help you?

405
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,902
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.

406
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,843
No, no, I don't mind at all.

407
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,240
-No, no, no. I can cancel.
-Sure. We'll do something next week.

408
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:43,157
No, it's no problem at all.

409
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,710
Okay. Take it easy.

410
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,851
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.

411
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:50,997
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night?

412
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,529
Friday night? Nothing. Now.

413
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:55,641
Want to come to see the baby?

414
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,832
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.

415
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,931
lf you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

416
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,882
-All right, I’ll go.
-All right. All right.

417
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,808
I’ll get it.

418
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:21,813
Yello.

419
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:23,835
What delay industries?
