1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,354
It's hard to find a store in a mall.
They have a directory...

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:09,160
...but the problem with it is,
even if you figure out where you are...

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,208
...and where you wanna go...

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:14,403
...you still don't really know,
sometimes, which way to walk...

5
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,839
...because it's an upright map.

6
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:20,548
lf you had, like, suction-cup feet,
then you could just walk right up on it.

7
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:24,425
Then you could tell, you could be
on it going, ''All right, I’m here.

8
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:26,376
I wanna go to the Gap.
That's down there.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,067
All right, I’ll just walk that way.''

10
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:35,242
But people would know. They would
see you walking down the mall going:

11
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,475
They'd go, ''That's one
of those suction-cup guys.

12
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:42,347
I heard about that guy.
He's never lost.''

13
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,556
One left. What a joke.

14
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:49,931
-You can have this one.
-That's not enough BTUs...

15
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:52,517
...for my living room.
This was a waste of time.

16
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:53,898
I didn't get one either.

17
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:55,558
Why do I always have the feeling...

18
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:58,249
...everybody's doing something
better than me on Saturdays?

19
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,141
-This is what people do.
-No, they don't.

20
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:02,923
They're out on some big picnic,
they're cooking burgers...

21
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,031
...making out on blankets.

22
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:06,795
They're not at some mall in Jersey...

23
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:10,279
...watching their friends trying to find
the world's cheapest air conditioner.

24
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:13,550
You should see what my father used
to do before he bought a new car.

25
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:16,530
He'd go from state to state.
He was away for weeks at a time.

26
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,409
Like he's running for president
and going through the primaries.

27
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,296
We'd get phone calls
from New Hampshire.

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,537
We took a little ride,
what's the big deal?

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,806
At least you accomplished something.
You got fish.

30
00:01:25,974 --> 00:01:27,021
Oh, big accomplishment.

31
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,131
Fish. What do they do?

32
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,823
-What do you do?
-Hey, this way!

33
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:35,567
Jerry, what time do you have?

34
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,360
I have 5:00.

35
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:40,495
-Always late. Always late.
-You're not late.

36
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,152
I told them to meet me
in front of my building at 6:1 5.

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,102
-Who?
-My parents. It’s their anniversary.

38
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:48,654
I’m taking them out to dinner
and a show tonight.

39
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:51,159
-Think we'll hit traffic?
-Of course. It’s rush hour.

40
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,296
-Isn't it the other way?
-There's no other way.

41
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,058
Everybody goes every way
all the time.

42
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:58,096
-But it's Saturday.
-You got the picnic and burger traffic.

43
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,754
-There's picnic traffic?
-As my grandfather used to say:

44
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,930
''Sometimes even a picnic's
no picnic.''

45
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:07,857
I always get myself in this position.
Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

46
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:10,390
What's the matter?

47
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:15,034
I have to go to the bathroom.

48
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:17,433
Why do they hide the bathrooms
in these malls?

49
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:21,236
-You want me to help you with that?
-No, I got it.

50
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,384
What do you think, Georgie boy?

51
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,260
Did I need that pointed out for me?

52
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:34,424
What is that gonna do for me?
How does that help me, to see her?

53
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:36,982
I’m trying to live my life.
Don't show me that.

54
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:38,941
Well, if you like her,
go and talk to her.

55
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:41,494
Yeah, women love to get approached
in parking garages.

56
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:45,212
I’ll go up and say, ''Hi, how you doing?
Would you like a glass of white wine?''

57
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:48,313
You get within 1 5 feet, she'd have
her finger on the Mace button.

58
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,752
That was a guy.

59
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,282
-That was a guy?
-Where's the car?

60
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,102
Well, I thought it was here.

61
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:57,472
You don't know where we parked?

62
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:02,105
-Oh, this is great.
-Look, I thought it was Green 22.

63
00:03:02,277 --> 00:03:04,349
I remember Orange.
I thought it was Orange.

64
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,396
-I didn't pay attention.
-This is just what I need.

65
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,986
I’m sure it's right around here.

66
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,231
Yeah, it looks familiar.
I remember the elevator.

67
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:15,228
There's elevators all over!
Everything looks the same!

68
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:18,181
We're like rats in some experiment.

69
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:21,221
It’s over there. I know where it is.

70
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:24,577
-It’s black, right?
-Well, it's dark brown.

71
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:27,046
In a parking lot, you write it down.
How hard is that?

72
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,583
There it is.

73
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,119
No, no.

74
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,169
That's a Toyota.

75
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:37,033
-I thought it was....
-Hey, didn't we come in over there?

76
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,257
I thought we came in over there.

77
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,801
How long can fish live
in one of these plastic bags?

78
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:47,208
I don't know. Maybe two hours.

79
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,702
You better find this car.

80
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:51,362
Let's try this way.

81
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,500
I really have to go to the bathroom.

82
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,932
Why don't you just go
behind one of these cars.

83
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:01,641
-Why? There's nobody around.
-I’ll wait.

84
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:05,222
You hold it in like that, you can cause
a lot of damage to your bladder.

85
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,082
That's what happens to truck drivers.

86
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,156
They hold it in all the time
and eventually...

87
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:12,142
-...it starts to come out involuntarily.
-All right.

88
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,350
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers
are a $600-million-a-year industry?

89
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:20,750
Maybe I should just go any time I get
the urge, like you, wherever I am.

90
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:24,078
There's too much urinary freedom
in this society. I’m proud to hold it in.

91
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:25,420
It builds character.

92
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,441
-Is that it?
-No.

93
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:30,129
Hey! Watch it!

94
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,168
Maniac.

95
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,718
You sure you don't want help
with that?

96
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:39,251
I’m gonna put it down
behind that car.

97
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:42,252
Worried somebody's
gonna pee on it?

98
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:50,927
-It’s Purple 23. Remember that.
-Oh, I got it.

99
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:54,891
That I’m supposed to remember.
Where the car is, that's insignificant.

100
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,294
I think they're laboring.

101
00:04:57,462 --> 00:05:00,365
Look at this place! It’s huge!

102
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,360
All right, let me say this to you:

103
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:09,839
lf I am not in front of my building
at 6:1 5, when my parents get there...

104
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,595
...they're gonna put me on
an aggravation installment plan...

105
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,867
...that will compound, with interest,
for decades.

106
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,528
Parents never forget a foul-up.

107
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,219
I once left my jacket on a bus
when I was 1 4.

108
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:22,289
I was flying to Chicago,
last week, on a plane:

109
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:24,150
''Make sure you hang on
to your jacket.''

110
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:25,722
There's no way you can call them?

111
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,666
-Yeah, I’ll call them on their car phone.
-What would it take...

112
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,698
-...for his parents to get a car phone?
-Hypnosis by aliens.

113
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:34,717
-Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
-We need a system.

114
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,121
Well, it's gotta be here.

115
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:38,522
Why are they using so many colors?

116
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,304
The numbers go up to 40.

117
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,988
Maybe it's not on this level.

118
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,832
-What?
-There's four different levels.

119
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,755
Maybe we're on the wrong level.

120
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,887
-How long was the escalator ride up?
-It felt like a couple of levels.

121
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:55,096
You should always bring
a pad and a pen.

122
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,883
I can't carry a pen.
I’m afraid I’ll puncture my scrotum.

123
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,358
I got a pen.

124
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,659
Where is the bathroom in this mall?

125
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,281
There's 600 stores,
I didn't see one bathroom.

126
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,824
What is this, like, a joke?

127
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:09,663
Don't they consult with a urologist
when they build one of these places?

128
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,491
-What's with you?
-My ear itches.

129
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,311
Don't you dare talk to me like that,
you hear me?

130
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:21,218
I told you, I don't care!
You'll have to wait!

131
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,869
Hey, hey, is that really necessary?

132
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:25,946
Why don't you mind
your own business.

133
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:29,347
Well, I think hitting a defenseless child
is my business.

134
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,517
-You're ugly.
-What?

135
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:33,475
-You're ugly.
-You are.

136
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,613
-You are.
-That's what you think.

137
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,987
That's what I know.

138
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,568
-I found it!
-He's got it!

139
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:50,270
-No, no, no.
-All right, that's it.

140
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:54,086
From now on, no more calling out
''I found it'' unless we're sitting in it.

141
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,224
Jerry, look at my fish.

142
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,783
-His eyes look a little cloudy.
-See?

143
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:00,896
Oh, those are your eyes.

144
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,886
Oh, they are gonna be furious.

145
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,709
-Who's got the tickets?
-I do.

146
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,119
I thought you knew this mall.

147
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,422
-You said you'd been here.
-It was easy last time.

148
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:10,825
Okay, my fish are dying
right in front of me.

149
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:14,087
We've gotta get someone to drive us
around to us help look for the car.

150
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,675
No one's gonna do that.

151
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:18,956
Excuse me. Hi.

152
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:23,341
We can't seem to find our car. I was
wondering if it would be possible...

153
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:27,016
...to drive us around the garage
for five minutes so we can look.

154
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:28,809
Sorry.

155
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,626
-Just five minutes.
-Can't do it.

156
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:34,694
We're not skinheads.

157
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:41,708
Excuse me.
I can't seem to find my car.

158
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:44,329
Do you think you could drive me--?

159
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:49,768
Oh, that's funny? Is that funny?
Hey, tell me if you think this is funny:

160
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:52,906
These fish are dying.

161
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,920
In an hour they'll be belly-up!

162
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:59,146
Excuse me.

163
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,354
Excuse me.

164
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:05,098
Hey, sorry to have disturbed you.
Terribly sorry.

165
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,368
But the fish will be dead!
You do know that?

166
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,868
They can't live in plastic.

167
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,292
That's not me talking,
that's science!

168
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:17,269
It’s amazing how shopping
makes me have to go.

169
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,148
How does my bladder know
I’m in a department store?

170
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,384
Why don't you just go.

171
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,079
No, I can't.

172
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:27,183
-Don't you get tired of following rules?
-You think I’m too cautious?

173
00:08:27,352 --> 00:08:30,288
Why be uncomfortable
if you don't have to?

174
00:08:30,457 --> 00:08:33,360
-It’s organic.
-Organic. So is Buddy Hackett.

175
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,766
-Buddy Hackett?
-He's a comedian.

176
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,172
I know.

177
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:41,105
-All right, all right.
-Hey, you can go over here.

178
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,691
I can manage.

179
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:48,536
George!

180
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,063
-Okay, let's go.
-But--

181
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:00,571
Come on.

182
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,872
Kramer.

183
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,425
I’m telling you, I’ve had this condition
since I was 11 years old.

184
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,857
I’ve been in and out of hospitals
my whole life.

185
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,933
I have no control over it.

186
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:17,493
Doctors have told me
that when I feel it...

187
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:19,606
...the best thing to do
is just release it.

188
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,370
Otherwise...

189
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:22,912
...I could die.

190
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,047
Do you hear what
I’m saying to you?

191
00:09:25,218 --> 00:09:28,863
I’m telling you
that if I don't go, I could die.

192
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,580
Die! Is it worth dying for?

193
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:35,130
-That's up to you.
-Oh, so you don't care if I die.

194
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,780
What I care about is the sanitary
condition of the parking facility.

195
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,988
Why would I do it
unless I was in mortal danger?

196
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:43,164
-I know it's against the law.
-I don't know.

197
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,108
Because I could get ''uromysitisis''
poisoning and die, that's why.

198
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,103
You think I enjoy living like this?

199
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,953
The shame? The humiliation?

200
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:56,355
You know, I’ve been issued
a public urination pass...

201
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,275
...by the city
because of my condition.

202
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,823
Unfortunately, my little brother ran out
of the house with it this morning.

203
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,872
Him and his friends are probably
peeing all over the place.

204
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,967
Jerry!

205
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:11,720
Jerry!

206
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,670
Unbelievable.

207
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,939
I’m never gonna get out of here.

208
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:17,956
Guy goes to pee,
he never comes back.

209
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,715
It’s like a science-fiction story.

210
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,626
Maybe he went
to one of the other levels.

211
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:24,705
-I’m gonna look for him.
-Now you're gonna go?

212
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,664
-Be back in five minutes.
-lf you go now...

213
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:30,341
...we'll find the car, Jerry will show up
and we'll never find you!

214
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:32,396
I’ll be right back.

215
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:37,129
What's the difference?
We'll all be dead eventually.

216
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:39,973
Does that bother you?

217
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:42,310
Yeah, it bothers me.

218
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:45,740
-Doesn't it bother you?
-Not at all.

219
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,299
Now, that bothers me even more
than dying bothers me.

220
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:50,351
Because people like you
live to be 1 20...

221
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:52,170
...because you're not bothered by it.

222
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,027
How can it not bother you?

223
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:58,470
Well, I once saw this thing on TV
with people who are terminally ill.

224
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,877
Every one of them believed
that the secret of life...

225
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,732
...is just to live every moment.

226
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,621
Yeah, I’ve heard that.

227
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:08,780
Meanwhile, I’m here with you
in a parking garage in Jersey.

228
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,538
That's a nice jacket.
Where'd you get that?

229
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,765
Some guy left it
over at my mother's house.

230
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:18,641
First of all, you don't even know,
technically, that I went.

231
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,113
That's for starters.

232
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:22,960
I mean, I could have been pouring
a bottle of water out there.

233
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,548
-I know what you did.
-Oh, really? Do you? Well...

234
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,044
...it just so happens
that I did pour water out.

235
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:32,784
I had a bottle of very tepid water
and I poured it out.

236
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,543
I could see how you made
a mistake...

237
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:38,770
...because pouring water out sounds
very much like a person urinating.

238
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,943
And, you know,
when you think about it...

239
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:44,341
...it's really quite an amusing case
of mistaken identity.

240
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,065
And that's all it is.

241
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:49,081
And now he's gone.
I’m sure he's looking for the car.

242
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,346
Five minutes, that's all.
I just wanna find him.

243
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:54,164
-I can't do it.
-But why? Why can't you do it?

244
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,736
I can't.

245
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:58,320
That's not a reason, ''You can't.''
You just don't want to.

246
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,056
That's right.

247
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,975
But why? Why don't you want to?

248
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,308
I don't know.

249
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:08,116
Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction
out of helping someone out?

250
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:10,870
No, I wouldn't.

251
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,416
All right. All right.

252
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:22,365
l.... I want to apologize.

253
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:23,900
I was frightened.

254
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:26,168
I said crazy things,
I obviously offended you...

255
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:28,408
...I insulted your intelligence.

256
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:31,642
The uromysitisis, the water bottle...

257
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:33,532
...I made all that up.

258
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,900
And now I’m gonna
tell you the truth.

259
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:39,808
Today my parents are celebrating...

260
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,318
...their 50th--
Well, I’m jumping ahead here.

261
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,878
Their 4 7th wedding anniversary.

262
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,247
And we made plans to spend
the evening together.

263
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,313
They're meeting me
in front of my building at 6:1 5.

264
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,393
What I haven't told you...

265
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,147
...or anyone else, for that matter...

266
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,546
...is that my father's been
in a Red Chinese prison...

267
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,814
...for the past 1 4 years.

268
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:05,057
I mean, the guy had a fat fetish.

269
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,570
The inspector never dated a woman
under 250 pounds.

270
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:12,320
-Really.
-What did he do with all that fat?

271
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,461
Does he just jump up
and down on it?

272
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,314
Or does he gouge it
like Killer Kowalski?

273
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,781
-Who's Killer Kowalski?
-He was a wrestler.

274
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,372
He would get down on his knees...

275
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:23,648
...and he'd grab ahold
of someone's stomach...

276
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,223
...and squeeze it till they gave.

277
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:28,418
Hey, hey, hey.
I have to go to the bathroom.

278
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:30,145
Why don't you just go.

279
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:32,287
What, here?

280
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,141
You and Jerry. It’s....

281
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,088
Okay.

282
00:13:38,506 --> 00:13:40,896
All right, I’m gonna
go down this row.

283
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:56,391
What? What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

284
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:59,941
Kramer! Kramer!

285
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:06,318
What? Don't you believe me?
It’s their 4 7th anniversary.

286
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:08,200
You know, this is gonna kill them.

287
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,407
You're aware of that? Kill them.

288
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:12,266
On the biggest night of their life.

289
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,985
Your folks have
an anniversary today too?

290
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,425
Was your father also
in a Red Chinese prison?

291
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,254
Red Chinese prison?

292
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:27,344
George!

293
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:30,155
George!

294
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:32,973
Jerry!

295
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:37,480
Jerry!

296
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:40,019
You know when you're walking
with someone...

297
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,115
...and you assume
that they know where the car is?

298
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:47,541
And you're fine until you see them
do this move. Once they do this:

299
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,053
When they look back from
where they came from....

300
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:56,401
No, you're in bad shape now.

301
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,862
Nobody that knows
where they're going does that.

302
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,985
Pilots on planes don't open
the cockpit door and go:

303
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:07,510
Well, what happened was...

304
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:10,804
...my father was staying with
one of China's great military leaders...

305
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:13,555
...General Chang, who, by the way,
came up with the recipe...

306
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:16,886
...for General Chang's chicken. The
one with red pepper and orange peel...

307
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,189
-...at Szechwan Gardens?
-I eat it all the time. Spicy.

308
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:21,362
Apparently, General Chang
is a flamboyant man.

309
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:24,401
Complete failure as a general,
but a hell of a cook.

310
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,057
Look at this.

311
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,683
Look at this. Will you look at this?

312
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:33,529
He doesn't have enough with the
Mercedes, he has to have two spaces.

313
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,726
I tell you, you know what I’d like
to do? I’d like to spit on it.

314
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,649
I would like to see that.

315
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,629
-Should l? Should I do it?
-Teach him a lesson he'll never forget.

316
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,027
-Who does he think he is?
-Someone's gotta stop him.

317
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:47,322
-It’s against the law, isn't it?
-Well, it certainly should be.

318
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:49,752
Okay.

319
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:55,195
This is some machine.

320
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,565
Leave it to the Germans.

321
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,470
Let me ask you something.

322
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:03,129
What do they get
for a tune-up on this?

323
00:16:05,985 --> 00:16:07,512
-Jerry!
-Elaine!

324
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:08,893
Where have you been?

325
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,481
-I was arrested for urinating.
-Me too.

326
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,887
-You what?
-I have uromysitisis.

327
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,513
It’s very serious, you know.

328
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,407
Jerry, look at my fish.

329
00:16:17,763 --> 00:16:21,474
-Is he...?
-No, but he's not looking good.

330
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,375
Please. We can't find our car.

331
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,956
Please, just drive us around
the parking lot to find our car.

332
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,198
-My fish are dying.
-Sorry. Can't do it.

333
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,050
I can see not caring
what happens to us. We're human.

334
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:37,477
But what about the fish? The fish?

335
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,981
Sorry.

336
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,897
That's right, go.

337
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:42,787
Go home to your dumbbells.

338
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:47,524
Go work on your pecs and your lats.
We're all really impressed.

339
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:49,761
Yeah, that's right. You heard me.

340
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:54,185
-You got a problem with that?
-Elaine, shut up.

341
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,412
Don't worry, I’m packing heat.

342
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,296
Hey, hey. Where's Kramer?

343
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,223
-I don't know.
-I thought he was with you.

344
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,296
Oh, see? See? I knew
this was gonna happen.

345
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,126
Look at the time. All right, that's it.

346
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,234
Did we look over there?
We check that side?

347
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,957
-We came in over there.
-We didn't come in over there.

348
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:11,848
-Where's Kramer?
-Look at these cars...

349
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:13,420
...they all look exactly alike.

350
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:18,986
The fumes.

351
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,459
I can't breathe.

352
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,524
I’m having trouble breathing.

353
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,184
Hey, George, there she is again.

354
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,939
What are you doing?
You're killing me.

355
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:35,885
Ask her to drive us around.
There's your opening.

356
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,585
That is an opening.

357
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:45,448
Excuse me. I’m really....

358
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,211
See, what happened...

359
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:50,990
-...my friend forgot where he parked....
-Sure, I’ll drive you around.

360
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:52,848
-You will?
-Sure.

361
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:54,637
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:58,284
We're late and my parents are waiting
for me and we're stuck here.

363
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,354
Well, I wouldn't wanna get lost in here.
It smells like a toilet.

364
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,826
-People are such animals.
-You're telling me.

365
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,298
Filthy pigs.

366
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,828
It’s a brown Ford.

367
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,510
This has happened to me too.
It’s very frustrating.

368
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:14,193
I’ve asked several people.
They wouldn't even answer me.

369
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:16,748
I’m happy to do it.

370
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,091
I’m Michele.

371
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:23,024
Hi, Michele. I’m George.

372
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:35,474
-Get out!
-But I didn't mean anything by it.

373
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:40,214
I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard.
I didn't know you were with that group.

374
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,167
What about my fish?

375
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,266
Boy, those Scientologists,
they can be pretty sensitive.

376
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:47,159
I’ll say.

377
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:50,041
What is it? The car!

378
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:51,993
-The car!
-The car!

379
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:56,434
-The car!
-I can't believe it!

380
00:18:56,605 --> 00:19:00,053
Kramer. Kramer's not here.
I knew it.

381
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,881
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

382
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:05,145
-Kramer! Kramer!
-Kramer!

383
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,246
Kramer!

384
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,537
Hey, look.

385
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,255
Boy, I had a hell of a time finding
that air conditioner.

386
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,952
You know I looked everywhere?

387
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,904
I completely forgot where I hid it.

388
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:25,692
You know where it was?

389
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:29,568
-Purple 23.
-Right. Purple 23.

390
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:31,258
I could have used you.

391
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,882
Sometimes it's good to write
those things down.

392
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:36,735
Oh, boy. What time is it?

393
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,526
7:45.

394
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:42,716
Well, at least there'll be no traffic.

395
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,059
Right.

396
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:47,775
Oh, boy.

397
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,959
-What time does that play start?
-8:00.

398
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,844
Well, that could be a problem.

399
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,266
Where's your little bag of....

400
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,840
All right, let's giddyup.

401
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:27,524
See, the problem
with the mall garage...

402
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:31,075
...is that everything looks the same.

403
00:20:31,308 --> 00:20:33,283
They try to differentiate it.

404
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:36,487
They put up different colors,
different numbers, different letters.

405
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,628
What they need to do
is name the levels like:

406
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:40,838
''Your mother's a whore.''
You know what I mean?

407
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,566
You would remember that.

408
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:45,669
You'd go, ''I know, I’m parked at
'My father's an abusive alcoholic.'

409
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,727
I know where I parked.''
