1
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:05,800
Women put on perfume
in an interesting way.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,139
Ever notice that, guys?

3
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:11,497
They have their little key,
Stratego little areas.

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:19,137
Places they think we're going.

5
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,978
And they always hit this one.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,524
Women are convinced...

7
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:29,837
...that this is the most action-packed
area that could ever happen...

8
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:31,973
...in the dating world.

9
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:34,085
What is that, ladies?
What is happening here?

10
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:36,874
Is that in case you slap the guy
or something?

11
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,016
He still finds you intriguing?

12
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:42,031
''Oh, Chanel!''

13
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:49,963
She's a pianist, a classical pianist!
She plays the piano!

14
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:51,658
She's a brilliant woman!

15
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,961
I sat in her living room,
she played the <i>Waldstein Sonata</i>.

16
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,947
The <i>Waldstein</i>!

17
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:03,437
We did a crossword puzzle
together in bed.

18
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,647
It was the most fun I ever
had in my entire life!

19
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,468
Do you hear me? In my life!

20
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,640
You know?

21
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,176
Were you talking?
I couldn't hear anything.

22
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,727
I was telling you about Noel.

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,444
Oh, Noel, yeah.
The one that plays the bongos.

24
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:22,039
So sidesplittingly funny.

25
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:25,340
All right, I’m sorry. What about her?

26
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,290
You think I’m gonna repeat
the whole thing?

27
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,722
You told me you like her.
Everything's going good.

28
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:31,446
No, everything's not going good.

29
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:34,200
I’m very uncomfortable.
I have no power.

30
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,830
Why should she have
the upper hand?

31
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:38,902
For once, I’d like the upper hand.
I have no hand, no hand at all.

32
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,796
She has the hand. I have no hand.

33
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:43,358
-Hand me that, would you?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,732
How do I get the hand?

35
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,419
We all want the hand.
Hand is tough to get.

36
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,530
You gotta get the hand
right from the opening.

37
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:52,733
She's playing a recital
at the McBierny School.

38
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,268
I got two extra tickets.
You and Elaine could go.

39
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:57,818
Yeah, that sounds like something.

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,845
Then afterwards, maybe
we could all go out together.

41
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,674
You know, she'll see me
with my friends.

42
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,141
She'll observe me
as I really am, as myself.

43
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,759
Maybe I can get
some hand that way.

44
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:12,574
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

45
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,371
Hey, smell my arm.

46
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,285
-What?
-Smell it. Smell it.

47
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,654
With all due respect,
I don't think so.

48
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,787
-Jerry, smell.
-That smells good. What is that?

49
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,028
-The beach.
-The beach?

50
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,723
Did you go swimming?
It's 29 degrees.

51
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:29,413
No, I just joined
the Polar Bear Club.

52
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,070
-You joined the Polar Bears?
-What the hell's a Polar Bear?

53
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,857
These people go swimming
in the winter. They're terrific.

54
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,543
I just took my first swim today.

55
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:39,753
-It's invigorating.
-Yeah...

56
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,059
...so is shock therapy.

57
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,232
-What is that, a PEZ dispenser?
-Yeah. You want one?

58
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,971
I just bought it at the flea market.
You want one?

59
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:51,593
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

60
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,005
You don't know?

61
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:55,560
No, I know. I know.

62
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,670
You think they have fleas there,
don't you?

63
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,422
-No.
-Yes, you do, Biff.

64
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,828
You've never been,
and you think they have fleas there.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,421
All right, I think they have
fleas there. So what?

66
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:11,313
-Here, you want this?
-You don't want it?

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,709
-No, I bought five of them.
-Wow, great. Thanks.

68
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,685
I don't know how anyone does this.
This must be so nerve-racking.

69
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:23,376
How do they warm up their fingers?

70
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,685
They have a piano backstage
they warm up on.

71
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,313
No. We would have heard it.

72
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:29,907
You think they just crack
their knuckles and come out?

73
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,467
-I told her we'd go out afterwards.
-Sure.

74
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:36,183
Don't applaud when she stops playing
the first time. It’s not over yet.

75
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,166
I really resent that.
That's directed at me, isn't it?

76
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,276
Is this okay? Can I do this?

77
00:04:59,026 --> 00:05:00,368
Oh, God.

78
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,254
Something I said?

79
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:05,709
It’s John Mollica.

80
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:09,871
Oh. Oh, John. Oh, hi, John.

81
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:12,373
-Hi.
-What are you doing out here?

82
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,607
I was just at this recital...

83
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:18,124
...and Jerry put this PEZ dispenser
on my leg...

84
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,947
...and I just started laughing.

85
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,159
-Jerry's in there?
-Yeah.

86
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,552
-I heard you guys broke up.
-We did. We're just hanging out.

87
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:28,600
Really? Boy...

88
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,473
...you really look great.

89
00:05:32,634 --> 00:05:35,024
Oh, thank you.

90
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,720
Hey, are you still friends
with Richie Appel?

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,661
Oh, Richie? He's been doing comedy
in L.A. for a couple of years.

92
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,547
He just got back a month ago.

93
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:54,431
He's kind of messed up on drugs.

94
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,086
I don't know what to do.

95
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,039
Have you thought
about an intervention?

96
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:02,202
-What's that?
-You get all his friends in a room...

97
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:04,675
...and they confront him
to try to get him into rehab.

98
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,723
It’s a very popular thing now.

99
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:09,339
Well, he'd never listen to anyone.

100
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:13,380
Except, of course, Jerry.

101
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:15,680
He'd listen to Jerry.

102
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:19,426
Jerry would have to be involved.

103
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:23,366
He really respects Jerry.

104
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,614
I’m sorry, George. I’m sorry.

105
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,392
What did you put the PEZ dispenser
on her leg for?

106
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:39,044
-I don't know. It was an impulse.
-What kind of a sick impulse is that?

107
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:42,410
How could I know
she'd start to laugh?

108
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:45,256
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I am.

109
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:48,396
-Could we go in already?
-What are we gonna tell her?

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,627
-I’ll tell her I was the one who laughed.
-No, don't say a word.

111
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,209
lf she thinks my friends are jerks,
then I’m a jerk.

112
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,680
Remind me to talk to you
about something.

113
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,175
-What about?
-Hey, we're discussing something.

114
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,312
I know, but I’m distracted now.

115
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,009
What are you, a baby?

116
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:05,712
All right, tell him.

117
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:08,493
When I was outside,
I ran into John Mollica.

118
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,122
-Really? John Mollica?
-Yeah.

119
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,562
The guy that used to bartend
at the comedy club.

120
00:07:12,726 --> 00:07:14,154
-How's he doing?
-He's good.

121
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:15,731
Could we cut to the chase?

122
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:17,772
''Cut to the chase''?

123
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:21,462
-Yeah.
-What are you, Joe Hollywood?

124
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:24,082
A lot of people say it.

125
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,616
I would lose that.

126
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:27,607
What's that?

127
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:29,908
''Lose that''? That's not
a Hollywood expression.

128
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,216
Yes, it is.

129
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:35,124
Anyway....

130
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,194
So John told me that Richie
is in town from Los Angeles...

131
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:40,151
...and he's really
messed up on drugs.

132
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:42,324
So I told him
he should do an intervention.

133
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:45,428
-Really? An intervention?
-We got a situation over here!

134
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,627
-But he wants you to be a part of it.
-Why me?

135
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:52,061
He says Richie really respects you,
and he would listen to you.

136
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,124
These things are really hard to load.

137
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:01,887
All right, okay. All right, I’m going in.

138
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,149
-We got to talk about this.
-All right.

139
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,704
Hi. Hi. Hi.

140
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,842
-You were wonderful. Wonderful.
-No, no.

141
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,283
These are my friends,
Elaine and Jerry. Noel.

142
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,908
You play a hell of a piano.

143
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:23,069
Yeah, I was really moved.
Really moved.

144
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,572
Didn't you hear
that person laughing?

145
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:28,518
I couldn't play. I was humiliated!

146
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,469
I’m sure it wasn't at you.

147
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,357
Well, then what was she laughing at?

148
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:35,938
-PEZ?
-No, thank you.

149
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,148
Did you see her?

150
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:40,038
Me? No, l....

151
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,829
Anyone who would laugh
at a recital...

152
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:44,134
..is probably some sort
of lunatic, anyway.

153
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,420
I mean, only a sick, twisted mind
could be that rude and ignorant.

154
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:52,615
Well, you know,
maybe some mental defective...

155
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,718
...put something stupid on her leg.

156
00:08:56,112 --> 00:09:01,066
Even if this so-called mental defective
did put something on her leg...

157
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:02,794
...she's still the one who laughed.

158
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:08,074
I’ll never forget that laugh
for the rest of my life.

159
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:12,936
I’m sure she would apologize
if she could.

160
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,563
Probably someone
is holding her back...

161
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,317
...maybe against
every fiber of her being.

162
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:21,997
lf she wants to continue to have a fiber
of her being, she'll be very careful.

163
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,075
-Don't hit me.
-Stop it.

164
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,183
All right. So, you ready?

165
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,969
We'll go out,
and we'll have a bite to eat.

166
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:33,326
I don't feel like it tonight.

167
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,379
-We'll be outside.
-Yeah.

168
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:36,754
It was nice meeting you.

169
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:41,169
By the way, how do you warm up
your fingers before you play?

170
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,544
I just crack my knuckles.

171
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:46,129
Come on, we'll have a good time.

172
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,505
-Well, I’m really not in the mood.
-Come on....

173
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:52,281
I said, I don't feel like it.

174
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:58,651
All right....

175
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,789
I’ll-- I’ll call you.

176
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,573
I’ll call you,
and we'll talk on the phone.

177
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:08,120
Have a telephone communique.

178
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,100
So, fine. Everything's fine.
Everything good?

179
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,529
Good. I feel good. Fine.
That's fine. That's good.

180
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,830
Okay. Okey-doke.

181
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,837
You know, I think Kramer might
have been indirectly responsible...

182
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,688
...for getting Richie
involved in drugs.

183
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,645
What? How?

184
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:31,141
A few years ago, the comedy club
had a softball team.

185
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:32,961
Kramer was our first baseman.

186
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:35,648
You couldn't get anything by him.
He was unbelievable.

187
00:10:35,814 --> 00:10:40,552
Anyway, this one game, we came back
to win from, like, eight runs behind.

188
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:42,306
So Kramer says to Richie:

189
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:45,701
''Why don't you dump the bucket
of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head?''

190
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:47,817
-The club owner.
-Yeah.

191
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,629
So Richie goes ahead and does it.

192
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,999
-So? What happened?
-What happened?

193
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:55,402
The guy was, like, 67 years old.
It was freezing out.

194
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,900
He caught a cold, developed
pneumonia, a month later...

195
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:01,575
-...he was dead.
-Shut up.

196
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:04,107
All the comedians were happy...

197
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,605
...because he's one of these
club owners nobody liked.

198
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,523
But Richie was never the same.

199
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:11,439
-What about Kramer?
-He's the same.

200
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:14,857
Are you sure you want me, John?

201
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:17,808
I mean, I haven't spoken
to Richie in two years.

202
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,005
I don't have a good apartment
for an intervention.

203
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:24,686
The furniture,
it's very nonconfrontational.

204
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,952
All right, all right. Goodbye.

205
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:29,578
Remember Richie Appel?

206
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:34,068
Oh, sure. The guy I told to pour the
Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

207
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:39,694
Right. John Mollica is organizing
some kind of intervention for him.

208
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,173
We're having it here.

209
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,734
Can I get in on that?

210
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:46,771
What do you think,
it's like a poker game?

211
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,752
-Is Elaine going?
-Yeah.

212
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:50,713
Well, I knew him as well as she did.

213
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,217
Yeah, but John invited her.

214
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,517
So wait, you don't want me
to intervene?

215
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:57,335
No, intervene, go ahead.
Intervene all you want.

216
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,697
I’m just afraid you might be interfering
while we're intervening.

217
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:05,691
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.</i>

218
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:07,032
Come on up.

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,167
Stop smelling your arm!

220
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,478
You know, I got a great idea
for a cologne.

221
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,069
It’s called ''The Beach.''

222
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,340
You spray it on, and it's just like
you came home from the beach.

223
00:12:17,507 --> 00:12:19,895
A cologne that smells
like the beach.

224
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:24,572
I can't believe I’m saying this,
but that's not a bad idea.

225
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:27,195
Tell me about it.

226
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,995
Why don't you call Steve D'Giff?

227
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:31,524
He works in the marketing department
at Calvin Klein.

228
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:35,231
In fact, he's a good friend
of John Mollica and Richie, also.

229
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,893
Okay.

230
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,163
Well, it's over. It’s definitely over.

231
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,720
-She broke up with you?
-No, but she's going to.

232
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,206
I can sense it. We had this
terrible phone conversation.

233
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:49,542
I was so nervous before I called,
I made a list of things to talk about.

234
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,461
What was on the list?

235
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,383
Let's see.

236
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,481
''I’m very good
at going in reverse in my car.

237
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:01,672
Why isn't Postum
a more popular drink?''

238
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:08,007
Yeah, Postum is underrated.

239
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:09,964
Anyway, there was all this tension.

240
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,167
I asked her if she wanted
to go out to dinner...

241
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,441
...and she said,
''No, maybe we could have lunch.''

242
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,812
-You know what that means.
-What's wrong with lunch?

243
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:19,465
Lunch is fine at the beginning,
then you move on to dinner.

244
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,537
You don't go back to lunch.
It’s like being demoted.

245
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:25,386
I’ll never do a crossword puzzle
with her again, I know it.

246
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,595
I like the jumble.
You ever do the jumble?

247
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,441
I have no power, you understand?

248
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:32,816
I need hand! I have no hand!

249
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,055
-Why don't you break up with her.
-What?

250
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:37,522
Break up with her.
You reverse everything that way.

251
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:40,437
A preemptive breakup.

252
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,623
A preemptive breakup.

253
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:47,800
-This is an incredible idea.
-Yeah.

254
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,920
I got nothing to lose.

255
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,130
We either break up,
which she would do anyway...

256
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:55,990
...but I go out with some dignity...

257
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:58,424
...or I completely turn the tables!

258
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:01,399
This is absolutely brilliant!

259
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,531
So I’m afraid l...

260
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:06,840
...am gonna have to
break up with you.

261
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,710
-You're breaking up with me?
-Yes.

262
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:13,981
l...

263
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,317
...am breaking up with you.

264
00:14:17,886 --> 00:14:19,350
-Wow.
-Shocked?

265
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:22,588
-I really am.
-Never expected this, did you?

266
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:26,551
-I thought everything was fine.
-Well, live and learn.

267
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,417
Well, I don't understand.
You didn't enjoy being with me?

268
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,629
Didn't we have fun
doing the crossword puzzle?

269
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,392
Kind of.

270
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:39,133
-I’m very confused.
-Well, I didn't mean to hurt you, kid.

271
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,719
-I thought--
-Now, stop it, please.

272
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:46,269
What do you want?
I know I can make you happy.

273
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:52,003
When you're playing the piano...

274
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:54,339
...do you think about me?

275
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:56,841
-I don't know.
-This is what I’m talking about.

276
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:59,719
Okay, I’ll think about you.

277
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,311
-All the time?
-All the time?

278
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,417
-You know--
-Okay, all the time.

279
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:07,785
-I can't hear you.
-All the time!

280
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,694
See? It’s not so hard.

281
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:15,140
Go ahead. Smell. Smell it.

282
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:17,929
-Yeah? So?
-Now, you recognize it?

283
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,562
I don't know.

284
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,806
The beach.

285
00:15:22,608 --> 00:15:25,772
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, I’m talking about the beach.

286
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:28,423
What about it?

287
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,382
You know the way you smell...

288
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:34,541
...when you first come home
from the beach?

289
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:38,384
Well, I want to make
a cologne that captures...

290
00:15:38,548 --> 00:15:41,266
...the essence of that smell.

291
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:43,309
Oh, yeah.

292
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:45,651
That is the dumbest idea
I’ve ever heard.

293
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:49,109
Whoa, wait a minute. You....

294
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,095
Did you hear what I just said?

295
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,422
You think people
are gonna pay $80 a bottle...

296
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,788
...to smell like dead fish
and seaweed?

297
00:15:57,913 --> 00:16:00,848
That's why people take showers
when they come home from the beach.

298
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:04,847
It’s an objectionable, offensive odor.

299
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:08,595
So you don't think
that it's a good idea?

300
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:15,475
The membranes get dry,
and it just starts bleeding.

301
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:21,014
Since I was a kid, so I have
to stick a tissue up there.

302
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:24,859
You have to work like that?

303
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:27,359
Yeah. Nobody minds.

304
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:30,525
Nobody's ever said anything to me.

305
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,085
There any ice cubes?
Whatever's in the freezer.

306
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,007
I looked. I don't see any ice cubes.

307
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:36,959
Well, then I guess
there's no ice cubes.

308
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:40,255
I can't drink this. It’s warm.

309
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,889
John, shouldn't we rehearse this...

310
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,963
-...before Richie comes?
-What's the plan?

311
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,661
Do I have to talk?
I don't want to.

312
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,740
lf he's not gonna talk,
then I don't want to.

313
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,464
-No, we all have to talk!
-What's the order?

314
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,455
Alphabetical order.
You're first, Roberta.

315
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,624
-Why am I first?
-Albano's your last name.

316
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,029
-Not anymore. I’m divorced.
-I’ll go first.

317
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:02,754
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.

318
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,809
-Is this the interference?
-Intervention.

319
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,969
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, is it all right if I stay?

320
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,758
He can't stay.
This is for close friends only.

321
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:12,134
Hey, I’m a friend.

322
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,017
Who told him to pour the Gatorade
over Marty Benson's head?

323
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,037
-Oh, let him stay.
-Yeah.

324
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:20,712
Hey, I got somebody to make up
that cologne for me, bigmouth.

325
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,789
Somebody's gonna make that crap?

326
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,642
-Kramer!
-Hey, you guys! All right!

327
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,198
Come on in. These are some
of my Polar Bear buddies.

328
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,857
-They can't stay.
-You're having a party here?

329
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,551
No, we're having an intervention.

330
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:35,721
An intervention? Who's intervening?

331
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,477
He's a friend of ours on drugs,
and we're gonna confront him.

332
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,367
Sure. We used to do that...

333
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,728
...when one of our Polar Bears stopped
coming. We'd go to his house:

334
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:46,128
''What, you don't want to be
a Polar Bear anymore?

335
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:49,676
-It’s too cold for you?''
-It’s him!

336
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:52,212
-What do we do?
-Hide!

337
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,765
It’s not a surprise party!

338
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:57,104
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.</i>

339
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:59,127
Come on up.

340
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,361
It’s not him.

341
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:04,627
You don't wanna go out with me
because I’m a bartender, right?

342
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,649
Look, you know, I don't really think
that this is appropriate right now.

343
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,306
Is it because I have a tissue
in my nose?

344
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:15,706
-You're getting warm.
-Hey, we just....

345
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:18,137
We just came from Chadway's.
What's going on?

346
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,091
The intervention.
We're waiting for Richie.

347
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:24,214
Right, the intervention.
Should we leave?

348
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:26,718
-Well....
-Elaine, hi.

349
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,405
Hi, Noel.

350
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,331
Well, you're looking well.

351
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,188
Jerry, let me tell you something.

352
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,768
A man without hand is not a man.

353
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,874
I’ve got so much hand,
I’m coming out my gloves.

354
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:40,253
I got to thank Kramer.

355
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,240
Even if I were dragged
through manure...

356
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:44,094
...I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

357
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,456
This man is a genius! A genius!

358
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,726
-You think so?
-I don't think so, I know so.

359
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:51,267
Come here. I gotta talk to you.

360
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,080
The male kangaroo
doesn't have a pouch.

361
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:56,286
Only the female has it...

362
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:59,715
...so the male has pouch envy!

363
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:05,375
''Why should she have
this huge pouch and I have nothing?

364
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,196
I have things to carry too.

365
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:12,195
At least give me a pocket.''

366
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,365
That laugh. That's the laugh.

367
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:31,310
-That's it! You're the one!
-No, no.

368
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:35,302
No, it was an accident.
It wasn't my fault! It was Jerry!

369
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:38,059
Jerry put a PEZ dispenser
on my leg!

370
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:42,002
You put a PEZ dispenser
on her leg during my recital?

371
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:44,431
-I didn't know she would laugh.
-And, you....

372
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:46,831
You lied to me, George.
You lied to me!

373
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:50,574
No, l-- I didn't. What did I do?

374
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,362
Where are you going?

375
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,796
I am breaking up with you.

376
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,165
You can't break up with me.
I’ve got hand!

377
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,299
And you're gonna need it.

378
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,580
Noel!

379
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:14,837
-Hey, Richie!
-Hey, Richie.

380
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,601
So, what's going on?

381
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:21,209
So we start the intervention,
and it's pretty ugly from the get-go.

382
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:24,819
He's not listening, he's hostile,
he's talking back.

383
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,324
I can't do these puzzles.

384
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,209
So he starts to get up.

385
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:33,206
Suddenly, he spots the PEZ dispenser
on the coffee table.

386
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:35,447
The PEZ dispenser.

387
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:38,103
He picks it up, he's staring at it.

388
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,183
It’s like he's hypnotized by it.

389
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:43,004
Then he's telling us this story
about how when he was a kid...

390
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,828
...he was in the car
with his father...

391
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,133
...and his father was trying
to load one of them.

392
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:50,910
-Well, they're hard to load.
-Tell me something I don't know.

393
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:55,994
So as the father's trying to load it,
he loses control of the car...

394
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,303
...crashes into a high school cafeteria.

395
00:20:58,469 --> 00:20:59,964
-Get out.
-Nobody's hurt...

396
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,590
...but PEZ was all over the car.

397
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:04,514
And the dispenser was destroyed...

398
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,435
...virtually beyond recognition.

399
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,302
-Poor kid.
-So as he's telling the story...

400
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:11,485
...he starts crying.

401
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,279
-What did you do?
-What do you think?

402
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:16,167
-I gave him my PEZ dispenser.
-Wow.

403
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,178
Two hours later,
he checks into Smither's clinic.

404
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:22,185
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab...

405
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,649
...he's hooked on PEZ.

406
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:29,001
He's eating them
like there's no tomorrow.

407
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,753
What's a three-letter word for candy?

408
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:36,107
I can't do those things.

409
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:51,115
Jawbreakers, to me, was like
the ultimate challenge candy.

410
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:54,513
It was like candy manufacturers were
sitting in their laboratories, going:

411
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,715
'‘I wonder if they'll eat this.

412
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:59,338
This seems pretty tough to eat.

413
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:01,876
Let's market it
as some sort of experiment.''

414
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:04,427
But the concept of Jawbreakers--
What was the concept?

415
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:07,119
Multicolored cement balls
for a quarter?

416
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,912
Was that the idea behind it?

417
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,445
''Let's see if we can hurt them.

418
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:14,456
Let's see if they'll pay to be hurt.''

419
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:16,275
This is the idea behind Jawbreakers.

420
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:17,968
I did it, I ate them, I loved them.

421
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:22,738
''Oh, this is very painful.
I’m really hurting.

422
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,721
And this is hurting me a lot.
I love them.''
