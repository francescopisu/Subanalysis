1
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,693
At the health club,
people are working out...

2
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:07,751
...and they're training,
getting in shape...

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,775
...but strangely, nobody's really
getting in shape for anything.

4
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:14,660
The only reason that you're
getting in shape...

5
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:17,343
...is that so you can get through
the workout.

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:20,672
So we're working out...

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,149
...so that we'll be in shape
for when we have to do our exercise.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,135
This is the whole thing.

9
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:29,923
The other thing I don't get
is why we're so careful...

10
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,049
...about locking up our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

11
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:40,613
What exactly is the black market
on these disgusting gym clothes?

12
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:43,112
I’ll give my car to any guy
in front of a restaurant...

13
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,543
...because he's got a short
red jacket.

14
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:47,112
''He must be the valet guy.''

15
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:49,575
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes...

16
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,492
...I got one of these locks...

17
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:54,275
...you could put a bullet through it
and it won't open.

18
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,903
That stuff is safe.

19
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,032
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.

20
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:06,144
I had three inches on that guy.

21
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,874
See, you two were hogging the ball.

22
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:10,147
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

23
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:11,591
All you do is dribble.

24
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:15,070
I have to dribble. lf I give it to you,
you just shoot. You're a chucker.

25
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,650
-Oh, I’m a chucker.
-That's right.

26
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,534
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

27
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:19,910
I can't believe you
called me a chucker.

28
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,497
No way I’m a chucker! I do not chuck.
Never chuck!

29
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,416
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck! No chuck!

30
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,778
You chuck.

31
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:31,272
-Kramer, am I a chucker?
-Oh, you're a chucker.

32
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,443
My God, I’m a chucker.

33
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:39,076
-All these years, you never told me?
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.

34
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,784
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

35
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:48,360
Believe me, I didn't see anything.

36
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:50,247
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

37
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,506
-No. Did you?
-Yeah, I snuck a peek.

38
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:55,880
-Why?
-Why not?

39
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:57,352
What about you, George?

40
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:00,457
Yeah, l...

41
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,107
...snuck a peek.

42
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:06,660
But it was so fast, I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

43
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,454
I made a conscious effort not to look.

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,857
There's certain information
I just don't wanna have.

45
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:12,865
Okay....

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,047
I gotta go meet Newman.

47
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:18,280
-I’ll see you later. Have a good one.
-All right.

48
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:20,296
Yeah.

49
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,074
Look at this guy.

50
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,237
Does he have to stretch in here?

51
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,481
-You know who that is?
-Who?

52
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:31,171
That's Keith Hernandez.

53
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:34,444
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

54
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,683
Yeah, that's him.

55
00:02:36,846 --> 00:02:39,115
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

56
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,027
Wow! Keith Hernandez!

57
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,914
-He's such a great player.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:46,283
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.

59
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:49,066
Wow, I’d love to be a Civil War buff.

60
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,646
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

61
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,487
So Biff wants to be a buff?

62
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,463
Well, sleeping less than 1 8 hours
a day would be a start.

63
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,838
I only got two weeks left
of unemployment.

64
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,875
I gotta prove I’ve been looking
for a job to get an extension.

65
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,215
Hey, should we say something
to him?

66
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:13,033
Oh, I’m sure he loves to hear
from fans in the locker room.

67
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:15,404
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

68
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,965
He's Keith Hernandez.

69
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,201
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

70
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,566
-So?
-What, you're comparing yourself...

71
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,037
...to Keith Hernandez?

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,851
The guy's a baseball player,
Jerry, baseball!

73
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:34,766
I know what he is. I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.

74
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,798
What, you're making some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

75
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,980
The guy was in game six, two runs
down, two outs, facing elimination!

76
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,322
Excuse me.

77
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:47,560
I don't want to disturb you.
I’m Keith Hernandez.

78
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,860
And I just want to tell you what
a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

79
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,187
-Really?
-I’ve always wanted to do what you do.

80
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,321
Do what I do?! You're one
of my favorite ballplayers of all time!

81
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,767
Mine too.

82
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,657
-I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
-Really?

83
00:04:08,145 --> 00:04:09,772
Thank you.

84
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,875
You know, Keith,
what I’ve always wondered is...

85
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:15,628
...with all these ball clubs
flying around all season...

86
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:18,347
...wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

87
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,164
Are you performing in New York now?

88
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,435
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.

89
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,734
But think about it:
26 teams, 1 62 games a season.

90
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:34,282
You'd think eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

91
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,832
I live on the East Side.

92
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,204
I’ll give you my number...

93
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,279
...and just tell me whenever
you want to go.

94
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,101
-Or maybe just get together for coffee.
-Oh, that'd be great.

95
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,425
Well, it's only a matter of time.

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,182
Who's this chucker?

97
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,861
It’s been three days,
and he hasn't called.

98
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,532
Well, maybe you should call him.

99
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,285
I can't. I can't.

100
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,964
-Why not?
-I just feel like he should call me.

101
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:07,376
What's the difference?

102
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,290
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.

103
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:14,129
lf he wants to see me,
he has my number. He should call.

104
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:19,564
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.

105
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,681
I can't stand these guys.

106
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,429
You give your number to them,
and then they don't call.

107
00:05:25,813 --> 00:05:27,241
Why do they do that?

108
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,518
I’m sorry, honey.

109
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,285
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.

110
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:36,461
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

111
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,347
-I know.
-Why did he come over to me?

112
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,544
I mean, here I meet this great guy,
this ballplayer...

113
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,597
-...best guy I ever met.
-Yeah. I know.

114
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:48,718
Well, that's it. I’m never giving
my number out to another guy again.

115
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:52,880
I’ve given my number out to guys,
and it takes them a month to call.

116
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,522
Good. Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month...

117
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,549
...he's got a prayer.

118
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,415
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.

119
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:05,746
Oh, what, they don't have phones
out of town?

120
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,685
I love how people say
they're too busy. ''Too busy.''

121
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,830
Pick up a phone!

122
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,650
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

123
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:18,226
-Why don't you just go and call him?
-I can't call here. It’s a coffee shop.

124
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,905
-I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
-Just ask if he wants to get together.

125
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,886
For what, dinner?

126
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,446
Dinner's good.

127
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:31,244
Don't you think that's coming on a little
too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff?

128
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,974
Jerry, he's a guy.

129
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:38,320
I know, but this is all very confusing.

130
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,974
When you're in your 30s,
it's very hard to make a new friend.

131
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,170
Whatever the group is you've got now,
that's who you're going with.

132
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,857
You're not interviewing,
not looking at any new people.

133
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:51,090
You're not interested in seeing
any applications.

134
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,744
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.

135
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,440
They don't know the activities.

136
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,870
lf I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
''Hey, look, I’m sure you're very nice.

137
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,196
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now.''

138
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,507
When you're a kid...

139
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,803
...you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid...

140
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,035
...what are the qualifications? ''lf
someone's in front of my house...

141
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,590
...that's my friend.
They're my friend. That's it.

142
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,412
Are you a grownup?
No? Great. Come on in!

143
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:18,926
Let's jump up and down on my bed!''
And if you have anything in common:

144
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:22,512
''You like cherry soda? I like
cherry soda! We'll be best friends!''

145
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:31,121
You only have two more weeks
before your benefits run out.

146
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,196
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps,
to get...

147
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,729
...a 1 3-week extension,
if that's possible.

148
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:39,121
So where have you been looking
for work?

149
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,046
You know what I’ve discovered,
Mrs. Sokol?

150
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:43,291
It’s not so much the looking...

151
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,628
...as the listening.

152
00:07:44,794 --> 00:07:47,610
I listen for work.
As I’m looking...

153
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,618
...and listening-- I’m also looking.
You cannot discount looking.

154
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,689
It’s a combination.
It’s looking. And listening.

155
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,089
Listening. And looking.
But you must look.

156
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,455
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

157
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,724
Specific. Let's see....

158
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,801
I’ve walked in and out
of so many buildings.

159
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,377
They all blend in together.

160
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:06,066
Just give me one name.

161
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,050
One name. Absolutely.

162
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,580
Let's see, there's....

163
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:11,926
Vandalay Industries.

164
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,481
I just saw them. I got very close there.
Very close.

165
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:16,561
What type of company is that?

166
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:19,026
Latex. Latex manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

167
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:23,122
-And you interviewed there?
-Yes, for a sales position.

168
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,667
Latex salesman.

169
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:28,570
The selling of latex
and latex-related products.

170
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,731
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!

171
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:35,130
Now I’m going to need an address
and a phone number for this...

172
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:36,470
...Vandalay company.

173
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,354
You like gum?

174
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:41,688
Because I have a friend in the gum
business. I got a gum guy!

175
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,820
I make one phone call, have boxes
of gum delivered right to your door.

176
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,581
The address?

177
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,624
The address is....

178
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,356
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

179
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:58,259
-No.
-Jose Jimenez.

180
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,691
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.

181
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,479
The address.

182
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:07,836
Vandalay is...

183
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:11,543
...1 2<i>9</i> West 81 st Street.
It’s a very small industry, Vandalay.

184
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,466
It’s why I wanted
to work for them.

185
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,452
A phone number.

186
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,232
That's...KL5...

187
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,822
...8383. Are you planning on
calling them soon?

188
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,128
Because they have
very strange hours.

189
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,539
As soon as I’m done with you.

190
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,258
Sure. Well....

191
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:29,594
You know, I’ll check in with you
next week.

192
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,273
I gotta run now because
I got a full plate this afternoon.

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,214
-Okay.
-All right. Really good to....

194
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,114
He'll call you back!

195
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,629
It’s a par five.

196
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,416
So, you know, I step up to the tee...

197
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,900
...and I hit a beautiful drive
right down the middle of the fairway.

198
00:09:51,072 --> 00:09:53,439
-I mean, you know my hook, right?
-Elaine?

199
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,351
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

200
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:03,263
Jerry, he's a guy.

201
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,705
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook.

202
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,109
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.

203
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,795
-Jerry! Jerry!
-George?

204
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,329
-<i>Kramer, put Jerry on!</i>
-I’m in the middle of something.

205
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,759
-Call back.
-<i>Kramer, no</i>--<i>!</i>

206
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,409
So the ball takes off,
and I’m waiting for it to turn.

207
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:28,956
Would you--!

208
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:33,881
All right. Well, I’ll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.

209
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,569
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.

210
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,625
She's wondering when
we'll go see the baby.

211
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:41,754
-See the baby. Again with the baby.
-Who are they?

212
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:45,019
A guy who used to live in the building
keeps calling us to see the baby.

213
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:48,285
''You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?''

214
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,943
Can't they just send us a tape?

215
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:52,666
Maybe if you wait a few months,
it won't be a baby anymore.

216
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,517
-Then you won't have to see it.
-Because he'll be all grown-up.

217
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:56,959
Yeah....

218
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:00,575
Hey, Kramer, what do you think
of this shirt?

219
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:07,293
It’s too busy.

220
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,695
You're trying too hard
to make an impression on him.

221
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,063
-You're not being yourself.
-What guy?

222
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:15,611
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

223
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,179
Who are you talking about?

224
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,801
Keith...Hernandez.

225
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,818
Keith Hernandez?

226
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:25,599
Keith Hernandez!

227
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,247
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?

228
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,453
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.

229
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,304
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I’m begging you.

230
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,646
Please. Please!

231
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,051
You know what?

232
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,839
Bad mistake. My mistake.

233
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,176
Go back. Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

234
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:49,211
This lane stinks. Go back to your lane.
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

235
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:53,053
Go! Go! Go! Make this light!
Make this light! Oh, man!

236
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:55,071
That's it! Get out!

237
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,278
-What do you mean, get out?
-Get out of the cab!

238
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,103
What? I’m not getting out of this cab.

239
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:02,139
No! No! You cannot throw me out!

240
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,546
No! Get....

241
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:06,399
Hello, Newman.

242
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:07,776
I hate Keith Hernandez.

243
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,659
-Hate him!
-I despise him.

244
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:12,862
-Why?
-Why? I’ll tell you why.

245
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,436
-Let me tell her.
-No, you can't--

246
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,256
-You always tell.
-All right, tell it.

247
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,397
-Just tell it.
-All right.

248
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:22,940
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

249
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,242
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

250
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:28,578
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

251
00:12:28,743 --> 00:12:31,711
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

252
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:34,661
Our day was ruined.

253
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:37,884
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

254
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,484
Now we're coming down the ramp.

255
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,379
<i>Newman was in front of me.</i>

256
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,484
<i>Hernandez was coming toward us.</i>

257
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:48,640
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, ''Nice game, pretty boy.''

258
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:53,314
<i>Hernandez continued past us</i>
<i>up the ramp.</i>

259
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:56,446
Then, a second later,
something happened...

260
00:12:56,615 --> 00:13:00,358
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

261
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,211
...from that day forward.

262
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:04,479
-What was it?
-He spit on us!

263
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,190
<i>And I screamed out, ''I'm hit!''</i>

264
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:14,975
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

265
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:19,424
What a story.

266
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,210
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

267
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:24,644
...the whole premise of your account.

268
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:27,328
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

269
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,984
...as I’ve heard this story
a number of times.

270
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,999
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

271
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,462
According to your story...

272
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:38,494
<i>...Hernandez passes you</i>
<i>and starts walking up the ramp.</i>

273
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,901
Then you say you were struck...

274
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,299
...on the right temple.

275
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,755
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

276
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:50,817
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the fourth rib.

277
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,109
The spit then came off the rib...

278
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:58,471
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

279
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,312
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

280
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,299
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

281
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,408
...in midair, mind you...

282
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,334
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

283
00:14:17,226 --> 00:14:20,260
That is one magic loogie.

284
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,028
Well, that's the way it happened.

285
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,999
What happened to your head
when you got hit?

286
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,887
Well, my head...

287
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:36,808
<i>...went back, to the left.</i>

288
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,460
-Say that again.
-Back and to the left.

289
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:42,179
Back and to the left.

290
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:46,025
Back and to the left.

291
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,946
So, what are you saying?

292
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,766
I’m saying...

293
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,380
...that the spit could not have
come from behind.

294
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,745
That there had to have been
a second spitter.

295
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,630
<i>Behind the bushes,</i>
<i>on the gravelly road.</i>

296
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:09,608
lf the spitter was behind you,
as you claim...

297
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:13,221
...that would've caused your head
to pitch forward.

298
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:18,018
So the spit could've only come
from the front and to the right.

299
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:21,091
But that's not what they
would have you believe.

300
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,778
I’m leaving.

301
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,446
Jerry's a nut.

302
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:27,949
Wait, wait, wait.

303
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,493
The sad thing is,
we may never know the real truth.

304
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,746
Did anybody call
asking for Vandalay Industries?

305
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:43,660
-No, what happened to you?
-All right, listen closely:

306
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:46,060
I was at the unemployment office.

307
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:49,418
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandalay Industries...

308
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,332
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

309
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,861
...you have to answer,
''Vandalay Industries.''

310
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,226
-I’m Vandalay Industries?
-Right.

311
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,495
-What is that?
-You're in latex.

312
00:15:59,662 --> 00:16:01,223
-Latex?
-Right.

313
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:04,075
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know! You manufacture it!

314
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:08,132
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?

315
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,637
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

316
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,640
-I’ll hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.

317
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,295
I don't think so.

318
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:19,563
Why would I do that?

319
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,149
Because I asked you to.

320
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,491
lf you think I’m looking for someone
to just sit...

321
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:27,504
...pushing papers around,
you can forget it.

322
00:16:27,664 --> 00:16:30,512
I’ve got enough headaches
just trying to manufacture the stuff.

323
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,018
-Yeah?
-It’s Keith.

324
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,525
All right, we're coming down.

325
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,965
Keith Hernandez?

326
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:40,518
-Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go.
-Where are you going?

327
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,215
They're giving me a ride downtown.

328
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:45,102
You know, there had to have been
a second spitter. Who was it?

329
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,443
Who had the motive?

330
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,674
That's what I’ve been trying
to figure out the past five years.

331
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,751
What the hell are you two
talking about?

332
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,846
-That was really fun. Thanks.
-Yeah, it really was.

333
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,444
<i>Should I shake his hand?</i>

334
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:00,911
Well....

335
00:17:01,073 --> 00:17:02,764
You want to catch a movie
this weekend?

336
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,905
Have you seen <i>JFK</i>?

337
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,137
No, I haven't.

338
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,864
<i>This weekend. Wow!</i>

339
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,608
Sure. That would be great.

340
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:17,773
<i>Damn. I was too overanxious.</i>
<i>He must have noticed that.</i>

341
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:20,007
I mean, if you want to.

342
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,994
-Well, how about this Friday?
-Yeah, Friday's okay.

343
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,605
<i>Go ahead, shake his hand.</i>
<i>I'm Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

344
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,809
<i>I've been on</i> The Tonight Show.

345
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,976
Well, good night.

346
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:33,456
Good night.

347
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,634
Oh, Jer, by the way...

348
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,551
...the woman we gave
a ride to earlier....

349
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:38,925
-Elaine.
-Yeah.

350
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,710
-What's her story?
-I don't know. We used to go out.

351
00:17:42,323 --> 00:17:44,941
Would you mind if I gave her a call?

352
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,473
-For a date?
-Yeah.

353
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,229
Oh, no....

354
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:50,989
Go ahead.

355
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:52,649
You got a pen?

356
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,162
You sure you don't mind?

357
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,098
So then we went to dinner.

358
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,985
-Who paid?
-We split it.

359
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:09,609
Split it. Pretty good.

360
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:13,041
-Did you talk about game six?
-No. I gotta wait until it's the right time.

361
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:17,842
-Yeah?
-<i>It's Elaine.</i>

362
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,378
Come on up.

363
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,916
So then what?

364
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,052
Nothing. Then he took me home.

365
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,137
Shake his hand?

366
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:27,763
Yeah.

367
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,779
What kind of a shake does he have?

368
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:31,539
Good shake. Perfect shake.

369
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:33,840
Single pump, not too hard.

370
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:38,031
Didn't have to prove anything,
but firm enough to know he was there.

371
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:39,953
So...

372
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:42,093
...you're gonna see him again?

373
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:46,547
He asked me if I was doing anything
Friday night.

374
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,332
The weekend!

375
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,042
So then, as I was getting out
of the car--

376
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,581
-Hi!
-Oh, hi, Elaine.

377
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:55,919
Hi, Elaine.

378
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,942
So how was your date?

379
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,681
What date? It’s a guy.

380
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:04,432
So you know.... He called me.

381
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,482
-Already?
-Keith called you?

382
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,647
This guy really gets around.

383
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,679
-Do you mind?
-No, I don't mind. Why should I mind?

384
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,661
What did he say?

385
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:21,685
He asked me out for Saturday night.

386
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,445
-You going?
-No.

387
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,746
-I told him I was busy.
-Oh, really?

388
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:27,853
So we're going out Friday.

389
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:36,017
-Friday?
-Yeah.

390
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,095
He's going out with you on Friday?

391
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,005
-Yeah?
-He's supposed to see me on Friday.

392
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,317
-I didn't know.
-We made plans!

393
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,553
-Well-- I’ll cancel it.
-No, don't cancel it.

394
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,678
Well, this is a little
awkward, isn't it?

395
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,705
Well, frankly, it is.

396
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:59,383
I’ve never seen you jealous before.

397
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,519
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.

398
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:02,899
You didn't even watch it.

399
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,821
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

400
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:07,538
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

401
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,198
Any Hennigan's around here?

402
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,816
Vandalay Industries.

403
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,593
Kell Varnsen speaking.

404
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:32,179
May we help you?

405
00:20:32,729 --> 00:20:34,902
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.

406
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:37,843
No, no, I don't mind at all.

407
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,240
-No, no, no. I can cancel.
-Sure. We'll do something next week.

408
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:43,157
No, it's no problem at all.

409
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,710
Okay. Take it easy.

410
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,851
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.

411
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:50,997
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night?

412
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,529
Friday night? Nothing. Now.

413
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:55,641
Want to come to see the baby?

414
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,832
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.

415
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,931
lf you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

416
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,882
-All right, I’ll go.
-All right. All right.

417
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,808
I’ll get it.

418
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:21,813
Yello.

419
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:23,835
What delay industries?

420
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,337
-No!
-Vandalay!

421
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,711
Say Vandalay!

422
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:29,047
No, you're way, way, way off!

423
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,765
Yeah, that's the right number,
but this is an apartment.

424
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:34,071
-No, say--
-Vandalay! Say--

425
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:36,178
Vandalay Industries!

426
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:39,093
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

427
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,972
How did you know who they wanted?!

428
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,428
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

429
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:05,787
Just sign here, please.

430
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,700
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.

431
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:11,480
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?

432
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:15,060
-I could sell latex like that.
-Just sign that.

433
00:22:23,454 --> 00:22:26,040
-Who is this?
-It’s my daughter.

434
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,404
This is your daughter?

435
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,030
My God!

436
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:34,231
My God!

437
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,782
I hope you don't mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

438
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,404
You think so?

439
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,113
Would you take this picture away
from me? Just take it away.

440
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,516
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.

441
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,784
Let me just sign this and go.

442
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,130
You know...

443
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:53,369
...she doesn't even have a boyfriend.

444
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:56,182
Okay. Okay.

445
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,714
Who do you think you're talking to?

446
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:01,215
You trying to make a joke,
Mrs. Sokol? It’s not funny.

447
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,553
I can tell you that.

448
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,415
I’m serious. She doesn't.

449
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:07,936
You know, it's one thing to not
give me the extension.

450
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,162
But to tease and
to torture me like this...

451
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:12,734
...there's no call for that.

452
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,165
Would you like her phone number?

453
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:22,013
Mrs. Sokol,
I don't know what to say.

454
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:26,912
-Where should I sign this thing?
-No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it.

455
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,943
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.

456
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:33,048
Even if you get a job after
you've been unemployed...

457
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:36,446
...they take unemployment out
of your check every week...

458
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,457
...and show it to you in that little box.

459
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,738
How good can it be for your
confidence that every paycheck...

460
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:46,872
...has the word ''unemployment''
on it?

461
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:49,953
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!

462
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:52,350
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

463
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,337
I have a friend who's unemployed.

464
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,222
He's collecting unemployment
insurance.

465
00:23:56,386 --> 00:24:01,886
This guy has never worked this hard
in his life to keep this thing going.

466
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:07,193
He's down there every week waiting
on the lines and getting interviewed...

467
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,233
...and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

468
00:24:10,402 --> 00:24:15,705
lf they had any idea the effort
and energy that he is expending...

469
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,974
...to avoid work, I’m sure they'd give
him a raise. I’m sure of it.

470
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,916
The guy is doing a tremendous job...

471
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,459
...not working.

472
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,289
So tell me more
about this game six.

473
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:31,268
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the tenth.

474
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:34,045
We're one out away
from losing the series.

475
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:43,581
Hello. How are you?

476
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,641
So, what do you think?

477
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,917
Do you love her?

478
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,451
Yes, I do love her.

479
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,843
You have a very nice place here.

480
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,914
So who do you think she looks like?

481
00:24:58,084 --> 00:24:59,514
Lyndon Johnson.

482
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,970
What? Lyndon Johnson?

483
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,286
He's joking.

484
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:07,770
No, I’m not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.

485
00:25:07,942 --> 00:25:11,257
Jerry, I can't believe it took you
so long to see the baby.

486
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:14,658
I kept saying to Michael, ''When is
Jerry going to see the baby?''

487
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:16,346
I was saying the same thing.

488
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:18,852
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.

489
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:22,308
-You don't have to take a picture.
-I don't know where it is.

490
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,252
It’s in the bottom drawer
of our dresser.

491
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:27,007
Hurry up!

492
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,857
He's such an idiot.

493
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:34,012
Jerry, you want to pick her up?

494
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:35,939
-I better not.
-I’ll pick her up.

495
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:37,564
<i>No!</i>

496
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,602
Thank you for a wonderful time,
George.

497
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,977
Glad you enjoyed it.

498
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:46,242
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

499
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:48,195
Billions and billions.

500
00:25:49,512 --> 00:25:51,300
Would you like to come up?

501
00:25:52,456 --> 00:25:54,244
Would I like to come up?

502
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:57,091
I would love to come up.

503
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,781
I’m...I’m fighting not to.

504
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,513
Fighting.

505
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,238
Unfortunately, l...

506
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,678
...I have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.

507
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,434
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

508
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,429
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

509
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,021
I’m not saying I want to do it
for the rest of my life...

510
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:19,046
...but hardware fascinates me.

511
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,544
Wouldn't you love to make a key?

512
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:26,465
Will you call me as soon
as you get home?

513
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,658
-Tonight?
-Yes.

514
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:35,199
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?

515
00:26:36,777 --> 00:26:39,680
You kill me. You really kill me.

516
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:42,911
Well, good night.

517
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:51,208
It was an accident. Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.

518
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:53,758
Oh, she's gonna be all right.

519
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:57,281
Here, baby. Here.
Here, baby.

520
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,200
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?

521
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,177
I have a friend who's got a baby.

522
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,065
''Gotta see the baby.

523
00:27:05,322 --> 00:27:09,151
You've got to come over
and see the baby.''

524
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:14,345
Nobody ever wants you to come over
and see their grandfather, do they?

525
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,376
''You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.

526
00:27:17,546 --> 00:27:19,368
He's so cute.

527
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,964
1 68 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.

528
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,506
He's 1 000 months.

529
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:30,344
You know, the mid 80s is such
a good time for the grand-people.

530
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:32,199
The mid 80s, you gotta see them.

531
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,982
He went to the bathroom
by himself today.''

532
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:39,908
You know what's tough about seeing
people when they have a baby...

533
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,173
...is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

534
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,413
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

535
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,107
''What do you think of him?''

536
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:49,130
I’d like to meet a couple that goes:

537
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,489
''You know, we're not that happy
with him, frankly.

538
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:55,949
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.

539
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,758
You want him? We don't even
want him. You want him?''

540
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,355
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.

541
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:05,987
Yeah, it was.

542
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:09,731
<i>Gosh, should I kiss her good night?</i>

543
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,779
<i>Is he going to try and kiss me?</i>

544
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:16,300
-I love Cajun cooking.
-Really?

545
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,249
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

546
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,228
Oh, my father's half-drunk.

547
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,244
Maybe they should get together.

548
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,451
<i>Go ahead. Kiss her.</i>

549
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:30,923
<i>I'm a baseball player, damn it.</i>

550
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:33,574
<i>What's he waiting for?</i>

551
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,628
<i>I thought he was a cool guy.</i>

552
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:40,908
<i>Come on. I won the MVP in '7 9.</i>
<i>I can do whatever I want to.</i>

553
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,123
<i>Well, this is getting awkward.</i>

554
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:49,798
Well, good night.

555
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:51,178
Good night.

556
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:58,990
<i>Who does this guy think he is?</i>

557
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,159
<i>I'm Keith Hernandez.</i>

558
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,161
Who else?

559
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:07,726
Mookie. Mookie was there.

560
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:09,482
You know him?

561
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,905
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.

562
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:16,075
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.

563
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,623
-He's the one who got that hit--
-I know. He got the hit in game six!

564
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,860
So then what happened?

565
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,069
Nothing. The he took me home.

566
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,259
So did you two...

567
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:32,907
...have....

568
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:36,106
What?

569
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,146
You know.

570
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:40,906
Milk?

571
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,663
-No.
-Cookies?

572
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:49,865
Did he kiss you good night?

573
00:29:50,449 --> 00:29:51,790
I don't know.

574
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:54,701
What do you mean, you don't know?

575
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:58,316
All right. He kissed me, okay?

576
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,942
Well, what kind of a kiss?

577
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:04,107
Was it a peck? Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?

578
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,986
Between a peck and a make-out.

579
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,224
So you like him.

580
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:12,810
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.

581
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,352
Now you're jealous of him?

582
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:17,133
I’m jealous of everybody.

583
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,759
Hello.

584
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,864
Oh, hi. What's happening?

585
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,239
What?

586
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:32,589
Sure.

587
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,469
Yeah, okay.

588
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:38,254
Then.... I’ll see you then.

589
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,663
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

590
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,005
Bye.

591
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,952
-Who was that?
-That was Keith.

592
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:48,111
-What's going on?
-He wants me to help him move.

593
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,442
Help him move?

594
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:52,912
Move what?

595
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:55,596
You know, furniture.

596
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,829
So, what did you say?

597
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,363
I said, yes, but I don't feel right
about it.

598
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:03,793
I mean, I hardly know the guy.

599
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:06,674
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

600
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:09,619
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.

601
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:14,829
And you feel you're not
really ready for--

602
00:31:14,997 --> 00:31:16,654
Well, we went out one time.

603
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,570
Don't you think that's coming on
a little too strong?

604
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,287
Hey.

605
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,708
What's going on?

606
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:28,562
Keith Hernandez just asked me
to help him move.

607
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,257
What?

608
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,881
Well, you hardly know the guy.

609
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,807
What a nerve!

610
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:40,821
You see? Wasn't I right
about this guy? Didn't I tell you?

611
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,157
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?

612
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,343
-I said, yes.
-You said yes?!

613
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:50,515
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

614
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:53,875
I mean, how can you prostitute
yourself like this?

615
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,110
Are you gonna start driving him
to the airport?

616
00:31:56,503 --> 00:31:58,357
I’m not driving him to the airport.

617
00:31:58,518 --> 00:32:00,242
Oh, boy. I don't know.

618
00:32:00,757 --> 00:32:03,092
-Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
-What?

619
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,597
Don't mention it to anybody.

620
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,060
I wish you never mentioned it to me.

621
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,341
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.

622
00:32:20,504 --> 00:32:22,576
And I will call you
as soon as I get home.

623
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:24,335
Don't bother.

624
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:26,544
Bother? What kind of bother?

625
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,080
I would prefer it if you didn't.

626
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,756
-Why? Is anything wrong?
-It’s over, buddy. Done.

627
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,556
Finished. So long. Goodbye.
<i>Adios. Sayonara</i>.

628
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,471
-Why?
-I’ve been thinking about it.

629
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,671
You got no job.
You got no prospects.

630
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,849
You're like Biff Loman.

631
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,791
I went to the hardware store
interview.

632
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:51,222
You think I’m going to spend my life
with somebody...

633
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:54,384
...because he can get me a deal
on a box of nails?

634
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:56,913
I thought we were a team.

635
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,016
lf I ever need a drill bit, I’ll call you.

636
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:01,875
Carrie, could you do me a favor?

637
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:04,376
Could you not mention this
to your mother?

638
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:09,173
You know, I hate to brag...

639
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,856
...but I did win 11 straight
Gold Gloves.

640
00:33:13,017 --> 00:33:15,473
I wouldn't have brought it up,
but since you mentioned it.

641
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,620
I didn't mention it.

642
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,281
Well, I won them anyway.

643
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,932
Well, so what? I mean...

644
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:25,138
...you played first base.

645
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:27,672
I mean, they always put
the worst player at first base.

646
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,551
That's where they put me,
and I stunk.

647
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:35,605
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

648
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,698
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

649
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:42,388
...and I know you'll never be there.

650
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:44,688
The way I figure it,
I’ve already been there.

651
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,827
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

652
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:53,110
Well, I’d watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

653
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:56,210
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

654
00:33:59,932 --> 00:34:01,906
You know, I hate to say this...

655
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:04,726
...but I really think that
we're hitting it off.

656
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:07,707
-Get it? Get it?
-Clever.

657
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:12,922
-What are you doing?
-What's that?

658
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,474
-You smoke?
-Yeah.

659
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,362
I didn't know you smoked.

660
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,106
Is that a problem?

661
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:28,468
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.

662
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:30,425
-How do you know?
-Who wouldn't like him?

663
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:31,963
I like him, and I’m a guy.

664
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,005
I suppose he's an attractive man.

665
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:38,132
Forget that. He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1 <i>9</i> 7<i>9</i>.

666
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,912
I’m making wisecracks in some
nightclub. This guy was in game six.

667
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:44,122
They're a perfect match.
They go together.

668
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:46,903
Like one of these brother and sister
couples that look alike.

669
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:50,419
I hate those couples. I could never be
one of those couples.

670
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,340
There are no bald women around,
you know.

671
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:58,870
I know this sounds a little arrogant,
but I never thought she'd find...

672
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:01,525
...someone she liked better
than me. But, you know...

673
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:03,963
...I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.

674
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,817
You know what I’d like to do?

675
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:09,053
I’d really like to have sex
with a tall woman.

676
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:13,011
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5''.

677
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,032
Really?

678
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,369
What was the tallest woman
you ever slept with?

679
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:19,029
I don't know, 6'3''.

680
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,850
Wow! God!

681
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,336
See, this is all I think about:
Sleeping with a giant.

682
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,379
It’s my life's ambition.

683
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:32,056
So I guess it's fair to say you've set
different goals for yourself than...

684
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,907
...say, Thomas Edison, Magellan,
these type of people.

685
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,144
Magellan? You like Magellan?

686
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:40,695
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

687
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:43,575
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.

688
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,557
-De Soto? What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.

689
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:49,140
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

690
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:54,045
All right. I gotta go down
to the unemployment office.

691
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,695
-You want to take a walk?
-No, I got some stuff to do.

692
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,711
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment
at 3. I’m helping him move.

693
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,504
What?

694
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,238
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!

695
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:08,573
-I know. Isn’t that something?
-Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

696
00:36:08,737 --> 00:36:12,348
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.

697
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,160
Soon he'll have you driving him
to the airport.

698
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,783
I’m not driving him to the airport!

699
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,704
I gave. I gave everything I could,
Mrs. Sokol.

700
00:36:24,865 --> 00:36:27,583
-Nothing was good enough for her.
-Sign here, please.

701
00:36:27,746 --> 00:36:30,364
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.

702
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,790
I’ll tell you, she's very particular,
your daughter. Very particular.

703
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,026
Is she looking for some
big hotshot businessman?

704
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,648
Well, I’ve got my pride too.
I’m not gonna beg her.

705
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:41,468
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

706
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:49,435
You like baseball?

707
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:52,668
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

708
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,743
I saw every inning that year.

709
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:59,805
It’s funny, because I happen to be
very good friends with...

710
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,914
...Keith Hernandez.

711
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:04,637
You know Keith Hernandez.

712
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,177
Know him?

713
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,921
Would you...like to meet him?

714
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:11,484
Oh, come on. Come on.

715
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,852
I can produce Keith Hernandez,
right here...

716
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:16,768
...within the hour.

717
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,457
All right.

718
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,866
You got one hour.

719
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:24,316
All right, Mrs. S.

720
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:28,921
I and my good pal
Keith Hernandez...

721
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,975
...will be right back.

722
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,198
1 2<i>9</i> West 81 st Street, and hurry.

723
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,395
Or not.

724
00:37:56,806 --> 00:37:59,195
You better bring your gloves.
It’s freezing out there.

725
00:37:59,365 --> 00:38:03,227
It shouldn't take too long.
I’d say maybe, oh, four hours.

726
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:07,967
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.

727
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:10,142
We got two dressers and the bed.

728
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:13,572
-Is there a box spring?
-What's that?

729
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:15,740
-A box spring?
-Yeah, there's a box spring.

730
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:19,259
But it's attached to the headboard,
and we'll have to take that apart.

731
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,890
Then we got the couch.

732
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:24,128
-Is that a sectional?
-Yeah, 1 2 pieces.

733
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:27,873
-A marble coffee table.
-Is that a thick marble?

734
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,624
Three inches thick.
Got it in Italy.

735
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,335
But the big problem is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

736
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:36,162
When you move it,
it tends to open up...

737
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:38,749
...so it's going to be difficult
getting it downstairs.

738
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:41,250
Stairs?

739
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:45,790
-There's no elevator?
-No, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

740
00:38:50,182 --> 00:38:52,158
-I’m sorry, I can't do this.
-What?

741
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:54,881
I can't do it! I can't!
It’s too soon.

742
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:57,055
I don't know you.

743
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,445
I can't help you move, I’m sorry.
I can't! I just can't.

744
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,549
-Hello.
-Hello.

745
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:15,780
Oh, you don't remember me.

746
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,880
-No. Should l?
-Yeah, yeah, you should...

747
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,982
...because I certainly remember you.

748
00:39:23,177 --> 00:39:24,933
Let me refresh your memory.

749
00:39:25,352 --> 00:39:29,246
June 1 4th, 1 <i>9</i>8 7.

750
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,548
Mets-Phillies. You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

751
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,851
Then you're coming up
the parking lot ramp.

752
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:37,405
You said, ''Nice game, pretty boy.''

753
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:41,414
-You remember.
-And then you spit on us.

754
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,365
-Hey, I didn't spit at you.
-Yeah, right.

755
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,312
-No, no. Then who was it?
-Look, the way I remember it...

756
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:49,376
...I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.

757
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,401
<i>That's when you called me</i>
<i>''pretty boy. ''</i>

758
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:54,312
<i>Hey, that ticked me off.</i>
<i>I was turning to say something...</i>

759
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,354
<i>...and as I turned around...</i>

760
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,985
...I saw Roger McDowell behind
the bushes over by that gravelly road.

761
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:09,413
<i>Anyway, he was talking to someone,</i>
<i>and they were pointing at you.</i>

762
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:11,520
<i>I tried to scream out,</i>
<i>but it was too late.</i>

763
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,152
<i>It was already on its way.</i>

764
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:14,531
I told you.

765
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:20,971
-<i>It was McDowell.</i>
-<i>But why? Why McDowell?</i>

766
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:24,674
Maybe because we were sitting
in the right-field stands...

767
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,144
...cursing at him in the bullpen
all game.

768
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:30,593
He must have caught a glimpse of us
when I poured that beer on his head.

769
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,109
-It was McDowell.
-Oh, boy.

770
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:39,393
-Look, Keith, we're sorry.
-Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.

771
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,604
Guys, don't worry about it.

772
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,707
-Well, I guess I better get going.
-What are you doing?

773
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:47,244
-I gotta move.
-You want any help?

774
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:50,149
-I’d love some. You sure?
-I’d love to help you.

775
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:51,526
Yeah, me too!

776
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,601
Okay, guys. We got to be careful
of one thing.

777
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:56,969
Some of the stuff is very fragile
We'll have to handle it like a baby.

778
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:58,855
Hey, no sweat.

779
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:12,198
Hello.

780
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,951
Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on?

781
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:16,678
No, he just left.

782
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,340
You broke up with him?

783
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,069
Me too!

784
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,527
What happened?

785
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:27,817
Oh, smoking. You know, you're like
going out with C. Everett Koop.

786
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:30,955
Me? No.
I couldn't go through with it.

787
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,124
I just didn't feel ready.

788
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:35,180
So, what are you doing now?

789
00:41:35,629 --> 00:41:36,939
Oh, great idea. Okay.

790
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,825
I’ll meet you there in, like,
30 minutes.

791
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,583
Okay, bye.

792
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:43,430
Keith! Keith!

793
00:41:43,597 --> 00:41:46,914
-What happened? Where's Keith?
-You just missed him. He just left.

794
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:49,805
What do you need him for?

795
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,545
Keith! Keith! Up here!

796
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:55,271
Look, could you do me a favor?

797
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,675
I need you to go to the
unemployment office with me!

798
00:41:58,351 --> 00:41:59,725
l-- I’m Jerry's friend!

799
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,741
The guy from the locker room!

800
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,464
I’m the chucker!

801
00:42:03,632 --> 00:42:05,606
It'll take five minutes!

802
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:08,678
Wait! Wait!

803
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,701
Well, Biff...

804
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,543
...what's next?

805
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:28,874
I don't know.

806
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:32,716
Excuse me.

807
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:34,441
I was walking behind you, and you...

808
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:36,779
...dropped your wallet.

809
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:43,307
When you're moving,
your whole world becomes boxes.

810
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:46,538
That's all you think about,
is boxes. Where are there boxes?

811
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:49,575
You just wander down the street,
going in and out of stores.

812
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:52,745
''Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?''

813
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:56,176
I mean, you can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

814
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:59,337
''Shut up! I’m looking for boxes!''

815
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:02,987
So after a while, you become
really into it. You can smell them.

816
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:04,647
You walk into a store:

817
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:06,826
''There's boxes here.

818
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:10,791
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it! I can smell them!''

819
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,036
You become, like, obsessed.

820
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:16,202
'‘I love the smell of cardboard
in the morning.''

821
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,502
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:

822
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,357
''That's a nice box.

823
00:43:22,067 --> 00:43:25,134
Does anybody know where
that guy got that box?

824
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,471
When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

825
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:29,642
It’s got some nice handles on it.''

826
00:43:30,004 --> 00:43:34,061
And that's what death is, really.
It’s the last big move of your life.

827
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:35,657
The hearse is like the van.

828
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:37,321
The pallbearers are close friends.

829
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:40,720
The only ones you could really ask
to help you with a big move like that.

830
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,891
And the casket is that great,
perfect box...

831
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,881
...you've been looking for
your whole life.

832
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:47,726
The only problem is
once you find it, you're in it.
