1
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:04,227
I’m going to get
a physical examination.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,219
That urine sample. Giving them that,
that's always a pleasure, isn't it?

3
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:11,330
Then there's always
the amount question:

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,175
'‘I don't know what you need.
I gave you whatever I had there.

5
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:18,891
I got more. Whatever you need,
I can get it for you.

6
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,805
Just let me know what you need.
It's no problem, I mean....''

7
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:24,718
But any kind of physical test,
I don't know what it is...

8
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:27,599
...I always click into this thing
where I wanna do really well.

9
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:30,032
lf it's gonna be a physical test,
I wanna do well.

10
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,083
Remember in school,
they'd do hearing tests?

11
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:34,895
And you'd really be listening,
you know...

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,036
...trying to really--
Trying to do well, I wanna do well.

13
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:39,986
I wanted to do unbelievable
on that test.

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,769
I wanted them to come to me
after the test and go:

15
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:46,035
''We think you may have something
close to super hearing.

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,839
What you heard was a cotton ball
touching a piece of felt.

17
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:54,423
We're sending the results
to Washington.

18
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:56,946
We'd like you
to meet the president.''

19
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:05,337
Let me ask you a question.

20
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,288
lf you named a kid Rasputin...

21
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,746
...do you think that would have
a negative effect on his life?

22
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:13,725
No.

23
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,352
What are you doing?
We're going out to dinner.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,745
Do you realize this is the last meal
I’m gonna have for three days?

25
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,458
-Yeah.
-<i>George.</i>

26
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,183
Come on up.

27
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,902
I never heard of this. You gotta fast
for three days to take an ulcer test.

28
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,723
-How will you do that?
-I don't know.

29
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:35,364
How could I possibly have ulcers?
Who could have given me ulcers?

30
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,600
I think I’ll take out the garbage.

31
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,396
Have you ever fasted?

32
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,143
Well, once I didn't have
dinner till, like, <i>9</i>:00.

33
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,923
I’ll tell you, that was pretty rough.

34
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:50,954
Hey. Do me a favor, will you?

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,008
Throw out my garbage for me.

36
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,245
Yeah. Right.

37
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,801
Come on. It’s just down the hall.

38
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:02,225
Give me 2 bucks.
I’ll do it for 2 bucks.

39
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:05,457
I’ll give you 50 cents.

40
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:07,826
There's no way I’d touch that bag
for less than $2.

41
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:11,156
Come on, 50 cents. You can
get yourself a Drake's Coffee Cake.

42
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:15,823
You're not getting no
Drake's Coffee Cake for 50 cents.

43
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:19,347
I’m all set. I got the ticket. I’m going
to the Cayman Islands Friday.

44
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:22,517
I don't get you. Who goes
on vacation without a job?

45
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,206
What do you need, a break
from getting up at 11?

46
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:29,243
It’s a deal. I don't know
why you don't come with me.

47
00:02:29,407 --> 00:02:31,098
I don't go for nonrefundable deals.

48
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:34,265
I can't commit to a woman,
I’m not committing to an airline.

49
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,231
-Hi.
-Hi.

50
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,677
How are you?

51
00:02:39,842 --> 00:02:41,534
Gina, do you know
Drake's Coffee Cake?

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,188
The plain cake with the sweet
brown crumbs on the top.

53
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,145
-Right. How much do they cost?
-The junior?

54
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,000
-No, no, no, the full-size.
-No, junior.

55
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,615
-You didn't say ''junior.''
-I haven't had one since I was little.

56
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:52,798
Really?

57
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:56,679
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I want you out of here.

58
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,787
-How you doing?
-Good enough.

59
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,963
-Boy, she's sexy, isn't she?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,521
-Do you believe that guy?
-What guy?

61
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,897
-My neighbor.
-That creepy guy?

62
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,290
-Did he think I was flirting with her?
-He didn't seem too pleased.

63
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:34,509
Maybe I’ll get a steak
with French-fried onion rings.

64
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:36,594
Hey, you know what?

65
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,831
I just remembered something.

66
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:42,679
I had a dream about that guy
last night. This is amazing.

67
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:45,560
-Amazing? You've seen him before.
-I haven't seen him in months.

68
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,251
What was the dream?

69
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,218
He was doing standup comedy
in Kennebunkport, Maine...

70
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,562
...in this really ominous nightclub.

71
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,669
The stage was on a cliff
and the audience...

72
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,727
...was throwing all the comics off.

73
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,286
I think I’ve played there.

74
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,160
I’ve had a lot of paranormal stuff
happen to me.

75
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:05,436
You're a little paranormal.

76
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,904
Name one paranormal thing
that happened to you.

77
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:10,851
-I knew I was gonna be bald.
-Your father's bald.

78
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,502
Baldness is inherited
from the mother's side, Jerry.

79
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,907
But your mother's bald too.

80
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,680
George, you know,
my friend goes to a psychic.

81
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:21,889
-Really?
-We should go sometime.

82
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:23,781
I’d love to go.
Make an appointment.

83
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,816
Psychics, vacations.
How about getting a job?

84
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:32,326
-I just got fired.
-All right. Let's get out of here.

85
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,730
I wonder what Gandhi ate
before his fast.

86
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:36,934
I heard he used to polish off
a box of Triscuits.

87
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:41,644
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. Gandhi loved Triscuits.

88
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,900
Who is it?

89
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:48,430
-Who is it?
-It’s Gina!

90
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:50,864
-Who?
-Martin's girlfriend.

91
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,417
-Martin?
-Your next-door neighbor.

92
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:55,211
Oh, Martin!

93
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:58,798
It’s Martin. I think he's dying.
He tried to kill himself with pills.

94
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,145
-What?
-Come on.

95
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,417
-Let me get my robe.
-We do not have time.

96
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,145
-Two seconds.
-There's no time.

97
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,386
-We don't have two seconds?
-All right, go ahead.

98
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,342
-No, forget it.
-No, go ahead.

99
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,547
-No, I’ll just wear the pajamas.
-Just get it!

100
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,887
-Are you sure?
-Forget it. Come on.

101
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:15,125
No, I’ll go get the robe.

102
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:23,387
It’s not too bad. It’s not
like a Sunny von Bülow coma.

103
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,761
Doctor said he should
snap out of it any time.

104
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:32,280
You know why he did this?
Because I told him it was over.

105
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,584
-I did not want to see him anymore.
-Really? It’s over?

106
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:38,818
I could not stand it another minute.

107
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,471
Yesterday, he turned over
a hot dog stand...

108
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,461
...because he thought
the man looked at me.

109
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:48,386
Then, after he saw you in the hall....
He was crazy with jealousy.

110
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:50,691
Oh, boy.

111
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,030
Did he say anything about me?

112
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,293
He does not like you.

113
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,065
And all indications are he does not
like Drake's Coffee Cake.

114
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:05,194
-He said that?
-He was screaming about it all night.

115
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,557
How it's too sweet and
it falls apart when you eat it.

116
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,752
I’m sorry if I caused any trouble.
I was just being friendly.

117
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,022
I wasn't.

118
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:17,165
You weren't?

119
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:21,869
No. I have thought
about you many times.

120
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:25,996
-Have you thought about me?
-Of course.

121
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:30,168
Tell me everything.

122
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,039
Are you sure
he can't hear anything?

123
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:36,469
Martin.

124
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,127
Martin!

125
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,438
I wish he was not in a coma.
I wish he was dead.

126
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,229
I would like to pull the plug out
from him!

127
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:50,076
I would wait on that one.

128
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,345
I know how you feel,
but juries today...

129
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,002
...you never know how
they're gonna look at this.

130
00:06:56,355 --> 00:07:00,131
I saw you looking at your watch.
You want to leave? Go ahead.

131
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:02,846
-I wanted to see what time it was.
-Are you afraid of him?

132
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:04,612
-No.
-Then kiss me.

133
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,367
-Here?
-Yes, right here.

134
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,127
Is this the proper venue?

135
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,648
-You don't want to?
-No, no, I want to.

136
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:14,949
I very much want to. I desire to.
I pine to.

137
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:16,739
Then kiss me right in front of him.

138
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:19,428
I can't! What if he wakes up?

139
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:22,313
A man is lying here unconscious
and you're afraid of him?

140
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:24,773
What kind of a man are you?

141
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,527
I’m a man who respects a good coma.

142
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,003
lf it was one of those
in-and-out comas, maybe.

143
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,136
But when a guy's got a coma
going like this...

144
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,314
...you don't wanna mess with it.

145
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,138
-Hey.
-Hey.

146
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,797
-Did you hear about Martin?
-Yeah, I heard.

147
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,479
I can't believe he's in a coma.
He's got my vacuum cleaner.

148
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,533
I loaned it to him, he never
returned it. The carpets are filthy.

149
00:07:56,697 --> 00:07:59,513
-What am I gonna do?
-Who told you about Martin?

150
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:01,530
Newman.
He's good friends with him.

151
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,273
Bigmouth Newman.
I should have guessed.

152
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:07,256
He's got all my attachments,
you know.

153
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,164
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait...

154
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:13,750
...for a guy to come out of a coma
before you ask his ex-girlfriend out?

155
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,576
Oh, Gina?

156
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:19,289
Why wait?
Why not just call Dr. Kevorkian.

157
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,867
I don't get that
whole suicide machine.

158
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:26,720
There's no tall buildings
where these people live?

159
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,660
They can't wrap their lips around
a revolver like a normal person?

160
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,184
What's going on
between you and Gina?

161
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,749
Well, I went with her
to the hospital last night.

162
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,416
So we're in the room and she's trying
to get me to kiss her in front of him.

163
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:42,789
That's the great thing
about Mediterranean women.

164
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,482
All right. So, what did you do?

165
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:49,671
-Nothing.
-What kind of a man are you?

166
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,659
The guy is unconscious, in a coma...

167
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,124
...and you don't have the guts
to kiss his girlfriend?

168
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:56,773
I didn't know what
the coma etiquette was.

169
00:08:56,944 --> 00:08:58,733
There is no coma etiquette.

170
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:02,475
See, that's the beauty of the coma.
It doesn't matter what you do.

171
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:08,399
So you're saying his girl, his car,
his clothes, it's all up for grabs.

172
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,580
You can just loot the coma victim.

173
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,937
I give them 2 4 hours to get out of it.

174
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:17,551
They can't get out of it
by 2 4 hours, it's a land rush.

175
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:21,838
So if the coma victim wakes up
in a month...

176
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,149
...he's thrilled. He got out of the coma.

177
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,997
-He goes home, there's nothing left?
-Nothing left!

178
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,659
That's why I’m trying to get that
vacuum. Somebody's gonna grab it.

179
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,626
Martin's spirit came to you
as a warning.

180
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:43,230
Why would he come to George?

181
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:45,881
Because George has heightened
extrasensory perception.

182
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,773
Faithy, get your finger
out of your nose!

183
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:51,834
-I knew it. I always felt different.
-You are. Some coffee cake?

184
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,945
-Drake's?
-Yes.

185
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:57,084
-Did you buy this for me?
-No, why?

186
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,356
Because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.

187
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,335
-Maybe I did.
-Take it away.

188
00:10:03,496 --> 00:10:05,471
She hasn't eaten in two days.

189
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:08,839
-Who's Pauline?
-Pauline?

190
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:11,169
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

191
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,374
My brother once impregnated
a woman named Pauline.

192
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,581
-You think about her?
-When I hear her name.

193
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,339
Cut these with your left hand.

194
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:26,341
There was a woman. Audrey.

195
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,433
She had a very big nose.

196
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:31,215
I see an Audrey,
but with a small nose.

197
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:34,062
Yes, yes. She had a nose job.

198
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,714
I loved her very deeply.

199
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:38,292
Will she ever speak to me again?

200
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,593
Not in this life.

201
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:44,210
-Should you be smoking?
-Does it bother you?

202
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:45,717
-You're pregnant.
-Elaine.

203
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:48,470
I smoked when I had Faithy.

204
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,476
What? What?

205
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:53,585
I don't know about this trip, George.

206
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,446
You can see the Cayman Islands
in there?

207
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,496
Is something gonna happen
to me? What?

208
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,995
It’s really bad for the fetus,
you know that?

209
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:02,263
She's a psychic.
She knows how the kid's gonna be.

210
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,919
Should I not go on this trip?

211
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,677
George...

212
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,265
...I am going to tell you something
and I want you to really hear me.

213
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,973
Now, listen, I just don't know
how a person, with everything...

214
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:20,608
...we now know about prenatal care,
can put a cigarette in her mouth!

215
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:22,562
-What are you doing?
-It’s disgusting.

216
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:24,516
-I don't need this!
-Look, please!

217
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:26,534
-I would like you both to leave.
-Oh, fine.

218
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,826
Well, I don't like to be around people
who are just so irresponsible.

219
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:33,310
-Get the hell out.
-A plane crash?! A heart attack?!

220
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:34,789
Lupus? Is it lupus?

221
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:38,568
Do you want me to call the super?
He was an Israeli commando.

222
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:42,949
lf you don't say anything,
I’ll assume it's a plane crash.

223
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,572
-Get out.
-Not a plane crash.

224
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,480
Is it a plane crash?

225
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,984
Psychics should be licensed.

226
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,277
And it wouldn't be hard. We could
just give them the regular DMV test...

227
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:58,574
...only with the silver dollars and
the pizza dough over the eyes.

228
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:01,805
lf you can do the parallel park
like that, you're a psychic.

229
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,340
We can test these people,
no question about it.

230
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:07,317
Like Kreskin. Instead
of just hiding his check...

231
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:10,414
...why don't we try
stopping his check.

232
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,756
Let's see how he handles that.

233
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,112
I do not like your toothbrush.

234
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:18,388
There are no bristles.

235
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:21,266
You can say what you want
about me...

236
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,672
...but I’ll be damned
if I’m gonna stand here...

237
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:26,074
...while you insult my toothbrush.

238
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:30,744
It is too small for someone
with such a big mouth.

239
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,167
Let me ask you...

240
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,294
...what will you do if Martin
wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

241
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,867
No, more like the Three Stooges
at the end of every movie.

242
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:46,719
Who are these stooges
you speak of?

243
00:12:47,622 --> 00:12:49,215
They're a comedy team.

244
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,388
Tell me about them. Everything.

245
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:57,320
Well, they're three funny-looking guys
and they'd hit each other a lot.

246
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,545
-You will show me the stooges?
-I will show you the stooges.

247
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:05,223
-When?
-Well...

248
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,068
...I don't really know where
the stooges are right now...

249
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:11,020
...but if I locate them,
you'll be the first to know.

250
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:14,982
Come. You walk me to a cab.

251
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,418
Well, l....

252
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,852
I don't want you to get upset
or anything...

253
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:23,564
...but with Martin and all, maybe it's
not a good idea to be seen together...

254
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,936
...in the building,
because he had a lot of friends.

255
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,368
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.

256
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,242
Well, then what are all those ties and
sports jackets doing in my closet?

257
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,804
Are you going to walk me
to a cab or not?

258
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:38,102
Yeah, all right, all right.

259
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:46,256
-Why don't you just eat fruit.
-Fruit makes me incontinent.

260
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:47,890
I don't want you eating over here.

261
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:50,968
Hello, Gina. Hello, Jerry.

262
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,491
Hello, Newman.

263
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,092
Do you think Newman
would tell Martin if he wakes up?

264
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,587
What kind of sicko would do that?
He could kill me.

265
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,438
People smoke, Elaine.

266
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,584
My mother smoked.

267
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:14,148
It didn't hurt me.

268
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:18,397
Did you guys see that wall move?

269
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,728
Boy, it's a good thing we came.

270
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,229
Could there be a native problem
in the Caymans?

271
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:25,703
Maybe there's native unrest.

272
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,249
Hi. I haven't eaten in three days.

273
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:33,092
I was wondering how much longer
it would be till I get my X-ray.

274
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:34,663
We'll call you.

275
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:38,635
George, I want you to promise me
something. lf I’m ever in a coma...

276
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,175
...in the first 2 4 hours, get everything
out of my place and put it in storage.

277
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,767
-How come?
-Looters.

278
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:50,701
How do we know the dog food's
any good?

279
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:55,313
Who tastes it?

280
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,682
She is really hungry.

281
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,566
-Hey.
-Kramer.

282
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,792
Well, Newman's upstairs
visiting Martin.

283
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,732
Would you buy
my Cayman Island ticket?

284
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,095
-You're not going?
-No.

285
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,828
-Why not?
-The psychic said...

286
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,489
...something terrible will happen.

287
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:16,756
I dig.

288
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,817
I want my vacuum cleaner!

289
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,505
Martin, I know you can hear me.

290
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:28,252
Look, my mother's coming to visit me.
She sees that rug, she's gonna kill me.

291
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,768
He can't hear you, you idiot.
Why don't you just buy another one.

292
00:15:32,675 --> 00:15:36,090
Why would I buy another one when
I spent 1 00 bucks on this one?

293
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:38,363
I have a carpet sweeper
you can use.

294
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:41,731
I don't want a carpet sweeper.
They don't do anything.

295
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,301
It gets my rug clean.

296
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,984
The carpet sweeper
is the biggest scam...

297
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:49,699
...perpetrated on the American
public since One Hour Martinizing.

298
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,524
You should take a look
at my rug, then.

299
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,894
I wouldn't set foot in your house.

300
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,384
-Hello.
-Hey.

301
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,272
Hello, Jerry.

302
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:04,714
-How's he doing?
-Well, he looks happy to me.

303
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:08,262
I hope he stays this happy
when he wakes up.

304
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,052
-Why wouldn't he?
-No reason.

305
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:13,994
He'll have a lot of catching up
to do, I guess.

306
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:16,459
I’ll bring him up to date.

307
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,306
-How up to date?
-All the way up.

308
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:23,117
Nothing could change your mind?

309
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:28,269
Well, it would take a lot, because
a friend is something you earn.

310
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:32,789
Jerry has a friend who has free tickets
to the Cayman Islands this weekend.

311
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,124
He's not going.

312
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,587
I don't care much for the beach.
I freckle.

313
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,205
-Is that a...?
-Drake's Coffee Cake.

314
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,940
Where did you get that?

315
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,226
From my house.
I got a whole box of them.

316
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:58,589
Boy. That's the full-size.

317
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,370
That's your big boy.

318
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:04,800
Can I have a bite?

319
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:07,102
I don't like to give out bites.

320
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,244
I got another one...

321
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,100
...but I’m saving it for later.

322
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,012
Just one bite?

323
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:18,692
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.

324
00:17:18,858 --> 00:17:21,478
All right! All right.

325
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,078
I won't say anything.

326
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:25,220
-You swear?
-I swear.

327
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:28,325
-On your mother's life?
-On my mother's life.

328
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:42,090
But here it was...

329
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:44,721
...mountains of duck.

330
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:51,403
And not fatty duck either,
but juicy, tender breasts of duck.

331
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,431
-Beautifully sliced....
-Faithy!

332
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,022
Sweetheart, no, don't run!

333
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:57,080
You could take
as much as you want....

334
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,952
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Faithy!

335
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:10,044
Hi. Hi! What are you doing here?
How did I know you were here?

336
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,792
Something drew me here.
This is phenomenal.

337
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,268
The nurse said she'd be back.

338
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:16,155
Supposed to take me
to the delivery room.

339
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,557
Oh, that's great. That's great.

340
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,438
I have to apologize for my friend
the other day--

341
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,642
Friend? I don't even
know that woman.

342
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,048
I met her on the way over.
I couldn't get rid of her.

343
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:28,448
I tell you, my psychic instincts
were a little off--

344
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:32,445
-Where's the nurse?
-I’m sure she'll be right back.

345
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:35,365
Sweetheart, why don't you
run and get a nurse for Mommy.

346
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,911
I was just curious. The other day
you said something about my trip.

347
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,094
-Don't take that trip.
-Yeah! Why? Why?

348
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:45,218
-Because.... Because....
-All right, Rula. It’s time to go.

349
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,689
Yeah, because...? Because...?

350
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,611
Assassins! How dare they keep
a person waiting like this!

351
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:55,660
Drake's Coffee Cake?

352
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:58,982
-Give me that!
-Jerry, you better stop her or I’ll tell!

353
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:02,000
Elaine, no! No!

354
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,840
Are there terrorists on the plane?
A hotel fire, is that it?

355
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:12,809
Typhus? Malaria? Yellow fever?
Lupus? Is it lupus?

356
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:15,633
They did it right in this bed, Martin.
Right in front of you.

357
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:18,351
-I want my vacuum cleaner!
-I can explain!

358
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,407
It was disgusting!

359
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:28,278
What are you doing?
We're going to dinner in 1 0 minutes.

360
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:31,765
I never assisted in a birth before.

361
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,782
It’s really quite disgusting.

362
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,690
-What did she name the kid?
-You wouldn't believe it.

363
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:39,067
Rasputin.

364
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,813
-Hey!
-Hey!

365
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:46,238
-When did you get back?
-A couple hours ago.

366
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,890
-So how was it?
-George...

367
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:53,756
...I would like to thank you
for the greatest four days of my life.

368
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:58,236
They were shooting the
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue...

369
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,790
...right in the hotel pool.
Not only that...

370
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,644
...the hotel opened up an area
on the beach for nude bathing...

371
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,881
...and all of the models
went down there.

372
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:11,337
I am on the next blanket
from Elle Macpherson.

373
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,956
We played backgammon nude.

374
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:17,860
-Oh, she's a sweet kid.
-Nude backgammon...

375
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,397
...with swimsuit models!

376
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,204
Oh, you know what? The second day
I was there, I stepped on a jellyfish.

377
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:29,455
It stung my foot. That's probably what
Rula was trying to warn you about.

378
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,723
-You gotta watch for the jellyfish.
-Yeah.

379
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,029
What's this?

380
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:37,492
It’s an invitation to a housewarming
for Martin and Gina.

381
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,652
-They moved in together?
-Yeah, some place in the Village.

382
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,813
-Yeah.
-<i>It's Elaine.</i>

383
00:20:45,976 --> 00:20:47,951
All right, we're coming down.

384
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,194
-Where you going?
-We're taking Elaine to dinner.

385
00:20:50,361 --> 00:20:53,079
She's gotta start the fast again.
You wanna go?

386
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:56,274
I’d like to, but a bunch of us
from the islands are getting together.

387
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:59,763
-Elle Macpherson gonna be there?
-I gotta call her back.

388
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,273
The thing I don't understand
about the suicide person...

389
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:08,319
...is the people that try
and commit suicide...

390
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,086
...for some reason, they don't die,
and then that's it. They stop trying.

391
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,000
Why?

392
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,433
Why don't they just keep trying?
What has changed? Is their life better?

393
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,787
No. In fact, it's worse,
because now they've found out...

394
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:24,707
...here's one more thing you stink at.

395
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,197
That's why these people don't
succeed at life to begin with.

396
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,256
Because they give up too easy.
I say pills don't work, try a rope.

397
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:37,770
Car won't start in the garage?
Get a tune-up. You know what I mean?

398
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,458
There's nothing more rewarding...

399
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:42,411
...than reaching a goal
you've set for yourself.
