1
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:03,805
So I'm on the plane. We left late.

2
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:08,871
Pilot says, ''We're going to be making
up some time.'' Isn't that interesting?

3
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:10,242
They just make up time.

4
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:12,197
That's why you have to
reset your watch.

5
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:14,624
Of course when they say
they're making up time...

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:18,305
...obviously, they're increasing
the speed of the aircraft.

7
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:21,407
Now my question is,
if you can go faster...

8
00:00:21,577 --> 00:00:24,446
...why don't you just go
as fast as you can...

9
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:26,144
...all the time?

10
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:30,055
Come on. There's no cops up here.
Nail it. Give it some gas.

11
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:32,290
We're flying.

12
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,107
Traveling, of course,
is the best education.

13
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:40,484
You know, last year...

14
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:46,470
...I was ill for 40, 45 countries...

15
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:50,496
...and I would've gone to more,
but I’d just got a puppy.

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,870
And he was too young
to take with me.

17
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,489
But not now.
I won't travel without him.

18
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:58,047
-Is he on the plane now?
-Oh, yes.

19
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,601
Yes, he's in
the baggage compartment.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,153
I don't know why they won't
let him sit up here with me.

21
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:07,941
He's a lot better behaved
than most of the dregs...

22
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:10,441
...you find onboard here.

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,821
You have any pets?

24
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,449
Just my next-door neighbor.

25
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,829
Well...

26
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,329
...you are missing out
on a relationship...

27
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:24,867
...that could enrich your life in ways
that you never even thought possible.

28
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:28,200
How about picking up their--?
You know.

29
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:30,273
You find that enriching?

30
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:35,467
-What's the matter?
-Oh, I’m feeling a bit...

31
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,122
...queasy.

32
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:41,255
Sir, we're gonna make
an emergency landing in Chicago...

33
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,243
...and get you to a hospital.

34
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:45,698
My dog.

35
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,276
What about my dog?

36
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:48,779
You have a dog?

37
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,796
Do you know anyone
on the plane, Mr. Palone?

38
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:58,052
Jerry.

39
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,011
How you feeling?

40
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:02,791
Would you take care of Farfel?

41
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,031
Farfel?

42
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:08,012
It's his dog. We're landing in
Chicago to get him to a hospital.

43
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,785
-Could you take his dog to New York?
-The dog?

44
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:14,693
-The dog?
-I’m sure it's only for a day or two.

45
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:16,778
But, you know--
What if, you know...?

46
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:19,331
Give me your address
and phone number. I’ll call you.

47
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:21,284
The dog?

48
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:26,989
Let go, Farfel.

49
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:28,809
Let go. Give me that.

50
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:32,040
Give me that sneaker,
you stupid idiot.

51
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,174
Shut up!

52
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,385
So, what would you do?

53
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:40,268
It’s only been three days.
I’m sure he's gonna call.

54
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:43,524
Stop it! Shut up!

55
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:47,657
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I’m dealing with?

56
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,645
I got a wild animal in the house.

57
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:53,288
He'd deranged. Maybe he's got
rabies. I can get lockjaw.

58
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:56,746
-lf only.
-Look at this place.

59
00:02:57,936 --> 00:02:59,365
He's going everywhere.

60
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:02,733
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.

61
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,198
This will be my first night out
since I got back.

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,295
Hey, when you walk him, do you...?

63
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,315
Do I what?

64
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,359
Do you pick it up?

65
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,034
Yes, I pick it up.

66
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,470
-You pick it up?
-Well, you have to.

67
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:22,383
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.

68
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,408
Shut up!

69
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:28,748
Shut up, Farfel! Stop it!

70
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,342
I don't know what to do.

71
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,361
What if I take it to the pound,
then the guy shows up?

72
00:03:33,522 --> 00:03:35,943
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.

73
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:39,180
No, I tried. They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.

74
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:41,517
-No, milk.
-I’m telling you. The guy's a drunk.

75
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:43,625
He's probably on a bender.

76
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,312
What is a bender anyhow?

77
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:49,745
I don't know. They drink and they
bend things at the bar. I don't know.

78
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:53,583
I can't believe he hasn't called.

79
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:55,274
Two hundred seats on a plane...

80
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:58,890
...I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack
and his dog Cujo.

81
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,317
Shut up!

82
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,818
One more day,
and you are pound-bound!

83
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:07,337
Hey, I’m sorry. I can't
watch the dog tonight.

84
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,482
-Why?
-We're going to the movies.

85
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:11,277
We're gonna see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

86
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,419
I can't. I gotta get this Ellen
out of my life.

87
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,206
-You're breaking up?
-Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,641
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.

89
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:21,106
You know some people
you worry about whether or not...

90
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:24,367
...you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I’m looking forward to it.

91
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,940
Boy, I’d like to get it on video.

92
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,955
Watch it in slow motion
and freeze-frame it.

93
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,962
Kramer, I don't know how you
lasted as long as you did.

94
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,471
You didn't like her?

95
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:37,971
lf you could see her personality...

96
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:40,304
...it'd be like one of the
Elephant Man exhibits...

97
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,120
...where they pull off the sheet
and everyone gasps.

98
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,067
I can't believe someone
hasn't killed her yet.

99
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,914
How come you never said anything?

100
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:50,671
You can't tell someone how you feel
about their girlfriend...

101
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:52,593
-...till after they stop--
-I tell you.

102
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,863
You. I’m talking about people.

103
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,513
Are we still going
to the movies tonight?

104
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,678
No, I can't. I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.

105
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,403
-Just me and George?
-Sure.

106
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:05,842
But we need you.

107
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,599
What do you need me for?

108
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:10,480
Because.

109
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:14,957
-Yeah?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

110
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:18,452
Because I relate to George
through you.

111
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:20,175
We're more like...

112
00:05:20,343 --> 00:05:24,140
...friends-in-law. Besides, we said
we'd see <i>Prognosis Negative</i> together.

113
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,350
Can't you put some newspapers
down or something?

114
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,131
No, I can't trust him. He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.

115
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:33,264
That's right, Farfel,
I’m talking about you!

116
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,400
Just me and George alone?

117
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:41,645
Let's go, people. Let's go.
It’s <i>Prognosis Negative</i> time.

118
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:43,501
I can't go.

119
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:46,863
-You can't go? Why not?
-Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

120
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:50,421
-I thought Kramer was watching him.
-He's breaking up with his girlfriend.

121
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,471
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.

122
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,640
No, I don't want that smell
in the house.

123
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:57,045
-You spritz a little Lysol on it--
-No.

124
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,702
It’s like BO and cologne.

125
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:03,029
They combine forces into some kind
of strange mutant funk.

126
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:04,437
So we're not going?

127
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,161
Nah. You two go.

128
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:11,829
You still wanna go?

129
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,639
Do you?

130
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:16,399
lf you want.

131
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,032
-It’s-- It’s up to you.
-Go ahead.

132
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,979
Well, I really wanted to see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i> with Jerry.

133
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,601
You wanna see <i>Ponce de Leon</i>?

134
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,876
<i>Ponce de Leon</i>?

135
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,640
Okay.

136
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:34,770
-You sure you don't wanna go?
-I want to, but I can't.

137
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,011
Oh! I tell you what.

138
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:40,212
How about if I come back here first
and I clean everything up?

139
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,062
And I open up the windows,
and if you're still not satisfied...

140
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:46,194
-...we switch apartments for the night.
-No.

141
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,912
-What about this--?
-Forget it.

142
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,082
Go ahead. You'll have a good time.

143
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,033
-I know. It’s not that.
-I just want you to go.

144
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,427
Well, thank you very much.

145
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,392
I’m telling you, one more day,
stink breath!

146
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:03,953
On my block, a lot of people
walk their dogs...

147
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,506
...and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags...

148
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,393
...which to me is just
the lowest function of human life.

149
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,069
lf aliens are watching this
through telescopes...

150
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:17,084
...they're gonna think the dogs
are the leaders.

151
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,410
lf you see two life forms,
one of them is making a poop...

152
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,508
...the other one's carrying it for him....

153
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,998
Who would you assume
is in charge?

154
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:35,896
So how long did you live there?

155
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,236
About three years.

156
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,876
That's pretty long.

157
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,900
-It’s not that long, really.
-Yeah.

158
00:07:49,374 --> 00:07:50,935
-Do you--?
-So--

159
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:55,769
-And then you came here.
-Yeah.

160
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,822
So I’ve been here about six years.

161
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,551
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90...

162
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:08,955
...'<i>9</i>1 .

163
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,899
Yep.

164
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,340
Bad dog.

165
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:14,713
Bad dog!

166
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,440
You go outside!

167
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,495
Outside!

168
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:21,022
What do you want from me? Tell me.

169
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,126
Money? You want money?

170
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,954
I’ll give you money. How much?

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,276
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.

172
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,993
Why don't you do something
with your life?

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,470
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

174
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:39,958
You're just taking up space!

175
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:44,213
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

176
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,095
Wouldn't respect myself.

177
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,614
I like herbal tea.

178
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,068
Chamomile's good.

179
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:59,200
Lemon Lift.

180
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:03,552
Almond Pleasure.

181
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:19,674
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

182
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,445
-Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
-Yeah.

183
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:27,906
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

184
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,652
Jerry doesn't know
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

185
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,202
-You don't tell him?
-No.

186
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,608
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.

187
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:38,658
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.

188
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,438
He walks around going,
''God, I feel great!''

189
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,435
-You don't tell him?
-No.

190
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,279
-That is so funny.
-I know.

191
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,042
Have you ever seen him throw up?

192
00:09:55,268 --> 00:09:56,675
Please!

193
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:59,514
Please!

194
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:02,237
I take it all back!

195
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:04,958
Everything. I take it all back!
Every word!

196
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:07,034
I love you!

197
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,698
I love you!

198
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:14,051
I can't live without you!
I’ll do anything!

199
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,837
That's right. Gavin Palone.

200
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,590
What? You're sure?

201
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:24,252
He was released on Monday?

202
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,396
Last Monday?

203
00:10:27,237 --> 00:10:29,692
Did he leave a phone number
or address?

204
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,035
Unbelievable.

205
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:35,293
Well, thank you. Thanks.
Thanks very much.

206
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:39,421
That's it, Farfel. Party's over.

207
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,325
Start packing up your little squeeze
toys, buddy boy. You're checking out.

208
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,726
It was weird because George
and I get along so great...

209
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:52,097
...in so many situations...

210
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,783
...but this was the first time
we went one-on-one.

211
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:57,766
One-on-one's a whole
different game. Can't pass off.

212
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:02,148
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable
was when we were making fun of you.

213
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,087
Hello. Boy George, about time.

214
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:10,947
Beautiful. How soon?

215
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,638
Okay, here's the plan:

216
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:16,637
We take the dog to the pound,
we go right to the movies.

217
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:19,142
Right. You, me and Elaine.

218
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:21,444
Yes, all three of us.

219
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:24,384
I am going.

220
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,887
Okay, see you in five minutes.

221
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,066
-What?
-Do you have to?

222
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:39,015
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.

223
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:41,087
I like dogs.

224
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:43,428
I’m not sure this is a dog.

225
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,466
You know the guy might have
just lost your number.

226
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,935
I’m in the book,
and I have a machine.

227
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:52,446
Jerry, do you know what they do
to dogs at the pound?

228
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:55,967
They keep them there for a week.
lf nobody claims them, they kill them.

229
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:57,447
Really?

230
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,334
How late are they open?

231
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,786
-What?
-What is it?

232
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,609
I went back with Ellen.

233
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:12,226
-That's great.
-Great.

234
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,297
-Terrific.
-Yeah.

235
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,474
I really think you guys
are good together.

236
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:21,571
Yes. She understands you,
and she is not demanding.

237
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:25,514
Do you think that I forgot
what you two said about her?

238
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:28,130
-We're just trying to be supportive.
-Yes.

239
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,055
-We knew you were upset--
-From now on...

240
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,936
...when we pass each other,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

241
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,067
Oh, Kramer. We didn't mean it.

242
00:12:36,235 --> 00:12:38,886
-What are you doing?
-I’m getting my pot.

243
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,049
-Kramer, we like her.
-Kramer....

244
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,476
What did we say that was so bad?

245
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:51,623
I believe I referred to her personality
as a potential science exhibit.

246
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,822
I said, ''How come
no one's killed her?''

247
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,087
-Well.
-Well.

248
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,977
Probably shouldn't have
said anything.

249
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,726
I mean, everybody knows
the first breakup never takes.

250
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:08,809
-Yeah?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

251
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,751
Great. Okay, Farfel,
put your shoes on.

252
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:19,112
Jerry, can't you just give it
one more day?

253
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,799
-It’s not his fault.
-It’s not my dog.

254
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,820
I don't know where
this booze hound is.

255
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,052
All right, I tell you what.

256
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,635
How about if you and George
go to the movies...

257
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:31,333
...and I stay here
and watch the dog?

258
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,991
I can't let you do that.
What about <i>Prognosis Negative</i>?

259
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:36,068
We'll see it Sunday.

260
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,038
Tonight's the night, right?
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

261
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,792
I’m not going.
I’m gonna watch the dog.

262
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:45,035
-What does this mean?
-Well...

263
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,422
...we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see <i>Ponce de Leon</i>.

264
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,486
What is with this dog? I thought
we were taking it to the pound.

265
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:54,281
She talked me into one more day.

266
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,073
Talk. I’m going to the bathroom.

267
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,661
Jerry, how long are you
gonna be in there?

268
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:02,511
I don't know, regular human time.

269
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:05,061
Why don't you wait
and go at the movies?

270
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,870
-Why shouldn't I go here?
-Well, you know.

271
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,814
Sometimes it's good to get there
and make sure you get seats...

272
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,406
...and then go to the bathroom.

273
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,715
-And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
-Yeah.

274
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:21,577
Oh, yeah, George. Urinals are fun.

275
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:25,286
-Can I go?
-Hey, go.

276
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,141
-Who's stopping you?
-What, are you doing me a favor?

277
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:32,011
Like we care if you go
to the bathroom.

278
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,721
-How's it going?
-Good.

279
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:43,851
-You?
-Things are good.

280
00:14:57,714 --> 00:15:00,813
-Boy, he takes such a long time.
-I know.

281
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:04,074
You know what he does
in there? He gargles.

282
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:06,065
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?

283
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:08,234
Yeah, he does it
like six times a day.

284
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:10,994
-How come we never hear him?
-Because he does it quiet.

285
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:14,024
He does it quiet. Lookit--
Just like this. Watch.

286
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:22,511
Wait, wait. Did you ever
see him throw up?

287
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,611
We talked about that already.

288
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,948
I have nothing to say
to anybody anymore.

289
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,833
I’m so uninteresting.

290
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:36,458
I’m think I’m out of conversation.

291
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,121
So why do you call me
six times a day?

292
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,779
All I know about is sports. That's it.

293
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,079
No matter how depressed,
I can always read sports.

294
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,831
I could read the sports section
if my hair was on fire.

295
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:50,671
You know what,
<i>Ponce de Leon</i> is sold out.

296
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:54,515
It is. Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?

297
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:56,750
Nothing except <i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

298
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:00,436
Boy, I know she really wants
to see that with me.

299
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,223
Give me that jacket, mud face.

300
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:04,178
This is not Seinfeld
you're dealing with.

301
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:07,309
When I get through with you,
you'll be begging to go to the pound.

302
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:11,155
Shut up.

303
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,332
Shut up!

304
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,954
Hello?

305
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:19,084
No. Who's calling?

306
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:24,694
Oh, my God. The dog guy.

307
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,962
Well, where have you been?

308
00:16:27,702 --> 00:16:30,158
Yeah? Well, you better pick up
your dog tonight...

309
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,466
...or he has humped his last leg.

310
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,965
I could understand if there was
something else playing...

311
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:39,924
...but it's this or nothing.

312
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,994
-I don't know what to do.
-What is this saving movies thing?

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,527
-Something's playing, you go.
-I know. I know.

314
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:46,997
So we're gonna do nothing now?

315
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,785
-This is crazy.
-It is kind of silly.

316
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:51,341
-Of course it is.
-I mean, it's just a movie--

317
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,163
-Exactly.
-It’s not like she's in the movie.

318
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:55,539
Right.

319
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:58,192
We're supposed to ruin the night
because she wants to see it?

320
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:00,051
lf I could have seen it
with her, fine.

321
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:02,606
But I can't control these
circumstances and schedules...

322
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:05,165
-...and people's availabilities.
-She'll still see it.

323
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:08,087
-You're not stopping her--
-How does sitting next to a person...

324
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,158
...in a movie theater
increase the enjoyment?

325
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,304
You can't talk during a movie.

326
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:15,796
This is stupid. Come on.

327
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:17,368
-Let's just go.
-Good.

328
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:20,503
-Saving movies.
-Ridiculous.

329
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,120
Two for <i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

330
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,272
-I’m in big trouble.
-Oh, you're dead.

331
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,075
Bell's Palsy.

332
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:37,136
The entire side of--
Of my face...

333
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,510
...was paralyzed.

334
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,267
Farfel.

335
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:45,200
You know, I couldn't-- I couldn't--
I couldn't even feed myself.

336
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,639
I was completely incapacitated.

337
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,715
Quiet, Farfel!

338
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,127
-Farfel.
-It’s interesting...

339
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,785
...because I called the hospital...

340
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,864
...and they said you were
released on Monday.

341
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,680
Yes, that's true...

342
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:03,154
...but then, see, I was taken
to the Bell's Palsy Center.

343
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,843
In-- In Rockville.

344
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:08,597
Absolutely first--
First-rate facility.

345
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:11,447
Top-- Top-notch physicians.

346
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,321
Hey, come on. Come on.
Get off me.

347
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,794
He won't hurt you. He's just playing.

348
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,579
Now you keep that mutt
away from me.

349
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:22,098
Mutt? I’ll wager his parents
are more pure than yours.

350
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,950
Kramer, are you coming?

351
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,800
-Oh, hi, Ellen.
-Get in here.

352
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,844
Listen, it's been a pleasure
taking care of your dog for a week...

353
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,892
...but if you don't mind....

354
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:40,982
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask
if you can come and visit him...

355
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:42,840
...before the month is out.

356
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:47,315
Prediction: I never see you
or him again for the rest of my life.

357
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,551
We made plans.

358
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:56,794
Why don't we just rent a movie?

359
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,642
I thought you wanted to see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

360
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:04,760
No. It’s supposed to be
really bad. Really bad.

361
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,644
I mean, it's long. There's no story.

362
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:12,149
It’s so unbelievably boring--
I heard. l....

363
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,477
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

364
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,713
Well, George told me
the whole story, line for line.

365
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:22,327
I almost feel like I’ve seen it already
and walked out on it.

366
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,619
Wait. George saw the movie? I saw
him yesterday. He didn't mention it.

367
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,924
You and George got together?

368
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:32,503
Yeah. I wanted to talk about how
we had nothing to talk about.

369
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:35,546
Hello.

370
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:36,989
Hi, hi, hi.

371
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:38,362
What's up?

372
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:40,022
Well, you were right.

373
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,102
-About what?
-Ellen.

374
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,826
We broke up again.

375
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,446
Too bad.

376
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:50,235
I thought she was the one.

377
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,592
I’ll bring back the pot.

378
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,154
Okay, come on. It’s movie time.

379
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,426
-Hey, what are you gonna see?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

380
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,284
-That's supposed to be great.
-It’s not.

381
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,384
-Well, how do you know?
-I have an instinct for these things.

382
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:07,002
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.

383
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,923
We used to let him out of his cage...

384
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,545
...and he would fly around.
And my mother had built--

385
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,910
One entire wall of our living room
was mirrored...

386
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,082
...she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

387
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,422
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

388
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,822
The mirror makes it seem like
you have another room.

389
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,393
Who walks up
to a mirror and goes:

390
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:26,489
''Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there.

391
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,918
There's a guy in there,
looks just like me''?

392
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:35,068
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out. He flies around.

393
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,584
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

394
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:42,050
I’d always think, even if he thinks
the mirror is another room...

395
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:46,625
...why doesn't he at least try and
avoid hitting the other parakeet?
