1
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,162
I bought the Ginsu knife.

2
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:06,714
I did buy the Ginsu knife.

3
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,145
I know, you can't believe it,
but I did, I swear. I saw it.

4
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:11,716
It was late, I’m watching...

5
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:15,009
...and it started making sense to me.
I’m thinking:

6
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:18,077
''Yeah, cut through the shoe,
cut through the can, yeah.

7
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:19,458
Yeah, I want that.''

8
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,177
So I called up the number
on the screen, you know...

9
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:25,345
...and I said, ''I’d like to order
the Ginsu knife.''

10
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:27,882
And the lady went, ''Really?''

11
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:30,283
I mean, even the Ginsu people
have given up.

12
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:32,168
It's really so sad, you know.

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,109
I guess, to be honest, if you need
a knife that can cut through a shoe...

14
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,647
...perhaps you're not buying the
highest grade of meat available.

15
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:45,095
Maybe you ought to think about not
getting the ''hoof cut'' once in a while.

16
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:53,459
<i>What is it about sleep</i>
<i>that makes you so thirsty?</i>

17
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:55,565
<i>Do dreams require liquid?</i>

18
00:00:55,735 --> 00:00:59,031
<i>It's not like I'm running a marathon,</i>
<i>I'm just lying there.</i>

19
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,173
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>Why is the door open?</i>

20
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:08,438
-Kramer, what are you doing here?!
-Jerry, now calm down. It’s okay.

21
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,262
-Oh, God.
-I’m sorry.

22
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:12,185
I didn't want to wake you up.

23
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,292
I was watching
<i>Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo</i>...

24
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:17,529
...and l-- You know, I wanted
to get some popcorn...

25
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,671
...so I used the spare keys
that you gave me...

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,816
...to come in to get your popper.

27
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,191
-You scared me!
-It’s just me.

28
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:28,033
-That's enough!
-Yeah, okay. Forgot the popper.

29
00:01:33,414 --> 00:01:35,520
It’s not broken.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,958
Come on.

31
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:49,955
Kramer!

32
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,402
What are you doing?

33
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:52,842
What does it look like? What?

34
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,112
Get out of the bathroom. I gotta go!

35
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,167
All right, all right.

36
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:00,072
-Come on!
-All right.

37
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:04,556
-Move it, move it! Get going!
-Well, my drain's all clogged up.

38
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:08,753
-Is that my towel?
-Yes.

39
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:14,004
I’m really happy the movie
was sold out.

40
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,207
You ever pretend there's
murderers chasing you...

41
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,799
...and see how fast you can
get into your apartment?

42
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:21,523
I’m from Wichita.

43
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,918
-There he is!
-Hurry, Jerry, he's coming.

44
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,248
-He's coming. The murderers!
-Hurry. Hurry, he's coming. Hurry!

45
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:30,323
Oh, Jerry.

46
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,941
Boy, that was close.

47
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,568
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

48
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:42,238
-You were so fast with those keys.
-Well....

49
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,543
-Beautiful.
-Kramer!

50
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,117
What the hell are you doing here?

51
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:53,345
Hey, Jerry, how are you? I thought
you were going to the movies.

52
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:54,722
That's it, hand them over.

53
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,198
-What?
-You know what. The keys.

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,735
You've lost your key privileges.

55
00:02:57,897 --> 00:02:59,141
-Oh, come on.
-No ''come on.''

56
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,543
-I thought you went to the movie.
-It was sold out.

57
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,431
How was I to know
it would be sold out?

58
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:05,090
-That's the point.
-What point?

59
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,562
-Just give me the keys.
-Just give me another chance.

60
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:09,035
-Don't ask me.
-I’m asking you.

61
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:10,573
-I’m telling you.
-You're joking.

62
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:12,261
-I’m serious.
-It won't happen again.

63
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,090
-It will. Give me the keys.
-No.

64
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,849
-Let go.
-You let go. Come on, Jerry.

65
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:18,669
Now, stop it. Come on, Kramer.

66
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,992
Oh, great! Okay, all right.

67
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:23,920
Fine, you go ahead. Take the keys.

68
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,710
But you're gonna regret this.

69
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:27,885
All right, yeah.

70
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,782
Goochie.

71
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,655
-So put them in a safe place.
-I will.

72
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,541
-Where?
-I don't know.

73
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:40,950
I’ll hide them.

74
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:43,025
-So is Kramer upset?
-I think so.

75
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,586
I mean, he's acting really weird lately.
He's different.

76
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,475
-Just give him the keys back.
-No, I can't.

77
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,279
Is that Kramer?

78
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,735
-Who's there?
-Kramer.

79
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,416
Hey. Oh, hi. Oh, you got the....

80
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:05,530
-No, I am not--
-No, no, it's okay. It’s okay.

81
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,157
I don't care about the keys.
It’s my fault.

82
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,749
No, I gave the keys away
with my stupidity.

83
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,308
I broke the covenant of the keys.

84
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,758
-Jerry, give him the keys back.
-Elaine.

85
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,457
-Here.
-What are you doing?

86
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,537
-I’m giving him the keys.
-Those are my keys.

87
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:24,261
-Let go! Jerry! No!
-Elaine. Come on.

88
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,113
Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want the keys back.

89
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,286
No, I’m glad the way
things turned out.

90
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:31,310
I was clinging to those keys, man...

91
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,255
...like a branch on the banks
of a raging river...

92
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,847
...and now I have let go.

93
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,144
And I’m free to go with the current...

94
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:40,974
...to float.

95
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,515
-And I thank you.
-Take the keys.

96
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:44,717
-I don't want them.
-I want you to have them.

97
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,274
-I don't want them! I can't.
-Come on. Take them!

98
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:50,131
-No!
-Okay.

99
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:51,757
Now, one more thing.

100
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:53,554
I would like my keys back.

101
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:56,370
-Your spare set?
-Yeah, that's right.

102
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:58,426
-You want them back?
-Yeah, yeah...

103
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,114
...I think it would be for the best.

104
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:17,623
Gee, Kramer, l....

105
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:19,005
I don't know what to say.

106
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:22,721
Say yes.

107
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:25,090
Yes, George, yes.

108
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,714
-Yes?
-Yes.

109
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,452
Should I give you my keys?
Is that the transaction, trading keys?

110
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:35,006
-Because Elaine has my keys.
-You can get them back.

111
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:37,095
I suppose I could.

112
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,999
Because you see, George,
having the keys to Jerry's apartment...

113
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:44,581
...that kept me in a fantasy world.

114
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:48,009
Every time I went over to his house,
it was like I was on vacation.

115
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,023
Better food, better view, better TV.

116
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,007
Cleaner. Oh, much cleaner.

117
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,407
That became my reality.

118
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,095
I ignored the squalor
in my own life...

119
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,294
...because I’m looking at life, you see,
through Jerry's eyes.

120
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,117
I was living in twilight, George.

121
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:07,574
Living in the shadows,
living in the darkness...

122
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,164
...like you.

123
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:13,555
-Me?
-Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,544
I can barely see you, George.

125
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,765
All right, stop it, Kramer.
You're freaking me out.

126
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,290
Hi. Are you ready to order?

127
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,218
-Yeah. What's the--?
-No, not yet.

128
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,390
Excuse me.

129
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,701
Do you ever yearn?

130
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,381
Yearn? Do I yearn?

131
00:06:37,027 --> 00:06:38,522
-I yearn.
-You yearn?

132
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,383
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn.

133
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:44,674
Often I sit and yearn.

134
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:47,204
Have you yearned?

135
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:50,406
Well, not recently.

136
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:53,055
I craved.

137
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:55,779
I crave all the time.
Constant craving.

138
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,021
But I haven't yearned.

139
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:02,533
-Look at you.
-Oh, Kramer, don't start.

140
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,742
No, no. You're wasting your life.

141
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,759
I am not.
What you call wasting, I call living.

142
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,085
-I’m living my life.
-Okay, like what? No, tell me.

143
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:13,137
-Do you have a job?
-No.

144
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,208
-You got money?
-No.

145
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,202
Do you have a woman?

146
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:19,146
No.

147
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:20,691
Do you have any prospects?

148
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,635
No.

149
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,101
You got anything on the horizon?

150
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,994
No.

151
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:34,906
-You have any action at all?
-No.

152
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:38,451
Do you have any conceivable reason
for even getting up in the morning?

153
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:42,395
I like to get the <i>Daily News</i>.

154
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,741
George, it's time for us
to grow up and be men...

155
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:49,978
-...not little boys.
-Why?

156
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:52,186
I’m going to California.
You know, I got the bug.

157
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:54,527
Yeah, I think I got
a touch of something too.

158
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,507
No, the acting bug. Ever since
I was in that Woody Allen movie.

159
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,767
''These pretzels
are making me thirsty''?

160
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,909
That was one line. You got fired.

161
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,496
I know, I know.
But, man, I never felt so alive.

162
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:09,699
-Now, you coming with me?
-No, I’m not.

163
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,808
All right. Suit yourself.

164
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:13,539
But let's keep this between us.

165
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:15,747
We're key brothers now.

166
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,310
You're not really gonna go
to California, are you?

167
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:21,478
Up here, I’m already gone.

168
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,775
He gave me his spare keys...

169
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,402
...and now he wants my keys,
so I need mine back from you.

170
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,710
Because you have his keys?
Why does he need yours?

171
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,138
I don't know, he said
he wants to be my key brother.

172
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,051
-That's ridiculous.
-That's Kramer.

173
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,826
I’ll give you back your spare keys,
but now I want mine back.

174
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,841
What for?

175
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,562
-Because I’ll give them to Jerry.
-Jerry? Why?

176
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,097
-Because he gave me his.
-So what?

177
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,186
So if he has my keys,
I should have his.

178
00:08:55,356 --> 00:08:56,818
I don't see why if you have his...

179
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:59,324
-...he should have yours.
-I just said the same thing.

180
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:02,008
-What?
-What?

181
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,314
I’ll give you my keys,
but I don't have them here.

182
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,975
Can I have mine to give to Kramer?

183
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:08,987
Yeah, okay, I’ll go get them.

184
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:14,211
What are you doing?
Would you just put that down?

185
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,740
I gotta get some new friends.

186
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,904
-Did you bring the keys?
-Yes.

187
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,788
But I still don't feel right about
letting you into Kramer's.

188
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,261
This could be an emergency.

189
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:27,687
-You shouldn't have taken his keys.
-I tried to give them back.

190
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:30,304
-How'd the Mets do?
-They lost.

191
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,516
-Kramer!
-Come on, open it up.

192
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,471
-Kramer?
-Hello, boys.

193
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,346
-Hello, Newman.
-Are you looking for someone?

194
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,552
Don't play coy with me,
I’m not in the mood.

195
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:46,827
Coy? I’m not being coy.

196
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:48,303
-Is he being coy?
-Yeah, coy.

197
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,151
You're being coy.
Now, where's Kramer, Newman?

198
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:54,131
-Who?
-Listen, Tiny...

199
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,204
...I wanna know where Kramer is,
and I wanna know now!

200
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,789
-Hit me, Seinfeld, I got witnesses.
-Turn around, George.

201
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,137
-Sure.
-George?

202
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:03,606
Tell me where Kramer is
or we'll do this the hard way!

203
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:05,362
-Help! Help!
-Where's Kramer?

204
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:06,904
-Help!
-What's going on?

205
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,653
-They're gonna beat me up.
-No, we're not.

206
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,543
We're trying to find Kramer.

207
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,164
You want to know what happened
to Kramer? I’ll tell you.

208
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,089
He was ticked off about the keys.

209
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,938
Yeah, that's right, about the keys.

210
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,628
-Thought he got a bad rap.
-Bad rap?

211
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,101
-Yeah, from you.
-Me?

212
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,982
You heard me. So he packed a grip
and he split for the coast.

213
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:28,001
La-la land. L.A.

214
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:30,204
L.A.?

215
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,421
I never should have taken
his keys away.

216
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,791
He drove me to it, I had no choice.

217
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,711
He wouldn't take them back.

218
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,567
Elaine, you saw it. Remember?

219
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,286
I said, ''Take the keys back.''
He wouldn't do anything.

220
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,079
You saw it. Didn't you see it?

221
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:18,069
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

222
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:20,501
I mean, it was complete bull--
But I saw.

223
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,072
Huh?

224
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,135
-What?
-No, what'd you say?

225
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:28,024
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

226
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,865
Oh, you didn't see it?

227
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,972
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it.

228
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:37,110
-I saw it. Yep.
-I heard you say something there.

229
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,077
-I didn't say anything.
-I’m calling Kramer's mother.

230
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:47,482
I don't know what you said,
but it was something.

231
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,913
I heard something.

232
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,955
Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer?

233
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:55,935
Mrs. Kramer?

234
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,721
Could you turn the music down?

235
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,605
Could you turn the music down?

236
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:05,247
-Ask her about Kramer.
-She's drunk out of her mind.

237
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:26,027
Oh, my keys.

238
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,546
This is perfect.

239
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:36,719
Elaine, are you there?

240
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:40,752
It’s me. I’m locked out.
I need my spare keys. Where are you?

241
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,929
I’m at the coffee shop.

242
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:49,498
Hey! You ever been in an accident?

243
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,450
About 5 years ago.

244
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:54,712
I was going down this very road.

245
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:59,551
Same time of day, going about
the same speed I’m going now.

246
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,601
There was a rock in the road.

247
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:03,650
It couldn't have been
more than a pebble.

248
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,851
Never really saw it.

249
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,396
Lost control of the bike,
went flying about a hundred feet.

250
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:12,638
Came down right on my head.

251
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,498
Cracked it wide open.

252
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:18,658
Blood and stuff just splattered
all over the road there.

253
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,767
Broke every bone in my face.

254
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,128
You know, when they found me...

255
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,366
...my eyes were hanging out
of their sockets.

256
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:30,536
Yeah, they pronounced me dead
at the scene.

257
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:34,631
Was in a coma for....
Well, they told me about a year.

258
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,550
Said I’d be a vegetable for life.

259
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:40,397
Yeah, but I showed them.

260
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:43,856
Of course, since then,
I always wear a helmet.

261
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,708
Lean.

262
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,369
Lean!

263
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,800
Georgie boy.

264
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,270
Way to come through with the keys.

265
00:13:57,432 --> 00:14:00,500
-Sit down, I’m buying you dinner.
-Look...

266
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,080
...I just don't feel right about
letting you into Elaine's apartment.

267
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,185
Don't feel right?
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,805
I let you into Kramer's.
Now you wanna go into Elaine's.

269
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,495
She entrusted me with her keys.
How can I just let you in?

270
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,093
What is the big deal?

271
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,174
Just because you have
someone's spare keys...

272
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:18,938
...doesn't entitle you to break in.

273
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,961
That's the reason you took
Kramer's keys.

274
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,097
You're not even supposed to have
Elaine's keys.

275
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:26,050
You're supposed to give them to her
so she can give them to me.

276
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,253
So technically, those are my keys.

277
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,331
lf you'd never taken your keys
from Kramer...

278
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,128
...he never would have given
his to me.

279
00:14:32,294 --> 00:14:35,143
In which case, I wouldn't have
had to take mine back from her.

280
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,827
-I want those keys.
-No can do.

281
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:39,882
-George, I want these.
-Stop it, let go.

282
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,825
-George, I don't want to get physical.
-You wanna fight?

283
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,264
-Wanna fight?
-I’ll fight you!

284
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:45,890
-Let's go.
-Nothing in the face!

285
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,719
-Okay.
-All right.

286
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,702
And then the evil ogre
took back the magical keys...

287
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,392
...from the handsome young prince.

288
00:14:58,802 --> 00:15:01,323
Oh, no. He didn't
take back the keys.

289
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:03,182
-No way.
-Yes.

290
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:05,072
And then the handsome
young prince...

291
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,053
...was cast out
into the cruel, cruel world.

292
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,840
Oh, man, what a bummer.

293
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:12,243
-That ogre dude is pretty cold, huh?
-He's cold.

294
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:13,870
Let me tell you something, Kramer.

295
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,271
lf that ogre dude pulled
that crap on me...

296
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:18,644
-...I’d stab him!
-Wait.

297
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,312
I’d cut him in half!

298
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:22,996
I’d gut him like a fish, man!

299
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:26,231
-That's what I’d do.
-Yeah, yeah. That'd be funny.

300
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:27,924
Hey, you can drop me here.

301
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,469
Hey, what's the rush, man?

302
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,966
-Well, I got to be going now.
-Hey, Kramer...

303
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:33,983
...have you ever killed a man?

304
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:35,323
What do you think?

305
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:39,516
You think these hands have been
soaking in Ivory Liquid, huh?

306
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:42,204
Oh, don't leave, Kramer.
Stay with us.

307
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,576
Oh, you know so much
about the world. We need you.

308
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,163
-Please, Kramer.
-Please, Kramer.

309
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,861
Well, now, Star Cloud--

310
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,656
-Okay, wait a minute.
-Please, Kramer.

311
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:53,923
-No, no, no.
-Please, Kramer.

312
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,608
See? You're avoiding
the middleman.

313
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:59,299
You'd give her her keys,
which she would give to me.

314
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:02,403
So instead of giving them to her,
you give them to me.

315
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:05,672
Unfortunately, when she gave
you yours, you didn't give her hers.

316
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,748
She'd give them to me
because she has mine.

317
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,774
Then I wouldn't have to ask you
for hers...

318
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,943
...so that I could get mine.

319
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:17,356
You're right. How did I miss that?

320
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,613
Maybe because it's a crock of sh--

321
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,621
-What's that?
-Nothing.

322
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,377
-I heard something.
-Didn't say anything.

323
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,136
So how long you been driving
this thing?

324
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,187
Going on four years.

325
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:44,886
Well, nothing's sexier than a woman
behind the wheel of a semi.

326
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:47,127
Nothing?

327
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:48,920
Well....

328
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:55,841
Listen to you.
You're quite the sweet talker.

329
00:16:56,002 --> 00:16:58,075
I always wanted to drive
the big rigs.

330
00:16:58,243 --> 00:17:01,375
I used to watch those commercials
during reruns of <i>Gomer Pyle</i>.

331
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,160
-You wanna give it a try?
-Really?

332
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,476
-Do you know how to double-clutch?
-Yeah.

333
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,261
-Well, come on.
-Wait a minute.

334
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:12,960
Wait.

335
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:19,243
Okay. All right.

336
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,696
They were in here.
I saw her put them in here.

337
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:36,525
Well, this is great.

338
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,546
-What do they look like?
-Like keys.

339
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,716
They look like keys, George.

340
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:43,700
They look exactly like keys.

341
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,733
''What do they look like?''

342
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:49,908
-They're obviously not here.
-They've got to be here.

343
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:54,963
Jerry, unless I pull down on this
statuette and a hidden wall opens up...

344
00:17:55,131 --> 00:17:57,466
...we have checked every square inch
of this apartment.

345
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:00,954
What is this?

346
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,461
-''<i>Murphy Brown</i>''?
-What?

347
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,862
-''By Elaine Benes''?
-What?

348
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,269
Elaine's writing a <i>Murphy Brown</i>?

349
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:12,632
-Let me see this.
-Wait a second.

350
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,428
-Let me just look at it.
-Wait.

351
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,793
-Give me half!
-All right, here!

352
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:21,084
Why didn't she tell us?

353
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:25,346
Elaine is writing a sitcom?

354
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:33,281
-You-- You weasels!
-What?

355
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:34,728
-What?
-How dare you!

356
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,714
-We hardly read anything.
-It was funny.

357
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,403
Who gave you permission
to come in...

358
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:40,133
...and just go through my things?

359
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,117
-You thought it was funny?
-Well, you know...

360
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:46,125
-...from what I saw--
-Well, it's just a first draft!

361
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:48,493
I was locked out.
I’m just trying to get my keys.

362
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,408
-Why did you let him in?
-He forced me to.

363
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,748
-I did not!
-Yes, you did!

364
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:56,461
-You, get out! Get out!
-Wait, I need my spare keys.

365
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,603
Oh, here's your damn keys.
You keep them.

366
00:18:58,773 --> 00:19:00,203
-I don't want them anymore.
-Good.

367
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,803
I want my keys back from you.

368
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,211
-I can't hold them?
-No, you can't be trusted.

369
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,383
All right, all right. Fine!

370
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:09,171
-And I don't want you to hold mine.
-Good, I won't!

371
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:10,516
Good, don't.

372
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,657
-Are these my keys?
-These aren't my keys.

373
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:15,283
-Whose are these?
-I don't know.

374
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,209
No, those are yours....

375
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:29,536
I just thought I could write it.

376
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:31,640
Is that something you wanna do?

377
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,567
I don't know.

378
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:36,766
Those writers make a lot of money.

379
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:40,064
What?

380
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:42,434
Let me tell you something
about show business.

381
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,053
-I can't believe it.
-It’s hard work.

382
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,192
You don't just write
a <i>Murphy Brown</i>.

383
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,915
You gotta watch the show,
get a sense of the characters...

384
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:52,709
...how they relate to each other.

385
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,625
Okay, can I just watch the show?

386
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:00,325
Oh, god, what an ass--

387
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,344
What did you say?

388
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:10,802
I didn't say anything.

389
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,189
I heard something.

390
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,034
Elaine, Elaine, it's Kramer!

391
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:19,857
Kramer's on <i>Murphy Brown</i>!

392
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:23,021
-Kramer's on <i>Murphy Brown</i>!
-Look, there he is!

393
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,363
He's sitting at the desk!

394
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,123
<i>Hi, I'm Murphy Brown.</i>

395
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:30,072
-<i>You must be my new secretary.</i>
-<i>Good morning, Miss Brown.</i>

396
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:33,105
-<i>And you are?</i>
-<i>I'm Steven Snell.</i>

397
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:34,902
-<i>Snell.</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

398
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,858
<i>Well, hello, Mr. Snell.</i>

399
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,298
<i>Steven.</i>

400
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,639
-<i>Steven.</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

401
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,629
<i>Are you familiar with this</i>
<i>computer system?</i>

402
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,662
<i>Oh, I'm familiar, yes.</i>

403
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:47,615
<i>Steven Snell, I know people...</i>

404
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,200
<i>...and I have a very good feeling</i>
<i>about you.</i>

405
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:52,194
Yes.

406
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,738
So I fly a lot. I was on a plane
the other day and I was wondering...

407
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:08,735
...are there keys to the plane?
Do they need keys to start the plane?

408
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:12,421
Maybe that's what those delays on the
ground are sometimes, at the gate.

409
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:14,661
Maybe the pilot's up in
the cockpit going:

410
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:16,684
''Oh, I don't believe this.

411
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:18,854
Oh, my God...

412
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:20,998
...I did it again.''

413
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,860
They tell you it's mechanical.

414
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,967
They don't want to come on
the PA system:

415
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,315
''Ladies and gentlemen...

416
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:29,002
...we're gonna be delayed here
a little while. l....

417
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:31,820
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.

418
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,738
I left the keys to the plane
in my apartment.''

419
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:37,390
You see technicians,
you think they're servicing it...

420
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,723
...but they're looking for the magnet
Hide-A-Key under the wing.

421
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:43,506
''Maybe he left it up there
somewhere.''
