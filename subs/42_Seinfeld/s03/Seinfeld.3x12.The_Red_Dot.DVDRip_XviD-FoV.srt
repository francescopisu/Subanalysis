1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,943
Every mall has a Hoffritz in it.

2
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:08,262
That's got to be a scary place
to work. I don't know how you feel.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,398
Do you want to stand there
having people going:

4
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:12,989
''I need knives.
I need more knives.

5
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:15,069
Do you have any bigger knives?

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,695
I’d like a bigger knife.
A big, long, sharp knife.

7
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:20,416
That's what I’m in the market for.
I like them really sharp.

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,438
Do you have one
with hooks and gouges...

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,218
...and blades
that are kind of serrated?

10
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:27,871
That's the kind of knife
I’m looking for.

11
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,655
I need one I can throw.
I need one I can hack away with.

12
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:32,995
Do you have anything like that?''

13
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:44,293
Like you know
what you're talking about.

14
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:45,634
Oh, no. You do?

15
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,934
Well, what do you think,
they put the statue on a giant raft...

16
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:51,943
...and a tugboat pulled it
all the way from France?

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,134
Think they brought it in pieces...

18
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,955
...and screwed it together
like a coffee table?

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,903
What's going on? It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

20
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,715
-Why'd France give that to us anyway?
-It was a gift.

21
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:05,539
Countries just exchange gifts
like that?

22
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:07,809
lf they like each other.

23
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:10,309
-There's Elaine.
-See that guy she's talking with?

24
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,709
-That's her new boyfriend.
-Really?

25
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,629
He works here in the office?

26
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:17,575
They're having a little fling,
so don't say anything to anyone.

27
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:22,214
Who am I going to tell, my mother?
Like I have nothing better to talk about.

28
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,034
You don't.

29
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,010
He's a recovering alcoholic.

30
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,151
-Really?
-He's been off the wagon two years.

31
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:33,155
-''Off the wagon''?
-I think it's ''off the wagon.''

32
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,934
I think it's ''on the wagon.''

33
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:39,138
Jerry, George,
what are you doing here?

34
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:41,093
What am I doing here?

35
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:46,591
My God! My watch!
You found my watch.

36
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:49,128
Keep your hands to yourself
if you know what's good for you.

37
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:51,458
-Where'd you find it?
-Under the sofa cushion.

38
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,234
-You stopped by just to give it to me?
-It’s your Christmas present.

39
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:59,715
-I thought I’d never find it.
-Today's your lucky day.

40
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,831
No, today is your lucky day.

41
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:04,836
-It would be my first one.
-You want to work here?

42
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,943
-What?
-Yeah. One of the readers just left.

43
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:09,022
There's a job opening.

44
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:10,949
Dick, this is Jerry.
And this is George.

45
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:13,350
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Is this the guy?

46
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:15,363
''The guy''?

47
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,585
-Dick.
-How can you just get it?

48
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:21,608
My boss said to find someone.
I’m in charge.

49
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:23,711
All you have to do is meet him.
Come on.

50
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,888
-No, come on. Hold my drink.
-Cranberry juice?

51
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:28,359
And vodka. Come on.

52
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,454
I got the cranberry juice.

53
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,956
So...

54
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,489
-...you're Jerry.
-So...

55
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:38,405
...I’m Jerry.

56
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:41,121
So have you ever done
this kind of work before?

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,406
Well, you know, book reports,
that kind of stuff.

58
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,061
-Who do you read?
-I like Mike Lupica.

59
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:55,688
Mike Lupica?

60
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,532
He's a sportswriter
for the <i>Daily News</i>.

61
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:01,632
-I find him very insightful.
-No, I mean authors.

62
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:06,692
Well...

63
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:10,338
...a lot of good ones.
Lot of good ones.

64
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,032
I don't even wanna
mention anybody...

65
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,503
...because I’m afraid I’m gonna
leave somebody out.

66
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,935
-Name a couple.
-Who do I like?

67
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:22,021
I like Art Vandalay.

68
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:26,145
-Art Vandalay?
-He's an obscure writer.

69
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,031
Beatnik, you know, from the village.

70
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:30,848
What's he written?

71
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:32,840
<i>Venetian Blinds</i>.

72
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:36,480
I got news for you.
I’m funnier than you are.

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,105
Why don't we get together New Year's,
watch some football?

74
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,663
-Where's my drink?
-There. So how'd it go?

75
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,688
I think he's impressed.

76
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:48,520
No, no, this is just cranberry juice.

77
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,049
I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

78
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,127
Dick?

79
00:03:56,586 --> 00:04:00,514
He can't drink. He's an alcoholic.
I told you to hold it.

80
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:03,431
I didn't know you meant hold it.
I thought you meant hold it.

81
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,620
One drink like that,
and he could fall right off the wagon.

82
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,248
Told you.

83
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,522
I never feel comfortable
in the women's department.

84
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:20,360
I feel like I’m just a little too close
to trying on a dress.

85
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,597
Do I really have to
buy her something?

86
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,439
The woman got you a job.
Least you could do is buy her a gift.

87
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,129
How about this?

88
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:31,081
-What is that, cashmere?
-Yeah. She loves cashmere.

89
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:32,585
Who doesn't like cashmere?

90
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:35,594
Find me one person that doesn't
like cashmere. It’s too expensive.

91
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,272
Wow, look at this.
It’s $85, marked down from 600.

92
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,854
-Excuse me, miss?
-Yes.

93
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:45,123
How come this sweater's only $85?

94
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,494
Oh, here. This is why.

95
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,922
-What? I don't see anything.
-See this red dot?

96
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,839
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, it's damaged.

97
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:54,945
It’s not really damaged.

98
00:04:55,115 --> 00:04:56,708
Wow. $85?

99
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,296
There's no exchanges on this.

100
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,120
-Think she'd care about the dot?
-It’s hard to say.

101
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,138
I don't think she'd notice.
Can you see it?

102
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,273
-Well, I can see it.
-But you know where it is.

103
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:10,534
-What do you want me to do, not look?
-Pretend you didn't know it was there.

104
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,423
-Can you see it?
-It’s hard to pretend...

105
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:15,489
-...because I know where it is.
-Can't you take an overview?

106
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,033
You want me to take an overview?

107
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,788
I see a cheap man
holding a sweater...

108
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:22,151
...trying to get away with something.
That's my overview.

109
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:29,254
-Yeah, so?
-He's acting very strangely.

110
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,558
I think he started drinking again.

111
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:34,277
-Oh, boy. Can you smell it?
-No, I can't smell it.

112
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:36,713
lf you can't smell it,
then he hasn't been drinking.

113
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:39,658
-You don't always smell from a drink.
-Yes, you do.

114
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,307
What about one drink?
Would you smell from one drink?

115
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,166
Yes, you would.

116
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:48,231
-I’ll prove it.
-How?

117
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:50,119
-Would you do me a favor?
-Okay.

118
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,672
Would you take a drink,
and let us smell you?

119
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,102
You can smell me without the drink.

120
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,795
No, no.

121
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:03,328
I suspect that this guy I’m seeing
might be drinking, but I can't smell it.

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,922
-Come on.
-Okay. Well, what am I drinking?

123
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:09,059
I got a bottle of Scotch my uncle
gave me. Hennigan's.

124
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:12,130
It’s been there two years.
I’ve been using it as a paint thinner.

125
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,786
All right.

126
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:27,368
-I don't smell anything.
-We're too close to the bottle.

127
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:31,302
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.</i>

128
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:34,883
-Come on up.
-That is damn good Scotch.

129
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:38,467
I could do a commercial
for this stuff.

130
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:44,321
Boy, that Hennigan
goes down smooth...

131
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,427
...and afterwards,
you don't even smell.

132
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,325
That's right, folks. I just had three
shots of Hennigan's, and I don't smell.

133
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,714
Imagine, you can walk around
drunk all day.

134
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:59,561
That's Hennigan's,
the no-smell, no-tell Scotch.

135
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,562
-Hello, everybody.
-Hey, George, come here.

136
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:06,146
I’m gonna tell you what I think.

137
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:08,836
I know you don't care what I think,
but I’m gonna tell you.

138
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,611
I think that you are terrific.

139
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,694
That's all.

140
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:18,819
Thank you.

141
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,818
-Hey, what's that?
-It’s an early Christmas present.

142
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,475
-A Christmas present?
-That's right.

143
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,238
-For who?
-For you.

144
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:29,547
Get out of here.

145
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,802
Say you got a big job interview
and you're nervous.

146
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,882
Throw back a couple of shots
of Hennigan's...

147
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:38,119
...and you'll be as loose as a goose
and ready to roll in no time.

148
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:41,220
And because it's odorless,
why, it'll be our little secret.

149
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,217
Kramer.

150
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,515
Yeah. That'll do.

151
00:07:50,797 --> 00:07:55,237
Oh, George, this is beautiful.
Is this cashmere?

152
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:59,147
-Of course it's cashmere.
-Oh, I love cashmere.

153
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:01,481
-Who doesn't?
-Oh, my God.

154
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,750
George, this must have
cost a fortune.

155
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,900
Money.

156
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,581
Jerry, how could you
let him spend so much?

157
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,178
I tried to stop him.

158
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,404
I couldn't. He just wants
to make people happy.

159
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:19,752
George, this is one of the nicest
things anyone has ever given me.

160
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,917
Good. Good. Listen, take it off.
You're gonna wear it out already.

161
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,874
It’s for special occasions, this thing.

162
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,862
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

163
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,304
-What?
-Listen, take it off.

164
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,575
I’m getting hot just looking at it.

165
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,197
What is this?
It’s like a red dot.

166
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:42,438
What? What red dot?
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,086
Jerry, come here for a second.
Do you see anything here?

168
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:48,456
I don't know.

169
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,507
I don't know.

170
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,314
-What don't you know?
-I don't know.

171
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,214
Well, do you see it, or don't you?

172
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,155
Say that again.

173
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,044
Do you see it, or don't you?

174
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:08,995
Do I see it or don't l?
That's the question.

175
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,384
Now, what did you ask me again?

176
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,635
You're still here?
You're a dynamo.

177
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:45,221
-I can't believe I get paid for this.
-God.

178
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,396
I’ll see you tomorrow.

179
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,097
-How you doing?
-Hello.

180
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:11,852
You had sex with the cleaning woman
on your desk?

181
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,505
Who are you?
How did you do that?

182
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:16,908
Hennigan's.

183
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:18,883
Hennigan's?

184
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:22,950
I was sitting there in the office,
and the cleaning woman comes in.

185
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,933
I’ve always been attracted
to cleaning women.

186
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,955
Cleaning women, chambermaids....

187
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:33,158
Yeah, chambermaids,
I’m attracted to them too.

188
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:35,815
-Why is that?
-It’s a woman in your room.

189
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,773
-So go ahead.
-So...

190
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:47,303
...she starts vacuuming,
back and forth, back and forth...

191
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:49,707
...her hips swiveling...

192
00:10:49,871 --> 00:10:51,976
...her breasts....

193
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:54,318
Convulsing?

194
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,958
-Convulsing?
-I don't know. I’m trying to help you.

195
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,075
So then I asked her
if she wanted a drink.

196
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:03,174
-You don't drink.
-I couldn't think of anything else to say.

197
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:07,085
-So you started drinking.
-So we started drinking, and....

198
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,451
I don't know if it was the alcohol
or the ammonia...

199
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:12,517
...but the next thing I knew,
she was mopping the floor with me.

200
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,836
-And how was it?
-The sex was okay...

201
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,421
...but I threw up
from the Hennigan's.

202
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:24,812
Good thing the cleaning lady
was there.

203
00:11:29,711 --> 00:11:30,955
Dick was fired.

204
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,633
You mean to tell me, I put that drink
six inches over to the right...

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,647
-...and this wouldn't have happened?
-You knew he was an alcoholic.

206
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,044
-Why'd you put the drink down?
-What are you saying?

207
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,185
-I’m not saying anything.
-Yes, you are.

208
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,686
-What could I be saying?
-You must be saying something.

209
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:46,604
lf I was, I would have said it.

210
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:47,946
-Say it.
-I said it.

211
00:11:48,111 --> 00:11:49,802
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

212
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,151
It’s exhausting being with you.

213
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:57,129
-Yeah.
-<i>It's George.</i>

214
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:59,400
-Come on up.
-Hey.

215
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,228
Let me ask you something.

216
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,326
Did George buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

217
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:06,383
...because it was cheaper?

218
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,854
-Okay. You just gave me the answer.
-No, I didn't.

219
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:14,286
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I saw your expression.

220
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:17,710
I didn't have an expression.
I have a deviated septum.

221
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,595
I have to--

222
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,990
I have to open my mouth
sometimes to breathe.

223
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,879
How much did he save?

224
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:30,855
Frankly, I am shocked that you
could ask such a question of me.

225
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:34,286
lf l-- The only surprise was how
you could even think of that.

226
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,066
That's what you were seeing.

227
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,324
I have to talk to you.

228
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:43,725
This cleaning woman's
turning the screws on me.

229
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,928
She's pushing for this
whole relationship thing.

230
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:48,715
She keeps calling me.
She's threatening to go to the boss.

231
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,183
I could lose my job.
I gotta keep her quiet.

232
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:53,864
Elaine's in the bathroom.
She's wise to the red-dot thing.

233
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,684
She's asking me
all kinds of questions about it.

234
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,523
-Did you tell her anything?
-No.

235
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,958
-You swear?
-I’m not swearing. I don't wanna swear.

236
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:04,331
-Come on, swear.
-No.

237
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,503
-Oh, you told her, didn't you?
-No.

238
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:10,862
Hey, George, did you buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

239
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,413
...because you could get it
at a discount?

240
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,211
What?

241
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,996
-Did I what?
-You did, didn't you?

242
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,642
Elaine, I’m shocked.
I’m shocked.

243
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:26,152
Here I go out, in the spirit of the
season and spend all my savings...

244
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:29,802
...to buy you the most beautiful
Christmas sweater I have ever seen...

245
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:32,522
...to show my appreciation to you
at Christmas...

246
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,340
...and this is the thanks I get
at Christmas.

247
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,759
-Well, Jerry told me that you did.
-You told her?

248
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,441
How could you tell her?
What kind of friend are you?

249
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:46,089
I didn't tell her, you stupid idiot.
She tricked you.

250
00:13:50,193 --> 00:13:52,582
Elaine, you don't understand.

251
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:56,618
I had a 1 03 temperature
when I bought that sweater.

252
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,467
I was so dizzy, I was seeing
red dots everywhere.

253
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:02,191
I thought everything in the store
had a red dot on it.

254
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:05,648
I couldn't distinguish one red dot
from the other.

255
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,720
I couldn't afford anything.

256
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,567
I have nothing. I haven't worked
for a really long time.

257
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,064
I mean, look, I have no clothes.

258
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,632
Look at what I’m wearing.

259
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,680
It was just a little red dot.

260
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,013
A little red dot.

261
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:28,781
-This is for you.
-Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?

262
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,990
Oh, I knew you cared for me.

263
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:34,023
As you care for me,
which is why it's very important...

264
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:37,161
...that you never breathe a word
to anyone about....

265
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,908
You know? What with
Clarence Thomas and everything.

266
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:44,208
-Okay. Can I open it now?
-Yes, of course. Go ahead.

267
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,152
My guess is you're gonna
like this very much.

268
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,580
-Is that cashmere?
-Of course it's cashmere.

269
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:56,331
Oh, a cashmere sweater.

270
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:58,353
Oh, Georgie Porgie.

271
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,521
Just a little something for Christmas.

272
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:07,911
When I was a little girl in Panama,
a rich American came to our town.

273
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,596
And he was wearing the softest,
most beautiful sweater.

274
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:15,472
I said, ''What do you call
this beautiful fabric?''

275
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:17,608
And he said:

276
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,593
''They call it cashmere.''

277
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:26,826
I repeated the word.
''Cashmere, cashmere''...

278
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,067
...and I asked him if I could have it...

279
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,919
...and he said:

280
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,327
''No. Get away from me.''

281
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:36,752
And he started to walk away.

282
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:38,987
Oh, but I grabbed onto his leg...

283
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,064
...screaming for him
to give me the sweater...

284
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,339
...and he dragged me
through the streets.

285
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:45,645
And then he kicked me
with the other foot...

286
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,112
...and he threw some change at me.

287
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:51,438
But I didn't want the change, Georgie.

288
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:56,015
I wanted the cashmere.

289
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:01,200
I had a feeling you would like it.

290
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:04,080
-I’m going to try it on.
-No. Don't try it on now. Try it later.

291
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:07,177
Oh, look, it fits beautiful.

292
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:10,129
All right, take it off.
You're gonna ruin it.

293
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,430
What's this?

294
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,013
I was in a men's room the other day.

295
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:20,041
They had the hand blower instead of
the paper towels. You know this thing?

296
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,934
I like the hand blower, I have to say.

297
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:25,482
Takes a little bit longer,
but I feel when you're in a room...

298
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,164
...with a revolting stench, you want
to spend as much time as you can.

299
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:33,067
The only stench is coming from you.

300
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,577
Oh, well, wait a second.

301
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:37,521
I believe we have a heckler,
ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:39,341
Dick, I don't know
what your problem is.

303
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:41,482
It’s not my fault
you're back on the wagon.

304
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,594
It’s ''off the wagon.''

305
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:47,211
In the old days, how do you think they
got the alcohol from town to town?

306
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:51,569
-I don't know.
-On a wagon.

307
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:56,077
Don't you think they broke into a
couple of those bottles along the way?

308
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:58,610
You can't drink on a wagon.
It’s too bumpy.

309
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:01,193
They had smooth trails.
What about the Cumberland Gap.

310
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:03,404
What the hell do you know
about wagons?

311
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,059
I know enough not to get on them.

312
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:11,145
I’m gonna get right to the point.

313
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,323
It’s come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

314
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:18,226
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

315
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:20,686
Is that correct?

316
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,925
-Who said that?
-She did.

317
00:17:28,436 --> 00:17:30,029
Was that wrong?

318
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,844
Should I not have done that?

319
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,834
I got to plead ignorance
on this thing...

320
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:37,200
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

321
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:41,226
...when I started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon....

322
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:44,369
You know, because I’ve worked
in a lot of offices...

323
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,793
...and I tell you,
people do that all the time.

324
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,738
You're fired.

325
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:53,648
Well, you didn't have
to say it like that.

326
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:56,049
I want you out of here
by the end of the day.

327
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,844
What about the whole Christmas-spirit
thing? Any flexibility there?

328
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,531
No.

329
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,121
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,082
She wanted me to give you this.

331
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:32,850
You had sex on your desk
with the cleaning woman.

332
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,439
You never had sex
in the office before?

333
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:38,514
No. I once made out with someone,
but that's it.

334
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,684
Okay. All right. So you made out.

335
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,090
-Well, that's not sex.
-Kissing is sex.

336
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,332
Kissing is not sex.

337
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:47,632
-George.
-Jerry.

338
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:51,888
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink
next to Dick's on purpose?

339
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:53,967
-No.
-George?

340
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,562
Over here.

341
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:58,449
What are you doing here?

342
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:00,980
I’m taking the kid out to dinner
to cheer him up.

343
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,076
Hey, Jerry, when do you consider sex
has taken place?

344
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,028
I would say...

345
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,261
...when the nipple
makes its first appearance.

346
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:20,591
So George told me that you left
the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

347
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,247
Nice try.

348
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:29,999
So guess who heckled me
at the club last night.

349
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,290
Merry Christmas!

350
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:36,559
-Oh, my God, that's Dick.
-Dick?

351
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,100
Dick!

352
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,875
It’s <i>Cape Fear</i>.

353
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,555
Hide. Hide under the desk.

354
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,083
-Move over.
-Get off of me.

355
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:50,963
-I have no room.
-My foot's sticking out.

356
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,166
Shut up. He's coming.

357
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:11,188
Is that cashmere?

358
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,804
Of course it's cashmere.

359
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,088
What's this?

360
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,666
But, in a way, I think I inadvertently
turned this guy into an alcoholic.

361
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:28,398
I hate being around alcoholics.

362
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:31,949
They're either saying how much they
love you or how much they hate you.

363
00:20:32,726 --> 00:20:34,765
Those are the two statements
that scare me most.

364
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,934
But I think he's okay now because
I don't know how he feels about me.

365
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:41,168
-He's finally off the wagon.
-You mean on the wagon.

366
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,512
Don't get smart.
