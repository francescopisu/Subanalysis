1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:04,806
Does it seem to you
that the ventriloquist dummy...

2
00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:09,726
...has a very active sexual,
social life?

3
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:13,468
He's always talking about dates
and women that he knows...

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,844
...and bringing them back
to the suitcase at night.

5
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,357
There's always a sawdust joke
in there somewhere, you know.

6
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:22,080
He says kinky things,
because he's made out of wood...

7
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:23,742
...and he can spin his head around.

8
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,886
We're somehow expected to believe...

9
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:29,825
...because the face is so animated...

10
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,894
...they think we're not noticing
the feet are just swinging there.

11
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:35,137
Dummy feet never look
really right, do they?

12
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:38,850
They're just kind of dangling there.
Always kind of askew, you know.

13
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:40,359
You always see a little ankle.

14
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:43,423
Those little thin, fabric ankles
that they have, you know.

15
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:46,310
You think,
''I don't think this thing is real.''

16
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:51,455
Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,764
Let me speak with the head librarian.
It's absurd.

18
00:00:56,298 --> 00:01:00,007
An overdue book from 1 9 7 1 ?

19
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,017
This is a joke, right? What are you,
from a radio station?

20
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:06,755
Okay, you got me. I fell for it.

21
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:08,552
All right. Okay.

22
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:10,983
I can be down there
in, like, a half-hour.

23
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:12,356
Bye.

24
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,111
-What's the problem?
-This, you're not gonna believe.

25
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:17,695
The New York Public Library...

26
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:22,339
...says that I took out
Tropic of Cancer in 1 9 7 1 ...

27
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:24,067
...and never returned it.

28
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,787
Do you know how much
that comes to?

29
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,353
That's a nickel a day for 20 years.

30
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:31,783
-It's gonna be $50,000.
-It doesn't work like that.

31
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,888
lf it's a dime a day,
it could be 1 00,000.

32
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:35,619
It’s not gonna be anything.

33
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:38,153
I returned the book.
I remember it very vividly...

34
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,103
...because I was with Sherry Becker.

35
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,649
She wore this orange dress. It’s the
first time I saw her in a dress like that.

36
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:46,983
I’d known her since ninth grade. She
was developing this body in secret...

37
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,416
...under these loose clothes
for, like, two years.

38
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,040
And then one day...

39
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:54,020
...this orange dress.

40
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,825
-It’s burned in my memory.
-Oh, memory burn, huh?

41
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,540
-I wonder whatever happened to her.
-How did they find you?

42
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:05,412
Oh, computers. They're cracking down
now on overdue books.

43
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,449
The whole thing's
completely ridiculous.

44
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:12,421
It’s George. Wait till he finds out we're
going to the library. He'll be thrilled.

45
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:15,971
-You know, I never got a library card.
-I’m coming down.

46
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,343
It’s all a bunch of cheapskates
in there anyway.

47
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,418
People sitting around
reading the newspaper...

48
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:23,108
...attached to those huge
wooden sticks...

49
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,348
...trying to save a quarter.

50
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,107
Look, I gotta go to the library.
You wanna go?

51
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,504
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

52
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,787
The Dewey Decimal System.
What a scam that was.

53
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:47,180
Boy, this Dewey guy
really cleaned up on that deal.

54
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,316
Where's George?

55
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,490
Look. Trying to save a quarter.

56
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:56,166
I kind of like those sticks.
I’d like to get them in my house.

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,195
This woman's completely
ignoring me.

58
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:05,740
Look at her.

59
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:09,579
This is a lonely woman
looking for companionship.

60
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:12,388
A spinster.

61
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:14,854
Maybe a virgin.

62
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,234
Maybe she got hurt a long time ago.
She's a schoolgirl...

63
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:22,537
...there was a boy. It didn't work out.

64
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:27,558
So now she needs a little tenderness.
She needs a little understanding.

65
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:29,963
Needs a little Kramer, huh?

66
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,467
Then she'll need
a little shot of penicillin.

67
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:39,020
-Yes?
-Yeah, I called before.

68
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,321
I got this notice in the mail.

69
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:46,949
Tropic of Cancer. Henry Miller.

70
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:51,979
This case has been turned over to our
investigations officer, Mr. Bookman.

71
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:53,320
Bookman?

72
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,749
The library investigator's name is
actually Bookman?

73
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,188
-Come on.
-It’s true.

74
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,562
That's amazing.

75
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:02,662
That's like an ice-cream man
named Cone.

76
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,198
Well, Lieutenant Bookman's
been working here 25 years...

77
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,701
...so he's heard all the jokes.

78
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,512
-Can I speak with this Bookman?
-Just a second.

79
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,147
Jerry.

80
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,682
What?

81
00:04:17,455 --> 00:04:18,830
I think I saw him.

82
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,934
-I think it's him.
-Who?

83
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:23,340
Did you see the homeless guy
on the library steps...

84
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,676
...screaming obscenities
and doing calisthenics?

85
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,004
-Yeah.
-I think that's Mr. Heyman.

86
00:04:29,392 --> 00:04:30,985
The gym teacher from our high school.

87
00:04:33,936 --> 00:04:36,522
-Heyman? Are you sure?
-He's older...

88
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,228
...completely covered in filth,
no whistle. But I think it's him.

89
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:44,936
George got him fired.
He squealed on him.

90
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:47,276
-Oh, tattletale.
-I didn't tattle.

91
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,469
Well, what did this guy do?
What happened?

92
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,705
There was an incident.
I’d rather not discuss it.

93
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,946
-Oh, come on. You can tell me.
-Some other time.

94
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:57,935
What, tonight?

95
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:02,822
-I never figured you for a squealer.
-He sang like a canary.

96
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,651
-Mr. Bookman's not here.
-Not here?

97
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:07,949
-Why was I told to come down here?
-He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

98
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:11,147
He's out on a case?
He actually goes out on cases?

99
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,390
What am I supposed to do now?

100
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,441
I’ll have Mr. Bookman
get in touch with you.

101
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:17,932
All right. Thanks.

102
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,236
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go see if it's Heyman.

103
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:24,396
-It’s not him.
-Hey, I’ll see you boys later, huh?

104
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:32,935
So, what's a guy gotta do around here
to get a library card?

105
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:46,157
-Where's Karen?
-She went to pick up lunch.

106
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:48,684
Well...

107
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,824
...she didn't ask me what I wanted.

108
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:54,191
She must've forgot.

109
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,131
How could she forget?
I’ve been ordering lunch...

110
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,022
...every day for three-and-a-half years.

111
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,680
Is there something
you're not telling me...

112
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,982
...because I’m getting, like,
a really weird vibe.

113
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:07,243
Is Lippman getting rid of me?
You can tell me.

114
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:09,997
-I won't say anything.
-I don't know anything.

115
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,455
You don't know. You see,
''I don't know anything''...

116
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:16,521
...means there's something to know.
lf you really didn't, you'd say:

117
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,285
''You're crazy.''

118
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:21,321
-Oh, hi, Mr. Lippman.
-Elaine.

119
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,844
I was wondering
if you got a chance...

120
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,979
...to look at that biography
of Columbus I gave you.

121
00:06:28,148 --> 00:06:29,937
Yes, I did.

122
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,979
Yes, I did.

123
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:38,287
-Marie, this water is still too cold.
-Oh, yeah. It’s freezing.

124
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,447
Hurts your teeth.

125
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,488
I’m telling you,
something is going on.

126
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:53,133
He never likes anything I recommend,
and then that lunch thing.

127
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,341
So they forgot to get your lunch.
Big deal.

128
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,192
What do you know?
You've never worked in an office.

129
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:00,724
See, you've worked in an office,
George. You understand.

130
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:04,114
Jerry thinks I’m overreacting,
but you understand lunch.

131
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,922
I don't understand lunch.
I don't know anything about it.

132
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:10,831
Just because I got the guy fired doesn't
mean I turned him into a bum, does it?

133
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,492
-What did he do?
-He purposely...

134
00:07:12,662 --> 00:07:14,418
...mispronounced my name.

135
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,370
Instead of saying Costanza...

136
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,756
...he'd say, ''Can't stand you.
Can't stand you.''

137
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:24,171
Remember, he made me smell
my own gym socks once?

138
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:28,084
I remember he made you wear a jock
on your head for a whole class.

139
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,699
-And the straps were hanging down....
-Okay, okay.

140
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:33,269
You never even had him for gym.

141
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,797
I had him for hygiene.
Remember his teeth?

142
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,064
It was like from an exhumed corpse.

143
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,943
Little baked beans.

144
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:45,238
Come on, tell me what happened.

145
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,634
Well, okay.

146
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:50,287
As I said, the guy had it in for me.

147
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:54,000
He actually failed me in gym. Me.

148
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,421
And those spastic Schnitzer twins.

149
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,924
-Can't stand you!
-Yes, Mr. Heyman?

150
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,087
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

151
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:05,230
Well, that's because
I wear boxer shorts.

152
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,025
Boxer shorts, huh?

153
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,231
-What brand?
-I’m not really sure. l--

154
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,701
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

155
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:14,350
He gave me a wedgie.

156
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,625
And he got fired the next day.

157
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,381
Why do they call it a ''wedgie''?

158
00:08:18,552 --> 00:08:22,097
Because the underwear is pulled up
from the back until it...

159
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:24,086
...wedges in.

160
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,507
They also have an atomic wedgie.

161
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,901
Now, the goal there is to actually
get the waistband...

162
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,104
...on top of the head.

163
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,279
It’s very rare.

164
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,897
-Boys are sick.
-Well, what do girls do?

165
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:42,741
We just tease someone till they
develop an eating disorder.

166
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,161
I gotta go back to the library
and talk to him.

167
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:49,176
I gotta find out if I’m the guy
that ruined his life.

168
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:51,159
Hey, babaloo, you better get home.

169
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,004
This guy Bookman from the library,
he's waiting for you.

170
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,463
What's amazing about the library...

171
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,455
...is here's a place
where you can go in...

172
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:01,137
...take out any book you want.
They just give it to you...

173
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,760
...and say, ''Bring it back
when you're done.''

174
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,548
Reminds you of that pathetic friend
everybody had as a kid...

175
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,259
...that would let you borrow any of his
stuff if you would just be his friend.

176
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,222
That's what the library is. It’s
a government-funded pathetic friend.

177
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,281
That's why everybody
bullies the library.

178
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,678
I’ll bring it back on time,
I’ll bring it back late.

179
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:21,209
''What are you gonna do,
charge me a nickel?''

180
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,302
I’m glad you're here so we can
straighten this out.

181
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,808
-Cup of tea?
-Got any coffee?

182
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,050
-Coffee?
-Yeah, coffee.

183
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:30,073
-No, I don't drink coffee.
-You don't?

184
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,957
-How about instant coffee?
-No, I don't--

185
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,911
-No instant coffee?
-Well, I don't--

186
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,081
-Who doesn't have instant coffee?
-I don't.

187
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,479
Buy a jar of Folgers crystals, put it in
the cupboard, you forget about it.

188
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,617
When you need it, it's there.
It lasts forever.

189
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:44,242
It’s freeze-dried.
Freeze-dried crystals.

190
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,477
Really? I’ll have to remember that.

191
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:51,119
-You took this book out in 1 9 7 1 .
-Yes, and I returned it in 1 9 7 1 .

192
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,680
Yeah, '7 1 , that was my first year
on the job.

193
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,469
Bad year for libraries.
Bad year for America.

194
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:58,937
Hippies burning library cards.

195
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,652
Abbie Hoffman telling everybody
to steal books.

196
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,281
I don't judge a man by hair length
or musical taste.

197
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:05,653
Rock was never my bag.

198
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:09,045
But you put on a pair of shoes
in the New York Public Library, fella.

199
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,383
Look, Mr. Bookman...

200
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:15,767
...I returned that book.
I remember it very specifically.

201
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:17,874
You're a comedian.
You make people laugh.

202
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,564
-I try.
-You think this is all a big joke?

203
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:23,770
No, I don't.

204
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:26,550
I saw you on TV once.
I remembered your name from my list.

205
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,082
I looked it up.
Sure enough, it checked out.

206
00:10:29,244 --> 00:10:32,244
You think because you're a celebrity,
somehow the law doesn't apply?

207
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,168
-You're above the law?
-Certainly not.

208
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:36,788
Well, let me tell you something,
funny boy.

209
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,246
You know that little stamp, the one
that says ''New York Public Library''?

210
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:41,874
That may not mean anything to you.

211
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,433
But that means a lot to me.
One whole hell of a lot.

212
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:47,703
Sure, go ahead. Laugh if you want to.
I’ve seen your type before.

213
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:51,513
Flashy, making a scene,
flaunting convention.

214
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,170
Yeah, I know what you're thinking:

215
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,959
''Why's this guy making such a stink
about old library books?''

216
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,028
Well, let me give you a hint, junior.

217
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:02,583
Maybe we can live without libraries,
people like you and me. Maybe.

218
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,789
Sure, we're too old
to change the world.

219
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,827
But what about that kid sitting down
opening a book right now...

220
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:09,884
...in a branch at the local library...

221
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,428
...and finding drawings
of pee-pees and wee-wees...

222
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:18,809
...in The Cat in the Hat
and The Five Chinese Brothers?

223
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,184
Doesn't he deserve better?

224
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,481
Look, if you think this is about
overdue fines and missing books...

225
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:26,199
...you better think again.
This is about that kid's right...

226
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,635
...to read a book without
getting his mind warped.

227
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,805
Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld.

228
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:34,749
Maybe that's how you get your kicks,
you and your good-time buddies.

229
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,758
Well, I got a flash for you, joy-boy:

230
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,200
Party time is over.

231
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:45,946
You got seven days, Seinfeld.

232
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:48,697
That is one week.

233
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:56,819
-What's wrong?
-It’s Bookman, the library cop.

234
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:59,997
-So? I didn't do anything wrong.
-I’m supposed to be at work.

235
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,454
I could get fired.
I never should've come here.

236
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,101
Why don't you leave?

237
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,692
I can't.

238
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:18,845
There's no way I’m paying that!
I returned that book in 1 9 7 1 !

239
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,374
I have a witness. Sherry Becker.

240
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,925
She wore an orange dress.

241
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,721
She gave me a piece
of Black Jack gum.

242
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:29,150
I said, ''Licorice gum.
What will they think of next?''

243
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:30,937
I remember it!

244
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,296
Becker, Becker....

245
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:51,610
Kevin went to a public school.

246
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:53,239
He's the 1 4 year old.

247
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:56,343
We were gonna send Marsha
to a private school...

248
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:59,322
...because in some ways, they don't...

249
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:02,206
...learn enough, I think.

250
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:05,915
So, Sherry, what do you remember
about that day at the library?

251
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,563
I remember it like it was yesterday.

252
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,671
It was a Friday afternoon.

253
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:15,070
-I wore a purple dress.
-Purple?

254
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,754
-You sure it wasn't orange?
-Positive.

255
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,638
And I was chewing Dentyne.

256
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,835
I always chewed Dentyne.

257
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:26,871
Remember, Jerry? Dentyne?

258
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:32,310
-No Black Jack?
-Licorice gum? Never.

259
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:34,205
What else?

260
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,740
We were...

261
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:39,997
...reading passages to each other
from that Henry Miller book you had.

262
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:42,683
-Tropic of Cancer.
-No.

263
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,476
Tropic of Capricorn.

264
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:49,020
-Tropic of Capricorn?
-Remember?

265
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:51,648
''What holds the world together...

266
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,902
...as I have learned from
bitter experience...

267
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,133
...is sexual intercourse.''

268
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:05,888
Wait a second, wait a second.
You're right. I had both of them.

269
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:07,612
We read from Tropic of Capricorn.

270
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,641
I was all set to return Tropic of Cancer.
And then....

271
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,496
-George, here's the book.
-Oh, man.

272
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,114
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

273
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:19,869
Jerry, it's me, George. Don't worry.
I’ll return it tomorrow.

274
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:23,352
All right. I’ll see you after school.
I’m late for Heyman's hygiene.

275
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:27,935
-Where are you going?
-It was nice seeing you again.

276
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,009
I just remembered something.
I’ve gotta go.

277
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,538
It was George!

278
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,314
Read another poem.

279
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:41,466
Pressed chest
Fleshed out west

280
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:43,611
Might be the savior

281
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,406
Or a garden pest

282
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,175
That is great poetry.
You should be published.

283
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,228
It’s great.

284
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:57,117
Well, the library's kind of a cool place
when it's closed.

285
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,674
Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet.

286
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,339
Listen to the echo.

287
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,265
-Hello!
-Hello!

288
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,698
-Hello!
-Hello!

289
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,355
-Hello!
-Hello.

290
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:11,999
Mr. Bookman.

291
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:15,482
I remember when the librarian was
a much older woman.

292
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,206
Kindly, discreet, unattractive.

293
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:20,796
We didn't know anything
about her private life.

294
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:23,038
We didn't wanna know
about her private life.

295
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:25,595
She didn't have a private life.

296
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:27,675
When you think about that,
think about this:

297
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,366
The library closes at 5:00,
no exceptions.

298
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,225
This is your final warning.

299
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,692
Got that, kewpie doll?

300
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,215
Lippman wants to see me
in his office.

301
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:45,125
-See me. That can't be good.
-Maybe you're getting a raise.

302
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:47,654
Maybe I’m getting a wedgie.

303
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:52,989
-What?
-It's George.

304
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,218
-George is on his way up.
-Wait till I tell him about the book.

305
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,420
Are you okay?

306
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:05,733
-What?
-It’s-- It’s Marion's poetry.

307
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:09,441
-I can't take it!
-Oh, Kramer.

308
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,161
Remember that biography
I recommended?

309
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:18,716
-My boss hated it!
-I’m right here.

310
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,797
Oh, sorry.

311
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:25,885
-Remember that Columbus book?
-Columbus. Eurotrash.

312
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,973
Well, it's definitely him.

313
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,437
-Him? Him who?
-Him who?

314
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,332
Heyman him.

315
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,285
Heyman, the gym teacher?

316
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,263
-You found him?
-Oh, I found him.

317
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,530
He was sitting on the steps
of the library.

318
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,006
I sat down next to him.

319
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:59,646
He smelled like the locker room
after that game against Erasmus.

320
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,705
That was double overtime.

321
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,619
I said, ''Mr. Heyman...

322
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:06,305
...it's me, George Costanza.

323
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,895
JFK, '7 1 .''

324
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:10,953
He doesn't move.

325
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:12,803
So I said:

326
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:16,962
''Can't stand you. Can't stand you.''

327
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:19,907
He turns and smiles.

328
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:22,692
The little baked-bean teeth.

329
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,250
I get up to run away...

330
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:28,734
...but something was holding me back.

331
00:17:29,578 --> 00:17:31,488
It was Heyman.

332
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:35,014
He had my underwear.

333
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:42,527
Here I was on the steps
of the 42nd Street library...

334
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:44,902
...a grown man...

335
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,432
...getting a wedgie.

336
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:51,146
At least it wasn't atomic.

337
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:55,104
It was.

338
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:03,047
So, Georgie boy, guess what
happened to Tropic of Cancer.

339
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:05,513
-How should I know?
-Because I gave it to you.

340
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:06,852
-Me?
-Yeah, think.

341
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,321
Don't you remember?
You kept begging me to see it.

342
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:11,174
Then finally, I agreed.

343
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:14,149
You were supposed to return it.

344
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:17,282
I met you in the gym locker room
and gave it to you.

345
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:19,430
The locker room.

346
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:22,027
-George, here's the book.
-Oh, man.

347
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,642
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

348
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,113
It’s me, George. Don't worry.
I’ll return it tomorrow.

349
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:30,789
All right. I’ll see you after school.
I’m late for Heyman's hygiene.

350
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,580
-Can't stand you!
-Yes, Mr. Heyman?

351
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:40,064
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

352
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:43,335
-That's because I wear boxer shorts.
-Boxer shorts, huh?

353
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:45,606
-What brand?
-I’m not really sure.

354
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:48,009
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

355
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:03,844
Anyway, I hope there's
no hard feelings.

356
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:08,584
Hard feelings? What do you know
about hard feelings?

357
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:13,800
Ever have a man die in your arms?
Ever kill somebody?

358
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:16,038
-What is your problem?
-What's my problem?

359
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,823
Punks like you. That's my problem.

360
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,647
You better not
screw up again, Seinfeld.

361
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,813
Because if you do, I’ll be all over you
like a pit bull on a poodle.

362
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:29,995
That is one tough monkey.

363
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:34,724
-So you were saying?
-So I took your suggestion...

364
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:37,130
...and I gave my boss
Marion's poems...

365
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:39,017
...the ones that affected
Kramer so much.

366
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:43,143
-Oh, beautiful. Did he like them?
-No, he didn't.

367
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:47,243
No, he didn't.

368
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:51,974
-Was he out there?
-No, he's gone.

369
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:56,292
-I wonder what happened to him.
-I guess we'll never know.

370
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:04,485
Can't stand you.

371
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:09,062
Can't stand you. Can't stand you.

372
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:11,784
Can't stand you.

373
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,916
Any day that you had gym...

374
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,184
...was a weird school day.

375
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,555
You know what I mean?
It started off kind of normal.

376
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,535
You have, like, English, geometry,
social studies...

377
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:26,762
...and then suddenly, you're, like,
in Lord of the Flies for 40 minutes.

378
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:29,994
You're hanging from a rope.
You have hardly any clothes on.

379
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,455
Teachers are yelling at you,
''Where's your jockstrap?'' You know.

380
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:37,707
Kids are throwing dodge balls at you.
You're trying to survive.

381
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,818
Then it's history...

382
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:41,806
...science, language.

383
00:20:41,968 --> 00:20:45,132
There's something off
in the whole flow of that day.
