1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,064
Loyalty to any one sports team
is pretty hard to justify...

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,037
...because the players are always
changing. The team can move.

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,337
You're actually rooting for the clothes
when you get right down to it.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,072
I mean, you are standing
and cheering and yelling...

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,615
...for your clothes to beat
the clothes from another city.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,548
Fans will be so in love
with a player...

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,689
...but if he goes to another team,
they boo him.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,189
This is the same human being
in a different shirt.

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,587
They hate him now.

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,558
Boo.

11
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,720
Different shirt.

12
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,366
Boo.

13
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,070
Sure you don't want the tickets?

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,104
- No.
- I can't believe I'm having trouble...

15
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,573
- ...getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
- I'm telling you, skip the wedding.

16
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,972
- Go to the game.
- I can't.

17
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,704
The Drake put me
in the wedding party.

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,281
Well, who schedules his wedding
on Super Bowl Sunday?

19
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,974
- Maybe he didn't know.
- Let me see.

20
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,122
I can't believe you got these for free.
What? Row F?

21
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,517
Row F.

22
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,215
In front of the G's.
Hobnobbing with the D's and E's.

23
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,354
- How about Kramer or Elaine?
- Elaine laughed at me.

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,395
Kramer's interested
in Canadian football.

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,159
Well, wish I could help you.

26
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,996
Come on, take them.
You could take Bonnie.

27
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,605
You paying my hotel
and airfare to Miami?

28
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,764
- What do you think?
- In order to use these...

29
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,705
...I gotta spend, like, 1,500 bucks.

30
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,072
This is a bill for $1,500.

31
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,774
Plus, she'd ask about
the sleeping arrangements.

32
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:25,281
I find sleeping-arrangement
conversations depressing.

33
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,976
Yeah. Sleeping arrangements.

34
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,087
- So you haven't -?
- Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,452
I haven't even seen her apartment yet.
Tomorrow night's the first night.

36
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,183
Hey, hey. Is that Tim Whatley?

37
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,788
- The dentist?
- Is he mad at you for crashing...

38
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,454
- ...his Thanksgiving party?
- No. I explained it to him.

39
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,997
- He was fine with it.
- Oh, good.

40
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,964
Yeah. I blamed it on you.

41
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,104
- Hi, Tim.
- Hey, Jerry.

42
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,966
George.
What are you up to?

43
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,007
Oh, just a couple gals out on the town,
shopping and gabbing.

44
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,666
I'm getting a makeover.

45
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,946
Hey, how'd you like
to go to the Super Bowl?

46
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,380
- What, are you kidding?
- Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.

47
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,977
How can I thank you?
I'll take you to dinner sometime.

48
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,988
- You ever been to Mendy's?
- No. No, no. No dinner.

49
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,594
Tim, you didn't have to get me
a thank-you gift.

50
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,196
I know. It's a label maker.

51
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,266
The Label Baby Junior.

52
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,660
Yeah, I hear they're good.

53
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,704
Well, label me thankful.

54
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,539
Okay. Well, you enjoy those tickets.

55
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,507
Bye-bye.

56
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,508
Yeah?

57
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,582
Come in.

58
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,283
Hey, where can I put this?

59
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,853
- What is it?
- It's Risk, Jerry.

60
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,014
The game of world conquest.

61
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,331
- All right, that's perfect.
- Kramer, why do you have to-?

62
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,227
Hello, Newman.

63
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,399
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it?
I gotta go to work.

64
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,868
- Take what?
- The board, Jerry.

65
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,872
We've been playing at Newman's
for six hours, but he's gotta go.

66
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,840
- Why not leave it at Newman's?
- I wanted to. He won't let me.

67
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,574
We have to put the board in a neutral
place where no one will tamper with it.

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,709
- So that's here?
- Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.

69
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,412
I don't wanna be Switzerland.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,526
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in
an epic struggle for world domination.

71
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,221
It's winner take all.
People cannot be trusted.

72
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,357
- Don't look at me.
- I'm looking right at you, big daddy.

73
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,127
- All right, soldier boys. Let's fall out.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,604
- All right, you're gonna look after it?
- Yeah, yeah.

75
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,572
- Stay strong. Watch it good.
- Yeah. Okay.

76
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,370
- Hey, hey.
- Hey. Hey.

77
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,773
Hey.

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,642
- Oh, is that a label maker?
- Yes, it is. I got it as a gift.

79
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,478
It's a Label Baby Junior.

80
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,552
Love the Label Baby, baby.

81
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,884
You know, those things
make great gifts.

82
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,116
I just got one for Tim Whatley
for Christmas.

83
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,887
- Tim Whatley?
- Yeah. Who sent you that one?

84
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,963
One Tim Whatley.

85
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,564
No. My Tim Whatley?

86
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,363
The same. He sent it as a thank you
for my Super Bowl tickets.

87
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,901
I think this is the same one
I gave him.

88
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,542
He recycled this gift.

89
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,177
He's a re-gifter.

90
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,643
Or maybe he liked your gift so much,
he decided to get me the same thing.

91
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,512
Perhaps it's an homage.

92
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,283
Yeah, perhaps.

93
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,116
Well, how did he react
when you gave it to him?

94
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,023
He said, "Oh, a label maker.
How about that."

95
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,130
- He repeated the name of the gift?
- Yeah. So?

96
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,358
Well, if you repeat the name
of the gift, you can't possibly like it.

97
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,762
What do you mean?

98
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,801
Like when someone
opens something and goes:

99
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,337
"Oh, tube socks."

100
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,168
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

101
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,708
I guess I'll just get invited
up to his apartment...

102
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,109
- ...and see if he's got a label maker.
- Why did you get him a gift?

103
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,443
He did some dental work for me
and didn't charge.

104
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,175
So I got him a Christmas present.

105
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,583
Yeah, well, if you're getting him
anything for his birthday, I'm a large.

106
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,525
Well, here we are.
This is the place.

107
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,527
You like it?

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,635
I love it. This is fantastic.

109
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,294
Look at this couch. Is this velvet?

110
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,700
Are you a velvet fan?

111
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,432
A fan?

112
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,841
I would drape myself in velvet
if it were socially acceptable.

113
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,538
Look at this. Hardwood floors.

114
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,316
Aren't they great?
Oh, Scott, hi.

115
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,714
This is George.

116
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,015
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Scott, my roommate.

117
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,018
- Hey.
- Here. Check out this view.

118
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,960
If you lean out this window,
you can see the river.

119
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,070
So Scott's your roommate, huh?

120
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,566
Yes. I'm sure I've mentioned him.

121
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,607
No, I don't think
you mentioned him, no.

122
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,379
He's a great guy.
You'll really like him.

123
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,276
I'm sure I will.

124
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,850
- Male roommate.
- Yes, a male roommate.

125
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,183
- And this is a problem?
- It's a huge problem, Jerry.

126
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,484
The hardest part
about having sex with a woman...

127
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,254
...is getting her to come back
to your place. He's already got that.

128
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,523
- Well, maybe he's -
- No, believe me, he's not.

129
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,997
- So he's an eligible receiver.
- Right.

130
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,159
She's confiding in him
about our dates.

131
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,568
You always like the person you talk to
about the date more than the date.

132
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,938
It's just a matter of time until they
realize, "Hey, we could have sex."

133
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,339
- What's stopping them?
- Exactly.

134
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,446
You know how they get animals
to reproduce?

135
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,174
They just put them
in the same cage.

136
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,112
- What does he look like?
- That's the worst part.

137
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,277
He looks just like me.

138
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,555
He looks like you,
and he's working from the inside?

139
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,852
I look like me,
and I'm working from the outside.

140
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,053
- Who is in the better position?
- Not you.

141
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,165
This bizarre
Harrad Experiment must end.

142
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,994
We'll take our check, please.

143
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,465
I gotta find a way to work this out.
I love that apartment.

144
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,072
It's so cozy.
I'm ensconced in velvet.

145
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,874
- If it was socially acceptable-
- I know.

146
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,070
You would drape yourself
in velvet.

147
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,840
- I've said that before?
- Many times.

148
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,984
You love velvet.
You wanna live in velvet.

149
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,086
Everything with the velvet.

150
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,382
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,784
Guess what.

152
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,687
- I saw Newman talking to the super.
- So what?

153
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,192
The super has keys
to your apartment.

154
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,853
Don't you see what's going on?

155
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,693
Newman is planning
a sneak attack.

156
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,528
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.

157
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,136
Yeah. All right, fine.
You sit there and you watch...

158
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,604
...while Newman takes over the world,
but he'd be a horrible leader.

159
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,073
And you know who's gonna suffer?
The little people.

160
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,677
You and George.

161
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,610
- Are you through?
- All right. Fine.

162
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,906
I talked to Arthur Jobania.

163
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,678
- The Drake's wedding. That's off.
- The wedding is off?

164
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,219
- What happened?
- The Drake...

165
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,120
...he found out that the wedding
is on the same day as the Super Bowl.

166
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,658
So he wanted to postpone it.

167
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,992
They got in a big argument
and... it's over.

168
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,730
The wedding is off.
You can go to the Super Bowl.

169
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,099
I can't call Tim
and ask for the tickets back.

170
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,434
You just gave them to him
two days ago.

171
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,406
He's gotta give you a grace period.

172
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,776
Are you even vaguely familiar
with the concept of giving?

173
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,242
There's no grace period.

174
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,087
Well, didn't he re-gift
the label maker?

175
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,621
- Possibly.
- Well, if he can re-gift...

176
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,089
...why can't you de-gift?

177
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,062
- You may have a point.
- I have a point. I have a point.

178
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,197
- All right, I'll call him.
- Yeah.

179
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,130
- What's that?
- Oh, it's Risk.

180
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,031
It's a game of world domination...

181
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,071
...being played by two guys
who can barely run their own lives.

182
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,303
Hello, Tim?
Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

183
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,174
Hey, remember
those tickets I gave you?

184
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,578
Well, it turns out I can use them.

185
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,048
Oh, you do? I understand.

186
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,050
Okay. Bye.

187
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,155
He already made plans.
He can't change them.

188
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,551
Well, they're his tickets.

189
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,250
- He can do what he wants with them.
- Thanks.

190
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,089
- I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
- What about the roommate?

191
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,858
I gotta try and figure out a way
to switch places with him.

192
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,866
It's like a Siegfried & Roy trick.

193
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,560
The pickle breath is a good start.

194
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,243
Hello, Jerry. May I come in?

195
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,347
What do you want?

196
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,142
Nothing.

197
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,112
Just being neighborly.

198
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,288
You wanna hang out?
Shoot the breeze?

199
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,084
I won't let you cheat.
You're not getting near that board.

200
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,386
Jerry, I'm a little insulted.

201
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,087
You're not
a little anything, Newman.

202
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,255
So just pack it up
and move it out of here.

203
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,196
All right.

204
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,802
Oh, by the way, what are you doing
for the Super Bowl?

205
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,337
I don't know.
Watch it on TV, I guess. Why?

206
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,441
If you watch closely,
you just might see me.

207
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,772
I'll be the one waving to the camera
from my seat on the 40-yard line.

208
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,607
- You're going to the Super Bowl?
- Yes.

209
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,579
A guy on my mail route got
a couple tickets and offered me one.

210
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,445
- What's his name?
- Tim Whatley.

211
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,984
That's my ticket.

212
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,054
Is it?

213
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,751
Well, if only you'd known...

214
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,054
...you could have saved some time
and given it directly to me.

215
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,326
Newman.

216
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,762
What a movie. Good choice.

217
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:08,873
- Thank Scott. He recommended it.
- Oh, Scott, Scott.

218
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,702
He's really great, isn't he?

219
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,811
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, he is.

220
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,972
Let me ask you something.

221
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,451
When you come out of the shower
and put your robe on...

222
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,111
...do you cinch it tight?
Are you concerned about that?

223
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,484
George.

224
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,091
Do you hold the neck together...

225
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,251
...or are you just letting it flap
in the breeze?

226
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,524
George, you're being ridiculous.

227
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,328
What's the massage situation?

228
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,402
- What do you mean?
- Is there any work being done?

229
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,510
Is there any rubbing, touching, finger
manipulation on the other person?

230
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,340
And if so,
who is making the request?

231
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:52,280
George, would you just stop.

232
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,484
Say you go into the bathroom
at 2:00 in the morning.

233
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,784
What's the outfit? I mean, are you
dressing up, or is it come as you are?

234
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,055
- George, what is wrong with you?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

235
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,563
A grown woman
with a male roommate.

236
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,600
It's unnatural. It's an abomination.

237
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,999
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,662
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

239
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,274
Do you need the bathroom?
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

240
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,241
No. Just throw my bras
out of the way.

241
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,084
Well, this is my building.

242
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,243
Yes, it is.

243
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,719
- This was fun, you know?
- Yeah.

244
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,317
So...

245
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,121
...I guess I'll talk to you.

246
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,594
Aren't you gonna
invite me upstairs?

247
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,858
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?

248
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,298
I would love to go upstairs.

249
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,266
Elaine, you are something else.

250
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,307
No one could ever
put a label on you, huh?

251
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,876
We'll see.

252
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,944
Newman. He's going with Newman.

253
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,881
How does Tim Whatley
even know Newman?

254
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,543
Newman's his mailman.

255
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,452
Who goes to the Super Bowl
with their mailman?

256
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,058
Who goes anywhere with Newman?

257
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,225
Well, he's merry.

258
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,764
He is merry. I'll give him that.

259
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,401
What's this plant for?

260
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,561
Oh, I had a little tiff with Bonnie
about the roommate.

261
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,406
Well, the cactus
will smooth things over.

262
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,432
Hey. Guess what.

263
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,410
I'm going to the Super Bowl
with Tim Whatley.

264
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,071
- What?
- We went out for coffee...

265
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,082
- ...and he offered me a ticket.
- But what about the label maker?

266
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,945
Well.

267
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,556
Wait a minute. That's my ticket.
You didn't wanna go.

268
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,089
It was totally out of the blue.

269
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,092
We went upstairs to his apartment
to look for the label maker-

270
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,526
How? Did you say
you had to use the bathroom?

271
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,428
- No.
- Then how did you get up there?

272
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,661
- I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
- And there's your ticket.

273
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,498
- Well.
- What?

274
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,936
That's why you're going
to the Super Bowl.

275
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,373
- Why?
- You go out with a guy one time.

276
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,174
You ask him to go upstairs
like you're Mae West.

277
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,943
Of course he's gonna try
and get you alone for the weekend.

278
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,382
You mean just because
I asked him to go upstairs...

279
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,012
- ...he thinks he's going downtown?
- Obviously.

280
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,026
- You're crazy.
- Well, what happened upstairs?

281
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,491
As soon as we walked in...

282
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,631
...he got a call from one of his patients
with an impacted molar...

283
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,359
...so he had to leave.
I didn't look for the label maker.

284
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,799
I don't trust this guy.
I think he re-gifted...

285
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,632
...and then de-gifted.
Now he's using an upstairs invite...

286
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,071
...as a springboard
to a Super Bowl sex romp.

287
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,018
- Hey.
- Hey.

288
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,180
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching your door.

289
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,348
- My door?
- Yeah. From my peephole.

290
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,323
Fisheye. Sees all.

291
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,269
- What was that?
- Newman. Open it. Open it. Open.

292
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,534
Damn.

293
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,237
The bedroom.

294
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,872
Get him.

295
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,586
- I see you, Newman. I see you.
- I'm taking the Congo as a penalty.

296
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,379
I've got a confession to make.

297
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,085
- What's that?
- I've got Super Bowl fever.

298
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,420
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

299
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,862
- So where are we staying?
- Oh, the Ambassador.

300
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,805
Big room?

301
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,467
It's a regular room,
but it's right downtown.

302
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,611
- Downtown?
- Right downtown.

303
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,410
What do they have there?
A couple of beds?

304
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,556
Why? You bringing someone else?

305
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,322
No...

306
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,620
...but don't you think
there should be two beds?

307
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,854
There's two of us.

308
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh, a cactus.

309
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,999
They don't need any water...

310
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,834
...so you don't have to keep
taking them to the bathroom.

311
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,807
Well...

312
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,046
...look who's here.

313
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,739
I asked Scott to move out.

314
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,846
So she kicked him out
of the apartment?

315
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,787
That's right.

316
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,257
It's just me and her.

317
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,623
She rearranged
her whole life for you.

318
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,957
Yeah, I guess she did.

319
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,661
He's gone. Now I'm the man.

320
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,963
That's not a good role for you.

321
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,834
No, it's not.

322
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,305
You unwittingly made
a major commitment.

323
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,000
That's a lot of pressure.

324
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,409
Oh, my God.

325
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,374
You wanted to be
ensconced in velvet.

326
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,347
You're buried.

327
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,012
I had the perfect situation here.
He was shouldering half the load.

328
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,522
- He was shouldering.
- I couldn't leave well enough alone.

329
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,126
Where you going?

330
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,627
I gotta go help tape up all his boxes
and get them ready for shipping.

331
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,823
Well, here.
Take Whatley's label maker.

332
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,366
- I don't wanna see it again.
- Thanks.

333
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,764
Yeah. I am taking over
South America...

334
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,999
...and there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

335
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,371
Too bad about that
Super Bowl ticket, huh, Newman?

336
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,412
Yeah. I just hope
Tim Whatley's electric bills...

337
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,311
...don't suddenly
get lost in the mail...

338
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,715
...or it could be lights out for him.

339
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,752
Okay. Thanks for
having me over, guys.

340
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,686
Yeah.

341
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,593
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Oh, hey, Jerry.

342
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,696
Tim Whatley. Out scalping?

343
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,390
See, now, I've been thinking a lot
about what happened.

344
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,264
I feel horrible. Listen,
I wanna give you a ticket back.

345
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,031
- Are you serious? What about Elaine?
- Oh, Elaine, yeah.

346
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,506
Well, things just didn't work out
like I thought they would.

347
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,106
Hey, isn't this Kramer's car?

348
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,273
Hey, Cosmo!
They're towing your car.

349
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,743
What?

350
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,423
Not my car!

351
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,661
They're towing my car.

352
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,956
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the board with me.

353
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,034
Hey.

354
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,936
Hey! Hey, wait!

355
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,406
Wait!

356
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,308
Hey, wait a minute!

357
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,743
Hey!

358
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,510
- So I guess I'll see you at the game.
- Yeah, see you there.

359
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,619
Okay. Good.

360
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,458
Hi, George.

361
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,256
Where-?

362
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,422
What happened? Where's -?
Where's all the stuff?

363
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,590
It's gone. It was all his.

364
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,102
Is this a label maker?

365
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:57,607
But the table, the stereo, the VCR-
The velvet couch. Where's the velvet?

366
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,334
They were his.

367
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:03,038
Besides, we don't need
any of those things.

368
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,843
We have each other.

369
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,780
Are you sure you know
where the impound yard is?

370
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,858
Oh, stop stalling. Come on.

371
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,121
I-I can't think.
There's all this noise.

372
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,733
Or is it because I've built
a stronghold around Greenland...

373
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,460
...I've driven you out
of Western Europe...

374
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,595
...and I've left you teetering
on the brink of complete annihilation?

375
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,005
I'm not beaten yet.
I still have armies in the Ukraine.

376
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,668
Yeah? The Ukraine.

377
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,714
You know what the Ukraine is?
It's a sitting duck.

378
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,714
A road apple, Newman.

379
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,716
The Ukraine is weak.

380
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,377
It's feeble.

381
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,353
I think it's time
to put the hurt on the Ukraine.

382
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,858
I come from Ukraine.
You not say Ukraine weak.

383
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,620
Yeah, we're playing
a game here, pal.

384
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,166
Ukraine is game to you? How about
I take your little board and smash!

385
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,830
Hello, Tim.

386
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,670
- Elaine, hi.
- Don't worry, Tim.

387
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,540
I didn't come by to yell at you.
I didn't come by for that.

388
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,844
I just came by
to pick up my label maker.

389
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,977
I gave you a label maker,
and now I would like to have it back.

390
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,214
But you gave it to me.

391
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,359
But you gave me a ticket
to the Super Bowl.

392
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,552
Hand it over, Whatley.

393
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,557
Okay.

394
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,193
You don't have the label maker,
do you?

395
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,831
- No.
- I knew it.

396
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,939
- You're a re-gifter.
- Oh, yeah. Some gift.

397
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,041
- That thing didn't work at all.
- What?

398
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,144
You put a label on something,
10 minutes later it would peel off.

399
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,281
It was the worst gift I ever got.

400
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,281
Well, I bought it for you...

401
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,583
...because you were so nice to me for
not charging me for the dental work.

402
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,958
The way you worked on my filling,
you were so-

403
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,090
So gentle and so caring
and so sensitive.

404
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,967
Oh, Elaine.

405
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,942
H...

406
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,587
...G...

407
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,247
...F. Seat four.

408
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:32,420
One, two, three-

409
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,733
Hello, Newman.

410
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,063
Hello, Jerry.

411
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,832
Tim couldn't make it. He's in love.

412
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,906
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Oh, it's enchanting.

413
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,515
Here's the TV.

414
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,882
I know you wanted to watch
the Super Bowl.

415
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,458
Do you at least have some towels
we could sit on?

416
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,622
It's, like, a four-hour game.

417
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:13,003
George, Scott's gonna drop by.
He said he never got his boxes.

418
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,699
I'll get the towels.

419
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:20,436
<i>How am I gonna get out of this?
Think, Costanza. Think!</i>

420
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,181
- Here we are.
- Hey.

421
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,943
Do you know, Bonnie, I-

422
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,851
I just had a pretty wild idea.

423
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,720
- What is it?
- Well, I-

424
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,420
I'm not sure how you
pronounce it or anything, but I-

425
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,393
<i>I believe it's ménage à trois?</i>

426
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,558
What?

427
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,133
- Hi.
- Scott.

428
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,501
Remember what we talked about
the other day?

429
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,939
George is into it.

430
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,578
Oh, really?

431
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,963
Great streak of luck I'm having.

432
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:18,364
First Kramer almost beats me at Risk,
but I narrowly escape...

433
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,472
...and then Tim Whatley
gives me this Super Bowl ticket.

434
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,574
Can you move over at all?

435
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,267
And then-
Then, just as I'm about to go...

436
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:31,280
...these boxes show up
at the post office with no labels.

437
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,551
No labels, Jerry.
You know what that means?

438
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,950
Freebies!

439
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,919
I got this great mini TV and a VCR.

440
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,959
- It's unbelievable.
- An inch.

441
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,030
- Can you move over an inch?
- Oh, come on.
