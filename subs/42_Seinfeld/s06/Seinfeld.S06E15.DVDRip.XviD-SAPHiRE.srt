414
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,677
- What's today?
- It's Thursday.

415
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,344
Really?

416
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,650
It feels like Tuesday.

417
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,259
Tuesday has no feel.

418
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,362
Monday has a feel.

419
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,426
Friday has a feel.

420
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:14,826
Sunday has a feel.

421
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,060
- I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Shut up, the both of you.

422
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,567
You double dipped the chip.

423
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,002
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?

424
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,439
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

425
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,737
...and you dipped again.

426
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,444
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth...

427
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,641
...right in the dip.

428
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:40,557
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

429
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,384
Could I offer you
something to drink?

430
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:47,260
Okay, yeah. I'll have a...
Do you have a decaf cappuccino?

431
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,599
I don't think we have that.

432
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,905
Well, that's a little strange.

433
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:59,376
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.

434
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:03,543
- This is an office.
- That's true.

435
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,076
Magellan? You like Magellan?

436
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,743
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

437
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,115
- Who do you like?
- I like de Soto.

438
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,892
- De Soto? What did he do?
- Discovered the Mississippi.

439
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,325
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

440
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,090
I was talking to this guy,
and I just happened to throw...

441
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,494
...my purse on the sofa.

442
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,501
And my diaphragm goes flying out.

443
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,070
So I just froze, you know:

444
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,041
Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.

445
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,238
So this woman who sold me
this hair thing...

446
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,941
...she grabbed it before
the guy noticed, so, I mean...

447
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,313
...big deal, right?

448
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,251
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?

449
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,517
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret...

450
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,991
...that women carry around
their diaphragms.

451
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,994
You never know when
you're gonna need it.

452
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,269
I hate Keith Hernandez.

453
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,273
- Hate him!
- I despise him.

454
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,411
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you why.

455
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,909
- Let me tell her.
- You can't -

456
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,808
- You always tell it.
- All right, tell it.

457
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,279
- You just tell it.
- All right.

458
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,110
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

459
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,552
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

460
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,159
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

461
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,195
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

462
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,333
Our day was ruined.

463
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,628
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

464
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,294
Now we're coming down the ramp.

465
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,270
<i>Newman was in front of me.</i>

466
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,534
<i>Hernandez was coming toward us.</i>

467
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,171
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, "Nice game, pretty boy."

468
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,817
<i>Hernandez continued past us
up the ramp.</i>

469
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,979
Then, a second later,
something happened...

470
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,116
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

471
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,057
...from that day forward.

472
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,863
- What was it?
- He spit on us!

473
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,234
<i>And I screamed out, "I'm hit!"</i>

474
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:11,367
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

475
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,837
What a story.

476
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,812
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

477
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,452
...the whole premise of your account.

478
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,282
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

479
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,050
...as I've heard this story
a number of times.

480
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,388
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

481
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,727
According to your story...

482
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,890
...Hernandez passes you
and starts walking up the ramp.

483
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,394
Then you say you were struck...

484
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,904
...on the right temple.

485
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,506
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

486
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,737
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the forth rib.

487
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,212
The spit then came off the rib...

488
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,718
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

489
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,722
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

490
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,958
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

491
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,122
...in midair, mind you...

492
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:14,301
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

493
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,802
That is one magic loogie.

494
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,988
Story is the foundation
of all entertainment.

495
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,523
And people really have
to care about the characters.

496
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,558
Care? Forget about care. Love.

497
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,286
They have to love them.

498
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,431
Now, get the hell out of my house.

499
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,035
Quiet! You shut up!

500
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,670
At this moment, you're banned
from the store. Banned!

501
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,705
It's a pizza the moment
you put your fists in the dough.

502
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,741
I have a hair on my tongue.

503
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,345
Can't get it off.

504
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,105
You know how much I hate that?

505
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,648
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.

506
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,048
Yeah. Just keep out
of my business, you big ape.

507
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,120
Who you calling "big ape"?

508
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,519
I'm calling you an ape.

509
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,455
All right, break it up.
Come on, you two.

510
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,220
Just cut it out now.

511
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:14,661
But you put on a pair of shoes
in the New York Public Library, fella.

512
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,661
We had a funny guy with us in Korea.

513
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,770
A tail gunner.

514
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,873
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

515
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,472
There's nothing funny about that.

516
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,913
We will annex Poland by the spring
at any cost!

517
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,850
And our stock will rise high.

518
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,824
You think you're an idiot,
but with all due respect...

519
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,824
...I'm a much bigger idiot
than you are.

520
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,793
Don't insult me, my friend.
Remember who you're talking to.

521
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,523
No one's a bigger idiot than me.

522
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,395
Am I a hipster doofus?

523
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,195
- No.
- No.

524
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,894
Said I'm not good-looking enough.

525
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,667
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me. Look at my face.

526
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,902
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?

527
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,614
- You're very attractive.
- Yeah.

528
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,515
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?

529
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,950
We're not gay.

530
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,521
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

531
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,091
- No, of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.

532
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,251
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have many gay friends.

533
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,693
- My father's gay.
- Look...

534
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,161
...I know what I heard.

535
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,960
- Heard. It was a joke.
- Look, you wanna have sex right now?

536
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,899
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

537
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,208
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

538
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:37,108
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

539
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,117
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No. No steam.

540
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,481
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

541
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,782
- You've faked?
- On occasion.

542
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,084
- And the guy never knows?
- No.

543
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,284
How can he not know that?

544
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,862
Because I was good.

545
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,328
I guess after that many beers,
he's probably a little groggy anyway.

546
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,870
Well, you didn't know.

547
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,973
What's that?

548
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,409
You didn't know.

549
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,483
- Are you saying-?
- I think I'll have a piece of cake.

550
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,118
- With me?
- Well...

551
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,117
- You faked with me?
- Yeah.

552
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,812
- You faked with me?
- Yes.

553
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,390
- No. You faked it?
- Yes. I faked it.

554
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,255
That whole thing, the whole
production, it was all an act?

555
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,924
Not bad, huh?

556
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,158
What about the breathing, the panting,
the moaning, the screaming?

557
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,327
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

558
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,803
I'm disturbed. I'm depressed.

559
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,603
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

560
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,905
Can't you see what's happened?

561
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,641
I've become George.

562
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,306
Don't say that.

563
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,817
It's true. I'm George.

564
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,512
I'm George.

565
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,122
Tuna on toast, coleslaw...

566
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,259
- ...cup of coffee.
- Yeah.

567
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,520
No, no, wait a minute.
I always have tuna on toast.

568
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,631
Nothing's every worked out for me
with tuna on toast.

569
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,530
I want the complete opposite
of tuna on toast.

570
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,670
Chicken salad on rye...

571
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,832
...untoasted, with a side
of potato salad...

572
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,705
...and a cup of tea.

573
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:17,541
Well, there's no telling
what can happen from this.

574
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,342
Chicken salad's
not the opposite of tuna.

575
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,849
Salmon's the opposite of tuna
because salmon swim...

576
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,581
...against the current,
and the tuna swim with it.

577
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,993
Good for the tuna.

578
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,754
George, you know that woman
just looked at you.

579
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,398
So what?
What am I supposed to do?

580
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,196
Go talk to her.

581
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,170
Elaine, bald men with no jobs
and no money...

582
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,809
...who live with their parents...

583
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,577
...don't approach strange women.

584
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,481
Try the opposite.
Instead of tuna salad...

585
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,140
...and being intimidated by women,
chicken salad...

586
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,255
- ...and going right up to them.
- Yeah, I should do the opposite.

587
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,152
If every instinct you have is wrong...

588
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,294
...then the opposite
would have to be right.

589
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,520
Yes.

590
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,564
I will do the opposite.

591
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,066
I used to sit here and do nothing
and regret it for the rest of the day.

592
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:17,174
So now I will do the opposite,
and I will do something.

593
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,573
Excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice that...

594
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,618
- ...you were looking in my direction.
- Oh, yes, I was.

595
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,381
You just ordered
the same exact lunch as me.

596
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,686
My name is George.

597
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,091
I'm unemployed,
and I live with my parents.

598
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,901
I'm Victoria. Hi.

599
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,805
Catch phrases

600
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,603
Boy, these pretzels
are making me thirsty.

601
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,179
These pretzels are making me thirsty.

602
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,509
These pretzels...

603
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,115
...are making me thirsty!

604
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,949
Boy, I'm really starting to
dislike the Drake.

605
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,112
Hate the Drake!

606
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,789
You are so good-looking.

607
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,088
You can't believe her.
She's one of these low-talkers.

608
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,594
Because he's a high talker.

609
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,255
He's nice. Bit of a close talker.

610
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,162
How about you, Jerry?

611
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,964
I'm swamped.

612
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,595
You sure? You can examine
the artwork up close.

613
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,708
I don't have a square to spare.

614
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,639
I can't spare a square.

615
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,608
I need hand! I have no hand!

616
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,145
- Newman.
- Newman.

617
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,012
- Newman.
- Hello, Newman.

618
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,743
So you're still master
of your domain.

619
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,548
Yes. Master of my domain.

620
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,714
I am king of the county.

621
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,291
Lord of the manor.

622
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,826
I'm queen of the castle.

623
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,656
- You mean shrinkage.
- Yes.

624
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,459
Significant shrinkage.

625
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,467
So you feel you were shortchanged?

626
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,162
Yes.

627
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,070
If she thinks that's me, she's under
a complete misapprehension.

628
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,073
Well, so, what's the difference?

629
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,702
- What if she discusses it with Jane?
- Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.

630
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,849
Could you tell her about
the shrinkage factor?

631
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,814
I'm not gonna tell her
about your shrinkage.

632
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,887
Besides, I think women know
about shrinkage.

633
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,682
How do women know
about shrinkage?

634
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,848
Isn't it common knowledge?

635
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,288
- Elaine.
- Elaine.

636
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,929
Elaine!

637
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,195
- What?
- Do women know about shrinkage?

638
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,892
What do you mean, like laundry?

639
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:26,892
No.

640
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,201
Like when a man goes swimming,
afterwards...

641
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,204
It shrinks?

642
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,549
Like a frightened turtle.

643
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,516
- Why does it shrink?
- It just does.

644
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,054
I don't know how you guys
walk around with those things.

645
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,436
- About the script.

646
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:03,131
The script. Now, I've read
this thing three times.

647
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,467
Yeah.

648
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,735
And every time I read it...

649
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,610
What?

650
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,549
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?

651
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:20,179
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.

652
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,492
You think he liked it?

653
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,058
I'm not sure.

654
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,673
The air conditioner!

655
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,156
My mother caught me.

656
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,460
Caught you? Doing what?

657
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,832
You know.

658
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,842
I was alone...

659
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,642
You mean-?

660
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,840
- She caught you?
- Where?

661
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,349
I stopped by the house
to drop the car off...

662
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,613
...and I went inside
for a few minutes.

663
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,915
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.

664
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,851
<i>My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.</i>

665
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,157
<i>Glamour?</i>

666
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,392
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?

667
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,437
First she screams, "George,
what are you doing? My God!"

668
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,974
Looked like she was gonna faint.

669
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,940
She started clutching the wall,
trying to hang onto it.

670
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,172
I didn't know whether to keep her
from falling or zip up.

671
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,247
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.

672
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,285
- So she fell?
- Yeah.

673
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,182
Well, I couldn't run over there
the way I was.

674
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,120
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.

675
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,195
So she fell, and then she starts
screaming, "My back, my back!"

676
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,456
I picked her up.
I took her to the hospital.

677
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,535
- How is she?
- She's in traction.

678
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,499
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.

679
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,765
I know. I'm sorry. It's serious.

680
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,501
Her back went out. She's gotta
be there for a couple days.

681
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,168
<i>Glamour?</i>

682
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,275
I'll tell you this, though:

683
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,416
I am never doing...

684
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,381
...that again.

685
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,077
What? You mean in your mother's
house or altogether?

686
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,621
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.

687
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,918
Yeah, right.

688
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,561
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.

689
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:16,257
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.

690
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,735
Care to make it interesting?

691
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,268
Sure. How much?

692
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,661
Hundred dollars?

693
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,029
You're on.

694
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,644
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Count me in on this.

695
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:31,111
You? You'll be out before we
get the check.

696
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,541
I want in on this.

697
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,950
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.

698
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,384
- It's different.
- Why? Why?

699
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,616
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?

700
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,353
It's easier for a woman not to do it
than a man. We have to do it.

701
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,430
It's part of our lifestyle.

702
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,991
It's like shaving.

703
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:54,296
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.

704
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,236
Not every day.

705
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,437
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.

706
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,807
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1. You gotta put up $200.

707
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,210
No. A thousand.

708
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,874
No. I'll put up 150.

709
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,953
- All right. You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.

710
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,589
How we gonna monitor this?

711
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,385
Obviously, we all know each
other very well.

712
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:20,895
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within
the confines of the honor system.

713
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,391
All right. Come on.

714
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,130
Fire!

715
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,675
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

716
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,676
...bubble boy.

717
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,846
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.

718
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,590
Amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

719
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,825
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

720
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,731
<i>Yankee bean. Yankee bean.</i>

721
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:12,378
<i>I like my Yankee bean.</i>

722
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,781
In fact, I hate anyone that ever had
a pony when they were growing up.

723
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,581
I had a pony.

724
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,822
Well, I didn't...

725
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,791
When I was a little girl in Poland...

726
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,295
...we all had ponies.

727
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,229
My sister had pony.

728
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,266
My cousin had pony.

729
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,030
- So, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

730
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,733
He was a beautiful pony,
and I loved him.

731
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,810
Well, I'm sure you did.
Who wouldn't love a pony?

732
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,641
Who wouldn't love a person
that had a pony?

733
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,079
You. You said so.

734
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,809
It's my father's cabin!

735
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:54,452
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

736
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,786
So you heard that
I was in a car accident...

737
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,522
...and then decided to stop off
for some Jujyfruit?

738
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,696
Well...

739
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,759
...the counter was right there.

740
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,497
I didn't know she had a pony.

741
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,740
Who figures an immigrant
is gonna have a pony?

742
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,904
I mean, in all the pictures I saw
of immigrants on boats...

743
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,879
...coming into New York Harbor...

744
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,280
...I never saw one of them
sitting on a pony.

745
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,614
But why would anyone come here
if they had a pony?

746
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,421
Who leaves a country packed with
ponies to go to a non-pony country?

747
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,091
It doesn't make sense.

748
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,300
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity...

749
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,905
...exposing the body's
internal organs.

750
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,903
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.

751
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,409
- You want one?
- No.

752
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,275
Now, I can't see.

753
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,286
Could you get-?

754
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,183
Where'd you get those?

755
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,828
- The machine. You want one?
- No.

756
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,759
- Here. Take one.
- I don't want one.

757
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,365
- They're good.
- I don't want any.

758
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,866
- Just take one.
- No. Stop- Kramer, stop it.

759
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,875
It's a Junior Mint.

760
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,204
Drake's Coffee Cake?

761
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,811
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.

762
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,709
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.

763
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,906
- PEZ?
- No.

764
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,311
A box of Jujyfruits?

765
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,385
- Clark Bar.
- I love Yoo-hoo.

766
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,714
- Oh, Chunkys.
- Chocolate babka.

767
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:32,719
It's Gore-Tex.

768
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,051
- Cashmere?
- No, Gore-Tex.

769
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,490
Who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

770
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,626
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.

771
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:43,323
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.

772
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,396
What's going on over here?

773
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,161
There's a beached whale.
She's dying.

774
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,932
Is anyone here a marine biologist?

775
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,638
The sea was angry that day,
my friends.

776
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,920
Like an old man trying
to send back soup in a deli.

777
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,055
I got about 50 feet out,
when suddenly...

778
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,222
...the great beast
appeared before me.

779
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,528
I tell you, he was 10 stories high
if he was a foot.

780
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,398
As if sensing my presence,
he let out a great bellow.

781
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,633
I said, "Easy, big fella."

782
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,811
And then, as I watched
him struggling, I realized...

783
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,211
...that something was obstructing
its breathing.

784
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,581
From where I was standing, I could
see into the eye of the great fish.

785
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,086
- Mammal.
- Whatever.

786
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,855
- What did you do next?
- Well, then...

787
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,961
...from out of nowhere,
a huge tidal wave lifted me...

788
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,121
...tossed me like a cork,
and I found myself on top of him...

789
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,891
...face to face with the blowhole.

790
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,434
I could barely see from the waves
crashing down upon me...

791
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,630
...but I knew something was there.

792
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,399
So I reached my hand in...

793
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,943
...felt around, and pulled out
the obstruction.

794
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,299
What is that, a Titleist?

795
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,973
A hole in one, huh?

796
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,602
We go into NBC, tell them we got
an idea for a show about nothing.

797
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,405
- Exactly.
- "What's your show about?"

798
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,639
- I say, "Nothing."
- There you go.

799
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,114
I think you may have something here.

800
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,648
Why don't you two go to the movies
by yourselves. I'm not in the mood.

801
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,982
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

802
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,249
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.

803
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,861
Well, I can't go to a bad movie
by myself.

804
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,796
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

805
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,367
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

806
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:36,233
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for? Let's just get out of here.

807
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,004
Seinfeld, four!
