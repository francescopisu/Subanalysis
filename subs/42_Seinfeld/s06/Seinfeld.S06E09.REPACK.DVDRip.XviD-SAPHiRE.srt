1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,167
What's supposed to be
so attractive about fur?

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,705
Why does a man
wanna see a woman in fur?

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,810
Men want women with shaved legs,
shaved armpits, plucked eyebrows.

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,674
Then before we go out,
we dress them up like a bear?

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,181
To me, the only reason to wear fur...

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,285
...would be if you were trying
to sneak up on another animal.

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,921
You ever see those tribal hunters
wearing the fur...

8
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,820
...with the other animal's head
on top of their head, you know?

9
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,156
I'm sure there's a moose looking at
that going, "Yeah. That looks good.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,391
Yeah. I'm gonna turn my back
on this goofball with the extra head...

11
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,262
...because there's nothing
fishy there.

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,336
I'll just keep drinking
from the stream.

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,906
I've seen a lot of two-headed
tigers with knees."

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,309
So I am actually gonna have
a secretary.

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,711
- And I get to do the interview.
- It's incredible.

16
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,749
You were taking messages
for your mother.

17
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,410
And now someone's gonna be
taking messages for me.

18
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,954
From your mother.

19
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,388
So this woman you plan on hiring...

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,994
...is she gonna be
in the spokesmodel category?

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,831
Sure, I could go the tomato route...

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,160
...but I've given this
a lot of thought, Jerry.

23
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,996
All that frustration,
I'll never get any work done.

24
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,071
So I'm doing a complete 360.

25
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,605
I'm going for total
efficiency and ability.

26
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,037
That's a 180, George.

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,677
Whatever.

28
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,837
- Hi, Willie.
- Hey, Jerry.

29
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,242
I got this stuff...

30
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,316
- ...and my mother's fur for storage.
- What are you doing with it?

31
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,181
She keeps it with me
for when she comes up from Florida.

32
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,582
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,417
Jerry, you know my wife, Donna.

34
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,491
Yeah. That's why I said "hi."

35
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,786
Hey, nice jacket.

36
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,328
Thanks. Houndstooth.

37
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,255
This is a beauty.

38
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,459
- Great cut. It's probably very flattering.
- Oh, yes.

39
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,196
It really accentuates
my bust line.

40
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,634
Well, I type about
90 words a minute.

41
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,971
I'm completely well-versed in all
the IBM and Macintosh programs.

42
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,376
Well, Miss Coggins, you're
obviously qualified for the job.

43
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,676
You have all the necessary skills
and experience...

44
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,480
...but you're extremely attractive.
You're gorgeous.

45
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,487
I'm looking at you,
I can't even remember my name.

46
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,786
So I'm afraid this is not
gonna work out. Thanks for coming.

47
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,987
You're luscious.
You're ravishing.

48
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,622
I would give up red meat just to get
a glimpse of you in a bra.

49
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,065
I'm terribly sorry. Terribly sorry.

50
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,361
As you can see, my references
are impeccable.

51
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,336
I think I'd be a real asset here.

52
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,635
My only concern is,
I do take care of my mother.

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,835
So will there be many late nights?

54
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,709
I can't imagine.

55
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,582
Okay. So Barneys is having
this huge sale.

56
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,218
I try this dress on.

57
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,286
Stunning. Stunning.

58
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,549
I couldn't take my eyes off myself.

59
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,216
- Yeah?
- Okay. So then I put it on at home...

60
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,022
...it looks like I'm carrying twins.

61
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,731
So you're saying, store, hotsy-totsy,
Home, hotsy-notsy.

62
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,201
Yeah, exactly.
Anyway, I gotta go there and return it.

63
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,032
I thought we were going
to the movies.

64
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,266
All right. I'll try it on again.
You tell me what you think.

65
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,610
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, George.

66
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,268
Hey, Elaine.

67
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,847
I am telling you, Jerry,
having a secretary is incredible.

68
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,882
Don't know why I didn't
have one before.

69
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,111
Because you didn't have a job?

70
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,917
Perhaps.

71
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,955
I walk in, everything is organized.

72
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,354
Messages, appointments.

73
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,054
I can't tell you how proud I am
of myself for going with Ada.

74
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,698
A lesser man would've crumbled.

75
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,358
They would've gone for the dish and
the sure-fire sexual harassment suit.

76
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,966
- It's a little-
- All right.

77
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,441
You answered it right there.

78
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,136
You got no waist in that thing.

79
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,909
And your arms look like something
hanging in a kosher deli.

80
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,480
I said, all right.

81
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,747
- Well, why'd you buy it for?
- Why did I buy it?

82
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,790
Because in the mirror at Barneys,
I looked fabulous.

83
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,723
This woman who was just
walking by...

84
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,625
<i>...said I looked like Demi Moore
in Indecent Proposal.</i>

85
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,629
How fast was she walking?

86
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,696
"Demi"?

87
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,564
I thought it was "Demi."

88
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,462
No, I think it's "Demi."

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,164
Really?

90
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,368
I never heard of
a" semi" tractor-trailer.

91
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,175
Wait a minute.

92
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,476
Wait a minute.
I know what's going on here.

93
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,142
- Skinny mirrors.
- What?

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,652
Skinny mirrors.
Barneys has skinny mirrors.

95
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,757
They make you look,
like, 10 pounds lighter.

96
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,449
Oh, you're crazy.

97
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,855
Am I?

98
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,428
Do you think I would've
bought this dress...

99
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,827
...if I looked like this at Barneys?

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,195
You know, I think
she may have something.

101
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,472
What are you all dressed up for?

102
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,666
I'm returning this dress to Barneys.

103
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,367
Good idea.

104
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,940
Do it tomorrow.
We'll go to the movies.

105
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,706
- Yeah. Okay.
- Hey, if you're going...

106
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,476
...maybe you can pick me up
some of this super-hydrating-

107
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,179
It's a total-protection moisturizer
with UVA. Yeah.

108
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,917
- Moisturizer? That's girl stuff.
- No. Look, I'll tell you what.

109
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,684
- They're having a sale, right?
- Yeah.

110
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,795
I'll meet you down there.
We'll have lunch.

111
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,957
- Well, we could-
- Yeah, we'll get to know each other.

112
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,226
We never get to spend
any time together.

113
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,769
Oh, sure. We have
our little group here, but...

114
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,837
And then, assuming
the strike is resolved...

115
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,638
...on April 14th,
we play the Angels.

116
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,441
So let's clear a floor
at the Anaheim Hotel.

117
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,551
Anaheim Hotel.
You may wanna reconsider.

118
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,085
I believe they only have
room service until 10 p.m...

119
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,654
...then it's only finger foods.

120
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,050
Ada, you're a wonder.

121
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,994
Okay. Now, I projected those figures
for you regarding the switch...

122
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,893
...to canola oil for stadium popcorn.

123
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,762
And surprisingly, it'll only cost
half a cent more per bag...

124
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,334
...so it is definitely doable.

125
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,729
Ada, I have to tell you, I have
never met anybody so efficient.

126
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,069
Well, thank you. I'm flattered.

127
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,205
You're just a marvel of organization.

128
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,441
Well, I'm just doing my job.

129
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,477
It's like I'm -
I'm thinking of something...

130
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,588
...and you're one step ahead of me.

131
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,986
What can I say? I'm...

132
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,592
I'm good at what I do.

133
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,923
Do you...?

134
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,826
Do you know what I'm...

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,800
...thinking about now?

136
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,335
Yes. I think I do.

137
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,731
Is it...

138
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,139
...doable?

139
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,474
It's definitely doable.

140
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,115
Well, that was the worst.

141
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,521
I can't believe they made
the wife the killer.

142
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,184
- Give me a break.
- Hey.

143
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,455
Give us a break.
We haven't seen it yet.

144
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,724
- Thanks a lot, bigmouth.
- Yeah.

145
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,458
- You got a pen?
- Yeah. I think I do.

146
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,360
And I need something to write on.

147
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,402
Well, all I got is
my dry-cleaning stub.

148
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,800
I just met Uma Thurman.

149
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,738
She's giving me her telephone
number. Uma, Jerry. Uma.

150
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,470
- Uma Thurman? Really?
- How'd you manage that?

151
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,910
Yeah. Well, I-
I don't have any time to talk now.

152
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,274
He's got the kavorca.

153
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,447
- Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry cleaner?
- Where?

154
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,488
He just went in.

155
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,120
You know, I-

156
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,490
I think he was wearing
my houndstooth jacket.

157
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,657
What would he be doing
wearing your jacket?

158
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,768
It looked just like the jacket
I brought in to be dry-cleaned.

159
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,528
He complimented me on it.

160
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,569
- Are you sure?
- I got it.

161
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,765
Uma, Uma, Uma.

162
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,603
- You are amazing.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,473
All right. Taxi's on me.

164
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,646
No, no, no. A better way
to reach the bra...

165
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,154
...would be to undo the jacket
then go around the back of the shirt.

166
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,722
Ada, you're incredible.

167
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,762
Here. I wanna show you something.

168
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,869
Hand me that pillow.

169
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,636
Here.

170
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,340
What?

171
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,706
Oh, my God.

172
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,607
Mr. Costanza.

173
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,372
Ada.

174
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,181
- I'm giving you a raise!
- Yes!

175
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,719
So you're having sex,
then all of a sudden you just blurt out:

176
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,724
"I'm giving you a raise"?

177
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,426
Yeah.

178
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,820
Just a quick sidebar here.

179
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,023
Are you in any way
authorized to give raises?

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,498
- Not that I'm aware of.
- No.

181
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,568
So you're so grateful to have sex,
you'll shout out anything...

182
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,332
...that comes into your head.

183
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,238
I didn't think ahead.

184
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,571
Well, maybe she'll just think
it was bawdy talk.

185
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,581
I didn't say any other bawdy things.

186
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,482
Maybe you could have sex
with her again and then take it back.

187
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,581
All right. You're not
any help at all here.

188
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,553
I don't know the point
of talking to you.

189
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,920
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

190
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,894
Yeah. Well, the only thing I can do
is to go to George Steinbrenner...

191
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,929
...and tell him he has
to give her a raise.

192
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,261
- How long has she been there?
- Three days.

193
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,999
- It's almost a week.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,909
Oh, my God.

195
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,410
- What?
- It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show.

196
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,449
George, I think Willie the dry cleaner's
been wearing my clothes.

197
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,250
These mirrors are skinny mirrors.

198
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,121
This is false...

199
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,555
...reflecting.

200
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,825
And I think that the department of...

201
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,696
...you know, whatever...

202
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,772
...would be very interested
to know what's going on here.

203
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,941
Well, we're more than happy
to exchange it for something else.

204
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,942
Okay. Fine.

205
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,206
I did like that little
Calvin Klein number...

206
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,282
...right by the elevator,
with the little-

207
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,818
- I'll bring it to your dressing room.
- Okay. Thanks so much.

208
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,850
What are you all dressed up for?

209
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,458
Well, Elaine, when you're
shopping on Madison Avenue...

210
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,754
...you don't wanna skimp
on the swank.

211
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,753
I like your little bag.

212
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,593
Oh, yeah. Hey, look at this.

213
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:06,704
This is a super-hydrating,
triple-action moisturizer, huh?

214
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,863
Wait till that Uma smells this UVA.

215
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,842
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, Bania. What's happening?

216
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,614
I'm looking for a new suit,
but I can't find anything I like.

217
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,920
- That's a nice suit.
- Well, thank you.

218
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,749
- Did you get that here?
- No, no, no.

219
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,221
This is vintage.
They don't make this stuff anymore.

220
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,223
- You're telling me.
- I sure am.

221
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,755
It's hard to find pants-

222
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,988
- That don't make you high-waisted?
- Yes.

223
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,825
- Me too.
- What size are you?

224
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,932
- Forty-two.
- Forty-two? That's what I am now.

225
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,071
I've been working out. I'm huge.

226
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,039
How'd you like to sell it?

227
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,066
Make me an offer.

228
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,174
- One hundred bucks.
- Surely you jest.

229
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,638
One seventy-five?

230
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,283
Look at the stitching.

231
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,352
This is old-world craftsmanship.

232
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,111
- Three hundred dollars.
- Sold.

233
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,190
- Follow me into the dressing room.
- You'll throw the shirt in?

234
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,350
Bania, you're killing me.

235
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,424
Hey, that's the women's
dressing room.

236
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,588
There's nothing there
I haven't seen before.

237
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,037
Mr. Steinbrenner?

238
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,874
Can I talk to you for a second?

239
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,841
Yes. Yes, George.
Can you talk to me?

240
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,003
Of course you can.
I'm a very accessible man.

241
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,945
I just wanna say you're doing great
on that canola-oil stuff.

242
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,982
Well, you know,
to be honest, sir, my-

243
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,383
My new secretary, Ada,
came up with that one.

244
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,046
Ada. Ada. I like that name, George.

245
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,885
She supports her whole family.

246
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,687
- Is that a fact, George?
- Yes.

247
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,624
In fact, her mother's in the hospital.

248
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,924
It's some kind of a diverticulitis.

249
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,626
I had about of that myself one time,
knocked me right on my ass.

250
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,237
She can't even afford
to go out to lunch. She-

251
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,339
She's been eating
in high school cafeterias.

252
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,941
She pretends to be a teacher.
It's pathetic.

253
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,805
What does that cost?
Two and a quarter?

254
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,812
You know, I was just thinking
that she could really use a raise.

255
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,450
She'd be better off making
a sandwich and bringing it.

256
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,051
Hello?

257
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,211
George, will you excuse me?

258
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,660
Kramer. What are you doing?

259
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,027
Listen, I need you
to get me some clothes.

260
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,759
- What?
- Yeah. I just sold my suit...

261
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,494
...to Bania for a cool 300.

262
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,335
So go buy a new one.

263
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,100
At this place?
It would destroy my profit margin.

264
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,774
- So?
- Listen, do me a favor. Just call Jerry.

265
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,140
Tell him to bring me some clothes.

266
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,048
- Hello, Willie.
- Hey, Jerry.

267
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,954
- You're dropping off.
- No...

268
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,688
...but seen any good movies lately?

269
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,528
- You came by to ask that?
- Yeah.

270
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,429
Specifically, 9:30 shows.

271
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,368
Seen any good 9:30 shows
at the Paragon, Willie?

272
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,302
- What are you getting at?
- I saw you...

273
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,772
...stepping out
with my houndstooth jacket.

274
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,379
Jerry, that's a breach
of the dry cleaners' code.

275
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,039
You need a code to tell you
not to wear people's clothes?

276
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,708
I wasn't wearing your jacket.

277
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,379
- Jerry, you're imagining things.
- Yeah.

278
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,650
Am I imagining this?

279
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,061
Found that little cutie in the pocket.

280
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,787
- Jerry, I-
- Yeah. Well, now that...

281
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,660
...we understand each other,
I'll take my business elsewhere.

282
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,769
- I want my mother's fur coat back too.
- Jerry, come on.

283
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,633
- Now.
- Now?

284
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,414
Yeah. I want that coat.

285
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,278
- Well-
- Where's the ticket?

286
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,115
- Kramer.
- Wait a minute.

287
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:45,587
You mean to tell me that
you don't have a ticket for the coat?

288
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,316
No. Not on me.

289
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,924
Well, I need to see that ticket.

290
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,824
Why? I've gotten cleaning without it.

291
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,897
Yeah, but this is different.

292
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,058
Those fur-storage warehouses
are huge.

293
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,171
You can't get anything
without a number.

294
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,267
All right. I'll be back.

295
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,571
Yeah. It looks good here,
but what does that mean?

296
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,681
So do you want it?

297
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,082
I don't know. I have to think about it.

298
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,448
I need a nonpartisan mirror.

299
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,635
I can't thank you enough,
Mr. Costanza.

300
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,898
- I'm so grateful.
- Yes. Well...

301
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,008
...I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner.

302
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,007
I told him you have
been doing great work.

303
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,874
I said that you deserved a raise,
and if you didn't get it...

304
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,641
...that I was leaving.

305
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,574
It was just so generous.

306
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,050
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's got plenty of money.

307
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,816
Oh, I know, but 25,000.

308
00:14:56,161 --> 00:15:00,530
- So you got a $25,000-a-year raise?
- Yes.

309
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,893
- Oh, I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner-
- You're making more than I am.

310
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,799
- I am?
- A secretary cannot make more...

311
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,669
- ...than her boss.
- Well, apparently they can.

312
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,751
Oh, this is insanity.

313
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,223
I'm not this hip-y.

314
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,852
Hey. Hey, what do you think of this?

315
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,996
You'll never pull it off.

316
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,292
Hey. What's going on in there?

317
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,029
Excuse me. Could you tell me where I
could find women's moisturizer lotions?

318
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,166
This woman's been in there
for over an hour.

319
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,608
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything okay in there?

320
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,113
Yeah.

321
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,545
- Kramer?
- Jerry. You got my clothes?

322
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,787
- What clothes?
- Didn't Elaine call you?

323
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,360
No.

324
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,256
Well, what are you doing here?

325
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,764
What am I doing here?
You're in the women's dressing room.

326
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,903
I need that ticket stub back so I can
get my mother's fur coat out.

327
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,040
The stub. Yeah.
I left it in my- My pants.

328
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,109
- Where are your pants?
- Well, I sold them to Bania.

329
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,143
What? You sold your pants
to Bania? Let me in.

330
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,510
Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?

331
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,916
I had Uma Thurman's number
written on that stub.

332
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,351
I lost Uma's number.

333
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,583
- Where are your clothes?
- I told you, I sold them to Bania.

334
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,220
- You mean, what you were wearing?
- Yeah.

335
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,024
How'd you expect
to get out of here?

336
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,698
Well, I didn't think ahead.

337
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,401
This-This isn't gonna work for me.

338
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,944
So if you could show me
something else.

339
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,609
No.

340
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,283
- No?
- No. Because you're taking that one.

341
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,615
- I am?
- Yes. You wore it outside.

342
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,225
That's preposterous.

343
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:13,263
Well, I suppose that salt stain
came from all the snow in the store.

344
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,760
Shall I wrap it,
or will you wear it out?

345
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,801
No. You can wrap it.

346
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,804
- Kramer, you still in there?
- Elaine?

347
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,006
Jerry?

348
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,979
- Elaine, where's Kramer?
- Bania?

349
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,085
- Kramer?
- I'm going out.

350
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,343
- Jerry.
- Bania.

351
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,683
Kramer, I want my money back
for this suit.

352
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,984
Your nancy-boy cream leaked
all over the pockets.

353
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,492
- Suit's ruined.
- You're not getting any money back.

354
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,392
- Jerry, come back.
- Excuse me.

355
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,960
- Uma's number's on that ticket.
- Never mind Uma.

356
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,103
I need that ticket
to get my mother's coat.

357
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,795
Why not just give him the money?

358
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:58,909
I'm not giving him $300 now for a suit
with moisturizer cream all over it.

359
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,370
- I got an idea.
- What?

360
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,141
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.

361
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,917
Can I talk to you for a second?

362
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,283
How's everything going?

363
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,952
- Pretty good.
- Yeah.

364
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,648
See, the thing is,
I'm in an awkward position here...

365
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,954
...because I don't wanna get
between you two guys...

366
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,360
...but I need a dry-cleaning ticket
that's in the pocket of those pants.

367
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,126
All you gotta do is tell Kramer
to give me my money back...

368
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,702
- ...and you'll get your ticket.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,671
Yeah, all right.
Well, tell you what I will do, Bania.

370
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,469
You give me the ticket...

371
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,807
...and I will take you out
for a nice dinner.

372
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,174
Can we go back to Mendy's?

373
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,581
You wanna go to Mendy's,
I'll take you to Mendy's.

374
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,916
- Twice. I wanna go twice.
- All right, let's be reasonable, Bania.

375
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,854
I'm taking you out for dinner.
All I want is a little ticket.

376
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,824
- I think that's a pretty good deal.
- Two Mendy's.

377
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,792
All right.

378
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,332
- Just give me the ticket.
- Here you go.

379
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:01,969
But, Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be
expected to perform my job properly...

380
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,009
...knowing that my subordinate
is making more money than I am?

381
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,578
With all due respect, sir,
it's out of whack.

382
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,214
I understand what you're saying.

383
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,282
I know what it's like
to be strapped.

384
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,783
As a young man in Cleveland,
I hitchhiked to work.

385
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,887
One time I got picked up
by a bakery truck.

386
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,023
Think that smells good?
Try being cooped up...

387
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,419
...in one of those babies.

388
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,822
I couldn't look at a doughnut
for two years.

389
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,758
Not that I was ever one
for the sweets.

390
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,797
Sure, I like a cupcake every
now and then like everybody else.

391
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,424
You know, I like it when they have
a little cream inside. It's a surprise.

392
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,867
That's good.
Plus, the chocolate ones are good too.

393
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,836
Sometimes I can't even
make up my mind.

394
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,943
A lot of times, I'll mix the two together.
Make a vanilla-fudge.

395
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,036
Let me in, it's me.

396
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,204
Here. You don't know
what this is costing me.

397
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,010
All right. Nice work.

398
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,210
Wait. Where's Uma's number?

399
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,584
The moisturizer smudged out
the phone number.

400
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,719
The dry-cleaning number's
gone too.

401
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,054
It must have been
the botanical extracts.

402
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,026
Give me that.

403
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,394
Hey, Bania, the dinner's off.

404
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,231
The ticket's no good.
The numbers are all smudged out.

405
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,764
You trying to get out of Mendy's?

406
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,205
- You can't do that.
- The ticket is worthless.

407
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,900
You promised me.

408
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,413
Hey, isn't that my mother's fur coat?

409
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,948
- No, it's not.
- It is.

410
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,252
- Give me that back.
- What are you talking about?

411
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,262
- You out of your mind?
- Are you crazy, taking my coat?

412
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,104
What, do you think the dry cleaners
is your personal closet?

413
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,639
Hey, Donna, can you get
the salt stain out of this?

414
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,107
Let me see. Piece of cake.

415
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,577
Bring it in. What size is it?

416
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,359
This soup is great.

417
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,495
Yeah, it's very good.

418
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:10,226
I told you Mendy's had the best
pea soup. The best, Jerry. The best.

419
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,528
- Are you enjoying it?
- Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time.

420
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,536
Wait till you try the swordfish.

421
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,641
You know, Jerry, I was thinking...

422
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,505
...for our next meal, do you think
we should come here...

423
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,203
...or should we go some place else?

424
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,609
It has its pros and cons.

425
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,478
On the one hand, here,
you're guaranteed a great meal.

426
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,779
- On the other hand-
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

427
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,751
This would be good,
but it'd be the same.

428
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,153
If we go some place else, it would
be different, but maybe not as good.

429
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,318
It's a gamble. I get it.

430
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,394
Yeah.

431
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,397
Let's hurry. I gotta go.
I'm meeting a woman for a drink.

432
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,900
- Oh, and who might that be?
- Some woman named Uma.

433
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,539
I got her number off that ticket
before it was smudged.

434
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,072
Hope she's good-looking.

435
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,083
If you are a waiter or a waitress
and you see me in a restaurant...

436
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,283
...I'm telling you right now,
I don't wanna hear about the specials.

437
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,987
I don't wanna know about the specials,
I'm sick of the specials, I hate them.

438
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,998
My feeling is, if the specials were
so special, they'd be on the menu.

439
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,700
You know what's special? They don't
know if anybody likes them.

440
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,365
And they always have those overly
creative descriptions of the specials.

441
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,272
The veal is lightly slapped...

442
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,472
...and then sequestered
in a one-bedroom suite...

443
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,310
...with a white-wine intravenous.
