1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, I painted
my apartment again.

2
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:05,000
I've been living in this
apartment for years and years,

3
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:07,400
and every time I paint it,
it kind of gets me down.

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,966
I look around and think, "Well,
it's a little bit smaller now."

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,133
And I realize it's just
the thickness of the paint,

6
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,133
but I'm aware of it.

7
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,000
It just keeps coming in
and coming in.

8
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,333
Every time I paint it,
it's closer and closer.

9
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:19,500
I don't even know where
the wall outlets are anymore.

10
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,900
I just look for, like, a lump
with two slots in it.

11
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,366
It kind of looks like a pig.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,333
He's trying to push his way
through from the other side.

13
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,733
That's where I plug in.

14
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,200
My idea
of the perfect living room

15
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,200
would be the bridge
on the <i>Starship Enterprise.</i>

16
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,633
You know what I mean?

17
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,333
Big chair, nice screen,
remote control.

18
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,800
That's why <i>Star Trek</i> really was
the ultimate male fantasy...

19
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,633
just hurtling through space
in your living room,

20
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,800
watching TV.

21
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,566
That's why all the aliens
were always dropping in,

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
because Kirk was the only one
that had the big screen.

23
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,466
They'd come over Friday nights...
Klingon boxing.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,566
Got to be there.

25
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,227
What did you do?

26
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:11,727
Mousse. I moussed up.

27
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,894
I guess it was just
a matter of time.

28
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:15,861
You know, I should've done this
years ago.

29
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:17,627
I mean, I feel like
I've had two lives...

30
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,594
my premousse,
and now I begin my postmousse.

31
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,627
Truthfully, have you ever seen
a better-looking guy?

32
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:26,561
Looks, it's so subjective.

33
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:27,640
Oh, I don't mean
to interrupt or anything,

34
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:29,627
Oh, I don't mean
to interrupt or anything,

35
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,694
but on Sunday,

36
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:31,861
my friend is having a brunch

37
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:33,061
for the New York marathon...

38
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:37,727
Oh! I keep forgetting
to enter that! Gee!

39
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:40,561
She lives
right above 1st Avenue.

40
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,561
She says she has
a perfect view of the race,

41
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,361
and she said I could
invite some friends.

42
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:45,361
Maybe.

43
00:01:45,394 --> 00:01:46,927
No, I'm not going up there!

44
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,527
Harold and Manny.

45
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,527
Boys, boys.

46
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:56,561
Oh, Jerry.

47
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:57,640
I slid the rent
under your door, Harold.

48
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,927
I slid the rent
under your door, Harold.

49
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,861
Did you get it?
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:02,927
Hey, Jerry,
would you like anything

51
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,261
from Miss Hudwalker's apartment?

52
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:06,927
I was only joking.

53
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,561
He thinks I'm going to give you

54
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:09,594
Miss Hudwalker's things.

55
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:13,194
We have to go up there now
and clean the apartment.

56
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:14,794
It's a good thing
her rent was overdue.

57
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:16,927
She'd be rotting
up there for a month.

58
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:18,861
She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?

59
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,694
94 years old.
I found her yesterday.

60
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,727
She didn't have a wig on.

61
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,927
It was horrifying.

62
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,227
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking!

63
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:32,861
So, Jerry, you know anybody
who needs an apartment?

64
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,761
Are you kidding?
Do you know my friend Elaine?

65
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,294
Yeah. I like her.

66
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,194
She always says hello to me.

67
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,261
It's not promised to anyone?

68
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:40,694
Because she'd take it
in a second.

69
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,061
Well, Manny wanted it
for his brother,

70
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:44,561
but he got deported.

71
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:45,627
...deported?

72
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,261
It's <i>un pequeño</i> misunderstanding

73
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:48,461
<i>con departmento de immigracíon.</i>

74
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:50,261
What's the difference?
It's true.

75
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,694
So it's okay? I can just
tell her she can have it?

76
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,427
Sure, sure.
She's getting a bargain too.

77
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:56,461
It's only $400 a month.

78
00:02:58,894 --> 00:02:59,894
Okay.

79
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:02,027
Okay!

80
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:04,227
Hey, Harold.
What do you think?

81
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:07,694
Manny, look.
Kramer put mousse in his hair.

82
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:13,394
Thanks.

83
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:21,827
What was that all about?

84
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,861
Oh, nothing important.

85
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:27,641
What's going on?
What is that look?

86
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:30,061
What's going on?
What is that look?

87
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,727
What look?

88
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,061
Nothing.

89
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:37,761
Something's going on here.

90
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:40,227
I don't know if you should sit
for this or not.

91
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,361
Sitting is good if you faint,

92
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:46,727
but standing is good
for jumping up and down.

93
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,361
I can't decide.

94
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,694
Jumping up and down?

95
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:52,527
What are you talking about?
Come on. Cough it up.

96
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:55,194
Oh, Elaine,
you know the way I am,

97
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,640
rarely ever thinking of myself.

98
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,527
rarely ever thinking of myself.

99
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:02,461
My only concern
is the welfare and happiness

100
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:04,561
of those close to me.

101
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:06,027
Sure, it hurts sometimes

102
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:08,527
to give and give and give...

103
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,061
Would you please?

104
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:12,027
What would you say...

105
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:13,827
if I told you that...

106
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:17,227
Told me what?

107
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:19,761
I got you an apartment
in this building?

108
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,761
No!
Yes.

109
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,327
No!
Yes!

110
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,461
You didn't!
I did.

111
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:26,361
You got me an apartment
in the building?

112
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:27,640
I got you an apartment
in the building.

113
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,427
I got you an apartment
in the building.

114
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:29,427
How did you...

115
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:30,927
You remember Mrs. Hudwalker,

116
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,861
the 94-year-old woman who lived above me?
No.

117
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,461
She died.
She died?

118
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:36,461
She died!

119
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:37,727
She died!

120
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:43,227
And... the rent
is only $400 a month.

121
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:45,594
Get out!

122
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:48,761
400 a month? Only 400 a month?

123
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:49,761
400 a month.

124
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:50,894
And I'll be right upstairs?

125
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:51,894
Right upstairs.

126
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:52,894
Right above you?

127
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:53,894
Right above me.

128
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,027
Oh! Whoo-hoo! We're neighbors!

129
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,640
I'll be here all the time!

130
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,227
I'll be here all the time!

131
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:01,027
All the time.

132
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,261
We can exchange keys

133
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,027
so we can come in and out.

134
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,561
Oh, this is gonna be great.

135
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:09,427
All the time.

136
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,894
The problem with talking

137
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:13,694
is that nobody stops you
from saying the wrong thing.

138
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,727
I think
life would be a lot better

139
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,794
if it was like
you're always making a movie.

140
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,261
You mess up,

141
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,861
somebody just walks on the set
and stops the whole shot.

142
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,261
You know what I mean?

143
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,261
Think of the things
you wish you could take back.

144
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:26,361
You're out somewhere
with people.

145
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,640
"Gee, you look pregnant.
Are you?"

146
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,461
"Gee, you look pregnant.
Are you?"

147
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:32,427
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

148
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:34,361
That's not gonna work at all.

149
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,227
Walk out the door. Come back in.

150
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,027
Let's take
this whole scene again.

151
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:41,094
People, think about
what you're saying.

152
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:44,594
Thanks.
See you later, Donna.

153
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:46,694
What happened to you?

154
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:48,061
You can't believe
what I just did.

155
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:49,527
What? What did you do?

156
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,894
I could tell you what I did,
but you won't believe it.

157
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,367
It's not believable.
What did you do?

158
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,127
How could I have done that?
Done what?

159
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:57,061
I told Elaine about
an apartment opening up

160
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:57,641
in my building.

161
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:58,061
in my building.

162
00:05:58,094 --> 00:05:59,127
She's going to move in.

163
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:01,027
Elaine's moving
into your building?

164
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,527
Yes. Right above me.

165
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,027
Right above you?

166
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:05,527
You're gonna be neighbors.

167
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,094
I know. Neighbors.

168
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:08,261
She's right above you?

169
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:09,361
Right above me.

170
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:10,694
How could you do that?

171
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,194
Because I'm an idiot.

172
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,361
You may think you're an idiot,
but with all due respect,

173
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:16,227
I'm a much bigger idiot
than you are.

174
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,694
Please.
Don't insult me, my friend.

175
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,127
Remember who you're talking to.

176
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,961
No one's a bigger idiot than me.

177
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:22,194
Did you ever ask
an ex-girlfriend

178
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,261
to move into your building?

179
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:24,861
Did you ever go
to a singles' weekend

180
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,527
in the Poconos?

181
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:27,640
She's right in my building,
right above me.

182
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:29,361
She's right in my building,
right above me.

183
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:30,761
Every time I come
in the building,

184
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:32,761
I'm gonna have to sneak around
like a cat burglar.

185
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:33,927
You're doomed.

186
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,527
You're gonna have to have
all your sex

187
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,694
at women's apartments.

188
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,061
It'll be like
a permanent road trip.

189
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,227
Forget about
the home-bed advantage.

190
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,261
But I need
the home-bed advantage.

191
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:42,294
Of course.

192
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:43,527
We all do.

193
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:45,527
Come in for two minutes
and sit with me.

194
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:47,527
I was just in there.
It's embarrassing.

195
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:49,027
Oh, who's gonna know?

196
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,527
They all saw me walk out.

197
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,527
Two minutes.

198
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,027
My sensoring system broke down.

199
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:01,594
You know that little guy
in your head

200
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:02,861
who watches everything you say

201
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,461
and makes sure
you don't make a mistake?

202
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,861
He went for a cup of coffee

203
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,294
and, in that second,
ruined my life.

204
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,761
My sensor quit two years ago.

205
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:14,127
Checked into a clinic,
emotionally exhausted.

206
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,627
So is there any way out
of this Elaine thing?

207
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:17,694
It's tough.

208
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:18,794
You know, the water pressure's

209
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,861
terrible in my building,

210
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:21,061
and she loves a good shower.

211
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:22,127
I never heard of anyone

212
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,194
turning down an apartment

213
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:24,694
because of a weak shower spray.

214
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,794
If they were fanatic
about showers, they might.

215
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:27,641
For that rent,

216
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:28,061
For that rent,

217
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:29,694
she'd take a bath
in the toilet tank

218
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:30,761
if she had to.

219
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:33,427
Look at this woman
feeding her baby

220
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,694
greasy, disgusting,

221
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,794
coffee-shop
corned beef hash.

222
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,361
Isn't that child abuse?

223
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:40,961
I'd like to have a kid.

224
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:45,227
Of course, you have
to have a date first.

225
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,727
Remember my friend Adam
from Detroit?

226
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:49,127
Yeah, the guy
with the flat head?

227
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,427
He's a cube.

228
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,727
Anyway, he got married
about six months ago.

229
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:55,061
He told me, ever since he's been
wearing a wedding band,

230
00:07:55,094 --> 00:07:57,061
women have been coming on to him
everywhere he goes.

231
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:57,641
Yeah, I've heard that
about wedding bands.

232
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,594
Yeah, I've heard that
about wedding bands.

233
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,694
I wonder if that's really true.

234
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,627
That'd be an interesting
sociological experiment.

235
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:05,694
You know, Kramer
has his father's band.

236
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:06,927
He'd loan it to you.

237
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,394
Hey, thanks a lot.

238
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,394
So I'll give it back
to you in a week.

239
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:18,794
You know, I don't even know why

240
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,027
you're fooling around
with this ring.

241
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,361
I've been telling you...
get yourself some plugs

242
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:24,027
or a piece.
I'm not doing that.

243
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:26,094
Oh, man. You know, you're crazy.

244
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:27,294
You're a good-looking guy.

245
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:27,641
Why do you want to walk around
like that for?

246
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:30,061
Why do you want to walk around
like that for?

247
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:33,094
No, I'll put a half a can
of mousse in my head, like you.

248
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:34,127
No.

249
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:40,227
I told you,
I don't like these sponges.

250
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,727
They're too small.

251
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:43,261
I want a big sponge!

252
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:47,227
You can't pick up anything
with these.

253
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,227
There's no absorption.

254
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,394
Boys, boys.

255
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:53,361
Hi, Jerry.

256
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:54,794
Hello, Jerry.

257
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:57,639
Okay.

258
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Okay.

259
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,194
Okay.

260
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:04,461
Your friend can't have
the apartment, Jerry.

261
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:05,461
What?

262
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,761
Because somebody
offered Manny $5000

263
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:10,361
for the apartment.

264
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:13,527
I don't want to do it.
Manny wants to do it.

265
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,727
Because it's true!
Why shouldn't I tell him?

266
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:19,761
Hey, hey, I understand.
You're businessmen.

267
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:20,861
Okay, okay...

268
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:27,640
Oh. Now he says that
if your friend has $5000,

269
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,727
Oh. Now he says that
if your friend has $5000,

270
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:31,094
we'll give it to her.

271
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,594
Well, that's a lot of money,

272
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:34,394
but if that's the way
it's got to be,

273
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:36,494
that's the way it's got to be.

274
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,361
You know, I used to think

275
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:42,694
that the universe

276
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,727
is a random, chaotic sequence

277
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:46,627
of meaningless events...

278
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,127
But I see now

279
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:52,227
that there is reason and purpose
to all things.

280
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,027
What happened to you?

281
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,727
Religion, my friend.
That's what happened to me.

282
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,641
Because I have just

283
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:58,627
Because I have just

284
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,227
been informed
that it's going to cost Elaine

285
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:05,694
the sum of $5000
to get the apartment upstairs.

286
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:09,527
$5000? She doesn't have $5000.

287
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,961
Of course
she doesn't have $5000.

288
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,194
So she can't get the apartment.

289
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:13,194
Can't get it.

290
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:15,094
So she doesn't move in!
No move.

291
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:18,394
So you see?
It's all part of a divine plan.

292
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:22,394
And how does the baldness
fit into that plan?

293
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:26,394
Elaine?

294
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,640
<i>Yeah!</i>

295
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:28,641
<i>Yeah!</i>

296
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,027
All right.

297
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,027
This is going to require
some great acting now.

298
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:36,961
I have to pretend
I'm disappointed,

299
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:39,194
so you're going to see me
really being a phony now.

300
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:40,361
I hope you can take this.

301
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:42,361
Maybe you should go
into the other room.

302
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:43,427
Are you kidding?

303
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,194
I lie every second of the day.

304
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,394
My whole life is a sham.

305
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,194
Because, you know,
I love Elaine.

306
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:50,227
Of course you do.

307
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:52,327
But, you know,
not in the building.

308
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,227
Really, I feel terrible
about this.

309
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,640
My intentions were good.

310
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:57,694
My intentions were good.

311
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,194
What... What can I do?
Tell me.

312
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,227
No, I'll be seeing you!

313
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,461
♪ Good morning
Good morning ♪

314
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,527
Have you ever gotten up
first thing in the morning

315
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:10,294
and felt that it's just great
to be alive?

316
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:16,061
That every breath is a gift
of sweet life from above?

317
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:22,794
Ooh.

318
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,727
Before I forget,

319
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,640
I have the checks
for the first month,

320
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:27,727
I have the checks
for the first month,

321
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,527
last month, security deposit.

322
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,727
I have $75 left in my account.

323
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,727
Well...

324
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:38,227
There's a little bit
of a problem.

325
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:39,294
Oh, I know.

326
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,694
There's a weak shower spray,
I know,

327
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,361
and I already thought about it...
I am switching to baths.

328
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:46,727
As Winston Churchill said,
"Why stand when you can sit?"

329
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:49,127
Maybe I'll get
some rubber duckies.

330
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:50,727
Uh, no, uh...

331
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,927
Someone offered Harold and Manny
5000 for the apartment.

332
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm sure they'd just as soon
give it to you,

333
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,394
I'm sure they'd just as soon
give it to you,

334
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,194
but you would have to
come up with that money.

335
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:03,794
Five thousand dollars?

336
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,127
I don't have $5000.

337
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,527
I know.

338
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,361
How am I going to get $5000?

339
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:12,627
I have no idea.

340
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:15,694
Hey! My new neighbor.

341
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,694
Oh, I'm not moving in.

342
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:18,894
What?

343
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,361
They want $5000 now.

344
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:24,861
So, okay, uh,
w-what's the problem?

345
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:27,194
I don't have $5000.

346
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:27,641
Oh, come on!
You can come up with $5000!

347
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:30,227
Oh, come on!
You can come up with $5000!

348
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:33,227
Jerry, you don't have $5000
you can lend her?

349
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:36,227
Come on.

350
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,027
Yeah, well, I didn't...
I mean...

351
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,527
is that something
you want to borrow?

352
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:44,027
No, that's too much money
to borrow.

353
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:46,961
Loan her the money.
You can afford it.

354
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,194
She doesn't want
to borrow the money.

355
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,127
Oh, come on!
She'll pay you back.

356
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,094
What's five grand
between friends?

357
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,094
Oh, of course I'd pay you back.

358
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:56,694
Yeah, so what's the problem?

359
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:57,641
Who said there's a problem?

360
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:58,427
Who said there's a problem?

361
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,694
Uh! See? He said
he'll loan you the money.

362
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,461
Well, now, Jerry,
it might take a while

363
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,061
for me to pay you back,
you know.

364
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:06,361
Maybe a few years.

365
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:08,227
How do you feel about that?

366
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,227
Ah, it's okay!

367
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:12,294
He doesn't care.

368
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,361
Well, you know,

369
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,527
money can sometimes
come between friends.

370
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,794
Get out of here.

371
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:18,194
Let me think about it.

372
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,194
What's to think about?

373
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:20,194
Well, I don't know.

374
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:22,061
I don't know. 5000?

375
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,794
Let me just take
one more look at it.

376
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:35,727
It was all over.

377
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,227
Taken care of.

378
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:38,227
Done. Finished.

379
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,694
5000... where is she gonna get...?

380
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,294
She doesn't have 5000.

381
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:42,294
Clean. Goodbye.

382
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,694
She's gone.

383
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,127
Then you come in.

384
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,527
"Why don't you loan her
the 5000?

385
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:48,227
"What do you care?
You got 5000.

386
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,227
Give her 5000."

387
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,461
Wait a minute.

388
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,394
You didn't want her
in the building?

389
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,361
No, I didn't.

390
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:57,640
Well, then, what did you
loan her the $5000 for?

391
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,194
Well, then, what did you
loan her the $5000 for?

392
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:00,294
Well, uh, look,
maybe she won't take it.

393
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:01,527
I mean, she did say

394
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:03,561
that she was going
to think about it.

395
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,061
People don't turn down money.

396
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,061
It's what separates us
from the animals.

397
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,461
Oh, man, well,
I still don't understand

398
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,394
what the problem is,
having her in the building.

399
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:14,227
Let me explain something to you.

400
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:17,227
You see...

401
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:18,861
You're not normal.

402
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:21,694
You're a great guy.
I love you.

403
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,727
But... you're a pod.

404
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:27,640
I, on the other hand,
am a human being.

405
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:28,127
I, on the other hand,
am a human being.

406
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:30,027
I sometimes feel
awkward, uncomfortable,

407
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,894
even inhibited
in certain situations

408
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:33,394
with the other human beings.

409
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,861
You wouldn't understand.

410
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,561
Yeah. Because I'm a pod.

411
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:41,727
I'll take it!

412
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:43,394
No.

413
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:51,561
Hi, Elaine.

414
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,861
Oh, hi, Roxanne.
It's nice to be here.

415
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:54,861
These are my friends.

416
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,527
This is George.
And this is Jerry.

417
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,727
Hi.

418
00:14:57,761 --> 00:15:00,194
Jerry's the one
who got me my new apartment.

419
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:03,561
So you're Elaine's hero.

420
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,527
Yes, it's my life's work.

421
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,727
There are so few true heroes

422
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,027
left in this world.

423
00:15:09,061 --> 00:15:12,394
Yeah, my wife
couldn't make it today.

424
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:15,175
She's got some thing
with her mother.

425
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:15,227
She's got some thing
with her mother.

426
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,527
Who knows what's
going on with her?

427
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,194
Don't let anybody kid you.

428
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:22,161
It's tough.

429
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,194
Well, better load up
on some carbos

430
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,761
before the race.

431
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,694
Oh, the marathon
is great, isn't it?

432
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,194
Oh, yes, particularly
if you're not in it.

433
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:35,927
I wish we had a view
of the finish line.

434
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:37,194
Ah, what's to see?

435
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,761
A woman from Norway,
a guy from Kenya,

436
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:40,094
and 20,000 losers.

437
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,194
Yeah, my wife started
getting on me

438
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:45,176
about the lawn today.

439
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:45,694
about the lawn today.

440
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,261
I tell you,
it's one thing after another.

441
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:50,461
Is she here?

442
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:51,794
Uh, no, no, she's working.

443
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,394
What does she do?

444
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,861
She's an entomologist.

445
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:59,627
Yeah, you know...
bees, flies, gnats.

446
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:01,594
Yeah. What... What about you?

447
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,361
I work for the director
of Madison Square Garden.

448
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:05,527
It's great.

449
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:07,361
I can get free tickets
to any sporting event

450
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,361
in New York.

451
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,694
Wow.

452
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,194
Anyway,
she's a very lucky woman.

453
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,594
Enjoy the race.

454
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:16,361
But...

455
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,361
Hi, Stan.

456
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,361
Joanne.

457
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,761
Come in.

458
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:21,861
Jerry, this is Joanne
and this is Stan.

459
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,361
They're in my short story class.

460
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:25,027
Hi.
How are you?

461
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:26,361
Hey, Jerry just got me

462
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:28,527
a great apartment
in his building.

463
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,894
Well, Jerry, it'll be nice

464
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:32,394
to have a close friend nearby.

465
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:33,461
Fantastic.

466
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,161
She can pop in
whenever she wants.

467
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,361
She doesn't even need to knock.

468
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:39,861
It's tremendous.

469
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,394
Any time of day.

470
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,094
I'm in heaven.

471
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,194
Oh, Rita.

472
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,176
Rita, come here.

473
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:45,227
Rita, come here.

474
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,594
This is Jerry.

475
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:48,727
He's the one
who got me the apartment.

476
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:50,294
Oh, hi.

477
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:53,827
Bob, this is the guy
who got Elaine her apartment.

478
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:01,861
I'm sorry, I just
don't see the big deal

479
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,261
about being a matador.

480
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:06,194
I mean, the bull charges,
you move the cape...

481
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:08,027
What's so hard?

482
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,361
So, are you really married?

483
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:13,427
Because I've actually heard
of single guys

484
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,175
who wear wedding bands
to attract women.

485
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:16,736
who wear wedding bands
to attract women.

486
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,694
You would have to be
a real loser

487
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:22,727
to try something like that.

488
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,061
That's too bad, because...

489
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:28,494
I really have a thing
for bald guys with glasses.

490
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:36,894
Hey, everybody!
Here come the runners!

491
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,227
Oh! Ooh.

492
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,561
So, you and Roxanne
are hitting it off, huh?

493
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:45,176
Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.

494
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:45,861
Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.

495
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:47,194
Really?

496
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:49,394
From a distance, you seemed
to be coming on to her.

497
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:50,394
Oh, I'm a guy.

498
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,061
It always looks like that.

499
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:54,627
Because I was thinking...

500
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:58,461
Are you at all concerned
that living in the same building

501
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,527
will, you know,
cramp our styles?

502
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,861
Nah.

503
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:06,061
Because I was worried
that there might be a situation

504
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:08,694
in which one of us
came home with somebody.

505
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,694
It could get
a little uncomfortable.

506
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:12,394
But as long
as you're okay with it,

507
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:13,461
it's fine with me.

508
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,361
I've never been able to be

509
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:19,694
with just one person.

510
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:21,394
I can, however,

511
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:24,027
carry on strictly
physical relationships

512
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,261
which can last
for years and years.

513
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,761
It's a shame you're married.

514
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,194
Um... I'm not.

515
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:37,194
Um, it... it's just
a sociological experiment.

516
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:38,227
Please.

517
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,627
You have no idea
what an idiot is.

518
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:55,627
Elaine just gave me
a chance to get out,

519
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:57,127
and I didn't take it.

520
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,694
This is an idiot.

521
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:01,627
Is that right?

522
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:06,294
I just threw away
a lifetime of guilt-free sex

523
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,594
and floor seats
for every sporting event

524
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:11,694
in Madison Square Garden.

525
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:15,175
So, please, a little respect,

526
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:15,194
So, please, a little respect,

527
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:20,161
for I am Costanza,
lord of the idiots.

528
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,894
You're all winners!

529
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:31,294
But, suddenly,
a new contender has emerged.

530
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:37,194
George, I didn't sleep at all
last night.

531
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,527
I decided I have to tell her.

532
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,861
I'm just gonna be honest,
that's all.

533
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:44,394
Yes, I'm nervous.

534
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:45,176
Are you listening to me?

535
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:47,127
Are you listening to me?

536
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,427
Just... Just put some soap
on your finger.

537
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:51,927
It'll slide right off.

538
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,361
Well, then try axle grease.

539
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:58,027
I'll call you back
after I talk to her.

540
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:00,527
Well...

541
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:04,194
It's all taken care of.

542
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:06,061
Everything's cool.

543
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,927
What? What's cool?

544
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:09,527
Elaine.

545
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,527
What are you talking about?

546
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,861
I just found a guy
who's willing to pay $10,000

547
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:15,175
for the apartment.

548
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:15,727
for the apartment.

549
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,761
You what? Get out!

550
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:18,761
10,000?

551
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:19,761
Cash!

552
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:21,261
Who would pay that much?

553
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:22,694
He's in the music business.

554
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,367
Elaine would never borrow
that much money.

555
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,361
Kramer...

556
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:26,861
my God, man.

557
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,361
This is beautiful.

558
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,861
I think I'm in the clear here.

559
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,194
Elaine's not moving in.

560
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:33,194
I don't have to confront her.

561
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:35,861
She has no idea
I never wanted her to move in.

562
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:37,261
I'm golden.

563
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:40,961
Well, occasionally,
I like to help the humans.

564
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:53,361
Wow, you're right, that is loud.

565
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:54,594
It's just unbelievable.

566
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:55,761
They rehearse all the time?

567
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:56,761
All the time!

568
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,194
I've been up there six times.

569
00:20:58,227 --> 00:20:59,861
They refuse to stop.

570
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:01,227
I can't live like this.

571
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,694
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

572
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,694
I'm headed for a breakdown.

573
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:04,961
Can't you do something?

574
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,261
I'm not going up.
It stinks up there.

575
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:08,294
Manny?

576
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:14,794
I'm not the one who said

577
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:15,176
they could play
till 11:00.

578
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:17,027
they could play
till 11:00.

579
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:18,594
He makes up his own rules.

580
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,194
Boy, too bad. If I was up there,

581
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:22,094
you'd never hear
a peep out of me.

582
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,961
I'm as quiet as a mouse.

583
00:21:23,994 --> 00:21:25,861
Hey.

584
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:27,227
Oh!

585
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:29,461
I love the one they do
right after this one.

586
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:32,027
I don't know.

587
00:21:32,061 --> 00:21:34,861
What do you do when a neighbor
is making, like, a lot of noise

588
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,194
at 3:00 in the morning?

589
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:37,761
I mean, can you
knock on someone's door

590
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:39,194
and tell 'em to keep it down?

591
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:40,961
You're really altering
your whole self-image.

592
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:42,694
I mean, what am I,
Fred Mertz now?

593
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,027
What's happening to me?

594
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,175
Can I do this?
Am I a shusher?

595
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,394
Can I do this?
Am I a shusher?

596
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:48,261
I used to be a shushee.

597
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:50,261
There's a lot of shushing
going on in movie theaters.

598
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:51,727
People are always shushing.

599
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:54,561
Shh. Shh, shh. Shh!

600
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:55,861
It doesn't work...

601
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:57,694
Because nobody knows
where a shush is coming from.

602
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:58,894
They just hear a "shh!"

603
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,694
Was that a shush?
I think somebody shushed me.

604
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:02,567
Some people you can't shush
in a movie theater.

605
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,694
There's always a certain group
of people talking and talking.

606
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,261
Everyone around them
is shushing them, shushing them.

607
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:07,261
They won't shush.

608
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,327
They're the unshushables.
