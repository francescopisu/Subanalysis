1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,130
So I move into the centre lane...

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,870
...I get ahead of this woman who felt,
for some reason, I'd cut her off.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,290
So she pulls up alongside of me,
gives me the finger.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,200
It seems like such an arbitrary,
ridiculous thing...

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,680
...to just pick a finger
and you show it to the person.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,650
It's a finger. What does it mean?

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,460
Someone shows me
one of their fingers...

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,970
...and I'm supposed to feel bad.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,300
Is that the way it's supposed to work?
I mean...

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,750
...you could just give someone
the toe, really, couldn't you?

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,400
I would feel worse if I got the toe
than if I got the finger.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,070
It's not easy to give the toe.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,070
You gotta get the shoe off, the sock off
and drive, get it up in the...

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,640
"Look at that toe, buddy."

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,190
I mean, that's really insulting,
to get the toe, isn't it?

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,110
That it? I've got the Q-Tips,
got the mini-umbrella.

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,180
Something boring to read
on the plane.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,080
That's it.

19
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,650
Done.

20
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,030
That is the single greatest packing
performance I have ever seen.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,790
I am the master packer.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,710
Yeah, right. You're the master packer.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,420
What you must understand, Elaine...

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,710
...packing is like leading men
into battle.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,090
You've got to know the strengths
and weaknesses of every soldier.

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,480
From a collapsible toothbrush
to a pair of ordinary black socks.

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,190
Excuse me, master packer?

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,170
Yes?

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,130
- Just give me your keys.
- All right, sir.

30
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,410
- George?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,580
Okay, so, now, is there anything else
I need to know about this place?

32
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,490
Yeah. The hot water takes a while
to come on. So the best thing to do...

33
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,140
...is to turn it on,
do all your shopping...

34
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,850
...then come back and take a shower.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,620
Okay. This is quite a place.

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,440
There's more. The refrigerator.

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,090
Deduct a minimum of two days
off all expiration dates.

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,840
No meat, no leftovers, no butter.

39
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,140
And I cannot overstate this:

40
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,000
No soft cheeses of any kind.

41
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,230
- Is that clear?
- I'll eat out.

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,840
And one more thing, Benes...

43
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,820
...regarding sexual activity.

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,730
Strictly prohibited, but if you
absolutely must, do us all a big favour...

45
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,600
...do it in the tub.

46
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,780
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. One second.

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,490
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hi.

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,410
- You coming to the airport?
- I'm staying for the weekend.

49
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,270
- I getting a break from my roommate.
- Oh, the actresslwaitress.

50
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,650
No. The waitresslactress.
She just got some part...

51
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,670
...in some dinner theatre production
of A Chorus Line.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,430
So now all day long she's walking
around the apartment singing:

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,310
She's gonna get it, right in the...

54
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,030
Why don't you just kick her out.

55
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,300
She's on the lease. George, you have
got to find another place for me.

56
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,370
Yeah, well, a little rough finding
something good in your price range.

57
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,610
Hey, but you, my friend,
may be in luck.

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,050
- I'm not looking.
- No, this one's different. It's a beauty.

59
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,240
- What's it like?
- I haven't seen it yet...

60
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,680
...but it's a two-bedroom,
it's on West 83rd...

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,080
...about a half-block from the park.
- How much?

62
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,790
Twice what you're paying here,
but it's a great building.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
It's two bedrooms.

64
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,440
Two bedrooms?
Why do I need two bedrooms?

65
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,360
I've got enough trouble
maintaining activity in one.

66
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,700
I saw that.

67
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,670
- You ought to at least take a look at it.
- Really? Why?

68
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,750
Because then I could move in here.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,450
- I know what you're saying now.
- It's time you got out of here, anyway.

70
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,260
Yeah, tell him, but quickly.
I'm double-parked here.

71
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,180
Listen, Jerry,
this place is falling apart.

72
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,060
You have no hot water.

73
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,150
You can't have soft cheese.

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,610
Let's not forget the radiator.

75
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,990
The steam's been on for 10 years.
No human can turn this off.

76
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,490
Jerry, come on.
You're doing okay now.

77
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,890
You should at least
take a look at this place.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,210
- You shouldn't have to live like this.
- You just said you wanted to live here.

79
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,980
Well, for me it's a step up.

80
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,010
It's like moving
from Iceland to Finland.

81
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,720
Jerry, you wanna see
the place or not?

82
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,540
I can't think about it now.
I'm going to Minneapolis.

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,150
I got four shows this weekend.

84
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,200
Elaine?

85
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,960
Elaine?

86
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,530
Jerry?

87
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,450
Jer... Oh, hi.

88
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,260
Welcome back.
How were the shows?

89
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,910
Great. I had fun. Where's the TV?
Where's the VCR?

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,420
- What?!
- They were stolen.

91
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,300
Stolen? When?

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,050
A couple of hours ago.
The police are coming right over.

93
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,720
Stolen?

94
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,520
Someone left the door open.

95
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,500
Oh, yeah...

96
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,150
You left the door open?

97
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,860
Oh, well, you know, I was cooking...

98
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,930
...and I came in to get the spatula.

99
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,690
I left the door open because I was
gonna bring the spatula right back.

100
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,960
Wait, you left the lock open
or the door open?

101
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,680
The door.

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,680
- The door? You left the door open?
- I was bringing the spatula right back.

103
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,140
Yeah, and...?

104
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,690
Well, I got caught up watching
a soap opera.

105
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,610
Bold and the Beautiful.

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,100
- So the door was wide open.
- Wide open.

107
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,540
Excuse me.

108
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,310
And where were you?

109
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,210
I was at Bloomingdale's,
waiting for the shower to heat up.

110
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,030
Look, Jerry, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,530
- You have insurance, right, buddy?
- No.

112
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,350
How can you not have insurance?

113
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,570
Because I spent my money
on the Clapco D-29.

114
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,900
It's the most impenetrable lock
on the market today.

115
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,510
It has only one design flaw:

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,600
The door...

117
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,890
...must be closed!

118
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,270
Jerry, I'm gonna find your stuff.
I'm gonna solve it.

119
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm on the case, buddy.
I'm on the case.

120
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,640
Don't investigate. Don't pay me back.
It was an accident.

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
- I made a mistake.
- These things happen.

122
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,210
- I'm human.
- In your way.

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,720
Let's see, that's one TV, a stereo,
one leather jacket, a VCR, a computer.

124
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,120
- Is that about it?
- The answering machine.

125
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,890
Answering machine.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,650
Boy, I hate the idea of somebody
out there returning my calls.

127
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,460
What do you mean?

128
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,800
It's a joke.

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,890
I see.

130
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,900
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, we'll look into it.
We'll let you know if we find anything.

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,500
- Do you ever find anything?
- No.

132
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,330
- Well, thanks anyway.
- You bet.

133
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,560
I didn't get that joke either.

134
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,690
The crook has the machine.
The messages aren't for him...

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,670
...he's the crook.

136
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,970
Why would he answer...?

137
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,100
How did you get in here?

138
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,610
I walked in.
Your lobby door is broken again.

139
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,960
Again?

140
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,840
I don't know how
you put up with this.

141
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,930
- Yeah. Tell him, George.
- Thanks.

142
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,010
You would still wanna move in here?

143
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes. You don't understand.

144
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,860
I'm living with Ethel Merman
without the talent.

145
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,920
Is that other apartment still available?

146
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,810
I got ripped off for about the...

147
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,000
...eighteenth time.

148
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,550
The first couple of times
you go through it, it's very upsetting.

149
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,570
Your first reaction,
or one of your friends, will say:

150
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,530
"Call the police.
You really should call the police."

151
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,560
So you think to yourself,
you know, you watch TV, you think:

152
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,250
"Yeah, I'm calling the police.
Stakeouts, manhunts.

153
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,550
I'm gonna see some real action."

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,010
Right? You think that.

155
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,510
So the police come over
to your house.

156
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,020
They fill out the report.

157
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,460
They give you your copy.

158
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,260
Now, unless they give
the crook his copy...

159
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,700
...I don't really think we're gonna
crack this case. Do you?

160
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,180
It's not like Batman,
where there's three crooks in the city...

161
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,730
...and everybody pretty much knows
who they are.

162
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,170
Very few crooks go to the trouble...

163
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,140
...to come up with a theme
for their careers anymore.

164
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,950
It makes them a lot tougher to spot.

165
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,500
"Did you lose a Sony?
It could be The Penguin.

166
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,630
I think we can round him up.

167
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,030
He's dressed like a penguin.

168
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,160
We can find him. He's a penguin."

169
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,880
Well, come on.

170
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,620
This is an apartment.
This is a home.

171
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,440
This is a place to live.

172
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,460
A fireplace!

173
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,450
Are you kidding me?
Does this work?

174
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,410
I didn't know there was a fireplace.
A fireplace! That's incredible.

175
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,020
- How do you get all that wood in here?
- They deliver.

176
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,420
- They deliver wood?
- Yeah.

177
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,130
What do you tip a wood guy?

178
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,510
- I didn't know there was a fireplace.
- Look. Look, look at this.

179
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,600
- There's a garden.
- A garden?

180
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,520
I can't believe there's a garden.

181
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,440
- Would I have to get a gardener?
- Yeah, you can get a gardener.

182
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,730
- You tip him?
- You can.

183
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,400
You don't tip a gardener.

184
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,740
- You can tip a gardener.
- You don't need a gardener.

185
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,560
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

186
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,430
They deliver the coal?

187
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,770
Sure. It's probably the same guy
who delivers the wood.

188
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,960
Oh, then I gotta tip him.

189
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,720
Oh, man, this place is incredible.

190
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,590
Look at all this great light.

191
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,350
- I don't have any plants.
- I have plants.

192
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,730
Jerry, look at this closet.

193
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,280
Look at this. I'm walking in it.
It's a walk-in.

194
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,140
Can you believe it? I'm nuts
about this. What do you think?

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,870
I like that.

196
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,040
- What do you think, George?
- It's your decision.

197
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm taking it. I'm taking the place.
I'm gonna take it.

198
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,570
This is gonna be my new place.
I'm living here.

199
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,930
- I'm moving.
- You're moving?

200
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,850
That means I'm moving.

201
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
Gee, is that incredible?

202
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,960
Congratulations.

203
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,640
- What about the couch?
- You like the couch?

204
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,620
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.
- What?

205
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,790
You're moving in, you're a good friend.
I wanna start you off on the right foot.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,980
Give me...

207
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,590
...a hundred and fifty dollars.

208
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,580
- In fact, get it out of here right now.
- Excuse me.

209
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,490
A hundred and fifty dollars? For what?
For this couch?

210
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,990
- Yeah.
- For this couch?

211
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,220
Okay, you tell me.
What is it worth?

212
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,040
Okay...

213
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,170
I tell you what.

214
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,610
I could go as high as...

215
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,220
I don't know. Maybe...

216
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,780
...twenty dollars?

217
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,310
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's George.

218
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,190
Come on up.

219
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,450
Forget it, I'm gonna take it with me.
I'll just pack up the cushions...

220
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,310
Okay. Okay, you win. $40.

221
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,390
You wanna help me
get it in the hall?

222
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,250
- Fifty dollars, okay? Is that all right?
- Fifty dollars?

223
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,590
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

224
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,680
Hey. What's going on?

225
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,430
I just bought Jerry's couch for $50.

226
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,730
So did you bring the lease?

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,690
Okay.

228
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,140
Gee, three years.
That kind of seems like a long time.

229
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,120
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

230
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,500
Listen, if you are feeling
uncomfortable about this at all, at all...

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,000
...do not feel like you have to take it.

232
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,650
- Why?
- lf you're having second thoughts...

233
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,220
...if you didn't want it...

234
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,180
...don't worry about it,
because, you know, I...

235
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,270
I could take it.

236
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,130
You could take it? You want it?

237
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,360
No, I don't want it.
I want it if you don't want it.

238
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,860
So you do want it.

239
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,950
I want it if you don't want it.

240
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,850
- You just said you wanted it.
- No, I'm saying if a situation arose...

241
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,770
...in which you didn't want it,
I might take it.

242
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,650
- So take it.
- How can I take it?

243
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,740
- How can I take it?
- It's your apartment.

244
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,030
How can I want it now,
if you want it?

245
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,540
Excuse me.
I don't mean to cause any trouble...

246
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,400
...but, George, if you take it,
can I take your place?

247
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,050
Yes, but I am not taking it.

248
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,760
I am not taking it.

249
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,050
Well, one of you better
damn well take it.

250
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,450
- Well, what do you wanna do here?
- I don't know.

251
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,370
You wanna flip a coin?

252
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,190
Who flips?

253
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,220
- You flip, I'll call.
- Okay, fine.

254
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,240
- All right. All right.
- This is the official flip.

255
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,250
No crying, no guilt.
Winner takes all and that's it. Agreed?

256
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,330
- I'm good.
- I don't know who to root for.

257
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,940
George's place has carpeting.

258
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,070
- All right. Now, you call it in the air.
- No catching.

259
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,740
- No, no.
- All right, flip it.

260
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,200
Heads!

261
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,310
- Tails.
- No, it hit the table.

262
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,440
- So what?
- Interference. You can't count that.

263
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,470
Come on, are you crazy?
The coin cannot touch anything.

264
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,490
- It affects it.
- You didn't call "no interference."

265
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,470
You don't have to call it.
That's a rule!

266
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,390
- I don't believe this.
- All right. Fine, Jerry.

267
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,050
- You win. Take it, just take it.
- I don't wanna win it like this.

268
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,170
Elaine, what do you think?

269
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,100
I better not.

270
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,940
I'll tell you what,
I'll choose you for it.

271
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,170
Straight choose, three takes it.
No disputes.

272
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,470
That's it. You gotta win three.

273
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,130
Okay.

274
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,450
Okay.

275
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,330
I'll choose you.

276
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,610
- What do you want?
- Odds.

277
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,950
- I want evens.
- Good.

278
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,290
- You got odds.
- You got evens.

279
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,750
Right.

280
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,880
- Ready.
- For the apartment.

281
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,860
- Once, twice, three, shoot!
- Mine!

282
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,730
- Once, twice, three, shoot.
- Mine!

283
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,910
- Once, twice, three, shoot!
- Mine!

284
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,420
Once, twice, three, shoot!

285
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,570
Congratulations.

286
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,870
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

287
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,790
I'm just gonna wash...

288
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,630
Why did I put out two?
Why did I put out two?!

289
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,280
Jerry? I think I'm on to something.

290
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,780
I think I found your stuff.

291
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,290
You know the Englishman
who lives down the hall?

292
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,790
The last couple days,
he's been acting very strange.

293
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,290
- I think he's avoiding me.
- Hard to imagine.

294
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,560
Yeah, and get this. I just got off the
elevator with him and I tested him.

295
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,570
I tested him, like, this is what I said,
like this. I went:
Yeah, and get this. I just got off the
elevator with him and I tested him.

296
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,210
I tested him, like, this is what I said,
like this. I went:

297
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,170
"Oh, by the way,
I know about the stuff."

298
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,200
You know, very casual so he'll take me
into his confidence.

299
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,430
- So, what did he say?
- "What stuff?"

300
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,120
- Case closed.
- No, no. You don't understand.

301
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,570
See, he swallowed.
See, the guy, he swallowed.

302
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,800
Oh, he was nervous about something.

303
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,280
Now, I'm gonna go over there.
I'm gonna borrow some tea.

304
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,830
If I don't get back in five minutes,
you better call the police.

305
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,960
Okay. Starting now!

306
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,630
Yeah.

307
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,010
One problem in life is...

308
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,040
...as a kid, you have a certain way
of working out disagreements.

309
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,370
And those laws do not work
in the adult world.

310
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,650
One of the main ways that kids resolve
any dispute is by calling it.

311
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,410
One of them says, " I got the front
seat." " I wanted it." " I called it."

312
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,790
And the other kid knows
he's got nothing to say.

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,670
"He called it. What can I do?"

314
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,960
If there was a kid court of law,
it holds up.

315
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:13,180
"Your Honour, my client did ask
for the front seat."

316
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,410
And the judge would go,
"Did he call it?"

317
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,480
"Well, no, he didn't call it." Bang.
"He has to call it. Case closed.

318
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,880
Objection overruled."

319
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,630
I love the mirror in that bathroom.

320
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,070
I don't know what in the hell it is,
I look terrific in that mirror.

321
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,580
I don't know if it's the tile
or the lighting.

322
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,190
I feel like Robert Wagner in there.

323
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,420
It's a good mirror.

324
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,970
- What are you getting?
- I don't know.

325
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,780
What can you eat?
You can't have anything anymore.

326
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,850
Look at this, look at this.
Eggs, out. Coffee, out.

327
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,980
French fries, out. BLT, out.

328
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,470
I visit my grandparents,
they're eating big brisket sandwiches.

329
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,660
I'm sitting there with a carrot.

330
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,410
They're closing in on 100, I'm saying
to them, "How can you eat that stuff?"

331
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,970
I'm so sick about losing that choose.
You don't know. I...

332
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,930
All right. Forget it. Forget it.
I'm not taking the place.

333
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,120
- What?
- How can I live there?

334
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,310
- Why not?
- You're still thinking about it.

335
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,230
- I'll never feel comfortable.
- Oh, get out of here.

336
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,260
How can I ever have you over?
You'll sit there moping.

337
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,070
- I won't mope.
- You're already moping.

338
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,040
- Would you take the place?
- No. Impossible. It's your apartment.

339
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,850
- You found the place.
- You won the choose.

340
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,570
All right. Forget it. I'm not moving.

341
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,130
Well, me neither.

342
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,530
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

343
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,910
All right, then, just get rid of it.
You won't have any problem.

344
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,770
No, it's not a problem. I can get rid
of the apartment this afternoon.

345
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,540
What apartment?

346
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,050
Oh, it's a great place.
It's a two-bedroom...

347
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,550
...West 83rd, half-block from the park.

348
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,640
What's the rent?

349
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,240
I hate housewarmings. What are
we doing here? This is ridiculous.

350
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,640
She wanted to thank us
for the apartment.

351
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,210
I can't believe I lost the deposit
on that U-Haul...

352
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,440
...and I threw out my couch.

353
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,290
- lf only the coin hadn't hit the table.
- The table is interference, you know it.

354
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,690
- It is not.
- It is too.

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,860
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight
on Carousel.

356
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,930
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Carol.

357
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,680
I just wanted to introduce you
to my husband. This is Larry.

358
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,920
This is George, Elaine and Jerry.

359
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,150
These are the guys
who got us the apartment.

360
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,440
You don't know how grateful I am.

361
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,950
If there's anything I can do
to repay you...

362
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,660
- We're just so thrilled with this place.
- It's a dream.

363
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,950
I'm running in the park,
I've lost weight...

364
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,710
...we're barbecuing every night.
And the rent is unbelievable.

365
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,450
We're really glad for you.

366
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,050
Couldn't be happier.

367
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,620
It's wonderful.

368
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,370
Oh, Diane. Diane, come here.

369
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,710
This is my new next-door
neighbour, Diane.

370
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,620
These are the guys who turned
this place down. Can you believe it?

371
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,000
Diane gave me the greatest back rub
today. She's a masseuse.

372
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,940
How could you guys
have turned this place down?

373
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,430
It's such a great location
and it's so close to the park.

374
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,870
We're aware of the proximity
to the park.

375
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,770
Well, it was nice to meet you.

376
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,070
Nice meeting you.

377
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,050
How late are the stores open? I'm
thinking of maybe buying a new TV...

378
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,760
...and smashing it over my head.

379
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,260
So I get a call
from Gilmore this morning.

380
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,640
They're restructuring the organization
in Atlanta. I gotta be there on the 1 st.

381
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,310
Really?
What about your apartment?

382
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,610
What can I do? I'll give it up.

383
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,800
What's the rent?
