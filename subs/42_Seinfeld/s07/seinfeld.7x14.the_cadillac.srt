1
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:04,685
Old people in Florida,
they drive slow...

2
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,885
...and they sit low.

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:11,398
Right? That is their motto.

4
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:13,678
The state flag of Florida should be...

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,202
...a steering wheel with a hat
and two knuckles on it.

6
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,519
And that left-turn signal on...

7
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:26,326
...from when they left the house
that morning.

8
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:29,797
Right? That's a legal turn in Florida.

9
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:33,045
It's known as an eventual left.

10
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:36,559
And old people
get to a certain age...

11
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:38,683
...where, when they back out
of the driveway...

12
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:40,485
...they don't look.

13
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,399
You know what I mean?
They just feel like:

14
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:46,003
"Well, I'm old, and I'm coming back.

15
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:48,797
I survived. Let's see if you can."

16
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:00,481
- Hey, you're back!
- Oh, I'm back, baby.

17
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,797
- How was it?
- One of the best jobs I ever had.

18
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,639
- Good for you.
- I killed.

19
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:06,604
- You killed.
- Wiped the floor with them.

20
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,281
And not only that,
the money was unbelievable.

21
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:12,564
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, highest-paying job I ever had.

22
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:14,001
How much?

23
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,759
- I'd rather not.
- Oh, come on.

24
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:18,646
It's not good to talk about money.
It can affect the friendship.

25
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:20,160
I tell you how much I make.

26
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,806
And I'm always impressed.

27
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,923
Just show me the check. Come on.

28
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:25,918
- You wanna see it?
- I wanna see it.

29
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:27,600
Okay.

30
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:29,924
Check that out.

31
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:34,837
- This is unbelievable.
- I told you.

32
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,475
My God, you're rich.

33
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:38,875
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,481
I didn't know you made
that kind of money.

35
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,685
- Gee.
- What?

36
00:01:43,847 --> 00:01:47,442
I just don't think
I can talk to you anymore.

37
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,201
I feel inferior.

38
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:51,126
I never should have told you.

39
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:54,165
You know, Jerry, I think
this changes the relationship.

40
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,045
I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?

41
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:57,845
No, I can't feel anything.

42
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:59,599
What are you gonna do with all that?

43
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:02,600
I was thinking of donating
a large portion of it to charity.

44
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,485
- Really?
- No.

45
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,326
Well, you should, Jerry.

46
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:10,285
To tell you the truth, I was thinking
of buying my father a car.

47
00:02:10,447 --> 00:02:12,483
- You see, that's nice.
- Yeah, maybe a Cadillac.

48
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:13,966
Cadillac.

49
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:15,401
Yeah.

50
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:17,717
That would blow his mind.
He's always wanted one...

51
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,276
...his whole life. He's never
been able to afford it.

52
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:22,358
- I'll do it.
- You're gonna score big points...

53
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:23,880
...with the man upstairs.

54
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,163
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?

55
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,044
Who was Pippi Longstocking?

56
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:35,199
Pippi Longstocking? I don't know.

57
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,120
Did she have anything
to do with Hitler?

58
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,164
Hitler? Maybe.

59
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,966
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

60
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:46,085
Have you seen Jerry?
I told him 2:00.

61
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,282
You remember Katy?

62
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,081
Oh, hi.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:53,807
We met skiing that time.
You're married to the eye guy.

64
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,765
Also ear, nose and throat.

65
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,120
Nose.

66
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,837
What's the worst
that could happen to a nose?

67
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,838
What does it get, stuffed?

68
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:08,357
- He's funny.
- You don't have to tell me.

69
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:10,358
Ladies, please, please.

70
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:12,483
Oh, you know what?
He got engaged.

71
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:15,115
Oh, you did?

72
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:17,198
What, is that bad?

73
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,835
I actually would have set you up
with a friend of mine.

74
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,441
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:25,599
You'd be perfect for her.
She loves quirky, funny guys.

76
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,486
- Bald?
- Loves bald.

77
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,478
Loves bald.

78
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:33,961
Who...?

79
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,557
- Who is she?
- Marisa Tomei.

80
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,807
- The actress?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,039
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?

82
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:46,796
That's right.

83
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,481
That's incredible. My Cousin Vinny...

84
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,115
I love her. She was fantastic.

85
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:53,921
Yeah, I know.

86
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:55,759
You were gonna fix me up with her?

87
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,360
She's just been sitting home.

88
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,882
Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine.

89
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:02,242
Why didn't you tell me
Katy was friends with Marisa?

90
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,046
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking.

91
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,606
I want this baby fully loaded.

92
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:10,445
Well, how soon can you get it there?

93
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,240
Oh, that's terrific.

94
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:15,046
Okay, thanks, bye.
Hey, guess what.

95
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:18,165
- I just bought my father a Cadillac.
- Really?

96
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:19,999
- Wow, you are quite the good son.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,395
I'm a very good boy.

98
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,603
I'm flying down there
and surprising them.

99
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,725
- You gonna sleep on the foldout?
- Yeah.

100
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:28,286
I guess.

101
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:30,324
Let me ask you something.

102
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,320
You ever hear of Marisa Tomei?

103
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:34,556
- The actress?
- Yeah.

104
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,525
- She's... She's something, isn't she?
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:40,645
- Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
- Yeah.

106
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:42,638
She happens to be
good friends with her.

107
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,479
Marisa Tomei?

108
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,684
- How does she know Marisa Tomei?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

109
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,566
You didn't ask
how she knows Marisa Tomei?

110
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:53,366
- Not the point. Can I finish?
- All right.

111
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,760
Go ahead.
Seems like a reasonable question.

112
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,236
That's all I'm saying.
I would have asked her.

113
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:01,125
All right!

114
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,564
So she said that she could have
fixed me up with her.

115
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:06,206
What do you mean, "could have"?

116
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,204
Well, you know, if I wasn't engaged.

117
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,238
Could have fixed me up
with Marisa Tomei.

118
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:15,760
She said I was just her type.

119
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,838
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,805
Do you know the odds
of me being anyone's type?

121
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,400
I have never been anyone's type.

122
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:27,038
But, apparently, this Marisa Tomei
loves funny, quirky bald men.

123
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,803
You know, she won
an Academy Award.

124
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,284
Like I don't know that.

125
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,358
My Cousin Vinny, I loved it.

126
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:38,042
I, George Costanza, could be
on a date with an Oscar winner.

127
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,596
An Oscar winner, Jerry.
Do you know what that's like?

128
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,486
If 50 years ago someone had fixed
me up with Katharine Hepburn.

129
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,285
Same thing.

130
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,486
Now there's a match,
you and Katharine Hepburn.

131
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,356
- I mean, you've seen her?
- Katharine Hepburn? Yeah.

132
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,518
- Marisa Tomei!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,247
I mean, she's beautiful, right.
She's just my type.

134
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,398
The dark hair, the full lips.

135
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,398
- You like full lips.
- Oh, I love full lips.

136
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:03,445
Something you can really
put the lipstick on.

137
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,247
Too bad you're engaged.

138
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,556
Yeah, too bad, too bad.

139
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,725
This is no good.

140
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,366
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,235
Excuse me, I'm with Plaza Cable.
I'm sorry to bother you.

142
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,523
I'm looking for the guy
who lives over here.

143
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:28,440
Been waiting about two hours.

144
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,926
You happen to know where he is?

145
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,361
No.

146
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,597
Could you tell him
the cable company was here?

147
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,917
- Sure.
- Thank you.

148
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:39,679
- Nice people.
- Yeah.

149
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,556
Listen, let me ask you a question.

150
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,724
What if I got a cup of coffee
with her?

151
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,886
Well, what about Susan?

152
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,639
I can't have a coffee with a person?

153
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:50,126
I'm not allowed to have coffee?

154
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:51,561
Would you tell Susan about it?

155
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:53,966
Not necessarily.

156
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,880
If you can't tell Susan about it,
then there's something wrong.

157
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:59,277
Of course there's something wrong.

158
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,800
We had a pact.

159
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:05,202
- Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?

160
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:07,121
Yeah.

161
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,359
Yeah, I've been getting HBO
for free.

162
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,200
They found out about it.
Now they wanna come and take it out.

163
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,961
Well, said he was waiting two hours.
Seemed a little put out.

164
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:16,926
Oh, was he?

165
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:21,126
Well, I guess the cable man
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

166
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,005
You don't seem too bothered by it.

167
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,397
Do you remember what they did to me
10 years ago?

168
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,876
"Oh, we'll be there in the morning
between 9 and 1...

169
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:32,562
...or we'll be there between 2 and 6."

170
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:35,764
And I sat there, hour after hour...

171
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:38,124
...without so much as a phone call.

172
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,437
Finally, they show up.

173
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:41,835
No apology.

174
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:44,680
Tracking mud all over
my nice, clean floors.

175
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:48,556
And now they want me
to accommodate them.

176
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:49,921
Well...

177
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:53,443
...looks like the shoe
is on the other foot, doesn't it?

178
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,602
- I've never seen you like this.
- You don't wanna get on my bad side.

179
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,680
- Marks without Positraction...

180
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:05,840
...which was not available
on the '64 Buick Skylark.

181
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,599
Hey.

182
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,998
Hey, what are you watching?

183
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:13,356
What is that, My Cousin Vinny?

184
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,879
- Yeah.
- I thought you saw that before.

185
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,844
How come you're watching
that again?

186
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:20,642
I don't know.

187
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:24,038
Did you know Marisa Tomei
won an Oscar for that?

188
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:27,279
Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think?
I wish I looked like that.

189
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,159
Turn it off.
You're making me jealous.

190
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:35,841
I'm gonna think you like her
more than you like me.

191
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,359
- Hello?
- Elaine, it's me, George.

192
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,358
- How come you're whispering?
- Never mind.

193
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,916
Never mind.
I need you to do me a favour.

194
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,476
Remember what we were talking
about at the coffee shop?

195
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,921
No.

196
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,115
Think a second.

197
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,120
You know, your friend was talking
about me and, you know...

198
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:04,120
George, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

199
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:06,243
- The actress.
- What?

200
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,479
Marisa Tomei!

201
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,445
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

202
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:12,801
Oh, yeah.

203
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:15,527
- Yeah, what about her?
- Well...

204
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,279
...I think I'd like to do it.
- What?

205
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:18,641
What?

206
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,116
George, no way. You're engaged.

207
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,845
A coffee.
That doesn't mean anything.

208
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,358
- No, George.
- Elaine.

209
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:27,916
- Forget it.
- Elaine.

210
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,157
Elaine! Don't!

211
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:35,442
The judge! I hate this guy.

212
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,477
I can't believe you're buying
your father a car.

213
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,558
And best of all, it's a Cadillac.

214
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:46,077
A Cadillac?

215
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:52,079
I had no idea you had
this kind of money.

216
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,925
I don't like to talk about it.

217
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:58,476
Yeah, I mean,
I thought you were doing okay.

218
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:02,356
I just didn't think you were
in this kind of, you know...

219
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:05,045
...position.

220
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,685
It's just money.

221
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:09,844
So when are you getting back
from Florida?

222
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,683
Oh, I don't know.
I'll play it by ear. Why?

223
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:15,521
I don't know, just...

224
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:19,043
Things seem a little more exciting
when you're around.

225
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:21,840
That's all.

226
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,800
Are you okay?

227
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,686
Sure, sure.

228
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:29,280
- What was that?
- Quiet, quiet.

229
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:34,001
Hey, you know the guy
who lives here?

230
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,635
- Yeah.
- All morning I've been waiting here.

231
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:39,275
- All morning.
- Oh, this is...

232
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:44,242
The guy says he's gonna be home.
I show up, and all I do is wait.

233
00:10:46,887 --> 00:10:49,117
I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it.

234
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:51,084
I'm not gonna put up with it
much longer.

235
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,363
I'm loving this.

236
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:58,006
Hey, there's a guy out here that...

237
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,759
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

238
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,246
Thanks very much for yesterday,
by the way.

239
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:07,285
Jerry, he wants me to fix him up
with Marisa Tomei.

240
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,278
I am not gonna be a part of this.

241
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:12,359
"Fixed up"? A cup of coffee.
A cup of coffee is not a fix-up.

242
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:15,200
You wanna meet her.
You wanna see if she likes you?

243
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,006
- So what? So what if I do?
- You're engaged!

244
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:20,556
I'm aware! I'm aware!

245
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,719
But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine.
An Oscar winner.

246
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,479
How can I live the rest of my life...

247
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:27,285
...knowing I could have been
with her?

248
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:28,721
She said I was just her type.

249
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,685
She loves short, stocky,
balding funnymen.

250
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,760
I notice you threw "stocky" in.

251
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah, what the hell.

252
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,518
George, it's cheating.

253
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:40,247
It's not cheating if there's no sex.

254
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,477
Yes, it is. Jerry.

255
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,243
Hundred. Hold on a second.

256
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,517
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear what you said.

257
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:55,916
Elaine, come on.

258
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,157
Would you make the call?
Please, make the call.

259
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,158
Yeah. Yeah, fine. I'll call.

260
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,481
- Eight fifty.
- Oh, right.

261
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,399
So...

262
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:14,162
...how are you getting to the airport?
Do you need a ride, or?

263
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,127
- Don't be silly. I've arranged a car.
- You sure? You sure?

264
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,039
Because, you know...

265
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:24,885
- Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
- Okay.

266
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,839
Oh, hi.

267
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:30,884
Is Katy there?

268
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:34,721
What?

269
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,718
Oh, really?

270
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,117
Well, could you tell her
Elaine called?

271
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:41,084
Yeah, thanks.

272
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,647
She's in the hospital.
She has an arrhythmia.

273
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:48,202
What about Marisa Tomei?

274
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,397
Morty, what do you have to open
this box for?

275
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,523
There's already
a box of cookies open.

276
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:01,836
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.

277
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,998
I don't want all these open boxes.

278
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,725
Look, I got a few good years left.

279
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:08,720
If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.

280
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:11,526
Surprise!

281
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,121
- Jerry!
- Oh, my God!

282
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:17,006
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm a good son.

283
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,805
Just like that? No call?

284
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,083
- Just like that.
- Oh, you are really something.

285
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,646
To what do we owe this honour?

286
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,320
You wanna know, come on outside.

287
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:25,806
Outside? What's going on?

288
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,276
Whenever Jerry comes,
something exciting happens.

289
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,846
Come on, come on.

290
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,636
- Well, what do you think?
- Look at this.

291
00:13:39,287 --> 00:13:41,039
Look at this.

292
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,640
You bought a Cadillac?

293
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:44,604
I bought it for you. It's yours.

294
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,962
You what?
You bought me a Cadillac?

295
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,197
I bought you a Cadillac.
Here you go.

296
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,800
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,400
- What?
- We can't take this.

298
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,125
You don't want it? Are you kidding?

299
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,755
- He's not buying us a Cadillac.
- What are you, nuts?

300
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,395
This is a very nice gesture, Jerry,
but take it back.

301
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,046
Can you believe this?

302
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,085
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac.
He hasn't got the money.

303
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,045
- How do you know?
- Oh, get out of here, Mr. Big Shot.

304
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:08,720
Why can't I buy my father a car?

305
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:10,764
- Your father doesn't need a car.
- Yes, I do.

306
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:12,519
- Oh, Morty.
- We're keeping it.

307
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,882
Over my dead body.
Give me those. Give me...

308
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:17,277
Well, this worked out
just as I had hoped.

309
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:26,482
- Giddyup.
- Yeah, this is Nick Stevens...

310
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:28,205
...from Plaza Cable.

311
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,483
Well, I waited all morning again.

312
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,558
You said you were gonna be there
from 9 to 1.

313
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,116
I was there. Where were you?

314
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,561
I got nothing better to do...

315
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:39,560
...than stand outside all morning
waiting for you to show up?

316
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:42,161
You're not gonna
get away with this.

317
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:44,519
Hey, Jerry, look at this.

318
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:47,076
My seat's got a memory,
in case somebody moves it.

319
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:48,566
I could be in prison for years.

320
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,763
I come out, my seat goes back
to where I like it.

321
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:52,406
That's what I was thinking.

322
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,765
Hello, Jerry.

323
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,246
Hiya, Jack.

324
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:57,806
So...

325
00:14:57,967 --> 00:14:59,286
...how do you like this?

326
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,199
- Whose car?
- It's mine.

327
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,880
- Yours?
- That's right.

328
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,197
- My son bought it for me.
- He what?

329
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,561
My son bought me the car.

330
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:07,921
It's a present.

331
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,317
- You bought it?
- That's right. I bought it.

332
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,715
You ever see one so nice?

333
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,036
Some car.

334
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:15,437
- You wanna take a ride?
- No, thank you.

335
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,484
- Come on, take a ride.
- I don't wanna ride.

336
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,717
- Why not?
- I don't feel like taking a ride.

337
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,206
Do I have to take a ride?

338
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,800
He doesn't wanna take a ride.

339
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,356
What do you think,
I've never ridden in a Cadillac?

340
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,405
Believe me, I have ridden
in a Cadillac hundreds of times.

341
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,319
- Thousands.
- Thousands?

342
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,524
You think you're such a big shot now
because you got a Cadillac?

343
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:37,802
Did you believe that guy?

344
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:42,321
Anyway, I was thinking
about what you said...

345
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,635
...about me and Marisa, you know,
the two of us getting together.

346
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,958
And I know that I said
that I was engaged...

347
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:53,518
...but, you know, it's really just
something you say, you know.

348
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,918
It's like going steady, you know.
Going steady, engaged.

349
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,442
It's all just stuff you say.

350
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,807
Anyway, I was watching
My Cousin Vinny...

351
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:06,755
...on the tape the other day
and I was thinking that...

352
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:10,636
...you know, the two of us
might take a meeting, as they say.

353
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,678
So, what do you think?

354
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,322
Move a pinkie if it's yes.
Can you move a pinkie?

355
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,761
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Kramer.

356
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,077
This is McNab
down at the phone company.

357
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,478
We got a report
about some trouble on your line.

358
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:37,196
Well, I haven't had any trouble.

359
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:40,723
Thing is, we happen to have a man
right in your neighbourhood.

360
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:46,799
Is that right? Well, I have been having
a little trouble with my call waiting.

361
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,878
We can fix that. We can fix that.

362
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,605
Oh, can you?

363
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,917
Well, that's funny.
Because as it happens...

364
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,964
...I don't have call waiting.

365
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,324
Seems to me that the phone company
would know that.

366
00:16:58,487 --> 00:16:59,966
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

367
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:03,597
I was looking at the wrong
work order.

368
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,200
Could you hold on for a second?

369
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,086
I've got something on the stove.

370
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,483
Hey, McNab!
Chunnel's on HBO tonight!

371
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,115
Why don't you stop by!

372
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,077
All right. Next thing on the agenda:

373
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,761
The restoration of the fence
at the Broward Gate.

374
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:37,999
At the present time,
we are still accepting bids.

375
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,998
It's been broken
for six months already.

376
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,361
What the hell are you doing?

377
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,166
Well, I, as your president,
have to find the best price.

378
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,125
And right now, I, for one,
do not think it's cost-feasible.

379
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,801
I'll bet you don't.

380
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,036
What's that?

381
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:54,165
Come on, Morty. The jig is up.

382
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,079
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

383
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:59,364
I'm sitting here the whole meeting
holding my tongue.

384
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:02,963
I know you a long time, Morty,
but I cannot hold it in any longer.

385
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:05,687
- What's going on, Jack?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

386
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:09,362
Morty Seinfeld has been
stealing funds from the treasury.

387
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,358
- Stealing?
- What proof do you have?

388
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:12,880
Proof? You want proof?

389
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:15,402
He's driving around
in a brand-new Cadillac.

390
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,886
What more proof do you want?

391
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,605
My son bought me that car.

392
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:22,237
Your son? Your son could never
afford that car.

393
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,365
We all saw his act
last year at the playhouse.

394
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,043
He's lucky he can pay his rent.

395
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,880
Jack's right. He stinks.

396
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:32,241
It's his material.

397
00:18:32,407 --> 00:18:34,796
I tell you, he bought it for me.

398
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:38,004
- I move for a full investigation.
- I second.

399
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:44,559
- Impeachment?
- That's right.

400
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,365
Have you ever heard anything
like that?

401
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:49,041
- Can they do that?
- Lf they get the votes.

402
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,357
Told you we shouldn't have let him
give us the car.

403
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,166
Didn't you tell them I got the bill?
That proves I paid for it.

404
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:57,478
It doesn't make a difference.
They think we're in cahoots.

405
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:01,524
You could put a fence around these
condos and call it an insane asylum.

406
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,279
Nobody would know the difference.

407
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,278
No one's ever
been impeached before.

408
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,723
I couldn't live here.
We'd have to move to Boca.

409
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,120
Hello?

410
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:14,165
- Oh, hi, Evelyn.
- Hello, Jerry.

411
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:17,525
I just got off the phone
with Sol Brandes.

412
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:21,043
- What did he say?
- He's voting to impeach.

413
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,518
Not because he thinks
you stole the money...

414
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,837
...but mainly because you never
thanked him...

415
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:29,044
...for giving you his aisle seat
at Freddy Roman's show.

416
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,486
I did so thank him.

417
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:34,320
No, he never heard you.
I told you he didn't hear you.

418
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,239
He's deaf anyway.

419
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:39,922
Now, my sources tell me...

420
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:42,476
...there's three votes
for impeachment...

421
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,444
...three votes
against impeachment...

422
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,643
...and one undecided.

423
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,718
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Choate.

424
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,161
- Who's she?
- Oh, that one?

425
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,557
She's been a member of the board
longer than anybody.

426
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,046
She's very tough to deal with.

427
00:19:54,207 --> 00:19:57,802
Maybe we should have her over
for coffee and explain our side of it.

428
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,401
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

429
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,603
I'll see you
at the Lichtenbergs' tonight.

430
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,520
- The Lichtenbergs'?
- Yes, they're having a party.

431
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,245
We weren't invited.

432
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,520
Well.

433
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,077
Probably they think
you're too good for them.

434
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:14,807
You know, because of the car.

435
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,081
We're losing all our friends.

436
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:26,958
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Kramer?

437
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:28,719
This is John Hanaran from Con Ed.

438
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:32,004
- Oh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
- Yes.

439
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:34,965
We've had some reports
of power surges in your building.

440
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:36,879
It seems some jok ers
were up on the roof.

441
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,799
They must have damaged
some of the wires.

442
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,197
Oh, you don't say.

443
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,676
Either way, we need to get
into your apartment...

444
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:45,360
...and do a safety check.

445
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,522
Oh, you're good.

446
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:51,281
You are really good.

447
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,646
What are you talking about?

448
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:02,236
I guess I should just
go introduce myself, huh?

449
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,285
Hey, what are you watching?

450
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:08,878
Only You?
