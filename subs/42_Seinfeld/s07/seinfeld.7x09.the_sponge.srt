1
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:03,796
People can be so vain.

2
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,795
I have a friend, wears eyeglasses,
no prescription...

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,958
...because he thinks
he looks more intelligent.

4
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:12,197
Now, why? Why do we think...

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:14,927
...that glasses makes us look
more intelligent?

6
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:18,124
Is it from the endless hours of reading
and studying and researching...

7
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,926
...that this person supposedly
blew out their eyeballs?

8
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,647
And that's why
they need the glasses?

9
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:26,685
It's a corrective device. If you see
someone with a hearing aid...

10
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:29,600
...you don't think, "Oh, they must
have been listening real good.

11
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:33,726
Yeah, to a lot of important stuff."
No, they're deaf.

12
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:35,526
They can't hear.

13
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,645
- Hey, boys and girls.
- Hey.

14
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,275
I need you both to sponsor me
in the AIDS Walk.

15
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:46,917
- Isn't that tomorrow?
- Yeah, yeah. So get... Get...

16
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:50,079
Well, I admire you for joining
the fight against AIDS.

17
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:53,557
Yeah, well, if I didn't do something,
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

18
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:56,116
It's hard enough living next door.

19
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:58,364
Some people,
they just wear a ribbon...

20
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:00,643
...and they think they're
doing something. Not me.

21
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,401
I talk the talk
and I walk the walk, baby.

22
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,484
Yeah, I'm gonna be right back.

23
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,003
- New jeans?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,806
- Still a 31 waist?
- Yep, since college.

25
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:18,836
- Hey, Lena Small is on this list.
- Lena Small?

26
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:23,319
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call
for a date, she was unlisted...

27
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:26,479
...and now here's her number.
- Oh, you're not gonna...

28
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:30,435
...cop a girl's phone number
off an AIDS charity list.

29
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:34,282
Elaine, you should admire me.
I'm aspiring to date a giving person.

30
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:37,041
- But you're a taking person.
- That's why I should date...

31
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,243
...a giving person.
If I date a taking person...

32
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:42,604
...everyone's taking, taking, taking.
No one's giving. It's bedlam.

33
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,723
She's gonna ask
how you got her number.

34
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:48,243
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy
who knew her and he gave it to me.

35
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,602
- What's he look like?
- I didn't pay much attention.

36
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,678
I'd just come
from buying a speedboat.

37
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,805
- You're buying a speedboat?
- See, we're already off the subject...

38
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,400
...of how I got her number.

39
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,206
All I do is get past the first
phone call and I'm home free.

40
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,483
- I don't know.
- Lf Billy got your number...

41
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:05,320
...off the AIDS Walk list,
you wouldn't have gone out with him?

42
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:06,761
- Well...
- Yeah.

43
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:10,438
- So you really like this guy?
- Very much.

44
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:15,158
- How's the sexual chemistry?
- Haven't been in the lab yet.

45
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,435
But I am
birth-control shopping today.

46
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:22,000
- Are you still on the pill?
- Oh, Kramer...

47
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,159
No, I think birth control should
be discussed in an open forum.

48
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,438
- The Sponge, okay?
- Sponge?

49
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,165
The Today Sponge.

50
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,365
But wasn't that taken off
the market?

51
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:34,321
Off the market? The Sponge?
No, no. No way.

52
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,718
- Everybody loves the Sponge.
- I read it in Wall Street Week.

53
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,479
Louis Rukeyser.

54
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:45,883
Hello, Lena?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

55
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,719
How did I get your number?

56
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,640
I met a guy that knows you,
he gave it to me.

57
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,204
I don't remember his name.
I think it began with a W, maybe a Q.

58
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,281
I wasn't paying attention.
I'd just come from shopping...

59
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:58,880
...for a speedboat.

60
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,160
You know, I really like those
new jeans Jerry was wearing.

61
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,238
He's really thin.

62
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,883
Not as thin as you think.

63
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:12,916
Why? He's a 31.
I saw the tag on the back.

64
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,084
The tag, huh?

65
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,521
Let me tell you something
about that tag.

66
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:23,159
It's no 31,
and let's just leave it at that.

67
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,356
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:30,442
He scratches off a 32
and he puts in "31."

69
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:33,679
What? Oh, how could
he be so vain?

70
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,839
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld
that only I know.

71
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:40,960
- I can't believe I just told you that.
- Why not?

72
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,197
Well, Jerry doesn't want
anyone to know.

73
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,597
It's all right, I'm your fiancée.
Everyone assumes...

74
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,485
...you'll tell me everything.

75
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:51,877
- Where did you get that from?
- Well, we're a couple. It's understood.

76
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,315
- I never heard of that.
- Well, you've never been a couple.

77
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,966
I've coupled. I've coupled.

78
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,563
Keeping secrets.

79
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:02,525
This is just like
your secret bank code.

80
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:06,202
This is totally different. That was
my secret. This is Jerry's secret.

81
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:08,597
There's attorney-client
privileges here.

82
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,679
If I play it by your rule,
no one will ever confide in me again.

83
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,883
I'll be cut out of the loop.

84
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,884
- Hey.
- Hey.

85
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,595
- What's the matter?
- I had a fight with Susan.

86
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,041
What about?

87
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,723
Clothing something, I don't know...

88
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:29,483
- So, what are you doing tonight?
- I got a date with that girl Lena.

89
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:33,323
- Lena? How did you meet her?
- I actually met her a few weeks ago...

90
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:35,239
...but...

91
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:42,681
Jerry got Lena's unlisted number
from Kramer's AIDS Walk list.

92
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:46,840
Monica, Jerry got Lena's unlisted
number off of an AIDS Walk list.

93
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,567
He got her number
off an AIDS Walk list?

94
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,518
You met her
a few weeks ago, but?

95
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,326
I didn't call her till today.

96
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,842
So, wanna double?

97
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:05,316
- What?
- Well, you know, I just had a fight.

98
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:06,920
I need a group dynamic.

99
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,165
- I don't know.
- Hey.

100
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,557
- Hey.
- Well, Kramer was right.

101
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,036
My friend Kim told me
the Sponge is off the market.

102
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:15,879
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you.

103
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:19,119
I'm gonna do a hard target search
of every drug store, general store...

104
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:22,757
...health store, grocery store
in a 25 block radius:

105
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,001
Just for these Sponges?

106
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:27,841
Hey, women are really loyal
to their birth-control methods.

107
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:31,317
- What does Susan use?
- I don't know.

108
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,476
- You don't now?
- I...

109
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,004
Figure it's something.

110
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:46,522
- What are you all out of breath from?
- The elevator just broke.

111
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:49,201
I had to walk up five flights.

112
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,518
And you got the AIDS Walk
tomorrow.

113
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,917
You're never gonna make it.
You're in horrible shape.

114
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:58,124
- I'm in tiptop shape.
- Tiptop?

115
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,723
- Better than you.
- I got a 31 waist, mister.

116
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,683
Well, I'm walking for charity.
What are you doing?

117
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:09,159
What am I doing? I'm dating a woman
who happens to be sponsoring...

118
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,557
...one of these walkers.

119
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,475
Do you have any Today Sponges?

120
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:25,080
Do you carry Today Sponges?

121
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:31,158
- Can I help you?
- Do you have any Today Sponges?

122
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,763
- I know they're off the market...
- Actually, we have a case left.

123
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,964
A case? A case of Sponges?

124
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:42,446
I mean, a case.

125
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,322
How many come in a case?

126
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:50,966
Sixty.

127
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,084
Sixty?

128
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,118
- Well, I'll take three.
- Three?

129
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,482
Yeah. Make it 10.

130
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:02,964
- Ten?
- Twenty Sponges should be plenty.

131
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,999
- Did you say 20?
- Yeah, 25 Sponges is just fine.

132
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,919
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:11,123
- You're set with 25?
- Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,881
Just give me the whole case,
I'll be on my way.

135
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:21,321
Hey, I have found the best-smelling
detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.

136
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,916
- Very nice.
- It's All TempaCheer.

137
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:28,923
I use Planet. It's biodegradable...

138
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,679
...and it doesn't pollute the oceans.

139
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,566
Yeah, the oceans are really
getting very sudsy.

140
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,202
Can you wrap up all the leftovers
on the table, please?

141
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,199
I always take the leftovers.

142
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:43,439
I work in a soup kitchen
every morning at 6 a.m.

143
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:45,962
They serve soup at 6 a. M?

144
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,118
Yeah, that's all they have.

145
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:51,279
Do the bums ever complain,
"Soup again?"

146
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:53,244
- I'd get tired of it.
- How could you not?

147
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:57,082
- Guess who volunteered last week.
- Mick Jagger.

148
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,406
No.

149
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,036
- Maya Angelou.
- Oh, the poet.

150
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,485
So let me ask you something. These
people eat soup three times a day?

151
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:08,524
- I don't know.
- Did you get to talk to her?

152
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,837
- Talk to who?
- Is it a lot of cream soups?

153
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,965
- Maya Angelou, the poet.
- No, I didn't get the chance.

154
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,199
You know, I'm sure you can reach her.
She's a poet, you know.

155
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,403
What does a poet need
an unlisted number for?

156
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:23,637
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- I'll go with you.

157
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,000
Why are you
looking at me like that?

158
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,283
Why did you have to mention
"unlisted number"?

159
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,961
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta tell you something...

160
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,685
...but you cannot tell Susan.

161
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:40,601
Jerry got her phone number
off of an AIDS Walk list?

162
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,962
- Oh, that's awful.
- I know, but don't say anything.

163
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:44,685
He told me not to tell you.

164
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,326
But you told me anyway?

165
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,685
Well, you know, I was thinking
about what you said before...

166
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:53,726
...and you're right, I've never really
been a couple, so if that's the rule...

167
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:56,355
...l'm gonna go by the rule.
- Thank you, honey.

168
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:01,638
So you wanna go home
and make up officially?

169
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,601
- Can we stop by a drug store first?
- What for?

170
00:09:04,847 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm out of birth control stuff.

171
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,323
Oh, yeah.

172
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:11,320
- Where am I gonna park?
- No, don't park. I'll just sit in the car.

173
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:15,116
- You can run in.
- Me run in? Why don't you run in?

174
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,562
You don't know what I use
for birth control, do you?

175
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:21,084
- Of course I do.
- You do? What?

176
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,241
- You know, you use the:
- The what?

177
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:27,796
You know, the:

178
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,639
Just get me some Sponges, please.

179
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:32,526
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They don't have them anymore.

180
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,803
- What?
- I just found out they're off the market.

181
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,800
- Off the market? The Sponge?
- So you gotta use something else.

182
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:41,846
I can't. I love the Sponge.
I need the Sponge.

183
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,799
Okay.

184
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,962
I think I know where we can get one.

185
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,717
Kramer, what the hell
is going on in here?

186
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:02,516
It's a poker game.
And I'm kicking some serious butt!

187
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,121
Are you out of your mind?
You got the AIDS Walk tomorrow.

188
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:08,597
- Hey, Kramer, are you in?
- Oh, you gotta be kidding...

189
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,396
You see those two ladies
I got showing? Do they look scared?

190
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,922
- What were you saying?
- You're never gonna make it.

191
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,595
Let's go! Let's go!
Rack them up! Come on!

192
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:27,445
Do you?

193
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,276
Do you wanna go in the bedroom?

194
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,075
Okay.

195
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,238
- Hold on just a second.
- Okay.

196
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,199
Elaine, it's me, George.

197
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,003
- Hey, sorry to bother you so late.
- Yeah.

198
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,919
Hey, how you doing?

199
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:52,205
- Did you get any of those Sponges?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,995
Cleaned out the whole West Side.

201
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,680
Why?

202
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:02,518
- Well, Susan.
- Oh, Susan uses the Sponge.

203
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:05,565
- Susan loves the Sponge.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, George.

204
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,957
- I can't help you out.
- What?

205
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,277
I can't do it. No way.
There's no how.

206
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,597
Wait... Elaine.
Let me explain something to you.

207
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,156
You see, this is not just
a weekend routine.

208
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,158
I'm on the verge
of make-up sex here.

209
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:18,965
- You know about make-up sex?
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:22,324
George, I know all about
make-up sex and I'm really sorry.

211
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:23,715
But, Elaine...

212
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:26,685
Elaine, can I just explain
something to you very privately.

213
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,123
Susan and I have been together
many, many times now...

214
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,359
...and just between you and me,
there's really no big surprises here...

215
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,325
...so make-up sex
is all that I have left.

216
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,486
I'm sure you'll have
another fight, George.

217
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:46,360
Hold that thought.

218
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,160
Oh, so listen to this.

219
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,239
But don't tell anyone.

220
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,285
Jerry Seinfeld,
he got a woman's number...

221
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:09,563
...off an AIDS Walk list.

222
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,525
He got her number
off an AIDS Walk list?

223
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,678
He what?

224
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:19,965
How did you find out?

225
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,801
A friend of a friend
of a friend knows Susan.

226
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,197
- George!
- Pardon?

227
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,918
- Pardon?
- Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry. I just...

228
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:32,682
It's okay. There's nothing
to be sorry about. I don't mind.

229
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,807
You don't mind that I got your number
off the AIDS Walk list?

230
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,879
No, not at all. No problem.

231
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,124
Call me later, okay?

232
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:53,646
You're lucky you're walking out of here
with a pair of pants on!

233
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,683
Kramer, you went all night?

234
00:12:56,847 --> 00:13:00,601
- Jerry, breakfast on me.
- Kramer, are you out of your mind?

235
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,405
You got the AIDS Walk
in three hours.

236
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,206
- You're never gonna make it.
- AIDS Walk, that's a cake walk.

237
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,766
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

238
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,877
- So, George?
- Yeah.

239
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:15,917
Guess what? Lena found out
how I got her number.

240
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:21,365
- Really? How did she do that?
- A friend of a friend of Susan's.

241
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,195
- My Susan?
- Why did you tell her?

242
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,804
I had to, Jerry. It's a couple rule.
We have to tell each other everything.

243
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,878
- You know what this means?
- What?

244
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:32,436
You're cut off!
You're out of the loop!

245
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,961
You're cutting me off?
No, no, Jerry, don't cut me off.

246
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,118
You leave me no choice.
You're the media now...

247
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,323
...as far as I'm concerned.
- Oh, Jerry, come on.

248
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,840
Please, it won't happen again.

249
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:45,079
If you were in the Mafia, would you tell
her every time you killed someone?

250
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,364
Hey, a hit is a totally different story.

251
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:52,566
- I don't know, George.
- So Lena was upset, huh?

252
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,957
You know what,
that was the amazing thing.

253
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,800
- What? It didn't bother her?
- No, she said it was fine.

254
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,798
Something very strange
about this girl.

255
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,286
What?

256
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:03,719
- She's too good.
- Too good?

257
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:06,685
I mean, she's giving and caring
and generally concerned...

258
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,476
...about the welfare of others.
I can't be with someone like that.

259
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,042
- I see what you mean.
- I admire the hell out of her.

260
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,482
You can't have sex
with someone you admire.

261
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:18,077
- Where is the depravity?
- No depravity.

262
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:21,319
I mean, I look at her.
I can't imagine she even has sex.

263
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,922
On the other hand...

264
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:30,044
- What?
- Thanks again for last night.

265
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,596
- Hey, I didn't even use one.
- Yeah.

266
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:34,678
- I thought you said it was imminent.
- It was.

267
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:39,045
But then I just couldn't decide
if he was really spongeworthy.

268
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:41,521
Spongeworthy?

269
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,803
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve...

270
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,719
...these Sponges.
- But you like this guy.

271
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,718
- Isn't that what the Sponges are for?
- Yes.

272
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,924
Before they went off the market.
But now I've got to re-evaluate...

273
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:52,520
...my whole screening process.

274
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,996
I can't afford to waste any of them.

275
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:58,800
You know, you're nuts
with these Sponges.

276
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,435
George is getting frustrated.

277
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,924
Cosmo Kramer.

278
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,805
- Okay. You're checked in.
- Thank you.

279
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:12,559
- Here's your AIDS ribbon.
- No, thanks.

280
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,844
- You don't wanna wear one?
- No, no.

281
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,237
- But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
- I have to?

282
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,723
- Yes.
- See, that's why I don't want to.

283
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:23,277
But everyone wears the ribbon.
You must wear the ribbon.

284
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,836
You know what you are?
You're a ribbon bully.

285
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:30,761
Hey! Hey, you, come back here!
Come back here and put this on!

286
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:36,883
Elaine and her Sponges. She's got
like a war chest full of them.

287
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:38,958
I don't see
why you can't just use condoms.

288
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,279
Oh, no, no.
No, condoms are for single men.

289
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:45,837
The day that we got engaged, I said
goodbye to the condom forever.

290
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,563
Just once, for the make-up sex.

291
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,524
Make-up sex?
You have to have that...

292
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,598
...right after the fight.
We're way past that.

293
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,962
- Come on, just once.
- No, no, I hate the condom.

294
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:56,765
Why?

295
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,600
I can never get the package
open in time.

296
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:03,163
- Well, you just tear it open.
- It's not that easy.

297
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
It's like Beat the Clock.
There's a lot of pressure there.

298
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,082
- Hey, where's your ribbon?
- Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.

299
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:14,761
You don't wear the ribbon?
Aren't you against AIDS?

300
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,999
Yeah, I'm against AIDS.
I mean, I'm walking, aren't I?

301
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,601
- I just don't wear the ribbon.
- Who do you think you are?

302
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,440
- Put the ribbon on.
- Hey, Cedric, Bob.

303
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,086
This guy won't wear a ribbon.

304
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:29,239
Who? Who doesn't
want to wear the ribbon?

305
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,845
- So you think you're spongeworthy?
- Yes, I think I'm spongeworthy.

306
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,362
I think I'm very spongeworthy.

307
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,805
Run down your case for me again.

308
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,801
Well, we've gone out several times.
We obviously have a good rapport.

309
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,925
I own a very profitable
electronics distributing firm.

310
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,045
I eat well. I exercise.
Blood tests, immaculate.

311
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:57,079
And if I can speak frankly,
I'm actually quite good at it.

312
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,566
You gonna do something...

313
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,036
...about your sideburns?
- Yeah, I told you.

314
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,358
I'm gonna trim my sideburns.

315
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,764
- And the bathroom in your apartment?
- Cleaned it this morning.

316
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,602
- The sink, the tub, everything clean?
- Everything. It's spotless.

317
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,877
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

318
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,881
- Hi.
- Hi.

319
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:28,042
Hey, look at this. I just got a citation
in the mail for my work with shut-ins.

320
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:30,004
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice.

321
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,397
You know, they're
a very eccentric group...

322
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:36,401
...because they're shut in.
Of course, they're not locked in...

323
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,364
...they're free to go at any time.

324
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:42,646
Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup
kitchen, they do have cream soups.

325
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:44,684
Hey, that's dynamite.
You know, Lena...

326
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:48,283
...I wanted to talk to you
about something.

327
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,247
You know, because
you're such a good person...

328
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,159
...that l...
- Oh, hang on to that thought.

329
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:55,966
I'm rinsing a sweater.
I left the water running.

330
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:58,687
Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel
out of my bedroom closet?

331
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,485
Oh, okay.

332
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,641
Oh, my God.
Look what's going on here.

333
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,476
She is depraved.

334
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:20,675
- There you are.
- Thanks.

335
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:24,285
- So you were saying?
- What? Nothing.

336
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:26,756
No, you said I was a good person...

337
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:30,079
You seem like
you wanna tell me something.

338
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:33,006
Tell you something? I do.

339
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,635
What is it, Jerry?
You can tell me anything.

340
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,124
- You see these jeans I'm wearing?
- Yeah?

341
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,960
I change the 32 waist on the label...

342
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:46,722
...to a 31 on all my jeans.

343
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,363
So you know...

344
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,637
That's it.

345
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,680
- Come on, George, just rip it open.
- I'm trying, damn it.

346
00:18:57,847 --> 00:19:00,281
- Tear it from the side.
- I tried to tear it from the side.

347
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,007
I can't get a good grip.
You gotta do it like a bag of chips.

348
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,441
- Give it to me.
- Wait a second.

349
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,563
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Wait a second.

350
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,604
You see? You see?

351
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,564
I got it.

352
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,599
Come on.

353
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:14,486
Come on.

354
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:17,838
It's too late.

355
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,796
So, what's it going to be?

356
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,798
Are you going to wear the ribbon?

357
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,078
No. Never.

358
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,636
But I'm wearing the ribbon.
He's wearing the ribbon.

359
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,399
We are all wearing the ribbon.

360
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,478
So why aren't you
going to wear the ribbon?

361
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:34,320
This is America. I don't have to wear
anything I don't want to!

362
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:37,843
- What are we gonna do with him?
- I guess we're just going to...

363
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:40,567
...have to teach him
to wear the ribbon.

364
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:51,600
- It completely turned her off.
- Well, I can see that.

365
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,804
Why do you have to do that for?
Who cares about your pant size?

366
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,037
I don't wanna be a 32.

367
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,598
I'd kill to be a 32.

368
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:03,601
She said I wasn't spongeworthy.
Wouldn't waste a Sponge on me.

369
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,959
I wish I had one.
That condom killed me.

370
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:10,039
Why do they have to make
the wrappers so hard to open?

371
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:14,200
It's probably so the woman has
one last chance to change her mind.

372
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,997
You never run out, do you?
Where's Kramer?

373
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,886
- Everything's finished here.
- I told him he'd never make it.

374
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,163
He was up all night.

375
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:27,318
Oh, my God. Kramer?

376
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,276
Look at you. I told you.

377
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:52,166
Up all night playing poker.

378
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,159
Come on.

379
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:59,077
Hey, where's your AIDS ribbon?

380
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:13,083
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

381
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,320
How did you sleep?

382
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,885
Great.

383
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:20,277
- You?
- Fine, fine.

384
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,166
Everything okay?

385
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:26,041
- Yep.
- No regrets?

386
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:28,119
Nope.

387
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:33,643
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

388
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:36,321
Oh, I don't think so.

389
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,441
Why not? I thought you said
everything was fine.

390
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:42,838
I wish I could help you,
but I can't afford two of them.
