1
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,876
When did tick-tack-toe
become the pound sign?

2
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:08,241
Why not call it what it is?

3
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:11,922
"Leave your numeric message now,
and then press Archie's head."

4
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:14,802
And what is that redial button?
Let's face it.

5
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,925
You'll either get the person, the
machine or they have call waiting.

6
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:19,964
Who is redialling and redialling?

7
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:23,199
This is like the harassment key
for people in a fight, you know.

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,597
Hey, I'm not through.

9
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,522
You can't do that to me.

10
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:30,678
And another thing.

11
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,758
Who would win a fight
between you and me?

12
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,121
What do you mean?

13
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:41,926
If you and I ever got into
a really serious fight, you know...

14
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:44,237
...and the punches started flying,
who would win?

15
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:47,236
Well, I think that's pretty obvious.

16
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,319
Yeah, me too.

17
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,201
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hey.

18
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,437
Who do you think would win
a fight between me...

19
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,677
...and gorgeous George here?

20
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:01,362
- You mean a real "fight" fight?
- Mano a baldo.

21
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,760
George.

22
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,127
- Why?
- George fights dirty.

23
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:08,515
Really? What would you do?

24
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:12,885
Pull hair, poke eyes, groin stuff.
Whatever I gotta do.

25
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,283
So listen, you're not doing
anything tomorrow, are you?

26
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:22,316
Because I have an extra ticket to the
historical clothing exhibit at the Met.

27
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:24,239
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:26,796
George?

29
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,164
Would I want to see what
Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?

30
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,079
There's nobody I can go with.

31
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:37,246
You know what?
I don't have one female friend left.

32
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:40,604
Well, no, of course, you don't.
You're a man's woman.

33
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,803
You hate other women
and they hate you.

34
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,161
Thank you.

35
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:46,716
So, Jerry, what time
are we going to the movies?

36
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:49,685
- How about the 8:30?
- Saddle up and ride.

37
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,964
- You wanna get something to eat first?
- No, I'm good.

38
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,441
I wonder if Susan...?

39
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:00,759
No, I better just go.

40
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:03,361
All right. See you.

41
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:07,520
There's nothing more pathetic than
a grown man who's afraid of a woman.

42
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:11,035
Hey, why don't you ask Susan?

43
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,720
- George's Susan?
- Yeah.

44
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,277
Yeah, why not Susan?

45
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:16,880
I should be friends with Susan.

46
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:19,481
Of course, Susan.

47
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,796
Okay. I'll see you guys. Bye.

48
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:26,241
That's gonna be trouble.

49
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,158
- Why?
- Jerry, don't you see?

50
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:33,205
This world here,
this is George's sanctuary.

51
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:37,519
If Susan comes into contact
with this world, his worlds collide.

52
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:39,721
You know what happens then?

53
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,039
Did I tell you I'm getting
a new number?

54
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:50,323
- How come?
- Chicks, man.

55
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,398
Too many chicks know my number.

56
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,523
Hey, Jerry, how are you,
Mr. Backstroke?

57
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:00,042
Kramer, this is Ramon
from the new health club I joined.

58
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,526
- You know what happened?
- What?

59
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,041
They fired me.

60
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,526
- Really?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:06,598
Said I put too much chlorine
in the pool.

62
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:11,317
- Hey, well, stay out of the deep end.
- Okay. See you later.

63
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:15,203
What's in the deep end?

64
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,766
- Hello.
- Hey, George.

65
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,838
- Hey, Laney, what's going on?
- Nothing much.

66
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,235
Can I talk to Susan?

67
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,518
Yeah, right. Hang on.
I'll get her for you.

68
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,564
Seriously, what's up?

69
00:03:29,527 --> 00:03:31,995
No, George, really,
can I talk to Susan?

70
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,516
Susan, why?

71
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:36,565
Because I wanna ask her to lunch
and to the Met tomorrow.

72
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,195
Oh, I don't think you wanna do that.

73
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,166
- Why not?
- Well, what would be the point of that?

74
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:44,681
Will you put her on the phone?

75
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:46,917
Where did this come from
all of a sudden?

76
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,157
Are you gonna let me
talk to Susan or not?

77
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,558
I really think I should have
been consulted about this.

78
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,881
Here. Something.

79
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,397
Hello?

80
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:04,162
Oh, that sounds great.
Oh, I love that sort of stuff.

81
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:06,315
- You wanna sit here?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:08,721
Over there.

83
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:10,726
- Why?
- A little buffer zone.

84
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:16,556
If we were at my place on the couch,
would we sit right next to each other?

85
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,604
- No, you got a point.
- All right.

86
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,239
I can't.

87
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:26,799
- What are you doing?
- Well, these seats have no lumbar.

88
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,360
Oh, hey, there's Ramon.
Pretend we're talking.

89
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,764
- We are talking.
- Pretend it's interesting.

90
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:39,598
So, well, then I had to kill him
and the police are still looking for me.

91
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,803
- Yeah, that's...
- Hey, hi, Jerry.

92
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:43,685
- Hey, Ramon.
- I took a lot of napkins.

93
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,166
- You want some?
- Oh, no, thanks.

94
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,646
Hey, is this seat taken?

95
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,286
No.

96
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,127
And the worst part is, after the movie
he leeched onto us...

97
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,517
...we wound up having
coffee with him for two hours.

98
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:00,247
Then he walks us home, all the way
back to the building.

99
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:03,558
Finally, I said, " Look, Ramon,
I gotta go to bed now."

100
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:08,119
- Have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
- No, why?

101
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,766
She called Susan last night.

102
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,599
Oh, yeah, I know.

103
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,440
- How do you know?
- It was my idea.

104
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,005
- Your idea?
- Yeah?

105
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,316
What'd you do that for?

106
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,362
She was looking for someone
to go to the show with.

107
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,201
Well, that was really a stupid thing.

108
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,881
- You know what's gonna happen now?
- Worlds collide.

109
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:28,805
Yeah.

110
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:32,559
Because this world is
your sanctuary...

111
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:36,037
...and if it comes in contact with this...
- Yes, it blows up.

112
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,004
If you know,
what did you tell Elaine for?

113
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,158
I didn't know. Kramer told me
about the worlds.

114
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:42,921
You couldn't figure out
the worlds theory for yourself?

115
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,566
It's just common sense.

116
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:48,481
Anybody knows
you gotta keep your worlds apart.

117
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:50,285
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.

118
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,445
He knows the worlds theory.

120
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:56,404
What? Is it blowing up?

121
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:02,965
Cosmo, go.

122
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:05,800
No, no, no, no.

123
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,523
This new telephone number
is driving me crazy.

124
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,405
Wrong numbers every five minutes.

125
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,684
- What is it?
- Well, it's 555-3455.

126
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,159
- 555-3455.
- Yeah.

127
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,086
555-3455.

128
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,683
Well, wait a second.
Don't you see? That's 555-FILK.

129
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,439
- What's "filk"?
- Filk's nothing.

130
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:30,405
But 555-FILM is Moviefone.

131
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,920
Oh, Moviefone.

132
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:35,079
Yeah, so people are just dialling it
by mistake and getting you.

133
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:38,923
- So I'm filk.
- You're filk.

134
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,918
Oh, Mama.

135
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:44,121
Well, but what about that number
Susan B. Anthony wore...

136
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,243
...to the 19th Amendment party, huh?

137
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:51,116
Quite the décolletage
for a suffragette.

138
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,324
Well, it must have been
one hell of a party.

139
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,239
Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.

140
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:57,806
What?

141
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:00,041
Forget it.

142
00:07:00,207 --> 00:07:03,119
What? You can tell me.
I'll put it in the vault.

143
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,879
The vault?

144
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:11,244
Mr. Seinfeld, we heard
you went to the movies with Ramon.

145
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,557
I didn't actually go with Ramon.
I bumped into him.

146
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:15,843
It's good he has friends
like you to cheer him up.

147
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:18,521
- Tell him to call us.
- Tell him Dustin says hello.

148
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,518
- All right. I gotta go.
- To see Ramon?

149
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,595
What else did you two do?

150
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,201
Oh, I don't know.
You know, girlie stuff.

151
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:32,800
So flower shows and shopping
for pretty bows...

152
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:36,357
And then back to her place, strip down
to bra and panties for a tickle fight?

153
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:45,284
That's what you think girls do,
isn't it?

154
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,076
Yes, I do.

155
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,085
Alrighty.

156
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:54,445
Hey, you know, George isn't too happy
about your new friendship.

157
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,882
Yeah, well, I don't really give a sh...

158
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,557
Hey, buddy, what's going on?

159
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:04,519
Yeah, hello.

160
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,406
Yeah, no, no, no. Hold on.

161
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:15,478
Yeah, Cupid's Rifle.
Eight-thirty, Sony Lincoln Square.

162
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah, no, no, no.
No problem. Yeah.

163
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,035
You're looking up movies
for people now?

164
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,925
I got time.

165
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:26,726
And this.

166
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:28,525
Cosmo here.

167
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,724
Yeah. No, no, no. I'll help.

168
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,003
Yeah, Firestorm's good.
I saw it yesterday.

169
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,885
My buddy Jerry,
he's seen it twice.

170
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,480
You wanna talk to him?

171
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:39,603
- Here.
- No, Kramer. I don't wanna talk to...

172
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:43,203
Just tell him about the picture.
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

173
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,597
Yes, are you still there?
Look, I'm sorry about that.

174
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,918
All right, there's an 8:30
and a 10: 15 showing.

175
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, that's George. Yeah?

176
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,520
Hey, it's Ramon.

177
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,042
- What?
- It's Ramon, Jerry. I'm coming up.

178
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:57,961
Oh, okay.

179
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,526
What is he doing here?

180
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,121
- Who? Who is Ramon?
- He's the pool guy.

181
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:03,766
- What pool guy?
- Do me a favour.

182
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,997
- Stick around while he's here.
- Yeah, no problem.

183
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,556
Hey, Jerry, how are you, crazy guy?

184
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,884
- So, Ramon, this is my friend Elaine.
- Yeah, and I was just leaving.

185
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,839
Bye-bye, Jerry.

186
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,927
- What are you doing around here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

187
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,806
- I figured I'd check you out.
- I kind of had some things to do.

188
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,685
Oh, yeah?
Where are you going?

189
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:30,680
Just, you know, I don't know.
Stuff I gotta do.

190
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:33,680
Hey, that's cool.
I'm up for some stuff.

191
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:35,885
All right.

192
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:41,363
So get this. I get down there...

193
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:44,439
...and right away
I see the drain is clogged.

194
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:48,395
- It's obvious. Can you believe that?
- All right, Ramon. I'm gonna get going.

195
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,964
- I think we should separate here.
- What are you trying to say, Jerry?

196
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,085
Look. You're a nice guy,
but I actually only have three friends.

197
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,521
I really can't handle any more.

198
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,564
I see. It's because I clean pools,
right?

199
00:09:59,727 --> 00:10:01,957
That has nothing to do with it.

200
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,044
Yeah, we got along real well.

201
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,483
Because, you know,
she has no female friends.

202
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,717
You know that, don't you?

203
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:15,924
Something strange about a woman
whose friends are all men.

204
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:19,523
Yeah, I know.
We talked all about that.

205
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,643
- You talked all about that?
- Oh, yeah.

206
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,685
Elaine opened up her vault.

207
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:27,921
Did you just say "vault"?

208
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,839
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?

209
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,361
You got that from Elaine?

210
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,916
Yeah. So what?

211
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:35,998
Well, it's a little strange.

212
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,000
Are you gonna start
to talk like Elaine from now on?

213
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,361
I don't know.

214
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,882
Anyway, I thought
we'd all go to a movie on Friday.

215
00:10:43,047 --> 00:10:45,038
We'd all go to a movie on Friday?

216
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,526
Yeah.

217
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,877
This is not good.

218
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,515
Worlds are colliding.

219
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,155
George is getting upset!

220
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:02,644
You have no idea
of the magnitude of this thing.

221
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:05,560
If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...

222
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:09,322
...then George Costanza,
as you know him, ceases to exist.

223
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:13,397
You see, right now,
I have relationship George...

224
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:17,162
...but there is also
independent George.

225
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:20,080
That's the George you know,
the George you grew up with.

226
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,718
Movie George, coffee-shop George,
liar George, bawdy George.

227
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:29,722
- I love that George.
- Me too. And he's dying, Jerry.

228
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,720
If relationship George
walks through this door...

229
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:35,276
...he will kill independent George.

230
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:40,400
A George divided against itself
cannot stand.

231
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:47,485
You're killing independent George.
You know that, don't you?

232
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,126
George, I don't even wanna get...

233
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:52,723
You know what word Susan
used last night? "Vault."

234
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,276
- So?
- She got that from you.

235
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,039
Well, I didn't tell her to say it.

236
00:11:57,207 --> 00:12:00,085
Is she the only girl in the whole world?
Can't you find your own?

237
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:01,805
I like her.

238
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:04,765
You see? You see?

239
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:07,043
You see what I'm talking about?

240
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:10,677
It's all just slipping away.

241
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,644
And you're all letting it happen.

242
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,525
- So you wanna catch a movie later?
- Yeah, sure.

243
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,601
I don't have a paper, though.

244
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,721
Hello, and welcome to Moviefone.

245
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:31,926
Brought to you by
The New York Times and Hot 97.

246
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,317
Coming to theatres this Friday:

247
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,762
Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon.

248
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,963
You've got to get me
over that mountain!

249
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,277
No!

250
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:50,955
There's no higher place
than Mountain High. Rated R.

251
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:54,483
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.

252
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,605
Kramer, is that you?

253
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,158
Elaine?

254
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,477
What time does Chow Fun start?

255
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,725
I don't know.

256
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,758
Well, well, look who's here.

257
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,282
What are you doing here?
You could get in trouble.

258
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:20,960
No, I don't think so, Jerry.

259
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,799
You see, they gave me my job back.

260
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,482
- What?
- I'm a pool boy again.

261
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:30,003
Look, Ramon, about the other day,
I'm sorry if I offended you.

262
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,759
I get a little crabby on the subway.

263
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,201
Oh, do you?

264
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,446
What happened to all the towels?

265
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:39,125
I guess they must have
disappeared.

266
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:44,677
Hey, Jerry, look at all the towels they
gave me. I really hit the jackpot.

267
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,520
It's been a terrible situation down there
the past couple of days.

268
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,803
He's really making things
uncomfortable for me.

269
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,686
There's always a big pile
of dirty towels in front of my locker.

270
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,156
Then when I come out of pool,
my towel is always gone.

271
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:01,239
- So frustrating.
- Tell me about it.

272
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,717
So you wanna join me and Susan
for lunch at the coffee shop?

273
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,606
- You're meeting at the coffee shop?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,837
I'm meeting George
for lunch at the coffee shop.

275
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:15,045
Well, this should be very interesting.

276
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:22,483
- Hey, Elaine, Jerry. Over here.
- Oh, there they are.

277
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,841
- Look who I ran into.
- Great.

278
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,601
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

279
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:29,239
Come on. Aren't you gonna
join us?

280
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:32,046
You know, I'm supposed to meet...

281
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:33,356
...someone.

282
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,246
- I'll wait for him outside.
- Wait here. Come on, sit down.

283
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,398
What's the matter with you?

284
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,202
This is gonna be ugly.

285
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:46,357
- What's that, Jerry?
- I said, boy, am I ugly.

286
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,003
Hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.

287
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,039
One, two...

288
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,680
...three...

289
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,481
...four.

290
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:19,442
- Hey, George!
- No, we'll pull up another chair.

291
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,598
I see you there, Ramon.

292
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,440
Hey, I'm not done.

293
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,996
I know what you're up to, Ramon.

294
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,998
Because I'm a member here,
this is my place to swim.

295
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,840
Now, you better cut it out, Ramon.
Just stop it.

296
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,440
Ollie, ollie, oxen free!

297
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,918
No!

298
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:08,877
I think he's gonna need
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

299
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,115
Mouth-to-mouth?

300
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:13,761
Yeah.

301
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,275
Well...

302
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,442
...go ahead.

303
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,325
You go.

304
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,484
You knocked him out.

305
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, but you pulled him in.

306
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:32,000
Come on, Newman. Do it.

307
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,406
No.

308
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,644
He might die.

309
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,559
Yeah. Maybe.

310
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,958
Jerry, we'll meet you
at the theatre. Okay.

311
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:47,197
Next showing's at 9:00.
We can't wait any longer.

312
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,835
Where could he be?
It's not like George to just disappear.

313
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,918
Look, let's just leave him
a note, okay?

314
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,645
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

315
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:55,206
"George.

316
00:16:55,367 --> 00:17:00,919
Elaine and I went
to see Chunnel...

317
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,486
...with Jerry."

318
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,566
- "Love"?
- Yeah.

319
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:07,195
"Love, Susan."

320
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,638
So eventually these people came...

321
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,843
...and somebody gave him
mouth-to-mouth.

322
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:13,360
He could have died.

323
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,206
Yeah, it was a gamble.

324
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,005
Why didn't you give him
mouth-to-mouth?

325
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,566
How can you possibly
show your face there again?

326
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,399
Oh, I can't.
They revoked my membership.

327
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,525
Newman too. No, we can't go
anywhere near there.

328
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:33,523
Hi. Three for Chunnel.
Two adults, one child.

329
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,679
What the hell is this?

330
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,681
"George. Elaine and I went
to see Chunnel with Jerry."

331
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,197
With Jerry, huh? With Jerry.
Great. Great.

332
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:48,717
Probably went to the 84th Street.
That's where I always go with Jerry.

333
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:52,525
Hello, and welcome to Moviefone.

334
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:56,043
If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.

335
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,115
Come on, come on.

336
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,278
Using your touch-tone keypad...

337
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:03,757
...please enter the first three letters
of the movie title now.

338
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:09,966
You've selected Agent Zero.

339
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,561
If that's correct, press one.

340
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,286
What?

- Two theatres?
- Yeah, there's a 9 too.

379
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:28,718
Your car is in the Chunnel,
somewhere between France...

380
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:30,366
Sorry.

381
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,923
- Good, huh?
- What'd you think, Susan?

382
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,725
I don't know.
I couldn't hear anything.

383
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,276
- You two talked the whole movie.
- Oh, well, come on.

384
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,325
- You wanna go grab a bite to eat?
- No, I don't think so.

385
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:44,000
- Why not?
- Well, you know...

386
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,965
...all you guys ever do is sit around
the coffee shop talking...

387
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,845
...sit around Jerry's apartment
talking.

388
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:52,037
Frankly, I don't know
how you can stand it.

389
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:53,716
See you.

390
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,684
I know they're in there.
The three of them.

391
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:59,317
Laughing at me, together.
Laughing and lying.

392
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,602
They're killing independent George!
They're all in on it!

393
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,280
Worlds are colliding!

394
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,040
