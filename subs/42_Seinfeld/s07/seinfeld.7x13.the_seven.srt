1
00:00:02,727 --> 00:00:04,365
I love it when people
are complimented on their clothes.

2
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:08,435
And they accept the compliment
as if it was about them.

3
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:11,804
Nice tie. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:16,678
The compliment is for the tie.
It's not for you. But we take it.

5
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:20,118
And that's the job of clothes.
To get compliments for us.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,403
Because it's very hard
to get compliments...

7
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,877
...based on your human qualities.
Right? Let's face it.

8
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:28,242
No matter how nice you are,
nobody is gonna say:

9
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,363
"Hey, nice person."

10
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:34,926
It's much easier to be a bastard and
just try and match the colours up.

11
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:42,120
Oh, look at this.

12
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:45,643
Boy. Oh, I miss the days when
they made toys that could kill a kid.

13
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,677
Oh, cool. Look at that.

14
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,878
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

15
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:56,438
That is a Schwinn Sting-Ray.
And it's the girls' model.

16
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:59,440
Oh, I always wanted one
of these when I was little.

17
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:02,081
What do you think, Jerry?

18
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,960
Jerry. What do you think?

19
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:08,766
Oh, yeah, it would be great
for your paper route.

20
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:10,326
I love it. I'm getting it.

21
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:13,997
Can you help me get it down, Jerr?
Jerry.

22
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,040
- Your friend needs some help.
- The only way to really help her...

23
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,959
...is to just let her be.

24
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,679
Hey.

25
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,720
- A little baby girl?
- Doctor says it could be any day now.

26
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:41,606
So, Carrie, you and Susan
are cousins.

27
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,996
So your baby daughter is gonna be
Susan's second cousin, right?

28
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:49,204
- So, what does that make me?
- It doesn't make you anything.

29
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:53,443
Well, so, legally, I could
marry your daughter.

30
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:01,605
So have you picked out a name yet?

31
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,957
Well, we've narrowed
it down to a few.

32
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,355
We like Kimberly.

33
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,002
Oh, boy.

34
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:10,084
You don't like Kimberly?

35
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,598
- What else you got?
- How about Joan?

36
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,116
- Come on, I'm eating here.
- George.

37
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:19,000
- Pamela?
- Pamela?

38
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,320
All right. I'll tell you what.

39
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,796
You look like nice people.
I'm gonna help you out.

40
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:27,959
You want a beautiful name? Soda.

41
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:31,045
- What?
- Soda.

42
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,318
S-O-D-A. Soda.

43
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,677
I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.

44
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,881
All names sound strange
the first time you hear them.

45
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,242
Are you telling me people
loved the name Blanche...

46
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:43,602
...the first time they heard it?

47
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:46,799
- Yeah, but Soda?
- Yeah, that's right.

48
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,083
- It's working.
- We'll put it on the list.

49
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:53,118
I solve problems.
That's just what I do.

50
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,035
Yeah, let's look at that boy.

51
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,041
That's good.

52
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:03,845
You're going to town with that turkey.

53
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:06,077
Oh, yeah. I got a big appetite.

54
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,285
Oh, Jerry. You got no mustard.

55
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:12,160
- It's on the door.
- What, this yellow stuff?

56
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:14,158
No, I said, mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

57
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,399
I still wanna do it.

58
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,566
No.

59
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:23,681
That's bush league. No.

60
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,358
Hey, wait. You're just gonna
leave it there?

61
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:28,677
- It's half a pound of turkey.
- I can't eat that.

62
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,599
You can't eat a sandwich
without Dijon.

63
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:34,237
Yeah, you're right. I really should keep
more of your favourites on hand.

64
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:38,880
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm getting a vibe here.

65
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,518
What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

66
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:43,999
What arrangement?

67
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:47,005
I was under the impression that
I could take anything I wanted...

68
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,237
...from your fridge. You take
whatever from mine.

69
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,802
Let me know when you get
something in there, and I will.

70
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,681
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

71
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,680
Hey. What's with your neck?

72
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,156
It's still killing me from having
to get that bike off the wall...

73
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,646
...by myself.

74
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,680
Well, if it's any consolation,
I did get her number.

75
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:08,923
I think I really strained it.

76
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,203
Oh, I doubt you strained it.
Maybe you pulled it.

77
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,959
- Maybe.
- Did you twist it?

78
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,958
- You could have twisted it?
- I don't know.

79
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,839
Did you wrench it?
Did you jam it?

80
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,362
- Maybe you squeezed it and turned it?
- Why don't you...

81
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,802
...just shut the hell up.
- All right.

82
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,439
God, man, this is killing me.

83
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:28,282
I would give that bike to the person
who could make this pain go away.

84
00:04:28,487 --> 00:04:32,719
- You're really hurting, huh?
- Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

85
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,957
Well, you're arterioles
have constricted.

86
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,725
All right, lean forward. Relax.

87
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:39,003
- What? What?
- Encounter shiatsu.

88
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,078
Wait a minute. You know
what you're doing?

89
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,637
Oh, yeah. A wise man once
taught me the healing power...

90
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,162
...of the body's
natural pressure points.

91
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,358
He sells T-shirts near
the World Trade Center.

92
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:52,246
He's a genius.

93
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:53,886
Here we go.
Here we go.

94
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,924
All right, from pain
will come pleasure.

95
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,126
Voilá.

96
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,599
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,555
Wow, that is unbelievable.

98
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:08,922
That pain is totally gone.

99
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:12,762
What's even more amazing is
his formal training is in paediatrics.

100
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:14,840
All right. My work is done here.

101
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,123
Oh, man. Kramer, thank you.

102
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,921
- You can send that bike over any time.
- What?

103
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,836
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.

104
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,396
You said you'd give the bike
to whoever fixes your neck.

105
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,075
- You really think he wants the bike?
- Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,600
But it took him like 10 seconds.

107
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,765
Well, that's the most he's
worked in the last four months.

108
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:39,526
- I think they really went for that Soda.
- What are you, crazy?

109
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,882
They hated it.
They were just humouring you.

110
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,163
All right. Very good.
Believe me.

111
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:47,080
- That kid's going to be called Soda.
- I can tell you...

112
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,044
...I would never name my child Soda.

113
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:51,158
Oh, no, no, no.
No, of course not.

114
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,046
I got a great name for our kids,
a real original.

115
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,124
You wanna hear what it is?
Are you ready?

116
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:57,686
Yeah.

117
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:02,486
- What is that, sign language?
- No.

118
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,878
Seven.

119
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,237
Seven Costanza. You're serious?

120
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,915
Yeah, it's a beautiful name
for a boy or a girl.

121
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:13,238
- Especially a girl. Or a boy.
- I don't think so.

122
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:16,803
- What, you don't like the name?
- It's not a name. It's a number.

123
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,998
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number.

124
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,317
So not only is it
an all-around beautiful name...

125
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,684
...it is also a living tribute.
- It's awful. I hate it.

126
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:28,325
- Well, that's the name.
- Oh, no it is not.

127
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:32,042
No child of mine is ever going
to be named Seven.

128
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,044
All right. Let's just
stay calm here.

129
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,562
Don't get all crazy on me.

130
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:39,798
Seven? Yeah, I guess
I could see it.

131
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,606
Seven. Seven periods of school.
Seven beatings a day.

132
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:47,237
Roughly seven stitches a beating,
and, eventually, seven years to life.

133
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,045
You're doing that child
quite a service.

134
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:50,646
Yes, I am.

135
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,196
I defy you to come up
with a better name than Seven.

136
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,846
All right. Let's see.

137
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,077
How about Mug?

138
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,278
Mug Costanza.

139
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,675
That's original.

140
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:03,725
- Ketchup. Pretty name for a girl.
- Right. You having a good time?

141
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:06,526
I got 50 right here in the cupboard.
How about Bisquick?

142
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,636
Pimento? Gherkin? Sauce?

143
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,197
- Maxwell House?
- All right, already.

144
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,125
This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry.

145
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,686
I had this name for a long time.

146
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,246
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

147
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,960
That's the one you met in the store?

148
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,766
She had this great black and white
dress with a scoop neck.

149
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,838
She looked like some
kind of superhero.

150
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,880
And you met her in an antique store.
I don't know how you do it.

151
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,520
I'm not engaged.

152
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,725
- I got it.
- Got what?

153
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,481
I got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem is solved.

154
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,082
Oh, it's no problem.
You can take whatever you want.

155
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,437
I will. But now I'm accountable.

156
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:44,438
All right, I take what I want. Here.

157
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:45,926
And I write it down.

158
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:48,237
One cupcake.

159
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:51,001
And then I put it in the bowl.

160
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,362
There. Very simple.

161
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:58,163
- Sort of a mooching inventory.
- No, not mooching.

162
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:00,158
Because at the end of the week
you add them.

163
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,045
- And you give me the bill.
- All right.

164
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,606
Look, I gotta run some errands.

165
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,321
When Elaine comes by with that bike,
hang on to it for me.

166
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,563
Kramer, I don't know
if you're getting that bike.

167
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,525
Oh, yes, I am.
We had a verbal contract.

168
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:14,838
If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.

169
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,685
Oh, yeah, yeah, put that on my tab.

170
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:23,922
Well, this is it.
The food is atrocious.

171
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,920
But the busboys
are the best in the city.

172
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:31,040
- May I take your coat, miss?
- Yes, thank you.

173
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,482
- The same outfit?
- The exact same outfit.

174
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,962
- How many days between encounters?
- Three.

175
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:48,598
Three days. Well, maybe you caught
her on the cusp of a new wash cycle.

176
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:51,242
You know, she did laundry
the day after she met you.

177
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,443
Everything got clean.
She started all over again.

178
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:58,956
Possibly. But then shouldn't the outfit
only reappear at the end of the cycle?

179
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,362
Maybe she moved it up
in the rotation.

180
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,683
Why? It's our first date.
She's already in reruns.

181
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,722
- Very curious.
- Indeed.

182
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,963
Einstein wore the exact same outfit
every day.

183
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, if she splits the atom,
I'll let it slide.

184
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:18,281
- All right. I'm heading home.
- Did Susan change her mind...

185
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,563
...about the name?
- Not yet, but she's weakening.

186
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,359
Just because your life is destroyed...

187
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,757
...don't destroy someone else's.

188
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,606
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry.
My idol.

189
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,520
- How about Mickey?
- Mickey?

190
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:32,885
Mickey...

191
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:41,559
- Is this your half a can of soda?
- Nope, that's yours.

192
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,604
My half is gone.

193
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:47,760
- What?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,401
I put my half a can here in the tab.

195
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,446
- Why? What's your beef?
- You cannot buy half a can of soda.

196
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,644
- Well, why not?
- I don't wanna get into the physics of it.

197
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,196
But you know the sound
a can makes when you open it?

198
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,641
- Yeah.
- That is the sound...

199
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,479
...of you buying a whole can.

200
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,037
And the same goes for this.
Okay?

201
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,643
When you pierce the skin of a piece
of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit.

202
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:13,241
Not a third of an apple.
Not a half of a banana.

203
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,125
- All right.
- You bite it, you bought it.

204
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:17,522
All right. I'll make
the necessary adjustments.

205
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:19,518
- All right.
- Thank you.

206
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,042
Oh, so how's the neck?

207
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,475
Nice and loose?

208
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,882
Lookit, Kramer, you are
not getting this bike.

209
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:29,198
I don't even know why you want it.
I mean, it's a girls' bike.

210
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,278
It's a verbal contract.
We had a deal.

211
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:32,715
No, we didn't.

212
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:34,400
You take these things too literally.

213
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,798
It's like saying you're hungry
enough to eat horse.

214
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,079
Well my friend Jay Riemenschneider
eats horse all the time.

215
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,602
He gets it from his butcher.

216
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,200
This is not the point.

217
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,757
The point is,
you just can't have the bike.

218
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,157
Boy, I am really surprised at you.

219
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:54,364
You are the last person I figured
would do something like this.

220
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,957
I mean, George, yeah, I can see that.
Even Jerry.

221
00:10:58,447 --> 00:11:01,996
But not you, Elaine.
I always put you up here.

222
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,476
They're over here.

223
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:08,196
Now you're all:

224
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:16,117
- All right.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:21,956
Come on. It's a fantastic name.

226
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,557
It's a real original. Nobody else is
gonna have it. And I absolutely love it.

227
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,678
Well, I don't know how original
it's gonna be.

228
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,642
- Why not?
- Well, I was telling Carrie...

229
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:34,038
...about our argument. And when I
told them the name, they just loved it.

230
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,278
- So, what are you saying?
- They're naming their baby Seven.

231
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,563
What? They're stealing the name?

232
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:42,955
That's my name. I made it up.

233
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,680
I can't believe they're using it.

234
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,445
Now, it's not gonna be original.

235
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,120
It's gonna lose all its cachet.

236
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,357
I don't know how much
cachet it had to begin with.

237
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, it's got cachet, baby.

238
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,840
It's got cachet up the ying-yang.

239
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,004
Oh, God.

240
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,075
Oh, God.

241
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,886
Kramer.

242
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,959
Watch your step.

243
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, stupid Kramer.

244
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,846
Excuse me, Elaine.

245
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,565
Over here.

246
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,604
I thought that was you.
You're Jerry's friend.

247
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,638
Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:31,526
- Christie?
- Yes, how you doing?

249
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,365
I'm fine.

250
00:12:33,527 --> 00:12:35,677
Well, I gotta run.
It was good to see you.

251
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:38,447
Okay. It was good to...

252
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:40,404
Good to see you.

253
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,876
- Looking good.
- Hey, Cosmo.

254
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,515
- Nice wheels.
- You got that right.

255
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:49,360
- Hey, you're riding a girls' bike.
- Kramer.

256
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,365
Kramer.

257
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,204
- Hello.
- Hello, Ken.

258
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,437
It's George Costanza.

259
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:00,484
I think we need to talk.

260
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,599
Kramer.

261
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,117
- Kramer!
- Hey.

262
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,165
God. Is Kramer back
from his little joyride yet?

263
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:14,037
- Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
- His chiropractic job was a crock.

264
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,516
I mean, it's even worse
than it was before.

265
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,445
I'd think Kramer
would have a knack...

266
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,484
...for moving a person's spine
around.

267
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,326
Hey, you know what?

268
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,717
I think I ran into that girl
from the antique store.

269
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,038
- What's her name, Christie?
- You saw her? What was she wearing?

270
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,326
I don't know. I couldn't see.
I couldn't look down...

271
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,842
...because of my neck.
- Didn't you get a glimpse?

272
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,725
- An impression?
- What do you care?

273
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:40,122
Both times I've seen her,
she's worn the same dress.

274
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:47,167
- Did you have a nice ride?
- Oh, great ride.

275
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,205
Oh, that's good,
because it was your last.

276
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:54,084
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.

277
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:57,199
You gotta give me back that bike.
Look at this! Look!

278
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,278
I couldn't even crawl
out of bed this morning.

279
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:02,439
Bed? You should be sleeping on
a wooden board for at least a week.

280
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:06,003
- What? You never told me that.
- Well, it's common sense.

281
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,317
What is he talking about?
He's being ridiculous.

282
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:10,079
Look, Jerry, you know
the whole story.

283
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:11,646
- You should settle this.
- Yeah.

284
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,559
I'm flattered you'd
appeal to my wisdom.

285
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,957
But, unfortunately,
my friendship to each of you...

286
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:17,958
...precludes my getting involved.

287
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,436
What you need is
an impartial mediator.

288
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,036
Yeah, I'd go for that.
Would you go for that?

289
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:25,084
All right, I'm down.

290
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:27,962
It would have to be someone
who hasn't heard the story.

291
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:31,119
Someone who is unencumbered
by any emotional attachment.

292
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,766
Someone whose heart is so dark...

293
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:36,886
...it cannot be swayed by pity, emotion
or human compassion of any kind.

294
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,085
So that's the situation.

295
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:43,724
You present an interesting dilemma.

296
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,763
Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle.

297
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,399
And yet the bicycle can have
only one rightful owner.

298
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,683
Quite the conundrum.

299
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:58,477
As a federal employee,
I believe the law is all we have.

300
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,763
It's all that separates us
from the savages...

301
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:02,838
...who don't deserve
the privilege of mail.

302
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:05,316
Stuffing parcels in mailboxes,
where they don't belong.

303
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,199
Newman!

304
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:15,438
But you must promise
that you will abide by my decision...

305
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:19,486
...no matter how unjust
it may seem to either of you.

306
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:21,558
Do I have your word?

307
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,558
- All right, yeah.
- Yeah.

308
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:26,844
All right. Let's begin.

309
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,925
My cocoa.

310
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:31,560
Why can't we use Seven?

311
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:35,043
It's my name. I made it up.
You can't just steal it.

312
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,238
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant.

313
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:40,205
You already postponed the wedding.
Who knows if you'll get married.

314
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,604
Hey, hey, don't worry about me.
I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle.

315
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,678
Look, we're both big
Mickey Mantle fans.

316
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,565
And we love the name.
It's very unusual.

317
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,287
What happened to Soda?
I thought we all agreed on Soda.

318
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,796
- We don't care for Soda.
- You don't care for Soda?

319
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:54,725
No, no. We don't like Soda at all.

320
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,919
How do you not like Soda?
It's bubbly. It's refreshing.

321
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,406
- What is it?
- I felt something.

322
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,364
- Are you okay?
- I'm going into labour.

323
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,325
Oh, God. Okay, let's not panic.
Let's just get to the hospital.

324
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:06,842
- Okay.
- I got the suitcase packed right here.

325
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,043
- Let's go.
- What about Six?

326
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,802
Nine? Thirteen?
Thirteen is no good.

327
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,083
Fourteen. Fourteen.

328
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:21,636
Are you okay, Jerry?
You seem quiet.

329
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,601
No, I'm just a little worn-out.

330
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:28,038
- I know exactly what you mean.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

331
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,522
What in God's name
is going on here?

332
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,882
Is she wearing the same thing
over and over again?

333
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,515
Or does she have a closet full
of these lik e Superman?

334
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,882
I've got to unlock this mystery.

335
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,117
Oh, my God.

336
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,965
I can't go to the movies like this.

337
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:47,561
Do you mind if we go back
to my apartment so I can change?

338
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:52,126
Change? Yes, I think
that's a super idea.

339
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,765
- Are we almost there?
- Just keep breathing, okay?

340
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,645
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

341
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:02,846
You know, the thing is, I kind
of promised the widow Mantle...

342
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:04,884
...that I would name my baby Seven.

343
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,561
Now's not the best time, George.

344
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:11,116
It's just that I know her.
And, boy...

345
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,164
George, she's in labour.

346
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,799
So am I.

347
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:23,915
Well, you both presented
very convincing arguments.

348
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,363
On the one hand, Elaine...

349
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,961
...your promise was given in haste.

350
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,362
But was it not still a promise?

351
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:37,325
And, Kramer, you did provide a
service in exchange for compensation.

352
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:41,116
But does the fee, once paid,
not entitle the buyer...

353
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:44,563
...to some assurance
of reliability?

354
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:50,605
These were not easy questions
to answer.

355
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,120
Not for any man.

356
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,167
But I have made a decision.

357
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,878
We will cut the bike
down the middle...

358
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,958
...and give half to each of you.

359
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,203
What? This is your solution?

360
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,085
To ruin the bike?

361
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,636
All right. Fine, fine.
Go ahead.

362
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,685
- Cut the stupid thing in half.
- No, no, no. Give it to her.

363
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,156
I'd rather it belong to another
than see it destroyed.

364
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,158
Newman, give it to her.
I beg you.

365
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,683
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Not so fast, Elaine.

366
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,519
Only the bike's true owner...

367
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:23,440
...would rather give it away
than see it come to harm.

368
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,121
- Kramer, the bike is yours.
- What?

369
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:29,324
Sweet justice.
Newman, you are wise.

370
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,886
But this isn't fair.

371
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:34,238
Lookit, my neck is still hurting me.
And now you have the bike?

372
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, tell it to the judge, honey.

373
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:38,916
I'm going for a ride.

374
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,321
Here we are.

375
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,959
So this is the fortress of solitude.

376
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,480
Well, I guess I'll go change.

377
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:51,521
Yes, change. By all means, change.

378
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:04,999
August 17 th, 1992.

379
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:06,686
The same dress.

380
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,884
She never changes. Oh, my God.

381
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,476
She's gotta have hundreds
of these dresses.

382
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:15,480
There must be a secret stash
around here somewhere.

383
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:23,081
- Are you looking for something?
- I thought you were changing.

384
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,676
You know, maybe we should
just call it a night.

385
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,117
No, no, no. Come on.
Put something else on.

386
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:29,686
It's early. Let's go out.

387
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,322
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

388
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:37,162
You know, I'm kind of tired myself.
I'll just sleep here on the couch.

389
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:40,717
In the morning, we'll walk out together.
Both dressed, different clothes.

390
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,155
I'll be in the same clothes.

391
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:44,477
You'll be in different clothes,
as it's your place.

392
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:47,320
We'll go down. Me in my same
clothes, you in different clothes.

393
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,404
Jerry, I don't think so.

394
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,879
- Wanna throw something on,
walk me...

395
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:54,406
...to a cab?
- Get out.

396
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,764
Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow.
I'll help you lay it out on the bed.

397
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:03,279
- Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
- You're really being very selfish.

398
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,762
Be nice if you'd think
of someone other than yourself.

399
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:08,122
- I'm having a baby.
- You're not getting Seven.

400
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,403
- Now, get out of here.
- Please, I have so little.

401
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,717
- I'm sorry, sir. Family only.
- I'm family.

402
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,684
I'm having sex with the cousin.

403
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,760
Seven! Seven!

404
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:23,363
Hello, Christie. I was wondering
if we could get together again.

405
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:25,160
Oh, really?

406
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,283
You can't break up
with me over the phone.

407
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:30,126
You gotta do this in person.
It doesn't have to be one-on-one.

408
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,278
Bring a group of friends.
I just wanna see you.

409
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:35,803
Don't hang up on me. Why do you
always wear the same dress? Hello?

410
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,677
Jerry, if you're gonna be
snacking on these...

411
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,917
...you can't expect me to pay
for the whole box.

412
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,523
All right, Hobo Joe.

413
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,717
I didn't wanna put a damper
on your smorgasbord.

414
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,959
But it's the end of the week,
so I added up your tab.

415
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,319
I know, pretty steep.

416
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,159
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

417
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,359
- Few do.
- I'm good for it.

418
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:02,684
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid,
the food court is closed.

419
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,441
Closed? All right.

420
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:09,395
I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And don't eat any more.

421
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:14,275
Hey, that's my bike.

422
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,478
- Gangway.
- This is my bike.

423
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,360
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I bought it from Kramer.

424
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:23,320
He was hard up for cash.

425
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:26,001
Fifty bucks. Can you believe it?

426
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,439
I had to make some
minor modifications.

427
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:30,798
Solid tires, reinforced seat post...

428
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:34,238
...heavy-duty shocks.
But, baby, this is one sweet ride.

429
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:37,166
No, you gotta give me back that bike.
Newman, give it.

430
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,643
Elaine, Elaine.
Help me. Help me.

431
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,877
Help. Help. Help.
