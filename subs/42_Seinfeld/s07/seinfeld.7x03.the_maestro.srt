1
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:04,398
I've never been any place
there was no coffee.

2
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:07,798
And people constantly try
to give you coffee.

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:10,845
"Who's having coffee?
Can I get you some coffee?"

4
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,043
Coffee's one of the only things
you can have...

5
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:15,675
...that people continue
to try and give it to you.

6
00:00:15,927 --> 00:00:19,078
Waitresses ask, " Can I fill it up?
Can I warm it up? Can I top it off?"

7
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,726
You could lift up a manhole cover:

8
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,321
"We just made a fresh pot.
Would you like some?"

9
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,115
It has taken over humanity.

10
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:30,404
There are coffee machines
we have to call "mister."

11
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,237
"Coffee anyone?"
"Hey, that's Mr. Coffee to you."

12
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,204
Then I hear this rabbi on television.
I mean, imagine.

13
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,483
I'm really sorry, George.

14
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:52,606
I wasn't jealous of you.
It was just the whole marriage thing.

15
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,519
You know, I was just
a little surprised.

16
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,326
Why would anyone eat canned fruit?

17
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,796
I mean, can anybody answer that?

18
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,164
- What about all the "loser" stuff?
- I don't know where the rabbi got that.

19
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:08,276
You know, I never said that.
I said, "I've never seen you looser."

20
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,157
I could see the can
if you're in the Army.

21
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:14,125
But fresh fruit, it's available.
It's there.

22
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,198
It's two aisles over.

23
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:20,200
Well, scintillating as always.

24
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,927
- Where you going?
- I'm going shopping with Susan.

25
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,203
- What kind of shopping?
- Clothes shopping.

26
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,005
- Where you going?
- Ross'.

27
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,044
- That's a nice store.
- It's her uncle's.

28
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:32,165
- Discount?
- One would hope.

29
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,077
So my friend and I,
we were going to the movies...

30
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,715
...and we stopped off
and bought this café latte.

31
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:41,843
- Is that Italian coffee?
- Yeah, that's right.

32
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:44,123
- Half milk, half coffee?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,321
- You take a sip?
- Yes, I did.

34
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,159
When you did,
did you notice it was hot?

35
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,999
Could you sip it
in your normal fashion?

36
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,961
No, I wasn't able to sip it
in my normal fashion.

37
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,999
All right, all right.

38
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,716
You take big sips?

39
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,079
Well, I think I take a normal sip.

40
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,761
Okay, you take normal sips.
Nothing wrong with that.

41
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:05,395
- Then what happened?
- Well, you know...

42
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:08,764
...they don't allow outside drinks
in the movie theatre...

43
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:11,077
...so I had to put it in my shirt
and sneak it in.

44
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,556
Yeah, see, they like
to sell their own coffee.

45
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:15,957
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- Yeah, it's a problem.

46
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:17,446
It'll be a problem for them.

47
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:19,802
It's a clear violation of
your rights as a consumer.

48
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,878
An infringement
on your constitutional rights.

49
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:24,880
It's outrageous,
egregious, preposterous.

50
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:27,318
It's definitely preposterous.

51
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,079
So then what happened?

52
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:33,638
Well, I was trying to get to my seat,
and I had to step over someone...

53
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:36,037
...and I kind of got pushed,
and it spilled on me.

54
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,277
- Was there a top on it?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,915
Did you put the top on,
or did they put it on for you?

56
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:43,317
- They put the top on.
- And they made the top.

57
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:45,478
You didn't make the top, did you?

58
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,361
Suzy, I want you to go down
to Java World.

59
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,995
Get me a café latte with a top.

60
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,078
We're gonna run
some tests on that top.

61
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:59,157
- Have you been to the doctor?
- No. No, I haven't.

62
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,638
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.

63
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,401
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.
Tell him it's for me.

64
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,479
- So, what do you think, Mr. Chiles?
- Jackie.

65
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,482
- Jackie. I mean, we got a chance?
- Do we have a chance?

66
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,365
Get me one coffee drinker
on that jury...

67
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,279
...you gonna walk out of there
a rich man.

68
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,482
I don't like it. It's red.
It's too flashy.

69
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,558
Well, you could use a little flash.

70
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,959
All right, don't change me.
Susan, don't change me.

71
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:30,756
There's a lot of women that would love
to be in your position right now.

72
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,165
Name one.

73
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:34,919
So did you find anything?

74
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:38,363
Oh, he is impossible
to shop for, Uncle Ned.

75
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:41,205
I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica.

76
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,085
Maybe I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

77
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,363
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.

78
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:50,002
- See, now, this I don't get.
- What?

79
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:52,357
- The security guard.
- What about him?

80
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,086
Why does he have to stand?

81
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,677
Because he's a security guard.

82
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,121
I mean, look at him.

83
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:02,120
He's gotta be on his feet like that
all day? I mean, that's brutal.

84
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:05,085
- I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
- George, you just met him.

85
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,158
Don't say anything to him.

86
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,682
Aren't you concerned
about the security guard?

87
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:11,241
Not really.

88
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,323
She's not concerned
about the security guard.

89
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:16,636
What kind of person is this?

90
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:18,724
I'm marrying a person
who doesn't care...

91
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,798
...this man has to stand
eight hours a day...

92
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,446
...when he could easily
be sitting.

93
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:25,075
All right, George.
What do you think?

94
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:30,799
- So, what did you do last night?
- Nothing.

95
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,605
I know, but what did you
actually do?

96
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:36,760
Literally nothing.
I sat in a chair and I stared.

97
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:40,046
- Wow, that really is nothing.
- I told you.

98
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:41,961
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:43,321
What are you dressed up for?

100
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:46,126
I just came from a meeting
with my lawyer.

101
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,517
- How's that looking?
- I'll tell you how it's looking.

102
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,247
My lawyer says if there's
one coffee drinker on that jury...

103
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:53,238
...l'm gonna be a rich man.

104
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,763
Oh, that's despicable.

105
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,361
How does he know
how all coffee drinkers will vote?

106
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:01,963
I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on
that jury, I wouldn't give you a nickel.

107
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:05,756
Well, you wouldn't be on that jury.
He would've weeded you out.

108
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,644
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're so litigious.

109
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:12,037
Oh, I can be quite litigious.

110
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,435
Whoever heard of this anyway?

111
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:16,519
Suing a company
because their coffee is too hot?

112
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,919
- Coffee is supposed to be hot.
- But Jackie says the top was faulty.

113
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,965
Jackie says the top was faulty.

114
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,240
- Hey, Maestro.
- Kramer.

115
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,045
- I'm in here. How's it going?
- Fine.

116
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:31,925
Hi, Bob.

117
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:36,079
I'm sorry. Maestro.

118
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:37,965
Oh, boy. This is a surprise.
Look at you.

119
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,836
I just wanted to drop off
this Chinese balm for your burns.

120
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,680
It's supposed to be great stuff.
It's all herbal.

121
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:48,760
Oh, Maestro, what are you doing?
You don't have to do this.

122
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,122
- Do you believe this Maestro?
- It's nothing.

123
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,243
You know, you haven't
been around for a while.

124
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,159
Oh, yeah. I've been
at my house in Tuscany.

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,160
Tuscany, huh? You hear that, Jerry?
That's in Italy. Yeah.

126
00:05:58,527 --> 00:05:59,755
I hear it's beautiful there.

127
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,999
Well, if you're thinking
of getting a place there, don't bother.

128
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,476
There's really nothing available.

129
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:09,077
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

130
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:12,284
- And who might you be?
- I might be Elaine.

131
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,483
- This is Bob Cobb.
- Maestro.

132
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:19,323
- Maestro?
- It is my very great pleasure.

133
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:24,879
- I have to get going.
- I have to be going.

134
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:27,083
Jinx. Buy me a Coke.

135
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:30,478
- I love it when that happens.
- I know, I know. That is so...

136
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,478
- Coincidental.
- Yeah.

137
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,399
- Okay, bye, you guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,285
- Ciao.
- Yeah, see you. Oh, hey.

139
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:39,723
Thanks for the balm. Yeah.

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,317
You know
you hurt the Maestro's feelings.

141
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:50,081
- Because I didn't call him Maestro?
- That's right.

142
00:06:50,247 --> 00:06:52,522
I feel a little funny
calling somebody Maestro.

143
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:55,076
- Why?
- It's a stupid thing to be called.

144
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:57,238
- Jerry, he's a conductor.
- Oh, conductor?

145
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:01,082
He conducts the Policemen's
Benevolent Association Orchestra.

146
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:02,999
Well, he's still a conductor.

147
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,998
He sure worked
pretty fast with Elaine.

148
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,476
You should see him do
"Flight of the Bumblebee."

149
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,478
He just...

150
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,806
New shirt?

151
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:15,601
- Yeah, you like it?
- No. Not particularly.

152
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,246
- Why? The colour?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,875
- Too flashy?
- Yeah, it's burning my retina.

154
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,525
Susan picked that out
for you, right?

155
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:26,120
No.

156
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,276
All right, what's it gonna be here?

157
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:31,880
Let me ask you something.

158
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,958
When you're in a store,
does it bother you...

159
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,721
...that they make the security guard
stand there all day?

160
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,159
No.

161
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,444
See, it didn't bother Susan either.

162
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,006
That's why I'm different.

163
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,045
I can sense
the slightest human suffering.

164
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,242
Are you sensing anything
right now?

165
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:54,396
Let me just say this.

166
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,797
It's inhumane to make a man stand
on his feet...

167
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,878
...in one spot for eight hours a day.

168
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,924
Why shouldn't he have a chair?

169
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,886
What about criminal activity?
He's gotta be alert.

170
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,481
He can't jump out of the chair?
How long does that take?

171
00:08:06,647 --> 00:08:09,480
Look at this. Here, watch.
Criminals. Boom, I'm up.

172
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,956
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

173
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,236
Maybe they offered him a chair
and he turned it down.

174
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,841
Would you get out of here.
Who's gonna turn down a chair?

175
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:20,726
I'd be very interested to know
how he felt about all this.

176
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,162
- Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
- I know you will.

177
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,238
Hey, hey. Listen to this.

178
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:27,079
- Jackie just called.
- Who?

179
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:28,965
- His lawyer.
- Java World wants to settle.

180
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,685
- What?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.

181
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:34,200
- Why are they settling?
- They're afraid of bad publicity.

182
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,403
All this because
you spilled coffee on yourself?

183
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,558
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:43,236
I'm gonna need a coffee here!
Very hot! Boiling!

185
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:46,561
And then, about four years ago...

186
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:51,801
...I was on holiday in Tuscany,
and I fell in love with this house.

187
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,719
Are you ready to order?

188
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,960
Gosh, what are you getting, Bob?

189
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,120
Good question.
We'll need a few minutes.

190
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:04,084
Thanks.

191
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:08,241
You know, I'm sorry, but...

192
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:13,841
I didn't mention it earlier, but,
actually, I prefer to be called Maestro.

193
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:19,001
- Excuse me?
- Well, you know, I am a conductor.

194
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:20,840
Yeah. So?

195
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,522
I suppose it's okay for Leonard
Bernstein to be called Maestro...

196
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:26,962
...because he conducted
the New York Philharmonic.

197
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,561
So he gets to be called Maestro
and I don't.

198
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,644
Well, don't you think
that he was probably called Maestro...

199
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,526
...while he was conducting.
Not in social situations.

200
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,837
I mean, his friends
probably just called him Lenny.

201
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:45,523
I happen to know for a fact that he was
called Maestro in social situations.

202
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,643
I once saw him in a bar,
and somebody said:

203
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:51,561
"Hello, Maestro, how about a beer?"
Okay? So that's a fact.

204
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,917
Maestro, huh?

205
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,565
Okay.

206
00:09:57,927 --> 00:09:59,440
Maestro.

207
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,922
Jerry! Jerry!

208
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,445
Jerry, my burn, it's gone, look.

209
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:19,243
- What do you mean?
- I put that Chinese balm on it.

210
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,398
- Look, it healed it.
- So?

211
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,035
So my lawsuit. I'm finished.

212
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,279
- I thought they wanted to settle.
- What happens if they wanna see it?

213
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,277
- Then you're in a lot of trouble.
- Yeah!

214
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:52,085
- Tired?
- No.

215
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:55,443
How come no chair?

216
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,880
What?

217
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:01,005
I couldn't help but notice
that you don't have a chair.

218
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,635
- I don't need a chair.
- I didn't mean to imply you did.

219
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,685
You're obviously
a very well-proportioned individual.

220
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:10,396
What I was just wondering is...

221
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,918
...have they ever
offered you a chair?

222
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,801
- No.
- Would you like a chair?

223
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,003
I suppose if they gave me one
I'd sit down.

224
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,121
You would, wouldn't you?

225
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,847
Obviously I'd rather sit,
if that's what you're asking.

226
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,043
- That's exactly my point.
- Who wouldn't?

227
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,279
Because, I tell you, frankly...

228
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:31,042
...l'd like to walk in here one day
and find you sitting down.

229
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:34,085
That would give me
a lot of pleasure.

230
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,761
Call me crazy.

231
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,277
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?

232
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:42,677
I didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?

233
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:44,405
You haven't even been
to the doctor.

234
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,478
Let a doctor put a balm on.

235
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,324
- I guess I screwed up, huh, Jackie?
- You're damn right, you screwed up.

236
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,125
Where'd you get
that damn balm anyway?

237
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,039
- The Maestro.
- The who?

238
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,675
- What you talking about, Maestro?
- My friend's a conductor.

239
00:11:57,287 --> 00:11:59,881
So a maestro tells you
to put a balm on, and you do it?

240
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,719
Well, my stomach was burning.

241
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,196
I'll tell you what this is.
It's a public humiliation.

242
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:07,643
- I didn't know the balm would work.
- Do you know what a balm is?

243
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,526
You ever seen a balm?
Didn't you read the instructions?

244
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:14,157
No one can tell what a balm's
gonna do. They're unpredictable.

245
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,441
All right, I'm sorry, Jackie.

246
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:21,082
- Pull over here, driver. This is it.
- Yeah, get over.

247
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,522
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, he's very interesting.

248
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:27,281
Did you know that Mozart died
while writing the "Requiem"?

249
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,245
Yeah. Everyone knows that.
It was in Amadeus.

250
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:31,806
Really?

251
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,316
What about the name?
Did he make you call him Maestro?

252
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,557
- Yeah, I called him Maestro.
- You didn't mind?

253
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:40,362
Well, I did at first,
but, actually, I kind of got used to it.

254
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,995
Okay, from now on, I want you
to call me Jerry the Great.

255
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,079
- I'm not calling you Jerry the Great.
- Why not? You call him Maestro.

256
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:48,124
- He is a maestro.
- Well, I'm great.

257
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,403
So you say.

258
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,077
What about his house in Tuscany?
He mention that?

259
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,317
Yeah. I'm invited.

260
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:59,002
When I told him it was beautiful there,
out of the clear blue sky, he says:

261
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:02,364
"There's nothing to rent," as if
he doesn't want anyone else there.

262
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:03,721
Why?

263
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:05,605
Maybe he's embarrassed
by Americans.

264
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:07,883
Well, maybe there aren't
any houses to rent there.

265
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:10,515
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.

266
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,804
I say we offer him $50,000, that's it.
Take it or leave it.

267
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,162
How do we know
how severe the burns are?

268
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:19,919
Let's have him
examined by a doctor.

269
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,396
Listen, the faster
we dispose of this, the better.

270
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,603
This thing gets into the paper,
it'll kill us.

271
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:27,918
All right, we'll start with 50,000
and free coffee at all of our stores.

272
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:33,355
- Yes?
- Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.

273
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:35,085
Send them in.

274
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,600
Gentlemen.

275
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:43,479
Gentlemen, come in.

276
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,916
Now, we don't want to take up
much of your time.

277
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,759
Let's make this short and sweet.

278
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:55,517
We're prepared to offer you
all the free coffee you want...

279
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,759
...at any of our stores throughout
North America and Europe, plus...

280
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:00,758
I'll take it!

281
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,923
"I'll take it"? "I'll take it"?
Who told you to take it?

282
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:13,520
- Did I tell you to take it?
- No.

283
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,757
The Maestro didn't tell you to.
He wasn't there.

284
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,361
- We were lucky to get anything.
- Free coffee?

285
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,279
- Yeah.
- I don't want free coffee.

286
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:22,483
It's not hard to get coffee.
I can get it myself.

287
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,444
I wanna know
what came after that "plus."

288
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,677
I didn't hear any "plus."

289
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,361
Twenty years, I've never experienced
anything like this.

290
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,836
Look, Java World.
Hey, listen, I'm getting out here.

291
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:34,805
I'm gonna get myself
a free café latte.

292
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:45,319
Hey.

293
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:47,159
Hi, Maestro.

294
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:57,278
- "Beethoven's 7th."
- Yeah.

295
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:59,278
- We were just talking about you.
- Oh, yeah?

296
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:02,439
The other day, you mentioned
there were no houses in Tuscany.

297
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:04,120
You didn't find one, did you?

298
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:08,041
- No. Not really looking.
- Nor should you.

299
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,916
But are you telling me there's not
one house to rent in all of Tuscany?

300
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:14,840
The houses are passed down
from generation to generation.

301
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:16,725
It's very hard.

302
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:20,766
I can't get a sublet,
a guest room, a cot, nothing?

303
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:24,806
- It's booked solid.
- It's booked, Jerry.

304
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,764
- How'd you get yours?
- Got lucky.

305
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,920
Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride.
I was about to pop in some Verdi.

306
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:41,397
Maybe I'll check out France.

307
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,079
Hey, George.
Hey, you believe this guy?

308
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,999
- Who?
- Bob Cobb.

309
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,796
- Bob Cobb?
- You know, the Maestro.

310
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:51,956
I missed the Maestro?

311
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:55,802
Get this, he tells me there are no
houses anywhere in Tuscany to rent.

312
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,400
- You renting a house in Tuscany?
- No.

313
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,041
So, what do you care?

314
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:10,679
I wish I could figure out if this guy's
trying to keep me out of Tuscany.

315
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:14,078
Of course he is. There's got
to be houses for rent in Tuscany.

316
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,602
- Do you know how big Tuscany is?
- I have no idea.

317
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,281
It's huge.
It's probably like North Dakota.

318
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,484
- Oh, no way it's that big.
- It's a big region.

319
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,603
You know how big
North Dakota is, stupid?

320
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,200
- Why do I bother talking to you?
- There's no gun to your head.

321
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,800
All right.

322
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,476
- So I spoke to the security guard.
- Yeah? And?

323
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,126
It was tough to get a good read...

324
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,484
...but I think if I brought him
a chair, he'd sit.

325
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:43,964
- So you're gonna get him a chair?
- Yeah. It's a question of what kind.

326
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,561
- Thinking about a barstool.
- That'd give him some height.

327
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,241
Be able to check things out.
With a back or without?

328
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,635
I think I'd go for the back.

329
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:52,877
- Swivel?
- I suppose he could swivel.

330
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,199
- Maybe one of those director's chairs.
- That's kind of a pompous look.

331
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,400
My parents had a kitchen chair
that would've been perfect.

332
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:04,920
- One of those vinyl things?
- Yes.

333
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,078
Vinyl, yeah. Maybe.

334
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:11,924
How can I figure out if there's
any places to rent in Tuscany?

335
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:14,926
Wait a minute.
Poppie's from Tuscany.

336
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,397
- I'm gonna go call him.
- Yeah, good luck.

337
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,278
Hey, I'll meet you outside.

338
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:34,843
Poppie told me to talk to his cousin.
He lives down in Little Italy.

339
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:36,884
What do you think
about a rocking chair?

340
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,356
You can't limit my café lattes.
It says so right here.

341
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:42,724
And no dirty looks. If I want
a café latte, you give me a café latte.

342
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:45,117
If I have any problems,
I'll get my lawyer down here.

343
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,606
You'll be in big trouble.

344
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,841
Hey, hey, slow down, Eddie.
What's the matter?

345
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,316
They're making faces
because I've had some café lattes.

346
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,559
But I can have as many café lattes
as I want. That was the settlement.

347
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,002
- That's it?
- That's it. You want one, George?

348
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,681
Jerry, you want one?
They're delicious. My pleasure.

349
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:04,078
You've got to stop it.
You're all hopped up on the caffeine.

350
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:07,159
- I feel like I'm talking a little faster.
- You're racing.

351
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,238
Well, I got things to do.
See you later. Bye.

352
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,280
Oh, Bob.

353
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:22,926
Bob.

354
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:25,757
Maestro.

355
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:27,759
Maestro.

356
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,680
Excuse me. Can I help you?

357
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,486
No. Just giving a chair
to the security guard.

358
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,478
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?

359
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,601
- What's your name?
- Evan Fane.

360
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,803
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece.

361
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,958
I'll be taking over this whole
place someday...

362
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:55,163
...so if I were you,
I'd stay on my good side.

363
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:57,245
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know.

364
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,204
Innocent mistake.

365
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,325
Well, here you go.
What do you think?

366
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:07,086
Mr. Ross said this was okay?

367
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,363
I'm his nephew, all right?
Don't worry about it.

368
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,438
Go ahead. Check it out.

369
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,281
Well...

370
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,759
Not bad.

371
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,238
Not bad at all.

372
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:34,526
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a Mr. Ciccio.

373
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:36,875
I'm Ciccio.

374
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:39,164
Poppie sent me
to see you, Mr. Ciccio.

375
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:40,726
Sì, sì, Poppie.

376
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,486
Did he mention to you why I called?

377
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,567
- The house in Toscana.
- Yeah, right, right.

378
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,399
So is there anything there to rent?

379
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,722
Two million lire.
You give me the check.

380
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:57,039
- No, I didn't actually want to rent it.
- The keys. Here are the keys.

381
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,119
You give me the check.
Two million lire.

382
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:03,719
Seventeen-hundred American.

383
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:15,845
No, see...

384
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,847
...I didn't say that I wanted to rent it.

385
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,682
I was just wondering
if there were houses there to rent.

386
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:26,805
This one.

387
00:20:56,887 --> 00:21:00,118
It's been a rough couple of weeks.
I really needed to get away.

388
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,879
I told you.

389
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:03,765
It's paradise.

390
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:06,441
You were right, Maestro.

391
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,119
Come on, Jerry, this guy's crazy.
Get out.

392
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,960
I'm getting out.
You didn't have to push me.

393
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,320
- How much did you pay that guy?
- Seventy-five thousand lire.

394
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,955
Seventy-five thousand lire?
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,163
Kramer, you don't understand
the conversion rate.

396
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:33,476
The conversion rates.

397
00:21:33,647 --> 00:21:36,605
- I don't even know why I brought you.
- Nobody put a gun to your head.

398
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:42,121
- Not bad.
- Yeah.
