1
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,917
I can't believe
I'm going out with this guy.

2
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:16,085
He's so cool.

3
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:19,724
Maybe he'll write a song about me.
That would be amazing.

4
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,845
"Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful.

5
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,282
So, so beautiful.

6
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:29,235
Not to mention your personality,
which is so, so interesting.

7
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:33,320
If you want, you can quit your job
and never work again."

8
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,279
Jerry, you have got to come see him.
He is so terrific.

9
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:51,519
- Maybe he'll write a song about you.
- Yeah, right.

10
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,644
Like that really matters.

11
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:55,559
So I take it he's sponge-worthy.

12
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:59,324
Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:02,243
He's a musician.
They're supposed to be very...

14
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:05,080
...you know, uninhibited and free.

15
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:08,524
Well, actually, he's not that way at all.

16
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:11,440
- Oh, no?
- Yeah, in fact...

17
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,765
Come on.

18
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,077
- Come on.
- I don't wanna.

19
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:20,364
Elaine, you're among friends.

20
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:27,884
Well, actually,
he doesn't really like to do...

21
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,519
...everything.

22
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,764
Yeah.

23
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:41,320
- It's surprising.
- Yes, it is. It is surprising.

24
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,797
- Does that bother you?
- No. No, it doesn't bother me.

25
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,798
I mean, it would be nice.

26
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it wouldn't be nice.

27
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:55,326
- Sure. Why not? You're there.
- Exactly.

28
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,717
You said he was coming out
of a serious relationship.

29
00:01:57,887 --> 00:02:01,004
Maybe he's, you know,
still kind of... He's...

30
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,397
It's not gonna happen.

31
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:07,483
Hey, Jerry. Listen, I need you
to help me get my stuff out of the car.

32
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,962
- What stuff?
- I just came from the Price Club.

33
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,324
- I'm loaded up, baby.
- All right.

34
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:18,965
What, are you out of your mind?

35
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:20,879
Look at this.
What did you buy here?

36
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,207
You will never be able
to finish all this stuff.

37
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:26,198
Of course I will.
These are all staples.

38
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,400
A 4-pound can of black olives,
that's a staple?

39
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,920
Lindsay olives, Jerry.

40
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:36,004
A 48-pack of Eggo waffles.
A gallon of barbecue sauce.

41
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,876
- Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs.
- $17.50. You can't beat that.

42
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,078
- Look at this can of tuna.
- Yeah, StarKist, Jerry.

43
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,681
- Most tuna don't make their cut.
- This isn't for a person.

44
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,121
It's for Biosphere 3.

45
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:50,444
- Hey, Clyde.
- Hey, Kramer.

46
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:53,804
- What's happening, dude?
- Yeah. Hey, this is Jerry.

47
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,446
- How you doing?
- Hi.

48
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,086
He plays backup
with John Germaine.

49
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,521
John Germaine?

50
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:01,076
That's amazing. I was just
talking about him with Elaine.

51
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,441
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,245
My friend Elaine and him
are going out.

53
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,160
- They're pretty hot-and-heavy.
- Is that right?

54
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,841
How about giving me a hand,
bring some of this stuff up?

55
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,716
Sorry, Kramer.
I got to watch the hands.

56
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:15,276
My hands are my life.

57
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:20,836
Georgie, can you zip me up?

58
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,406
Yeah.

59
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,125
- Yeah, one second.
- Well, come on.

60
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,801
All right. All right.
Let's not get into panic mode!

61
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,925
Let's not make a big deal out of this,
or we'll never get through it.

62
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:34,284
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws.
I think I should look nice.

63
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,359
- My in-laws. Oh, my God.
- So, what do you think?

64
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,643
Your old man can look good
when he wants to, huh?

65
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:42,037
- I don't like that tie.
- What's wrong with this tie?

66
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,437
- I've hardly worn it.
- It's too thin.

67
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,199
They're wearing wide now.

68
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,404
How do you know
what kind of ties they wear?

69
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:51,719
Go to any office building
on Seventh Avenue...

70
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:56,005
...and tell me if there's anyone there
wearing a thin tie like that.

71
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,397
- Go ahead.
- Oh, get the hell out of here.

72
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,046
Seventh Avenue?

73
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,437
George, do you think
he should wear a tie like that?

74
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:05,881
I think he should wear
whatever tie he wants.

75
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,880
We gotta stop off and pick up
a marble rye from Schnitzer's.

76
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,605
It's out of our way.

77
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,565
Why can't we pick up something
at Lords? It's right over here.

78
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,160
No, we have to go to Schnitzer's.

79
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:17,716
I'll show these people
something about taste.

80
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,077
This is gonna be fun.

81
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,520
Hey, you'll never guess who
I bumped into. This guy Clyde...

82
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:27,882
...he's in your friend
John Germaine's band there.

83
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:30,040
- What did he have to say?
- Nothing.

84
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,675
I told him you two
were pretty hot-and-heavy.

85
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,725
"Hot-and-heavy"?

86
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:39,118
- You said "hot-and-heavy"?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,518
What did you do that for?

88
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,123
- What?
- What if he tells John?

89
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:47,439
Then John's gonna think that
I think that we're hot-and-heavy.

90
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:50,838
I don't want John thinking I'm
hot-and-heavy if he's not.

91
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,682
I'm trying to get a little squirrel
to come over to me here.

92
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:59,315
I don't wanna make any
big, sudden movements.

93
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:03,002
- I'll frighten him away.
- Well, Clyde might not tell him.

94
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,558
How do you know that?

95
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,643
I should have helped Kramer
with those packages.

96
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,599
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,235
Hey, Kramer, I wonder,
could you do me a favour?

98
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:24,046
I'm taking the family
to Disney World next week.

99
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:27,677
- I wonder, can you pick up my mail?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

100
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:31,317
In fact, you know what, how'd you
like my hansom-cab for the week?

101
00:05:31,687 --> 00:05:34,485
- Drive the horse?
- It'll just be sitting there.

102
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:36,956
You can really clean up.
Five hundred bucks a day.

103
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,799
I'll split it with you.

104
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,764
Giddyup.

105
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,557
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.

106
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:52,400
Why are you complimenting her?
She didn't make it. Rowena did.

107
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:59,240
- What is this thing anyway?
- It's Cornish game hen.

108
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:03,805
- What is that, like a little chicken?
- No, it's not a little chicken.

109
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:08,086
- "Little chicken." No, it's a game bird.
- Game bird?

110
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:11,284
- What do you mean, like, you hunt it?
- Yes.

111
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,485
How hard can it be to kill this thing?

112
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:19,280
I couldn't help but notice,
but you have quite a library in there.

113
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:24,997
If I had a dime for every book
he's actually read...

114
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,998
...l'd be broke.

115
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,646
- More wine, anyone?
- Yeah, I'll take more. Thank you.

116
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,367
- How do you like the merlot?
- Merlot? I never heard of it.

117
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,166
- Did they just invent it?
- Oh, brother.

118
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:40,604
She's heard of the merlot.

119
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,804
Let me understand.

120
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:45,880
You got the hen, the chicken
and the rooster.

121
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,277
The rooster goes with the chicken.

122
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,324
So who's having sex with the hen?

123
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,840
- We'll talk about it another time.
- But you see my point here?

124
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:57,317
You only hear of a hen,
a rooster and a chicken.

125
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:00,605
- Something's missing!
- Something's missing, all right.

126
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,282
They're all chickens.

127
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,403
The rooster has sex with all of them.

128
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,556
- That's perverse.
- So has anybody seen Firestorm?

129
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,558
Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.

130
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:14,366
Remember when they had
the helicopter land on top of that car?

131
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:15,801
Hey! I haven't seen it yet.

132
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,959
- It has nothing to do with the plot!
- Still, I like to go in fresh!

133
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:21,523
Oh, Mother of God.

134
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,564
And of course, this is Central Park.

135
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:34,036
This was designed in 1850
by Joe Pepitone...

136
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:37,320
...built during the Civil War
so the Northern armies...

137
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,843
...could practice fighting on grass.

138
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,479
Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,159
On, Rusty.

140
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,399
Thank you. Now I'd like to play
something that...

141
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,445
Well, actually, it's my latest,
so it's nice and fresh...

142
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,523
...called "Hot-and-Heavy."

143
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,200
Thank God that's over.

144
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:10,845
The mother seems to hit the sauce
pretty hard. I didn't like that.

145
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,521
And who doesn't serve cake
after a meal?

146
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,643
What kind of people?

147
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:18,480
Would it kill them to put out
a pound cake? Something.

148
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:20,763
So they didn't give you
a piece of cake. Big deal.

149
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:24,317
It is a big deal. You're supposed
to serve cake after a meal.

150
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,443
I'm sorry, it's impolite.

151
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,440
It's not impolite. It's stupid,
that's what it is.

152
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:33,282
- You gotta be stupid to do that.
- Your father is absolutely right.

153
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,642
We're sitting there like idiots...

154
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,367
...drinking coffee
without a piece of cake.

155
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,839
What is this?

156
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,837
The marble rye?

157
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:49,239
Oh, dear, I forgot to put out
that bread they brought.

158
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,399
- We forgot to bring it in.
- No, I brought it in.

159
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:53,795
They never put it out.

160
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,197
- Where is it?
- I don't know. Where'd you put it?

161
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,961
- Right over there.
- Well, it's gone.

162
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,276
You stole the bread?

163
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,677
What do you mean?
It's my bread. They didn't eat it.

164
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,964
- Why should I leave it there?
- Because we brought it for them.

165
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:08,846
Apparently it wasn't good enough
for them to serve.

166
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,838
Is it possible they took it back?

167
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,077
Who would bring a bread
and take it back?

168
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,761
Those people, that's who.
I think they're sick.

169
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:19,363
- People take buses to get that rye.
- Maybe they forgot to put it out.

170
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,121
No, they didn't forget to put it out.
It's deliberate.

171
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,642
Deliberate, I tell you!

172
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,805
- He stole back the rye?
- Yeah.

173
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:35,481
- Why?
- Why? Why?

174
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:38,207
Because he's off his rocker,
that's why.

175
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,723
- So do the Rosses know?
- They're all very suspicious.

176
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,242
Why wouldn't they be?
Rye bread doesn't just disappear.

177
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:49,242
Now because of that rye, I gotta keep
them separated for the rest of my life.

178
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:52,277
Bad situation.

179
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,485
I tell you what I'd like to do.
I'd like to replace that rye.

180
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:58,480
- What do you mean, replace it?
- You know, go out, get another rye.

181
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:01,286
Of course, it would have to be
the same one from Schnitzer's.

182
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:04,598
You put it in the kitchen somewhere
and say, "Oh, there it is."

183
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:07,122
Well, there you go.
What's so hard about that?

184
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,165
What's so hard about that?
I can't just walk in with it.

185
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:13,763
- I have to get the Rosses out of there.
- All right. Don't panic.

186
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,997
Let's just think about it.

187
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:18,847
The Rosses out of the apartment.
Can't be so hard.

188
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,601
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
Wait a second.

189
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,803
You know, Kramer's
been driving that hansom-cab.

190
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:26,847
- So?
- He'll take them around for a while.

191
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,682
And it's their anniversary
Friday night.

192
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,519
I can send them
for a hansom-cab ride.

193
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,598
- You think they'd like that?
- People love it.

194
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,327
There's something about
the clip-clop. They're nuts for it.

195
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,717
So they go. When they
come back, the bread is there.

196
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,525
- What about Susan?
- She's working late.

197
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,997
We're suppose to have dinner at 8:00,
so I'll set up the rye for 7:00.

198
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,886
- Beautiful.
- You think Kramer will do it?

199
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,163
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to.

200
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,397
- So I gotta be there at 7?
- Just take them out...

201
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,797
...and ride around for half an hour.
- Sounds easy.

202
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:00,400
- What the hell are you doing there?
- That's Beef-a-Reeno.

203
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,046
And I got 50 cans.

204
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:05,085
- Well, do you want some?
- No. No, thanks.

205
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,557
Jerry, I think I bought too much
at that Price Club.

206
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,683
I don't have any room for it all.

207
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,121
Hold on. Wait a minute.

208
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,482
How am I gonna get the rye bread
into the apartment?

209
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,115
- Put it under your shirt.
- Have you seen a Schnitzer's rye?

210
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:19,881
- It's huge.
- I tell you what, I'll bring it over.

211
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:23,642
I'll stop by Schnitzer's,
I'll come by right after they leave.

212
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:28,122
Oh, well, this is all locking in now.
It is all locking in.

213
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:31,281
- Hey. Is that your horse outside?
- That's Rusty.

214
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,041
Why, he's outside?
Come on, I wanna see him.

215
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,358
- Let's go. I'll show you the horsie.
- Laney, wanna see the horsie?

216
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,961
You really did me in this time,
didn't you?

217
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:47,803
First guy I like in a really long time.
I mean, we're getting along...

218
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,083
...everything is just...

219
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:55,321
- great. I mean, all right,
so he doesn't do everything...

220
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:59,800
...and then you have to come along
with your "hot" and your "heavy."

221
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:03,164
- So you think Clyde told him?
- He wrote a song about it.

222
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:05,887
- Well, maybe it's a good thing.
- No, it's not a good thing.

223
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:07,321
It's a bad thing.

224
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:11,765
Do you know what this is like, to have
no control over a relationship?

225
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:15,078
And you feel sick to your stomach
all the time?

226
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:18,398
- Do you know what that's like?
- No, no.

227
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:22,276
But I've read articles, and I must say,
it doesn't sound very pleasant.

228
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,039
You know, one of these days...

229
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:28,120
...something terrible
is gonna happen to you.

230
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,599
- It has to.
- No, I'm gonna be just fine.

231
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,201
But as far as your situation,
you're seeing him tonight...

232
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,927
...so talk to him about it.
- I can't.

233
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:40,762
He's got a big showcase for record
producers at his late show tonight.

234
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,125
I don't wanna upset him.
Oh, what the hell, I'll upset him.

235
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,401
George, I gotta tell you,
this is a very nice gesture.

236
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,445
- We really appreciate it.
- Well, it's your anniversary.

237
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,086
It's the least I can do.

238
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:57,398
I just want you guys to go out
and have a good time.

239
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,637
So you think we should
get downstairs?

240
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,479
We got about 20 minutes.

241
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:04,924
You seem a little nervous, George.
Anything wrong?

242
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:08,921
Oh, no. No, no, no. Nothing.
I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine.

243
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:11,681
Just get a little nervous
on the weekends, that's all.

244
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:15,164
- Could I get a glass of water?
- We've got water.

245
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:19,002
I don't think we have any bread,
but we've got water.

246
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,925
There you go, big fella.
That's Beef-a-Reeno.

247
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,999
I'm so k een-o
On Beef-a-Reeno

248
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,637
What a delicious cuisine-o
Fit for a king and queen-o

249
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:35,397
Yeah, eat up.
I got 34 more cans.

250
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,047
Nice night for a
hansom-cab ride, eh, George?

251
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:45,677
You know, George,
we haven't done anything...

252
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:50,477
...romantic like this in years.

253
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,643
Oh, my God. It's 7:01.

254
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,446
What have I done? My whole plan
is depending on Kramer?

255
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,359
Have I learned nothing?

256
00:13:58,527 --> 00:14:00,358
How could I have made
such a stupid mistak e?

257
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,518
He'll never show up.

258
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:11,083
There he is. Right on time,
as usual.

259
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,480
- Fifty-three.
- Fifty-three.

260
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,525
I'd like a marble rye.
No plastic. In a bag.

261
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:20,684
You're lucky, it's our last one.

262
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,244
Wait a second,
that's your last marble rye?

263
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:25,238
- That's right.
- There's none left?

264
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,637
That's what I said.

265
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:29,560
Number 54.

266
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,279
Excuse me.

267
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,245
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but I have to have that rye.

268
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:39,002
It's a long story, but a person's
whole future may depend on it.

269
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,556
Well, I'm sorry, but you should've
got here earlier.

270
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,877
Yes, well, be that as it may...

271
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,607
...if you could just find it
within yourself to give it up...

272
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,884
- You're not getting this rye.
- All right. All right.

273
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,400
I'll tell what I'm gonna do.

274
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,797
I will give you double
what you paid for it.

275
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,276
You're in my way.

276
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:02,047
Mr. Ross, Mrs. Ross,
my name is Cosmo...

277
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,959
...and I'll be your driver this evening.

278
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:06,846
We have blankets for your comfort.
I also have hot chocolate...

279
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,726
...if the mood should strike you.
- My favourite.

280
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:12,560
Well, if we're all set to go,
why don't you two hop aboard...

281
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:16,242
...and let me show you
a little taste of old New York...

282
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:17,840
...the way it once was.

283
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:20,240
Happy anniversary.

284
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,556
On, Rusty!

285
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,044
All right. Look, I'll tell
you what, I'll give you $50.

286
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:39,758
Now, be reasonable. You cannot
turn down $50 for a $6 rye.

287
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,878
No? Watch me.

288
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,125
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it.

289
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:47,006
- I want that rye, lady.
- Help! Someone help!

290
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:49,886
- Shut up, you old bag.
- Stop, thief!

291
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:53,244
Stop him! Stop him,
he's got my marble rye.

292
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,077
I'm sorry to just show up
unexpectedly like this.

293
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,636
I know you've got your big
showcase coming up later.

294
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,844
I know how important it is. I know
how hard you've worked for this...

295
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:07,319
...but I just had too tell you that
I never told Jerry "hot-and-heavy."

296
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:11,116
I didn't think we were hot-and-heavy.
I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?

297
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,005
Hold on, Elaine.

298
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:15,966
- I'm kind of disappointed.
- Disappointed?

299
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,045
Yeah, I mean...

300
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,283
...I was excited
when Clyde told me that.

301
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,443
- You were?
- Absolutely.

302
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,038
I am so relieved.

303
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:35,281
Listen, I've still got a couple of hours
to kill before the next show.

304
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,677
My place is only a few blocks
from here.

305
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,605
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:44,484
And you know what,
I've been thinking about what we do...

307
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:47,605
...and I'm thinking of...

308
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:52,285
...adding a new number to my,
you know, repertoire.

309
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,439
What is that?

310
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,759
I think it's the horse.

311
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:27,155
Oh, my God.

312
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,161
How's everything?
You need anything?

313
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:33,080
This is really intolerable.

314
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,807
Excuse me.
What do you feed this animal?

315
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,923
Oh, you know, oats and hay.

316
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,806
Yeah, they like that stuff.

317
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,081
I can't take this.

318
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,598
Get me out of this thing!

319
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:53,397
Turn this thing around. We've had it.
We can't breathe back here.

320
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:57,403
- And hurry it up.
- Rusty!

321
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,724
Rusty!

322
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,523
What happened?
What are you doing back so soon?

323
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,679
- Ask Rusty.
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross.

324
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,362
One never knows how the intestinal
workings of the equine will function.

325
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,486
Thanks for nothing. Come on,
George, let's go upstairs.

326
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,684
- What the hell happened?
- The horse is gassy.

327
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:41,124
- Must've been the Beef-a-Reeno.
- Beef-a-Reeno?

328
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,677
- You fed the horse Beef-a-Reeno?
- Well, I overbought.

329
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:46,360
George!

330
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,485
What's going on? Where is he?

331
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,683
- He'll be here soon.
- I'll give him 10 minutes.

332
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,803
I'm not gonna stay here all night.

333
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,717
- How much did you give him?
- Just a can.

334
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:14,165
- He really liked it, though.
- Jerry, up here.

335
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,283
Yeah, what do you
want me to do with this?

336
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,836
I can't come out. They're
right by the door. Throw it.

337
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,477
- Really?
- Yeah, it's the only way. Come on.

338
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:25,716
What, are you kidding me?!

339
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:28,555
Can you get this horse
out of here? He's killing me.

340
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:31,764
- I don't wanna go back on there.
- Come on.

341
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,842
Hey, hey. Wait a second.

342
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,759
I got an idea.

343
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:54,045
No, no. Don't be silly, John.
You were very good.

344
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,239
You just don't have to try so hard.

345
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,557
Good luck, honey.

346
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,200
- Come on. Come on.
- Would you just wait a second.

347
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:07,040
I never baited a hook
with a rye before.

348
00:20:07,527 --> 00:20:10,837
Your hook is too small.
This is for, like, a muffin.

349
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:13,166
All right, take it away.

350
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,281
Come on.

351
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:22,005
Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,605
Schnitzer's.

353
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,242
Ladies and gentlemen,
John Germaine.
