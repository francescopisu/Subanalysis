1
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:07,366
I love when the car place
puts that paper mat on the floor.

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:10,325
Like they're so obsessed
with cleanliness.

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:12,717
They don't even want their shoes
to touch the carpet.

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,242
The mechanic comes out,
he looks like Al Jolson.

5
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:19,082
He's covered in goo from head to toe.
You can't even see him.

6
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:22,564
I prefer that to when they have the
lab coat, the clipboard, the glasses.

7
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,683
Now you know
you're getting screwed.

8
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,236
"Can I see it?"

9
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:29,205
"You better not.
It's idling quietly right now.

10
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,800
I think it should stay overnight.

11
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:34,039
We want to keep an eye on it,
and want to keep the bill running up."

12
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,317
Tell the players that
I reimbursed the trainer...

13
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:43,966
...for the cigarettes and shakes.

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,277
- The players will be reimbursed?
- The trainer.

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,244
Tell the players
I reimbursed the trainer.

16
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,717
This is the third time
I've had to repeat myself.

17
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,639
- Sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

18
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,399
We're running
a ball club here, George.

19
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,444
You've got to pay attention.

20
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,881
I know. It won't happen again.

21
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:00,766
Let me see.
I had an assignment for you.

22
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:04,280
Let me... Let me think here.

23
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,361
Elaine.

24
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:14,801
Hi, Mr. Peterman.

25
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,403
You know what a huge fan
I am of John F. Kennedy.

26
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,080
I do.

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,602
The Peace Corps gave me
my start in this business.

28
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,998
Clothing the naked natives
of Bangtubesh.

29
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,646
The Pygmy pullover.

30
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,521
Sotheby's is having an auction
of JFK's memorabilia.

31
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,645
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

32
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,286
The presidential golf clubs.

33
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,999
To me, they capture that indefinable
romance that was Camelot.

34
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,156
Whatever.

35
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,522
Unfortunately, I will be
out of town with my lady...

36
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:47,598
...and therefore unable
to bid on the lot.

37
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,564
I was hoping you would go
in my stead.

38
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,480
Oh, yeah. I'd be happy to.

39
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:56,959
How much do you want this thing?
How high are you willing to go?

40
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:01,518
I would see no trouble in spending
up to, say, $10,000.

41
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,285
Have my secretary give you a check.

42
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,636
- When you're done, George,
and bring it directly to me.

43
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,640
Mr. Steinbrenner is
very interested in this.

44
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,718
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, George.

45
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:21,003
I want you to make this project
a top priority.

46
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,805
I will, sir. Top priority.

47
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,527
- Top priority, George.
- Top priority.

48
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:33,366
So he walks out of the stall.
He's been talking the whole time.

49
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,643
- He pulled an LBJ on you.
- LBJ?

50
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,162
Lyndon Johnson used to do that
to his staffers.

51
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,316
- No kidding?
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,398
He'd hold national security
meetings in there.

53
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,957
He planned the Hanoi bombing
after a bad Thai meal.

54
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:47,205
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,119
I don't even know
what my assignment is.

56
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,357
Ask him to repeat it.
Tell him there was an echo.

57
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,836
I can't. He's been on me
about not paying attention.

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,077
It's too late.
I already told him I heard him.

59
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,076
You know what you do?
Ask him a follow-up question.

60
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:02,319
Tell him you're having trouble getting
started, and you want his advice.

61
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:06,166
Yeah, follow-up question.
That'll work.

62
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:07,602
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

63
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:08,916
- Can I have my keys...
- Yeah.

64
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,156
- Back please.

65
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,602
- You should have come, Jerry.
- We made quite a haul.

66
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,723
- Where did you go?
- Price Club.

67
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:17,606
- Why didn't you take your car?
- Oh, the steering wheel fell off.

68
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,962
I don't know where it is.

69
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,879
What are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

70
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,959
Well, I'm not paying the 5 cents
for that stupid recycling thing.

71
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,482
You don't pay 5 cents.
You get 5 cents back.

72
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:28,636
Read the label.

73
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,877
"Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York.

74
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,480
Refund, 5 cents."

75
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,841
- Refund?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,316
Well, what do you think
the hobos are doing?

77
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,160
I don't know. They're deranged.

78
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,282
Listen. Can you give me
a lift back to my place?

79
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,917
No, I can't. I've gotta pick up Elaine.
I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.

80
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,282
- All right. I'll see you later.
- All right.

81
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:51,678
- What is this "MI, 10 cents"?
- That's Michigan.

82
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,360
In Michigan you get 10 cents.

83
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:54,721
- Ten cents?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,606
Wait a minute, you mean you get
5 cents here and 10 cents there?

85
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,997
You could round up bottles
and run them to Michigan.

86
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,839
- No, it doesn't work.
- What do you mean?

87
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,042
You get enough bottles...

88
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:06,199
You overload your inventory, and you
blow your margins on gasoline.

89
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,516
Trust me. It doesn't work.

90
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:10,247
You're not talking that Michigan
deposit-bottle scam?

91
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,398
- No, I'm off that.
- You tried it?

92
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,956
Oh, yeah. Every which way.
Couldn't crunch the numbers.

93
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,799
It drove me crazy.

94
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,400
You keep an eye on each other?

95
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,920
- No problem.
- You bet.

96
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,320
Are you sure you didn't hear
my car making a funny noise?

97
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,364
I know those two idiots did
something to it.

98
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,961
No, I didn't hear anything.

99
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:40,326
Oh, my God. Look who's here.

100
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:46,005
Sue Ellen Mischke, the braless,
Oh Henry! Candy bar heiress.

101
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:51,161
Well, hello, Elaine, Jerry.

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,079
- Hi, Sue Ellen.
- Hi, Sue Ellen.

103
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm surprised to see you here.

104
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,918
Come to catch a glimpse
of high society?

105
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,723
No, no, I'm actually here to bid,
Sue Ellen.

106
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,718
I mean,
that is if anything's to my liking.

107
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:10,035
I'm here to catch
a glimpse of high society.

108
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,801
Well, I hope you find something
that fits your budget.

109
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,879
I hate that woman.

110
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,316
I don't understand.

111
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,555
You fill an 18-wheeler.

112
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,366
No, an 18-wheeler's no good.
Too much overhead.

113
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,757
You got permits,
weigh stations, tolls.

114
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,758
Look, you're way out of your league.

115
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,885
I wanna learn.

116
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,515
I want to know why.

117
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,286
Oh, those are handsome.

118
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,880
Look at that set.

119
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,720
Yeah, think I might bid on those.

120
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,478
Lot number 745.

121
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,478
We have a full set of golf clubs...

122
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,115
...that were owned
by President John F. Kennedy...

123
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:01,121
...as seen in the famous photo of the
president chipping at Burning Tree...

124
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,198
...on the morning
of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

125
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:08,964
The set is in perfect condition,
and we will start the biding at $4000.

126
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,721
Four thousand dollars?
Do I have $4000? I have $4000.

127
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:15,038
Do I have 5? Five thousand dollars?
I have $5000. Do I have 6?

128
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,721
Six thousand dollars
for this set of beautiful clubs.

129
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:21,402
Six? I have $6000.
Can I have 6500?

130
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,521
Sixty-five hundred
to the dark-haired person on the right.

131
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:29,363
We are at 6500.
Do I hear 6600?

132
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,597
The president's own golf clubs.

133
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,519
Leisure life at Camelot.

134
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,359
Sixty-five hundred going once.

135
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,836
Eight thousand.

136
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:41,683
Eight thousand. We have 8000.
The bid is now $8000.

137
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,360
What is she doing?

138
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,166
She's starting in on the biding now?

139
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,680
Eighty-five hundred.

140
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:50,407
- We have 85.
- Nine thousand.

141
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,239
Nine thousand dollars.

142
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:53,601
I think she wants those clubs.

143
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:56,122
Do I hear 95?
Ninety-five hundred.

144
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,517
- Ninety-five hundred.
- Ten thousand.

145
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:02,324
Ten thousand
to the shapely woman on the left.

146
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,045
Ten thousand going once.

147
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,721
- That's you're ceiling.
- Ten thousand going twice.

148
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,117
- Eleven thousand.
- Twelve thousand.

149
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,916
- Thirteen thousand.
- Fourteen thousand.

150
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:16,562
Fifteen thousand.

151
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,799
Peterman is gonna kill me.

152
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,878
I really thought
you had her there at 17,000.

153
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,765
Why didn't you stop me?

154
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,121
Do you hear this clunking?

155
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:30,321
A little.

156
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,279
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna grab these from you later.

157
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,915
You'll take care of them.
Okay? Okay.

158
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,440
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

159
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:46,167
- Alrighty. Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,397
What is going on here?

161
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:53,841
Oh, my God.

162
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:03,637
Oh, you idiots!

163
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:07,198
So we could put the bottles
in a U-Haul.

164
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,756
- Go lean and mean.
- Newman, it's a dead end. Come on.

165
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,481
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

166
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,877
You put your groceries under
the hood of my car?

167
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,959
Oh, that's right.
We forgot about those.

168
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,719
That's where my missing soda is.

169
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,037
And your crab legs?
And a thing of cheese?

170
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,358
The AAA guy said I was close to
sucking a muffin down the carburettor.

171
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,724
- What were you thinking?
- We ran out of space.

172
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,355
Now I gotta take the car to Tony
and get it checked out.

173
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,676
- He's good.
- He's real good.

174
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,678
But he's so obsessive
about the car.

175
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,202
He makes me feel guilty about
everything wrong with it.

176
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,086
I gotta get it washed before
I take it down or he'll yell at me.

177
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:41,444
- Choke?
- No, thank you.

178
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,077
Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:48,445
I remember this car. Beautiful car.

180
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,440
Yeah, so anyway, the engine's been
idling a little rough.

181
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,804
I thought it might be time
for a check-up.

182
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,719
There's nothing wrong on the inside.

183
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,878
The shift knob is loose.
You know about that?

184
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,686
- No, I hadn't noticed.
- Have you been picking at it?

185
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:03,596
Have I been picking at it?

186
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,402
No, you know,
it's just wear and tear.

187
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,876
Wear and tear, I see.

188
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,117
The engine's the only thing
that needs checking.

189
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:13,357
- You been rotating the tires?
- Try to.

190
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:14,960
You don't try to. You do it.

191
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,243
Fifty-one percent of all turns
are right turns.

192
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,080
That's right.

193
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:23,515
Twenty thousand dollars?

194
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,121
Elaine, that's twice the amount
I authorized you to spend.

195
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,596
I know, Mr. Peterman,
but once I saw them...

196
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,679
...I just couldn't stand to let anyone
else have them, you know.

197
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,883
Certainly not some
stuck-up candy-bar heiress...

198
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,163
...who flaunts herself in public
without regard...

199
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,363
Well, where are they?

200
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,320
They should be here today.

201
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,638
- Mr. Wilhelm.
- Yes, George.

202
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,603
Hi, I was just...

203
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,565
I just had one little question
about my assignment.

204
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,445
Well, I trust things are
moving smoothly.

205
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,120
Mr. Steinbrenner's counting on you.

206
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,358
Yes, yes, very smooth,
super smooth.

207
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:06,566
But I really want to attack this thing.
You know, sink my teeth into it.

208
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,683
So I was just wondering...

209
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:12,840
...what do you think would be
the very best way to get started?

210
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,475
Get started?
I don't understand, George.

211
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,842
- I was wondering...
- You haven't been to Payroll?

212
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,877
- No, I haven't done that.
- What's the problem?

213
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,005
Now, come on, George. I told
the big man you were moving on this.

214
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,839
Now, don't let him down!

215
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,719
Payroll!

216
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:41,679
Hello there.
I'm George Costanza.

217
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:42,882
Yes.

218
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,075
Assistant to the travelling secretary.

219
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:49,364
I'm working on the project.

220
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,879
- What project?
- The payroll project.

221
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,685
Wilhelm?

222
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:59,202
Big, big payroll project.

223
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,359
You're gonna have to fill me in.

224
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,078
You know what?
I'll look around for awhile.

225
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,966
- I'll just browse around.
- Hey, wait. Excuse me.

226
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,560
You can't come back here.

227
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,958
I'm under direct orders
from Mr. Wilhelm.

228
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:15,357
If you have a problem,
you just take it up with him.

229
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:16,996
Well, maybe I will.

230
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:21,446
You know what?
I urge you to take it up with him.

231
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:22,881
Go ahead. Give him a call.

232
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,481
He'll tell you what I'm doing here.
Then you can tell me.

233
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,002
Mr. Wilhelm,
this is Lafarge in Payroll.

234
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:32,399
There's a Costanza here,
says he's working on some project.

235
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:40,760
Oh, I see. Interesting.
Well, that's quite a project.

236
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,158
All right. Thank you.

237
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:48,238
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

238
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,600
Whatever you need,
just make yourself at home.

239
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:54,999
So he explained it all to you?

240
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,996
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.

241
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,921
- What did he tell you?
- Look, you were right, I was wrong.

242
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,998
You don't have
to humiliate me about it.

243
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,725
Damn.

244
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
Oh, Mother's Day.

245
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,846
Wait a second.

246
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,077
Mother's Day.

247
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:44,959
Yes!

248
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,517
Come on, Kramer!

249
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,442
- What?
- It's the truck, Kramer, the truck.

250
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,518
Look, Newman,
I told you to let this thing go.

251
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,915
No, no, no, listen to me.

252
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,476
Most days, the post office sends
one truckload of mail...

253
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:15,957
...to the second domestic regional
sorting facility in Saginaw, Michigan.

254
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:19,119
But on the week before holidays,
we see a surge.

255
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,925
On Valentine's Day,
we send two trucks.

256
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,396
On Christmas, four,
packed to the brim.

257
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,206
And tomorrow,
if history is any guide...

258
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,598
...we'll see some spillover
into a fifth truck.

259
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:34,079
- Mother's Day.
- The mother of all mail days.

260
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,920
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

261
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,318
A free truck?

262
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,160
Oh, boy, that completely changes
our cost structure.

263
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,283
Our G and A goes down 50 percent.

264
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:46,722
We carry a couple of bags of mail,
the rest is ours!

265
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,765
Newman, you magnificent bastard,
you did it!

266
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,201
Let the collecting begin!

267
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,726
So did you go down to Payroll?

268
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,445
Yes, Payroll. Yes, I did.

269
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:07,041
Very productive. Payroll paid off.

270
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,675
Then I guess
you'll be heading downtown, huh?

271
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:14,601
Oh, yeah. Downtown, definitely.

272
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,122
I'm very interested
to see how this thing turns out.

273
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:20,962
You said it. Excuse me, Mr. Wilhelm,
do you really think...?

274
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,357
Well...

275
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:28,647
Is this downtown trip really necessary,
you know, for the project?

276
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:31,082
Oh, no, you've got
to go downtown, George.

277
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,238
It's all downtown.

278
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:36,399
- Just like the song says.
- The song?

279
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:40,641
There's your answer, "Downtown."

280
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:46,958
The song "Downtown"?
The Petula Clark song?

281
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,162
Yeah.

282
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:51,205
You're sure he didn't mention it
because you were going downtown?

283
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,564
I think he was trying to tell me
something, like it had some meaning.

284
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,401
Okay, so how does it go?

285
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:01,444
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

286
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,041
You can always go

287
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,959
Downtown

288
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:11,081
Maybe you know
Some little places to go to

289
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,078
Where they never close

290
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,839
- Downtown
- Wait a second.

291
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,965
Little places to go that never close.
What little place never closes?

292
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,566
- 7-Eleven.
- Maybe.

293
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:28,515
Just listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city

294
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,123
Linger on the sidewalk
Where the neon lights are pretty

295
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,359
Where the neon lights are pretty.
The Broadway area?

296
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,358
No, that's midtown.

297
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:38,516
Midtown.

298
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,838
The lights are much brighter there

299
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,956
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares

300
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,355
Just go

301
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,995
Downtown

302
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,682
Things will be great
When you're

303
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,565
Downtown

304
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,727
I got nothing, Jerry, nothing.

305
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:07,802
Well, don't hang around
and let your troubles surround you.

306
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,764
There are movie shows.

307
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,638
You think I should come clean?

308
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,798
What do you think?
You think I should confess?

309
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,844
How can you lose?

310
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,679
Yeah, Jerry,
it's Tony Abado at the shop.

311
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,644
Look, we gotta talk.
You better come down.

312
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,923
Anytime after 4.

313
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,286
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

314
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:42,165
- Oh, hi.
- Listen, I need to come over...

315
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,646
...and pick up the clubs.

316
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:47,277
- Oh, you know what?
- Oh, no. What?

317
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,723
No, it's no big deal.
I left the clubs in the car.

318
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,082
You left them in the car?

319
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:55,205
- How could you leave them in the car?
- I forgot.

320
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,085
Oh, go down and get them.

321
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,760
I can't.
The car's at the mechanic's.

322
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,480
Oh, this is great.

323
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,046
All right. Where's the mechanic?

324
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,799
I'll just go and pick them up myself.

325
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,197
No, no, you can't.
He's working on the car right now.

326
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,722
You cannot disturb him
while he's working.

327
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,121
I'm going there in an hour
if you wanna meet me there.

328
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,959
You know the place.
It's on 56th Street.

329
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,119
Oh, okay. All right. Fine.

330
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,966
Hey, Tony.

331
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:23,641
- Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
- Sure.

332
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:28,444
I think I know what's going on here,
and I just want to hear it from you.

333
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,563
But I want you
to be straight with me.

334
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,399
Don't lie to me, Jerry.

335
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,323
You know that motor oil
you're putting in there?

336
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,398
It's from those
quickie-lube places, isn't it?

337
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:43,243
- Well, I change it so often. I mean...
- Motor oil is the lifeblood of a car.

338
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,319
You put in a low-grade oil,
you can damage vital engine parts.

339
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,923
Okay, see this gasket?
I have no confidence in that gasket.

340
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,477
- Tony, I really don't...
- Here's what I wanna do.

341
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,763
I wanna overhaul the entire engine.

342
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,487
But it's gonna take
a major commitment from you.

343
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,320
You're gonna have to keep it under
60 miles an hour for awhile.

344
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:05,162
You gotta come in, and you gotta get
the oil changed every 1000 miles.

345
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,045
How much money is
this gonna cost me?

346
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,199
I don't understand you.

347
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,725
It's your own car
we're talking about.

348
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:16,482
You know, you wrote
the wrong mileage down on the form.

349
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:17,636
You barely know the car.

350
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,684
Don't know the mileage,
the tire pressure.

351
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,917
When's the last time you checked
the washer fluid?

352
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,806
- But the washer fluid is fine.
- The washer fluid is not fine!

353
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,597
You know what...

354
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:33,482
...I just wanna take my car and
I'm gonna bring it someplace else.

355
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,726
- What do you mean?
- Just can I have my car.

356
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,878
I'm gonna to pay my bill
and be on my way.

357
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,075
- Well, the car's on a lift.
- Well, just get it down.

358
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,000
All right.

359
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:48,321
Okay. Well, wait here and I'll...
I'll bring it around.

360
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,842
Okay. Thank you very much.

361
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,718
Hey, where's the car?

362
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,878
- He's bringing it.
- Good.

363
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,726
Okay. Thank you.

364
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,081
So, what did they say?

365
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,283
They're sending
a detective tomorrow.

366
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,041
What the hell were you thinking
leaving my clubs in that car?

367
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:22,404
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic
pulling a Mary Beth Whitehead, did I?

368
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,159
Well, what kind of maniac
is this guy?

369
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,318
He's a very special maniac.

370
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,407
- What do I tell Mr. Peterman?
- I don't know.

371
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,479
Why couldn't
you take better care of that car?

372
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,077
- Well, are they here?
- Mr. Peterman...

373
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,637
...there seems to be a bit of a snag.

374
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:42,802
Snag?

375
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:47,279
It seems that
a psychotic mechanic...

376
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,803
...has absconded
with my friend's car.

377
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,639
What does that have
to do with my clubs?

378
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,002
They happened to be
in the back seat at the time.

379
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,961
What was the suspect wearing
at the time of the incident?

380
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,723
You know, like mechanic's pants,
a shirt that said "Tony."

381
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,276
Let me ask you,
have you ever seen a case like this?

382
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,484
All the time. The mechanic forms
an emotional attachment...

383
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,196
...thinks he's gonna lose the car.
He panics and does something rash.

384
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,399
I'm gonna ask you
some personal questions.

385
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,604
I'm sorry if I touch a nerve,
but I think it will help with the case.

386
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,687
Had you been
taking good care of the car?

387
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,883
- Had I been taking...?
- Did you leave the AC on?

388
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:30,517
Do you zip over speed bumps?
Ride the clutch? Things like that?

389
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:34,396
What does it matter? It's my car.
I can do whatever I want with it.

390
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:38,085
Not that I would think
of doing such things.

391
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:41,956
All right, Mr. Seinfeld,
we'll let you know if we find anything.

392
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:43,845
I gotta be honest with you.

393
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,599
These cases never end up well.

394
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,927
Well, whatever you can do.
Thanks.

395
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,602
Mr. Wilhelm, about the project, sir.

396
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,246
That's what I came to talk about.

397
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:00,479
Great job, George.
You really nailed it.

398
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,723
- I did?
- Yes, I read through it this morning.

399
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:07,675
I couldn't have done it better myself.
I turned it over to Mr. Steinbrenner.

400
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,280
Good work, George.

401
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,276
I don't get it.

402
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,007
He assigns it to you,
you don't do it...

403
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,441
...somehow it gets done...

404
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:19,882
...and now he's telling you
what a great job you did.

405
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,561
Maybe somebody did it
and didn't take credit for it.

406
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,764
Maybe it was already done and
didn't need doing in the first place.

407
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,647
I have no idea who did it...

408
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,196
...what they did,
or how they did it so well.

409
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,561
And you know what?

410
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,639
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.

411
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:40,003
The gardener did a nice job planting
the rose bushes, didn't he, dear?

412
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,045
You planted the rose bushes, dear.

413
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,877
- I did?
- Yesterday. You remember.

414
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:49,719
That's right.

415
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,641
- Oh, what's for dinner?
- We just ate.

416
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,719
Did you forget
to take your medicine?

417
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,527
The point is,
however it got done, it's done.

418
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,917
So any luck with the car?

419
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,315
No, the police have no leads.

420
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:08,921
And I just found out today
my insurance doesn't cover it.

421
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,884
- Why not?
- They don't consider it stolen...

422
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,117
...if you wilfully
give the guy the keys.

423
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,606
- Hey.
- Hey.

424
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:16,961
What did the detective say?

425
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,759
They're looking.

426
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,281
I gotta go.

427
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:24,766
- Hello.
- Mr. Seinfeld?

428
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:26,724
- Yeah.
- It's Detective McMahon.

429
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,765
I'm at the warehouse on pier 38.

430
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:32,365
I think you'd better get down here.

431
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,563
Yeah, okay.
They may have found the car.

432
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:36,406
Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

433
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,159
Are there golf clubs in the back?

434
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,477
We really can't tell.

435
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:43,480
You better bring
your service records.

436
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:48,800
Watch where you step.

437
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:52,482
There's quite a bit of grease.

438
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,239
Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

439
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:56,799
How do you do?
Thanks for coming down.

440
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,605
This is Elaine Benes.

441
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,803
We used to date
but now we're just friends.

442
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,639
- I see.
- You know.

443
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,046
I'm sorry to make you go through this,
but we need to make sure.

444
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:07,799
What's going on?
What is this thing?

445
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:11,004
One of our patrolmen
stumbled over this.

446
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,316
Oh, my God.

447
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,883
The block is nearly split apart.

448
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,720
We found the overhead cams
30 feet away.

449
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,923
We can only hope
the body's sold for scrap.

450
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:21,680
Oh, my God.

451
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,326
And we know it's a Saab.

452
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:26,843
The angle on the V6
is definitely a '92.

453
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,966
The model is hard to determine
because the drive train is all burnt out.

454
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,078
What is that smell?

455
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,885
Look at the clutch.

456
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,639
Excuse me.

457
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:40,120
Whoever did this
didn't just dismantle it.

458
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:42,721
I mean, they took their time,
they had fun...

459
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,479
...they were very systematic.

460
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,207
They went out of the way
to gouge the sides of every piston.

461
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,756
And the turbo was separated
from the housing...

462
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:52,646
...and shoved right up
the exhaust pipe.

463
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:54,965
Wait a second. Turbo?

464
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,687
- I didn't have a turbo.
- Your car is not a turbo?

465
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,997
No, it's a 900 S.

466
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,522
It's a turbo, Elaine. A turbo.

467
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,166
It's a turbo!

468
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,080
Excuse me.
Did you say "Turbo"?

469
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:12,156
Saab Turbo 9000?

470
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,842
Is it midnight blue?

471
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,159
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,716
9999 bottles and cans in the truck

473
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,765
9999 bottles and cans

474
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:30,603
At $0. 10 a bottle and $0. 10 a can
We're pulling in $500 a man

475
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,998
9998 bottles and cans in the truck

476
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:37,125
9998 bottles and cans

477
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,721
We fill up with gas
We count up our cash

478
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:44,438
9997 bottles and cans in the truck

479
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:53,120
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry. It's Tony.

480
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,716
Tony, where are you?

481
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,447
Oh, look, I just want you to know
that the car is fine.

482
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:58,801
Got her all fixed up.

483
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:02,004
We're in a nice area,
no potholes, no traffic.

484
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,158
So there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

485
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,646
In fact, here.

486
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:08,002
Somebody wants to talk to you.

487
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,281
Tony, you better
bring that car back.

488
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,960
Nobody's giving anything back.

489
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:16,401
You tried to take it from me.

490
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:17,761
I don't forget that.

491
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,395
Tony, it is my car,
and I want it back.

492
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,842
Oh, your car?
You want your car back?

493
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,480
- Tony...
- Listen.

494
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,877
That registration may have
your name on it, Jerry...

495
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:30,881
...but this engine's running
on my sweat and my blood.

496
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:36,002
Where do I find these guys?

497
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:44,801
- How much gas we got?
- Three quarters of a tank.

498
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,521
Better than we estimated.

499
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:52,957
- Seven dollars and 22 cents better.
- Oh, baby.

500
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,836
- Maybe we could stop for a snack.
- No, that's not in the budget.

501
00:26:57,207 --> 00:27:00,756
Well, the budget changed, you know.
I mean, it might be a good investment.

502
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:03,441
That's not a good investment.
That's a loss.

503
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,800
Hey, you see that car?

504
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,483
It looks like Jerry's.

505
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:11,683
I'm gonna check out
that license plate.

506
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,519
Yeah, those are New York plates.

507
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,518
- Is that Jerry's number?
- I don't know.

508
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:21,441
But that's New York and we're in Ohio.
Those are pretty good odds.

509
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,120
- What are you doing?
- Calling Jerry.

510
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,404
- On what?
- I brought my phone.

511
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,355
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry.

512
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,597
- What's your license plate number?
- What's up?

513
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:35,405
Yeah, well,
I think I spotted your car.

514
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,559
Oh, my God, you're kidding.
Hang on a second.

515
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:42,563
- It's JVN728.
- Hey, that's it.

516
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,797
That's it.
Hey, look, we got him.

517
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,525
We're driving behind him
in a truck.

518
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:49,201
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He said he brought it to the country.

519
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,483
We're in the country,
and we're right on his tail.

520
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:53,399
Good work, Kramer.
This is incredible.

521
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,716
Yeah, don't worry, Jerry.

522
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:57,640
We're right on this guy
like stink on a monkey.

523
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,638
I'll check back with you.

524
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,401
Elaine Benes.

525
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,285
Yeah, it's me.
Kramer found the car.

526
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,041
Oh, my God. Where is it?

527
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,163
Somewhere in the country.
They're following him.

528
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:10,802
- The clubs there?
- I don't know. They're tailing him.

529
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:14,323
- I'm waiting for them to call me back.
- All right. I'm heading over right now.

530
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:20,475
- What's the status?
- Last check-in, they were still on him.

531
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:22,240
Have they called the police yet?

532
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,443
- They won't call the police.
- What? Why not?

533
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,404
They'll get in trouble
for using the truck.

534
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,637
- Kramer doesn't want a record.
- Kramer has one.

535
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,160
Not a federal record.

536
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,556
- Kramer?
- Kramer?

537
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:36,080
- What's going on?
- Yeah, nothing.

538
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,441
We're still following him.

539
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,117
Wait a second. He's getting off.

540
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,596
Yeah, he's gonna be going south
on the 135.

541
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,201
- Keep following him.
- All right. I'll follow him.

542
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,005
We can't.
We're going north to Michigan.

543
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,604
Yeah, hey, listen, I can't.
It's gonna be taking us out of our way.

544
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,401
- I need those clubs.
- Kramer, I want my car.

545
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,479
- Well, I don't know what to do!
- We got 10,000 deposit bottles here.

546
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,285
This guy could be going
to Arkansas.

547
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,966
Keep following.
Don't let me down.

548
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,005
We can't afford a detour.
Our budget won't hold it.

549
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,566
I don't know what to do, man!

550
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,161
Stay left! Stay left!
Left, left, left. Stay left!

551
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:09,680
- Right! Go right!
- Go south!

552
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,680
All right, all right. I'm getting off.
I'm gonna go on the ramp.

553
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:14,519
I hope you realize
what you've done.

554
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,564
You've destroyed
our whole venture.

555
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:18,240
This ramp is steep.

556
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,604
All my work, my planning, my genius,
all for naught.

557
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,120
We're pulling too much weight.

558
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:25,881
- He's getting away. Take the wheel.
- Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,686
- I'm gonna get something.
- Are you crazy?

560
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,279
Keep your foot on the gas.

561
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,926
Hey, you're not dumping those
bottles back there, are you?

562
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:43,039
Kramer, those have wholesale value.
We can cut our losses.

563
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:45,641
Bottles below!

564
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:56,405
I love this magnifying glass.
I feel like a scientist.

565
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,842
- Oh, yeah.
- You wanted to see me, sir?

566
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,398
Come in, George. Come in.

567
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:04,843
Wilhelm gave me
this project you worked on.

568
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:06,645
- Yes, sir.
- Let me ask you something.

569
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,605
Having any personal problems?
Girl trouble? Love trouble?

570
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,119
- No, sir.
- What about drugs?

571
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:14,403
Doing some of that crack cocaine?
You on the pipe?

572
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,518
- No, sir.
- Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

573
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,326
I got a flash for you, young man.
You're non compos mentis.

574
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,205
You got some bats in the belfry.

575
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,675
What are you talking about?

576
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:27,685
George, I read this report.
It's troubling. Very troubling indeed.

577
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,236
It's a sick mind at work here.
Okay, come on, boys.

578
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:32,204
Come in here.
George, this is Herb and Dan.

579
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,676
They're gonna take you
to where you can get some help.

580
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,281
Very friendly people there.
My brother-in-law was there.

581
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,039
Man was obsessed
with lactating women.

582
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:41,277
They cured him.
Although he eats a lot of cheese.

583
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:45,359
But you see... You see, I didn't
write that report. That's not mine.

584
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,358
Of course you didn't.
You didn't write it.

585
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:49,802
I didn't do it! It just got done!

586
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,322
I don't know how it got done
but it did!

587
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:53,602
Of course, it got done.

588
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,883
Things get done all the time.
I understand.

589
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:58,402
Your job will be waiting for you
when you get back.

590
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,525
Get better, George!
Get better!

591
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:08,438
Man, I don't understand this.

592
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,360
I ditched every bottle and can,
and we still can't gain.

593
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:13,119
It's like we're...

594
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,679
...sluggish.

595
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:19,556
We collected all those bottles and
all those cans for what? What a waste.

596
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:22,321
I'm really gonna catch hell
for those missing mailbags.

597
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:25,679
Hey, wasn't that a pie stand
back there?

598
00:31:26,287 --> 00:31:27,686
- A pie stand?
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:29,678
Homemade pies, 200 yards back.

600
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,963
Oh, come on, pull over.
Pull over, will you?

601
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,241
Where? I don't see it.

602
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:41,285
Well, open the door.
You'll get a better look.

603
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:43,119
I don't see any pie.

604
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:46,521
Kramer!

605
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,918
I'm sorry, Newman,
you were holding us back.

606
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,645
Kramer!

607
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:58,003
Jerry, we've lost the fat man
and we're running lean.

608
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,158
We're back on track, buddy.

609
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:04,158
Federal employee.

610
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,239
I hate corn.

611
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:01,886
- Hello, stranger.
- Look, I'm sorry to bother you...

612
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,526
...but I'm a U.S. Postal worker...

613
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,598
...and my mail truck
was just ambushed...

614
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,645
...by a band of backwoods,
mail-hating survivalists.

615
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,320
You just calm down now.
Calm down.

616
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,159
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

617
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:15,524
This farm ain't much,
but you're welcome to what we have.

618
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:20,078
- Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

619
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,726
I just have one rule.

620
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:24,082
Keep your hands off my daughter.

621
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:33,406
Jerry, we got him.
I'm riding his tail.

622
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,161
There's no escape.
He's running scared, buddy.

623
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:39,205
- How's the gas situation?
- I got enough to get to Memphis.

624
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,246
He's reaching in back.

625
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,160
Keeps grabbing at something.
He's pulling out a gun.

626
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:46,522
- He's got a gun, Jerry!
- Duck, Kramer, duck.

627
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,718
It's a golf club. There's no gun.

628
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,003
He threw a golf club at me!

629
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,919
Those are JFK's golf clubs.

630
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,315
Hey, I'm under fire.

631
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,523
I'm under heavy fire here.

632
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:07,478
Jeez, there goes a five-iron.

633
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,439
Stop the truck, Kramer.
Pick up the clubs.

634
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,326
No, don't stop, Kramer.
Keep going. Don't let him get away.

635
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,762
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think he's done.

636
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,724
Oh, no, he's taking out the woods!

637
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,677
You'll have to do
a lot better than that!

638
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,119
What's happening?

639
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,325
This truck is dying.
We're losing him.

640
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,319
- I think we lost him.
- Damn it.

641
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:54,398
Can you stop
and pick up those clubs, Kramer?

642
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:56,843
Yeah, yeah, I'll get them.

643
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,444
Enjoying that mutton?

644
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:40,241
It's delicious mutton.

645
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:43,126
This is... This is out of sight.

646
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:47,326
I would... I would love to get the recipe.
It's very good.

647
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,366
That cider too strong for you?

648
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,724
No, no, I love strong cider.

649
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:09,766
I'm a big strong-cider guy.

650
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,760
Gonna milk the Holsteins
in the morning, if you'd lend a hand.

651
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:17,606
You know, I don't know much about...
I don't have any...

652
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,327
- I don't think I know much about that.
- Susie will teach you.

653
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,998
Just gotta pull on the teets a little.

654
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,885
It's nice having
a big, strong man around.

655
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:34,842
You know, those mailbags,
they get mighty heavy.

656
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,641
I...

657
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,877
I Nautilus, of course.

658
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,164
Can I have some gravy?

659
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:52,000
Steinbrenner had me committed!
I'm in the nuthouse.

660
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,078
I'll be back
same time next week, Pop.

661
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:55,885
They took my belt, Jerry.

662
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,526
I got nothing to hold my pants up.

663
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,318
You gotta come over here now!

664
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,445
Just tell him what we talked about,
how I didn't do the project.

665
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,120
George?

666
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,319
I see you're finally
getting some help.

667
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:12,480
Oh, Deena, thank God.
Thank God, you're here.

668
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,921
Listen, you gotta help me.

669
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:15,964
You gotta tell these people
that I'm okay.

670
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,402
You know
that I don't belong in here.

671
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,919
George, this is
the best thing for you.

672
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:27,118
What? No, no, Deena.
Deena, wait! Deena, help!

673
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,481
It's not what it looks like.

674
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,603
Is that little Georgie C?

675
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:33,039
How's the folks?

676
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,516
You still got that nice little car?

677
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,317
- What are you doing?
- Kramer, help me, help me!

678
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:04,398
I told you to keep away
from my daughter.

679
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:09,359
No, Daddy, you'll hurt him.

680
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,199
I love him.

681
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:15,679
Goodbye, Norman! Goodbye!

682
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:26,115
Elaine, you found the clubs.
That's wonderful news.

683
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,403
- Where are they?
- Yep.

684
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,559
Let me get them for you,
Mr. Peterman.

685
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,083
I'll be inaugurating them this weekend
with none other than Ethel Kennedy.

686
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,958
A woman whose triumph
in the face of tragedy...

687
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:40,483
...is exceeded only
by her proclivity to procreate.

688
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:55,046
The...

689
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:59,646
The letter of authenticity
is in the side pocket there.

690
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,240
Elaine.

691
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,077
I never knew Kennedy
had such a temper.

692
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,039
Oh, yeah.

693
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:14,560
The only thing worse was his slice.

694
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:20,717
- See you on Monday.
- Have a good game.
