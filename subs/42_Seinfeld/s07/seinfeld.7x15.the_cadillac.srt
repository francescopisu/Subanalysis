451
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,682
That's another Marisa Tomei movie.

452
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:13,439
And you've seen that one too.

453
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,882
What, do you have a thing for her?

454
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,882
Yeah. Yeah, I have a thing
for Marisa Tomei.

455
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:25,006
Like she would ever go out
with a short, stocky, bald man.

456
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,725
Like that's her type.

457
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:28,684
She's an Oscar winner.

458
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,119
Besides, I don't even know her.

459
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:34,165
It's not like anyone's
trying to fix us up.

460
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:36,876
Who would try and fix me up
with Marisa Tomei?

461
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,356
What are you talking about?

462
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,325
Have I told you
how much I love you today?

463
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,358
Not in the last 15 minutes.

464
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,918
Well, I do love you very much.

465
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:10,157
And I love you, Marisa.

466
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,724
Well, then. Come on, get dressed.

467
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:15,764
We're going to be late
for the premiere.

468
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,557
Stupid foldout.

469
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:47,878
Why do they put the bar
in the middle of the bed?

470
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:01,205
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.

471
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:03,963
Elaine? What's going on?

472
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:08,926
I was thinking. I mean, I'm not really
doing that much this weekend...

473
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,442
...and I thought, "Well, what the hell.

474
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,326
Maybe I'll come down there
and hang out a little."

475
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,682
You wanna hang out here...

476
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,520
...at Phase Two
in the Pines of Mar Gables?

477
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,081
Well...

478
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,158
...it's just two hours by plane.

479
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:30,602
Gee, I don't know what to tell you.

480
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:32,879
Damn it. I got another call.

481
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:35,436
Hang on. Don't hang up, Jerry.

482
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:37,841
- Yeah?
- Elaine...

483
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:40,043
...you have got to get me
Marisa Tomei's number.

484
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:43,882
Okay, George, I'm on the other line.
I promise you, I'll get you her number.

485
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:47,447
- Yeah.
- Goodbye.

486
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,320
Hi.

487
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,240
Hi.

488
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:53,961
So, what do you think?

489
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,200
I don't think so.

490
00:23:58,167 --> 00:23:59,520
I'll be back on Monday.

491
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:02,964
Well, if you need that ride...

492
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:04,880
...just give me a call.

493
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,799
I can meet you at the gate, Jerr.

494
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,241
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

495
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:10,557
- All right, I'll see you.
- Jerr, Jerry?

496
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,683
- Yeah?
- Bye.

497
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,086
Bye.

498
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:20,599
Yeah, sure. No, that's fantastic.

499
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,565
I'll... I'll see you then.

500
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,240
Okay.

501
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:28,203
I just got off the phone
with Marisa Tomei.

502
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,927
I just spoke to Marisa Tomei.

503
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:32,725
And I wasn't even that nervous.

504
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:35,242
I can't remember calling
a woman without being nervous.

505
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,877
Usually I'm pacing all over the room.
I write down things to say.

506
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:42,042
Okay, well, that's all the time
we have for today.

507
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:44,721
Why don't we pick up
with this next week?

508
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,639
- Where are you going?
- I got stuff to do.

509
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:48,718
- What? You can't leave yet.
- Why not?

510
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,162
- We have to discuss my alibi.
- Alibi?

511
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,716
- What does that have to do with me?
- I spend Saturday...

512
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:56,003
...with Susan. She'll wanna know
what I'm doing.

513
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,158
I can't use Jerry.
He's in Florida.

514
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,966
- So you wanna say you were with me?
- Yes.

515
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,405
Okay, fine. You were with me.

516
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,603
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What were we doing?

517
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,076
Where were we?
Why are we together?

518
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,046
- What is the difference?
- Because if you ever see her...

519
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,324
...and it comes up,
we have to be in sync.

520
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,400
Okay. Now...

521
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:24,245
Why do I have to see you?

522
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:31,001
Because I'm going to the dentist...

523
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,725
...and I'm afraid...

524
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:35,117
...and I want you to go with me.

525
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:37,199
That's no good.

526
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:40,402
Okay, fine.

527
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:41,716
What?

528
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:44,401
I don't like the way you
just rejected my suggestion.

529
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:47,559
Hey, let's not get so defensive here.
This is a give-and-take process.

530
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:50,161
I thought that
my suggestion was good.

531
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,397
I think you could have
been a little more tactful.

532
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,923
Okay, look, we've never
worked together on a lie.

533
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,885
You don't understand how I work.
I have a certain way of working.

534
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:01,845
Jerry and I have worked together
a few times. He knows how I work.

535
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:06,080
Not a personal thing. We're just trying
to come up with the best possible lie.

536
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,760
- That's what this is about.
- Okay.

537
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,280
- Okay. Fine.
- Okay?

538
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:11,756
- Good.
- Fine, fine, fine.

539
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,679
Okay.

540
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,004
Okay, how about this?

541
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,600
- What?
- You are having problems...

542
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:23,601
...with your boyfriend, and I am
meeting you to discuss the situation.

543
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,120
I don't have a boyfriend.

544
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,437
She doesn't know that.
We say that you do.

545
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:31,724
It's good. Believe me.

546
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:34,401
I thought my idea was just as good.

547
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,684
- The dentist thing?
- Yeah, right. The dentist thing.

548
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,759
- The dentist thing was not good.
- Okay, all right.

549
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,645
What is his name? Who is he?

550
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:44,721
Art Vandelay.

551
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:47,364
Art Vandelay?

552
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:49,677
- This is my boyfriend?
- That's your boyfriend.

553
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,759
What does he do?

554
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:54,964
- He's an importer.
- Just imports? No exports?

555
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:57,998
He's an importer-exporter.
Okay?

556
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:03,237
So I'm dating Art Vandelay.

557
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:05,364
What is the problem
we're discussing?

558
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,246
Yes, yes.

559
00:27:13,687 --> 00:27:15,006
How about this?

560
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,477
How about he's thinking
of quitting the exporting...

561
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:21,480
...and just focusing in
on the importing.

562
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:25,765
And this is causing a problem.
Because why not do both?

563
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,600
Oh, what? You don't like
that suggestion either?

564
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:34,118
It's very complicated.

565
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,724
You know, it seems to me
that it's all you...

566
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:39,764
...and none of my ideas
are getting in.

567
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:44,478
You know, I mean, you just know it all.
And I am Miss Stupid, right?

568
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:49,958
What are you doing?
Are you making coffee?

569
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,402
- Yeah.
- You better make a pot of tea too.

570
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,125
Morty, you're driving me crazy.

571
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,959
Look, I don't want anything
to go wrong.

572
00:27:56,127 --> 00:27:58,641
If this woman votes to impeach me,
I'll be a laughingstock.

573
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:02,482
You wanna drive a Cadillac,
expect to pay the consequences.

574
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,285
There she is.

575
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:08,075
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Choate.

576
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,397
- Hello.
- Oh, come in. May I take your coat?

577
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:13,445
No, no. I prefer to wear it.
Nobody's taking my coat.

578
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:15,438
How about a cup
of coffee or something?

579
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:16,881
Coffee?

580
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,675
I'll take hot water
with lemon if you have it.

581
00:28:19,847 --> 00:28:21,360
Please, have a seat.

582
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:24,599
That's a lovely scarf you're wearing.
Where did you get it?

583
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,803
They're a dime a dozen.

584
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,800
Oh, hi, Jerry. Mrs. Choate,
this is my son, Jerry.

585
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,166
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it.

586
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,840
Help! Someone help!

587
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,475
- Shut up, you old bag.
- Thief!

588
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:42,162
Stop him! Stop him,
he's got my rye!

589
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:47,287
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

590
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:49,677
Jerry lives in New York.
You just came from New York?

591
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:53,123
Yeah, I was visiting my daughter.
And I'll never go back.

592
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,716
The crime there is just terrible.

593
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:59,277
Do you know I got mugged
for a marble rye right on the street?

594
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:03,122
Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye?
Why would they steal a rye?

595
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:06,006
That's what the city's turning into.
They'll steal anything.

596
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,282
They're like savages.

597
00:29:07,447 --> 00:29:10,644
Yeah, there are some sickos
out there.

598
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:13,765
You look very familiar.
Have we ever met?

599
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:17,041
You ever go to Camp Tioga?

600
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:18,720
Maybe you've seen him
on television.

601
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:22,163
- Jerry's a comedian.
- No, I don't watch TV.

602
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,079
- It was nice meeting you.
- Jerry, don't go.

603
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:25,919
No, I think I'll go.

604
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:29,687
So, Morty, what's this all about?
What do you want?

605
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,718
Hey, where are you going?

606
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,320
Oh, l... I didn't tell you?

607
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:36,364
I gotta go meet Elaine.

608
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,279
Elaine? What for?

609
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:41,519
I don't know. She's having some
problems with this guy she's seeing.

610
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,400
I didn't know
she was dating anyone.

611
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:46,639
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing
this guy, Art Vandelay.

612
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:50,001
- So, what does he do?
- He's an importer-exporter.

613
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,919
What kind of problems
are they having?

614
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,562
Well, he...

615
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:59,085
He wants to quit
the exporting and...

616
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:01,877
...focus just on the importing.

617
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:05,607
And it's a problem because
she thinks the exporting...

618
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,406
...is as important as the importing.

619
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,637
Are you having
an affair with Elaine?

620
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:15,162
Right. Come on.

621
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:19,445
I'm having an affair with Elaine?
If I was having an affair with Elaine...

622
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:21,518
...I wouldn't tell you
I'm seeing Elaine.

623
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,121
I would make up another person
to tell you I would see...

624
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:26,642
...and then I would go see Elaine.

625
00:32:04,127 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll get you! I'll get you, Kramer!

626
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:09,597
You won't get away with this.

627
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:14,960
All right, are you ready to eat?

628
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:19,283
Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go.
It's time to eat. We're going to dinner.

629
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:24,005
- Dinner? Well, what time is it?
- It's 4:30.

630
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,035
Four thirty?
Who eats dinner at 4:30?

631
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:29,675
By the time we sit down,
it'll be quarter to 5.

632
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,759
I don't understand
why we have to eat now.

633
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:35,124
We gotta catch the early-bird.
It's only between 4:30 and 6.

634
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,802
Yeah, they give you a tenderloin,
a salad and a baked potato for $4.95.

635
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:41,276
You know what that
costs you after 6?

636
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,405
Can't we eat at a decent hour?
I'll treat. Okay?

637
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,080
You're not buying us dinner.

638
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:48,682
I'm not force-feeding
myself a steak at 4:30...

639
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,156
...to save a couple bucks.
I'll tell you that.

640
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:53,886
All right.

641
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:55,480
We'll wait.

642
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,519
But it's unheard of.

643
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:04,476
So anyway, if you think about it...

644
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:06,524
..."manure" is not really
that bad a word.

645
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:09,485
I mean, it's "newer," which is good.

646
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,719
And a "ma" in front of it,
which is also good.

647
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:15,447
"Manure." It's really not that bad.

648
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:18,037
You're so right.
I never thought of it like that.

649
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,517
"Manure." "Ma" and the "newer."

650
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:23,875
Did you just make that up?

651
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:26,000
What, you think I'm doing material?

652
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,441
No, no.

653
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:31,441
It's hard to believe anyone
could be so spontaneously funny.

654
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,677
And I'm a little tired.

655
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,400
So tell me:

656
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:38,876
How is it that a man like you...

657
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:42,960
...so bald and so quirky
and funny?

658
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:45,721
How is it you're not taken?

659
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:48,884
Well, Marisa...

660
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:51,197
...you see, the thing is...

661
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,277
...l'm sort of engaged.

662
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:58,801
What?

663
00:33:58,967 --> 00:34:01,765
I'm, you know, "engaged."

664
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:13,758
- Hey, look, there's a spot right in front.
- Always, Jerry. Always.

665
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,082
Was that delicious or what?

666
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:21,805
Where you gonna get
a better meal?

667
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,241
It's better than Danny's.

668
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:25,363
Danny's? Come on.

669
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:26,801
- Hello, Jack.
- Doris.

670
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:28,685
- Hi, Jack. Hi, Doris.
- Jerry.

671
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:30,678
Hello, Morty.

672
00:34:31,687 --> 00:34:34,326
Well, you missed the early-bird.

673
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,045
Yeah? So?

674
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:40,482
Must be nice to have
that kind of money.

675
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:42,486
Bernie.

676
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,115
Look who's eating at 6:00.

677
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:48,404
Your suddenly well-to-do president.

678
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,444
Stop it, Jack.

679
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:53,519
You enjoy your last meal in office.

680
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:55,439
Tomorrow, when they kick you out...

681
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:59,520
...you'll have plenty of time
to drive around in your Cadillac.

682
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:01,643
They're not kicking me out.

683
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:03,604
You don't have the votes.

684
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,280
That's what you think.

685
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:07,597
- We'll see.
- Yes, we will.

686
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:10,321
All right, let's eat already.

687
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,399
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi.

688
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:23,196
Hi. Come in. Come in.

689
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:26,404
- Have a seat.
- Elaine, I have to ask you a question.

690
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:29,206
- Oh, sure.
- Are you having an affair with George?

691
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,959
What?

692
00:35:37,647 --> 00:35:40,400
Don't be ridiculous.

693
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,637
I mean, why would
anyone wanna sleep...?

694
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,078
Well, obviously...

695
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:51,118
You know... Of... Of...

696
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:54,006
Why would you think I was
having an affair with George?

697
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:58,479
Oh, because he said that he had to
talk with you earlier about some...

698
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,285
...problem that you were having.

699
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:02,961
Yeah. Yeah, I did have
to talk with him.

700
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,402
I definitely had to talk with him.

701
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:09,765
I was having a problem
with my boyfriend.

702
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:12,566
- Art Vandelay?
- Yeah, Art Vandelay.

703
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:15,116
I'm sorry.
L... I feel like an idiot.

704
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,118
No, no.

705
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,118
That's okay.

706
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:21,357
- Forget that we ever talked.
- It is so forgotten.

707
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:22,801
- All right.
- Okay.

708
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:25,037
Okay. It's no problem.

709
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,802
So was George helpful at all?

710
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:34,960
Yeah. Oh, yes.
Yes, he was very helpful.

711
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:39,201
Because Art and I were
getting into this whole thing...

712
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:41,835
...about his business.

713
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,157
- You know he's an importer-exporter?
- Yeah.

714
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,399
George felt that I was too
adamant in my stand...

715
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:50,365
...that Art should focus
on the exporting...

716
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:52,483
...and forget about the importing.

717
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:56,037
Wait a minute. I thought that Art
wanted to give up the exporting.

718
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,880
- What did I say?
- The importing.

719
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:00,958
I did?

720
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,724
So, what does he import?

721
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:07,679
Chips.

722
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:11,121
- What kind of chips?
- Potato.

723
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:13,517
- Some corn.
- And what does he export?

724
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,483
Diapers.

725
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:19,798
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

726
00:37:21,207 --> 00:37:22,799
Okay.

727
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,675
Come on, George, pick up.

728
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,963
Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.

729
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:38,239
- Hi.
- Hi. So, George...

730
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,875
...what does Art Vandelay import?

731
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:45,763
Matches. Really long matches.

732
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:55,963
There she is. Okay, if I could have
your attention for a minute here.

733
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,925
We're calling this emergency meeting
of the board of Phase Two...

734
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:03,443
...to consider a motion of impeachment
of our president, Morty Seinfeld.

735
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:06,078
- Nervous, Jack?
- What for?

736
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:08,482
Because I have the votes.

737
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:10,922
- Nice to see you, Mrs. Choate.
- Hello, Morty.

738
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:15,075
Building A, are you for or against
the motion to impeach?

739
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:18,205
- What does that mean?
- It means if you're for the motion...

740
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,766
...you're against Morty.

741
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:21,360
So why don't you say that?

742
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:23,438
Hey. I'm running the meeting.

743
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:25,678
If you think so.

744
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,044
- Building A.
- For impeachment.

745
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:30,926
- Building B.
- Against impeachment.

746
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:33,601
- Building C.
- For impeachment.

747
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,235
- Building D.
- Against impeachment.

748
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:39,126
I can't believe you got that old bag.

749
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:43,280
Help! Someone help!

750
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:44,675
Shut up, you old bag.

751
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:47,283
Thief! Thief!

752
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:49,036
It's him.

753
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:52,205
It's your son.

754
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,846
Now I know where I saw him.

755
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,998
He stole my marble rye.

756
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,635
My son never stole anything.
He's a good boy.

757
00:38:58,807 --> 00:39:00,957
They should lock him up.

758
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:04,364
Like father, like son.

759
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:06,718
I change my vote.

760
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,400
I vote to impeach.

761
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,127
Me too. I change my vote.

762
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:13,403
- All those in favour say aye.
- Aye!

763
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:14,920
All opposed?

764
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,282
The ayes have it.
The motion passes.

765
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:21,042
Morty Seinfeld, you are officially
dismissed as condo president.

766
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:23,084
As vice president, Jack Klompus...

767
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:25,397
...in accordance with
the Phase Two constitution...

768
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,603
...is hereby installed as president.

769
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,519
Hear, hear, Jack.

770
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:31,882
Good for you, honey.

771
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:38,558
All right, I know you're in there.

772
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:40,524
I know you can hear me.

773
00:39:40,687 --> 00:39:43,121
You win, okay? You win.

774
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,642
I can't do it anymore.

775
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,806
What do you want from me,
an apology?

776
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,446
All right.

777
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:52,040
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:55,677
There, I said it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

779
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:59,920
I see now how we made you feel
when we made you sit home waiting.

780
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:03,124
I don't know why we do it.
I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy...

781
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:05,721
...taking advantage of people.

782
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:08,202
But all that's gonna change.

783
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:11,845
From now on, no more 9 to 12,
no more 1 to 5.

784
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:14,157
We'll kind of have appointments.

785
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:16,363
Eleven o'clock is gonna
mean 11:00...

786
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:21,043
...and if we can't make it,
I'm gonna call you, tell you why.

787
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:24,802
For God's sakes, if a doctor can do it,
why can't we?

788
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,119
Anyway...

789
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:31,359
...that's it.

790
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:40,596
