1
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:04,160
You get to a point
with your parents...

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:08,759
...where all you can do with them
is eat. You can't talk anymore...

3
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,124
...but you wanna at least try
and keep your mouths moving.

4
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:14,596
And they're so anxious for it,
you know. You come in:

5
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:16,598
"How was the plane?
You must be hungry.

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,439
How did you sleep?
Ready for breakfast?"

7
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:21,241
My mother will argue with me
about what I like.

8
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:24,444
"Can I have a piece of pumpkin pie?"
"You don't like pumpkin pie."

9
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,837
"Yes, I do."
"Since when?"

10
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,599
"What's the difference?
Can I have it?"

11
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:32,203
"No. I have never seen you eat
a piece of pumpkin pie."

12
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:38,483
Mr. Peterman sent me over here
for a physical...

13
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:40,763
...because as you may
or may not know...

14
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:44,039
...he and I are going on a trip
to Kenya.

15
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,599
Africa.

16
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:49,840
It's my first such mission
for the company.

17
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:53,087
The Masai Bushmen
wear these great sandals...

18
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:55,715
...and we're gonna knock them off.

19
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:58,555
Not the Masai, the sandals.

20
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:01,919
- I'll need a urine sample.
- Right.

21
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:05,716
Africa? Do you know how hot
it gets there?

22
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,202
Like 150 degrees.

23
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,961
Your skin is gonna be
simmering with boils.

24
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,203
Oh, come on.

25
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,846
You coming to The Tonight Show?

26
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,157
Yeah, yeah. My parents wanna
come too, is that okay?

27
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,722
- Sure. My parents will be there.
- The Tonight Show?

28
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:21,400
Yeah, they're in town.
You wanna go?

29
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:23,438
- Are you doing new material?
- No.

30
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,881
I don't think so.

31
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,240
Hey, the super's in my bathroom
changing my showerhead.

32
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,915
- Have they changed yours?
- No, he's doing mine next.

33
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:36,363
- They're low-flow, you know.
- Low-flow?

34
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,882
Well, I don't like the sound of that.

35
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:42,757
So, what are your parents
doing here in New York?

36
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,241
Well, they were humiliated.

37
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,921
After the impeachment,
my father left office in disgrace.

38
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,201
- So, what are their plans?
- Well, this is the problem.

39
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,245
They're moving into this new
development. Here's the pamphlet.

40
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,007
"Del Boca Vista." But they're
not quite ready to go back...

41
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,000
...so they're in seclusion here
for a while at Uncle Leo's.

42
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:00,799
The three of them
in that tiny apartment?

43
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,567
No, Leo's not there.
He's got a girlfriend, Lydia.

44
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:07,515
- In fact, he moved in with her.
- Uncle Leo's having regular sex?

45
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,241
Yeah, I know, it devalues
the whole thing.

46
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,799
- Hello.
- What time do we have to be...

47
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,446
...at The Tonight Show on Thursday?

48
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:21,482
- You gotta be there at 4:30.
- But it comes on at 11:30.

49
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,963
Yeah, well, they tape it in the
afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.

50
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,318
- How long they been doing this?
- Thirty years.

51
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:31,564
Helen, did you know that they
tape this thing in the afternoon?

52
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,758
All right. I'll see you later.

53
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:36,162
Georgie, how come your parents
never moved to Florida?

54
00:02:38,887 --> 00:02:40,479
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?

55
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:42,678
- Yeah, it is.
- I mean, they're retired.

56
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:44,803
There's no economic reason
for them to be here.

57
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,686
They have no friends.

58
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,565
No social reason for them
to be here.

59
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:51,998
- You're all grown-up.
- Yeah, they're through ruining my life.

60
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,283
What the hell
are they still doing here?

61
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,398
Let me see this pamphlet.

62
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,605
All right, I'll...

63
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,564
I'll get back to you.

64
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,525
- Hello?
- Where can I buy some ice?

65
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,359
Your father likes a lot of ice.

66
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:13,522
I don't know.
Maybe get an ice tray?

67
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,287
- I can do that.
- You know, Dad just called me.

68
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,563
Yeah, I know.
His phlebitis is acting up.

69
00:03:18,767 --> 00:03:20,883
Yeah. All right.
Well, I got some people here.

70
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:22,520
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

71
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:23,961
- You see this?
- What?

72
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,163
Any thought pops into their head,
they call me...

73
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:28,238
...because it's a local call now.

74
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:31,405
I'm used to a 1200-mile buffer zone.

75
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,684
I can't handle this. Plus, I got
the dinners, I got the pop-ins.

76
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,362
- They pop in. It's brutal.
- Any idea when they're going back?

77
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:41,041
The only way out is if
Leo breaks up with his girlfriend...

78
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,119
...and moves back in. Then they
would have to go back to Florida.

79
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:45,556
How's that gonna happen?

80
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:49,959
It's about time you called your uncle.
We gotta do this once a week.

81
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:53,243
Once a week?

82
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,006
So how's Lydia?

83
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,885
She's a real tiger.

84
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,726
I don't know how you do it.

85
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,515
- What?
- Well, a man like you...

86
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:05,475
...limiting yourself to one woman.
I don't know. It's none of my business.

87
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,643
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,640
- Well...
- Look at this.

89
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,367
I told them medium rare.
It's medium.

90
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,764
- It happens.
- I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.

91
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,446
He has no idea who you are.

92
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:22,122
They don't just overcook
a hamburger, Jerry.

93
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,238
Fine. Anyway, the point
I was making...

94
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:27,558
...before Goebbels
made your hamburger here is this:

95
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,003
A man like you could be
dating women 20 years younger.

96
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,926
Come on, Uncle Leo,
I've seen the way women look at you.

97
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:37,836
When's the last time you looked
in the mirror? You're an Adonis.

98
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,157
You've got beautiful features,
lovely skin.

99
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:43,803
You're in the prime of your life here.
You should be swinging.

100
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:46,567
If I were you,
I'd tell this Lydia character:

101
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,041
"It's been real."

102
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,926
Move back into that bachelor pad
and put out a sign:

103
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,601
"Open for business."

104
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,400
Believe me, I thought about it...

105
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:59,446
...but she is so perfect in every way,
I can't see a flaw.

106
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,603
Well, keep looking.

107
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,044
Oh, hi, Mr. Peterman.

108
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:07,886
Do you realize how short
the Kalahari Bushmen are?

109
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,999
I'm gonna look like a giant
to those guys.

110
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:14,205
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Elaine.

111
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,282
It appears you will not be
accompanying me to Africa.

112
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,922
What? Why not?

113
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:22,516
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine.

114
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,724
You've tested positive for opium.

115
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:27,918
- Opium?
- That's right, Elaine.

116
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,163
White Lotus. Yam-yam.

117
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,557
Shanghai Sally.

118
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,759
Well, that's impossible.
I've never done a drug in my life.

119
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,918
Dr. Strugatz must have
made a mistake.

120
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,719
Not a chance.

121
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:43,163
I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone
else to accompany me on my journey.

122
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,000
The Dark Continent
is no place for an addict, Elaine.

123
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:49,360
Obviously, Mr. Peterman,
there's something wrong with this test.

124
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,444
I don't take opium.

125
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:54,405
Let me take another one, please?
I'll call the doctor right now.

126
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,478
I'll take a pop urine test.

127
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,566
- All right, Elaine.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Peterman.

128
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,077
I'll be ready in three minutes.

129
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,564
Boy, it's cold outside, huh?

130
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,400
Oh, these New York winters.

131
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,920
Bitter cold. Bitter.

132
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,880
I was out for five minutes before.
I couldn't feel my extremities.

133
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,362
What extremities?

134
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:23,643
You know what the temperature
in Florida is today?

135
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:25,445
Seventy-nine.

136
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,365
That's almost 80.

137
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,999
Yeah, I read someplace,
the life expectancy in Florida...

138
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,206
...is 81. And in Queens, 73.

139
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,046
So, George, why are you here?

140
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:42,525
What, I can't stop by
and visit my parents?

141
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,200
What's this?

142
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:47,365
That's where the Seinfelds
are moving. They got a great deal.

143
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,677
- Yeah?
- You know what they got in Florida?

144
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,200
Jai alai.

145
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,881
You bet on the games,
you clean up.

146
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,601
- I don't bet.
- Well, what about the dolphins?

147
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,246
You can swim
with the dolphins there.

148
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,517
I don't swim.

149
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,485
Well, you could pet them.

150
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:04,842
They come right out of the water
onto the sidewalks.

151
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,039
Are you trying to get rid of us?

152
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:12,359
"Rid"? Ma, come on.
The word is "care." "Care."

153
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,006
I care about your comfort.

154
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:15,640
Be it here in Queens...

155
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,446
...or 1200 miles away.

156
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,800
No?

157
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,637
Jerry. Jerry!

158
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,683
- You too, huh?
- Yeah.

159
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,276
These showers are horrible.
There's no pressure.

160
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:42,041
- I can't get the shampoo out.
- Me either.

161
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,876
If I don't have a good shower, I am not
myself. I feel weak and ineffectual.

162
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,878
- I'm not Kramer.
- You? What about me?

163
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,366
I got The Tonight Show tonight.

164
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,836
I'm gonna have to shower
in the dressing room.

165
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:55,564
- Where you going?
- Well, I gotta find another shower.

166
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:03,482
- They got you too?
- This is awful.

167
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,205
I'm not Newman.

168
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,041
- Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
- Kramer, you look terrible.

169
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:17,165
Yeah. I need the keys to your
apartment. I gotta take a shower.

170
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:20,404
- What's wrong with your shower?
- There's no water pressure.

171
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,802
- Why didn't you go see Jerry?
- Jerry's got nothing.

172
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,845
Newman's got nothing. You're
the one who's got the good stuff.

173
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,483
And I need it bad, baby, because I feel
like I got bugs crawling up my skin.

174
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:32,565
- Now, you gotta help me out.
- Not on my watch!

175
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,201
I won't have you turning my office
into a den of iniquity!

176
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,642
- What's wrong with you?
- Get your fix somewhere else!

177
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:40,117
Go on, beat it!

178
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:47,718
- Mr. Peterman, what are you doing?
- Elaine, you're out of control.

179
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:49,286
You need help.

180
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,003
I know what you're going through.

181
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,965
I, too, once fell under the spell
of opium.

182
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,601
It was 1979.
I was traveling the Yangtze...

183
00:08:57,767 --> 00:08:59,519
...in search
of a Mongolian horsehair vest.

184
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,206
Oh, for God's sake.

185
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,763
I had got to the market after sundown.
All of the clothing traders had gone.

186
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:06,883
But a different sort of trader
still lurked.

187
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,244
"Just a taste," he said.
That was all it took.

188
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:14,156
Mr. Peterman, I don't know
what's going on here.

189
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:17,524
I am not addicted to anything.

190
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,957
Oh, Elaine.

191
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,881
The toll road of denial
is a long and dangerous one.

192
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,681
The price? Your soul.

193
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:31,917
Oh, and by the way, you have
till 5:00 to clear out your desk.

194
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:33,520
You're fired.

195
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:40,365
- All they serve is chicken?
- There's more food down the hall.

196
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,717
Here, wrap it up. We'll take it home.

197
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,518
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

198
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,881
Hello, Seinfelds.

199
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,924
- Hello.
- Hi, Estelle.

200
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:52,687
This is your dressing room?
They treat you like Toscanini.

201
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,439
Oh, Jerry, I don't know
how you can do this.

202
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,438
I'm so nervous for you.

203
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,000
Actually, I'm drunk.

204
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,477
Hey. Hey, how is Florida, huh?

205
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,439
We just bought a new place
down there.

206
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,717
I know. We were looking
at the brochure.

207
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:09,599
- You what?
- Why, you thinking of moving?

208
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,843
- Not really.
- Because if you are, you shouldn't.

209
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,599
There's nothing available there.

210
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,686
Are you telling me there's not one
condo available in Del Boca Vista?

211
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:20,685
That's right.
They went like hotcakes.

212
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,519
- How'd you get yours?
- Got lucky.

213
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,760
Are you trying to keep us out
of Del Boca Vista?

214
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,798
I know this doesn't seem
like work to you...

215
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,004
...but if you'd conduct the psychopath
convention down the hall...

216
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:34,404
...so I could just get
a little personal space.

217
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,802
How could I have
tested positive twice?

218
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:41,805
Once, I can understand.
That's a mistake. But twice?

219
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,599
Yeah, it's hard to figure.

220
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,440
I mean, I've lost my job.
I can't go to Africa.

221
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,877
I was gonna meet
the Bushmen of the Kalahari.

222
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,043
- The Bushmen?
- And the Bushwomen.

223
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,442
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

224
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,683
I notice you're eating
a poppy seed muffin there.

225
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,479
Yeah, I eat these muffins
all the time.

226
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,564
Well, you know what opium
is made from.

227
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,560
Poppies!

228
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,438
Welcome back.
Talking with Jerry Seinfeld.

229
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,916
Jerry, let me ask you,
I saw some people back there...

230
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,159
...they look lik e family. Is that family?
- I got some family backstage.

231
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:15,680
My family's nuts. They're crazy.

232
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,758
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

233
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,963
My Uncle Leo,
I had lunch with him the other day.

234
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,197
He's one of these guys
that anything goes wrong...

235
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,641
...he blames anti-Semitism.

236
00:11:23,847 --> 00:11:26,884
Know what I mean? The spaghetti's
not al dente? Cook, anti-Semite.

237
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:28,924
- Right there, yeah.
- Loses a bet on a horse?

238
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:32,636
- Secretariat, anti-Semitic.
- Even the horse... Even the animal.

239
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:35,116
The High Holy Days in the temple?
Rabbi, anti-Semite.

240
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:45,877
Listen to this. My Uncle Leo broke up
with his girlfriend because of my bit.

241
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,925
She thought it was funny, so he
accused her of being an anti-Semite.

242
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,476
They had a fight, now he's
moving back to his apartment.

243
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:54,115
Know what this means? My parents
are gonna go back to Florida.

244
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,640
What?

245
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,638
What number is this?

246
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:00,757
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

247
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,883
Kramer, my parents are gonna have to
move back to Florida. Isn't that great?

248
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:07,845
Yeah, well, I'm really happy for you.

249
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:12,077
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man.
What's wrong?

250
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:15,160
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath.

251
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,280
- No good?
- It's disgusting.

252
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,201
I'm sitting there in a tepid pool
of my own filth.

253
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,883
All kinds of microscopic parasites
and organisms...

254
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,277
...having sex all around me.

255
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:32,164
Well, you used to sit
in that hot tub.

256
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:36,155
Jerry, that was super-heated water.
Nothing could live in that.

257
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,801
- Chicken?
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,325
Well, this you're not gonna believe.

259
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,166
I found out why
I was testing positive for opium.

260
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,636
- Poppy seeds.
- Poppy seeds.

261
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,678
- Yep, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,678
- Here you want some chicken?
- Yeah, thanks.

263
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:53,606
So I'm gonna get tested again later.

264
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:58,158
Hopefully I'll get my job back,
and I will be on my way to Africa.

265
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,963
Hello, Newman.

266
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:08,885
Hello, Jerry. Well, I may have
a solution to our little problem.

267
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,757
- Elaine, will you excuse us?
- Oh, come on, Newman.

268
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,401
I have a private matter to discuss
with my fellow tenants.

269
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,046
If you don't mind...

270
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:18,999
- Jerry...
- Look, sister, go get yourself...

271
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,158
...a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it.

272
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,080
All right. Now, here's the lowdown.
Through a certain connection...

273
00:13:26,247 --> 00:13:28,807
...l've been able to locate
some black-market showerheads.

274
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,123
They're all made
in the former Yugoslavia.

275
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:34,319
And from what I hear, the Serbs
are fanatic about their showers.

276
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,722
Not from the footage I've seen.

277
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,006
Nevertheless,
sometime this afternoon...

278
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,239
...behind the market diner,
an unmarked van will be waiting.

279
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,967
I'm expecting the call at any time.

280
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,402
- Are you in?
- I'm down.

281
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,080
Jerry?

282
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:02,519
So, Georgie,
we have some big news for you.

283
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:05,520
- Big news?
- We're moving to Florida.

284
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,600
What?

285
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,196
You're moving to Florida?

286
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:13,757
That's wonderful. I'm so happy!

287
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,282
For you! I'm so happy for you!

288
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,836
Oh, what do you need
this cold weather for?

289
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,321
Has nothing to do with weather.

290
00:14:20,487 --> 00:14:22,523
- It's because of the Seinfelds.
- What do you mean?

291
00:14:22,727 --> 00:14:25,241
They don't want us there,
so we're going.

292
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:29,643
We're moving right into
Del Boca Vista!

293
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,917
- So you're moving there for spite.
- Absolutely.

294
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,886
No one tells Frank Costanza
what to do!

295
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:40,477
That's right! Who the hell are they?
How dare they?

296
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,566
So, Georgie, are you gonna
come to visit us?

297
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:49,720
Oh, every chance I get.

298
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,406
Jerry, Jerry!
I'm busting, I'm busting!

299
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,246
- Well, what's going on?
- My parents are moving to Florida!

300
00:14:57,447 --> 00:14:59,961
- Are you kidding?
- Can you believe it? It's happening!

301
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,516
It's finally happening, I'm free!

302
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,400
- Well, where are they moving to?
- Del Boca Vista.

303
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:07,245
That's where my parents
are gonna live.

304
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,039
- I know.
- We can visit together.

305
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:10,521
Every five years!

306
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:15,679
- That's incredible.
- You know why they're moving there?

307
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,565
- Why?
- To spite your parents.

308
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,001
- To spite my parents?
- Yeah.

309
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,727
- Your parents are crazy.
- I know, they're out of their mind.

310
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,280
- I don't believe it.
- Fantastic.

311
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,603
- My parents are moving back too.
- Beautiful!

312
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:31,521
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here.
I'm not ready to go back to Florida.

313
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:35,720
He was getting along so well
with that woman. What happened?

314
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,361
Hello?

315
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:42,997
- This is Frank Costanza.
- What do you want?

316
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,886
You think you can k eep us
out of Florida?

317
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:49,443
We're moving in
lock, stock and barrel.

318
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,325
We're gonna be in the pool.

319
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:53,318
We're gonna be in the clubhouse.

320
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,206
We're gonna be all over
that shuffleboard court...

321
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:59,916
...and I dare you to keep me out!

322
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:04,042
I'm sorry, we can't go back
to Florida.

323
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,844
I can't believe
I didn't push for this sooner.

324
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,959
You have no idea how your life
is gonna improve as a result of this.

325
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,685
Food tastes better.

326
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,883
The air seems fresher.
You'll have more energy...

327
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,766
...and self-confidence
than you ever dreamed of.

328
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,324
- Hello.
- Hello, Jerry, it's your father.

329
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,880
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Is it all right...

330
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,686
...if we move in with you
for a little while?

331
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,957
- What was that?
- Nothing. A bottle broke, that's all.

332
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,083
What do you mean,
you're gonna move in here?

333
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,755
Because the Costanzas
are moving in to Del Boca Vista.

334
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,527
- But it's a big complex.
- You don't understand.

335
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,922
You gotta have a buffer zone.

336
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:48,598
All right, fine. Come over here.

337
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,760
What?

338
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,487
They're not going back to Florida.

339
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,763
- They're moving here.
- What? Why?

340
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,197
Because your parents
are going down there.

341
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,757
My buffer zone just went from
1200 miles down to two feet.

342
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:02,916
You gotta do something.

343
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,036
Hey, I'm sorry. You had
your buffer zone for many years.

344
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,596
It's my time to live, baby.

345
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,919
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

346
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,645
You're killing independent Jerry.

347
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,596
I gotta go see my Uncle Leo.

348
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,406
I think he may have made
a big mistake.

349
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,044
- Move back with Lydia?
- Come on.

350
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:26,799
You're lucky to have anybody.

351
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:30,918
Last week you told me I was
in my prime. I should be swinging.

352
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,595
Swinging?
What, are you out of your mind?

353
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,485
Look at you. You're disgusting.

354
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:37,801
You're bald. You're paunchy.

355
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,204
All kinds of sounds are emanating
from your body 24 hours a day.

356
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:45,122
If there's a woman that can take your
presence for more than 10 seconds...

357
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:47,357
...you should hang on to her
like grim death.

358
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,836
Which is not far off, by the way.

359
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:53,596
- But she's an anti-Semite.
- Can you blame her?

360
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,962
You don't think he minds
us staying here, do you?

361
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,920
Why would he mind?
We're his parents.

362
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,125
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hello.

363
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,246
- Jerry's not here?
- No.

364
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:11,644
- Oh, my God.
- What?

365
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,923
A poppy seed.

366
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,237
It must have been in the chicken.

367
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:18,159
Oh, I'm dead.

368
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,283
I'm going to the doctor's
in a half an hour.

369
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:22,762
- Why?
- It's a long story.

370
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,037
Just a second.
I have to go to the bathroom.

371
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,037
Wait. What are you gonna do
in there?

372
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:30,686
What am I gonna do
in the bathroom?

373
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:31,882
You gotta do me a favour.

374
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,841
- Elaine, I really have...
- Hold on a second, Mrs. Seinfeld.

375
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,242
I need your sample.

376
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,806
You want my urine?

377
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,123
I need a clean urine sample
from a woman.

378
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:44,000
- I don't know.
- Oh, please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?

379
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,799
Well, what am I gonna do it in?

380
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,805
- Well, one of those glasses.
- Jerry's glasses?

381
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:54,046
Oh, yeah. He won't mind.
Come on, you're his mom.

382
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,801
I could... Should I use a coffee cup?

383
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,640
- Yeah, coffee cup's fine.
- Or maybe I could use a juice glass.

384
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,923
Yes, yes. Fine, fine.
A juice glass. It's perfect.

385
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,402
- This one is kind of scratched.
- It doesn't matter.

386
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,639
- All right. How...? A milk glass.
- A milk glass, a juice glass.

387
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:11,640
- Any glass, just pick a glass.
- Jerry really doesn't...

388
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:14,685
...wash these very well.
- Mrs. Seinfeld, choose a glass.

389
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,242
Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld.

390
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,279
All right. I got everything here.

391
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,244
I got the Cyclone F series...

392
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:25,405
...Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm
Superstream, you name it.

393
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,006
What do you recommend?

394
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,562
- What are you looking for?
- Power, man, power.

395
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:31,001
Like Silkwood.

396
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:34,045
- That's for radiation.
- That's right.

397
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,078
Now, what is this?

398
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,278
That's the Commando 450.
I don't sell that one.

399
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,239
No, that's what we want,
the Commando 450.

400
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,041
No, believe me. That's only used
in the circus for elephants.

401
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,044
- Just give it to us.
- We'll pay anything.

402
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,323
- Give me the money.
- We've got the...

403
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,001
- What about Jerry?
- He couldn't handle that.

404
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,441
He's delicate.

405
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:55,719
It's nice being back at Leo's.
Jerry's place was too small.

406
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,679
First Leo breaks up,
then he goes back.

407
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,838
What the hell's going on?

408
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,998
- Who is it?
- It's the super.

409
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,285
We're installing new low-flow
showerheads in all the bathrooms.

410
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:07,846
Low-flow?

411
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,123
I don't like the sound of that.

412
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,124
So as a result of your test
being free of opium...

413
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,563
...I am reinstating you.
- Oh, yes!

414
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,683
What a load off.

415
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,082
So when are we going to Africa?

416
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,805
I'm afraid I can't take you.

417
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,360
What? Why not?

418
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:29,564
Elaine, according to your
urine analysis, you're menopausal.

419
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:33,636
You have the metabolism
of a 68-year-old woman.

420
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,480
But I wanted to see the Bushmen.

421
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,599
Oh, and one more thing.

422
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,166
You may have osteoporosis.

423
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,642
- Well, it's been a great visit.
- Jerry, I'll tell you.

424
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,844
First thing I'm gonna do when
I get back to Florida is take a shower.

425
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,402
At least the Costanzas
changed their mind about moving.

426
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:52,758
- They couldn't bear leaving George.
- George must be happy about that.

427
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,198
You have no idea.

428
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:59,077
Take my swim trunks.
I won't need them.

429
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:01,881
What does he want
with your swim trunks?

430
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,839
Why should they go to waste?

431
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,764
Oh, yeah.
