1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:03,881
Why are people surprised...

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:07,682
...when someone
gets hit with a golf ball?

3
00:00:07,847 --> 00:00:09,599
Have you watched
the tournaments on TV?

4
00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:12,645
You got 600 people
crowding around a hole that big...

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,684
...and no one believes it
when a Titleist...

6
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,599
...bounces off someone's coconut.

7
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:20,282
You know, you throw a rock into
a crowd, that's considered terrorism.

8
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:24,725
But if you have a nice follow-through,
you know, that's golf.

9
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,283
I'm always impressed
with the golf cameraman...

10
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:31,235
...whose job it is to follow the golf ball
when it's in the sky.

11
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:34,524
It's a little white ball doing 100 miles
an hour on a white background.

12
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:36,882
"I got it. I lost it. I got it. I lost it."

13
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:39,607
Why bother? Aim the camera
at the sky. Aim it at the ground.

14
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,678
Take a ball out of your pocket.
Throw it down.

15
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:44,042
Who's gonna know
where the hell it came from?

16
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:50,039
How did you lock your keys
in your car?

17
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:51,799
How? Because I'm an idiot.

18
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:55,283
- Why didn't you get a locksmith?
- I was going to.

19
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:58,996
Then I found out the Auto Club has
free locksmith service, so I signed up.

20
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,727
Just waiting
for the membership to kick in.

21
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,965
How long has your car been sitting
in the Yankee parking lot?

22
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:08,716
I don't know. About three days.

23
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,245
Hello, boys.

24
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:16,156
- You're not playing golf?
- Yes, indeed.

25
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:19,160
Calendar says winter,
but the gods of spring are out.

26
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,160
- And the course is open?
- No, no.

27
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:26,677
I sneak in with Stan the Caddy.
We go through the caddies' entrance.

28
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:28,599
- No kidding.
- I'll tell you something else.

29
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:32,362
Stan's advice has transformed
my game. He's never wrong.

30
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:36,805
He thinks eventually I'll have a shot
at making it big on the Senior Tour.

31
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,286
Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.

32
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,406
- Really, you're getting that good?
- Oh, I'm the real deal.

33
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:47,324
Yeah, here, Stan. In here.
There he is.

34
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:50,047
Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.

35
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:51,606
- How you doing?
- Hi.

36
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:52,756
Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,599
- Ready to hit the links?
- You betcha.

38
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,560
- What are those, cotton pants?
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:00,921
What, is it too cold out?

40
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:04,316
Here's what you do.
You bring a lightweight jacket.

41
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,399
That way, the sun comes out,
you play the jacket off the sweater.

42
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:10,445
Oh, that makes sense.
That's a good call, Stan.

43
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,040
All right. We'll see you later.

44
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:14,198
- Yeah, we'll see you.
- See you.

45
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,203
- Stan the Caddy.
- Stan the Caddy.

46
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:21,276
Elaine?

47
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:24,246
Hi.

48
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:28,036
Oh, great. It's the braless wonder.

49
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,879
Who does she think she's kidding?

50
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:32,561
Look at her,
she's totally out of control.

51
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:35,400
I was thinking, "That woman
looks like Elaine Benes."

52
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,035
Yeah. What have you been up to?

53
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:40,846
- Just been hanging out.
- I see.

54
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,237
Listen, I'm having a birthday party
tomorrow evening.

55
00:02:43,407 --> 00:02:45,875
- I'd love it if you came by.
- Oh, tomorrow.

56
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,685
- I don't know if I can.
- No?

57
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:52,682
- No, I'm just really, really busy.
- Oh, that's too bad.

58
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,758
Well, I hope you can
get me a gift anyway.

59
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,524
- George.
- Mr. Wilhelm.

60
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,721
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but Mr. Steinbrenner and I...

61
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,924
...want you to know we appreciate
all the hours you've been putting in.

62
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,123
Oh, and confidentially...

63
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:14,962
...Sozonkel, assistant to the general
manager, hasn't been working out...

64
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,436
...and the boss thinks
you're the man for the job.

65
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:20,041
So keep it under your hat.

66
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,959
Assistant to the general manager!
Do you know what that means?

67
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,357
He could be asking my advice
on trades.

68
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,757
Trades, Jerry. I'm a heartbeat away.

69
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:36,355
That's a hell of an organization
they're running up there.

70
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,517
I can't understand why they haven't
won a pennant in 15 years.

71
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,121
And it is all because of that car.

72
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,120
See, Steinbrenner is, like,
the first guy in at the crack of dawn.

73
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,881
He sees my car.
He figures I'm the first guy in.

74
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:51,845
Then the last person to leave
is Wilhelm.

75
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:54,760
He sees my car. He figures
I'm burning the midnight oil.

76
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,725
Between the two of them, they
think I'm working an 18-hour day.

77
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:03,082
Locking your keys in your car is
the best career move you ever made.

78
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,525
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

79
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,042
- Better now.
- Yeah? What happened?

80
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,801
- You know Sue Ellen Mischke?
- Sue Ellen Mischke?

81
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,958
Yeah, the woman I grew up with
in Maryland.

82
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,357
- She moved here last year.
- Sounds familiar.

83
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:18,087
The heiress to the
Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune?

84
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:20,715
- You mentioned her.
- Yes. I ran into her today.

85
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:25,717
This woman has never, not once ever,
as long as I have known her...

86
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,605
...worn a bra.

87
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,327
- That is shameless.
- Well, she's disgusting. She's a pig.

88
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,717
- There's no reason. That's wrong.
- The woman's a pig.

89
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,843
- It's rude.
- All right. There's no point.

90
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,919
- Come on. Come on. We're sorry.
- We're only kidding.

91
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:40,396
You don't understand.
See, she hasn't changed at all.

92
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,161
She stole my boyfriend
when I was in high school.

93
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,966
I was at this party, and I was
dating this really cute guy.

94
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,799
His name was
Tom Cosley, by the way.

95
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,765
And she goes walking by
in this little floozy outfit...

96
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:52,997
...and he follows her
right out the door.

97
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,443
She's your Lex Luthor.

98
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:01,524
Her birthday's coming up, see?
So I decided to get her a little present.

99
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:04,247
- What are you gonna get her?
- A very traditional...

100
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,398
...a very supportive...

101
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,285
...brassiere.

102
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:12,841
- There's nothing subtle about that.
- No, no, she might just think it's a gift.

103
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,726
Have I ever bought you
a jockstrap as a gift?

104
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,445
Hey.

105
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,555
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

106
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,036
I'm thinking of leaving town
with Susan for a few days.

107
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:27,560
Her parents rebuilt the cabin.

108
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:30,560
So you're just taking off from work?

109
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,878
Yeah, well, they won't know.
I got the car there.

110
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,878
Is this a good idea, with you being
on the verge of this big promotion?

111
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,517
My presence in that office
can only hurt my chances.

112
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,321
Sue Ellen Mischk e to see you.

113
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,762
Sue Ellen Mischke?

114
00:05:49,287 --> 00:05:51,482
All right. Send her in.

115
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,278
Hi, Elaine.

116
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,205
Hello.

117
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:58,595
I was in the neighbourhood...

118
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,839
...so I thought I'd stop in
and thank you for your lovely gift.

119
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:06,526
Oh, you're welcome.

120
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,518
Is anything wrong?

121
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:11,361
Well, Sue Ellen, it's...

122
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,802
It's not a top.

123
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,320
It's a bra.

124
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,161
Oh, I know.

125
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,397
Thanks again.

126
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:25,276
This is the life, isn't it, huh, kid?

127
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:28,359
- You wanna check out a swap meet?
- Yeah, maybe.

128
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,722
- Where'd you get that?
- It was on the windshield...

129
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:33,355
...when we came out
of that rest stop.

130
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,919
- Hello.
- Hey, hey, it's George.

131
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:41,725
- I need a favour.
- What's going on?

132
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:44,640
I just remembered. There's a
restaurant near Yankee stadium...

133
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,957
...that puts fliers on all the cars.
- Yeah, so?

134
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:50,802
This is what you gotta do. Go to the
parking lot, take the fliers off my car.

135
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,606
Last time you had me throwing
bread up three floors to you.

136
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,359
Now you want me
to go to the Bronx...

137
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,836
...take fliers off your car.
Where does it end?

138
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:02,159
All right, fine. I'll drive the three hours
each way and take them off myself.

139
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,443
All right. I'll do it.

140
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,480
- Hey, what are you up to?
- Nothing.

141
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,081
You wanna go to the Bronx
and see if there's fliers...

142
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,839
...on George's car?
- Sure.

143
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:15,566
- I could have said just about anything.
- Yeah.

144
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,118
Oh, man, look at this mess.

145
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:29,278
You know what will happen
if they see this?

146
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:30,675
What are we gonna do?

147
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,156
- I don't know.
- Well, we gotta get it washed.

148
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,642
Oh, the keys are locked inside.

149
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,605
Wait a second.

150
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:44,442
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll just snag the lock with this.

151
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,883
There we go.

152
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,002
This is quite a life I lead here.

153
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,679
- George has to be happy about this.
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,716
Oh, my God, Kramer,
is that woman just wearing a bra?

155
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,084
Oh, mama.

156
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,966
Kramer!

157
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,839
My God, are you okay?

158
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:15,077
I got a cut on my head
and I banged my shoulder.

159
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,762
I guess I have to bring his car back up
to the stadium. If it can make it.

160
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,487
- So how did this happen?
- He was staring at some woman.

161
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:24,115
Well, I couldn't help it.
You saw what she was wearing.

162
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,844
- What woman?
- There was a beautiful woman...

163
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,918
...walking down the street
wearing just a bra.

164
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,237
I can't get that image
out of my mind.

165
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:35,041
- Oh, my God.
- What?

166
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:38,199
- Was it a tall woman in a black blazer?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,441
- That's Sue Ellen Mischke.
- Sue Ellen Mischke?

168
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,646
That's the bra I gave her.
She's wearing it as a top.

169
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,444
A woman is walking around in broad
daylight with nothing but a bra on.

170
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:53,246
She's a menace to society.

171
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,162
Hey, you know, my arm really hurts.

172
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,677
I wonder if it's gonna affect
my golf swing.

173
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,163
I got your message.
How's the shoulder?

174
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:08,797
- It's my left arm. I can't swing it.
- Oh, no, not the left arm!

175
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,844
What happens if I can't play
like I was?

176
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,316
What about the tour
and all my dreams?

177
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,086
I got it!

178
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,805
Let's sue her.

179
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,527
- Sue her?
- Yeah, she's loaded.

180
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,962
She's the heiress to the
Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune.

181
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,482
I can't. I learned my lesson
from that coffee company.

182
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,285
Kramer, listen to me.

183
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,881
Listen. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

184
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:31,400
Your dreams have been shattered.

185
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,558
Somebody's gotta be
held accountable.

186
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:37,083
Come on. We'll take her
for every penny she's got.

187
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:41,117
What do you think, Stan?

188
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:44,282
Let's go for the green.

189
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,559
You know a good lawyer?

190
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:49,641
So you're driving in the car.

191
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,401
You're with your friend,
minding your own business.

192
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,319
- Then what happened?
- We saw this woman...

193
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,557
...and she was wearing a bra
with no top.

194
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,683
No top? She didn't have a top on?

195
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:02,203
Yeah, so I got distracted
and I crashed the car.

196
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,846
How would you describe
this woman?

197
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,565
Would you say she was attractive?

198
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:08,436
- Oh, yeah.
- So we got an attractive woman...

199
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,485
...wearing a bra, no top,
walking around in broad daylight.

200
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,239
She's flouting society's conventions.

201
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,796
- She was flouting.
- That's totally inappropriate.

202
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:19,482
It's lewd, lascivious, salacious,
outrageous.

203
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:20,966
It was outrageous.

204
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,800
And she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune.

205
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,318
Could you repeat that?

206
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:29,399
I said, she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune.

207
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,239
Oh Henry!?

208
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,643
That's one of our
top-selling candy bars.

209
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:36,196
It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat.

210
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,245
It's delicious, scrumptious,
outstanding.

211
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,637
- Have you been to a doctor?
- No.

212
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,880
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.

213
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:48,242
Tell him it's for me.

214
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,316
So, what do you think, Jackie?
I mean, we got a case?

215
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:53,240
Like taking candy from a baby.

216
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,439
I think I got it. How about this?

217
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,677
We trade Jim Leyritz
and Bernie Williams...

218
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:04,678
...for Barry Bonds.
What do you think?

219
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,042
Then I have Griffey and
Bonds in the same outfield.

220
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,606
Now you got a team.

221
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,679
I don't know, George.
I'm still worried about this car thing.

222
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,680
- Would you stop worrying?
- Well, what about the fliers?

223
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:19,637
Jerry took the fliers off the car.
I got the whole thing covered.

224
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,840
Come in.

225
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,686
- Wilhelm.
- Mr. Steinbrenner...

226
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:49,077
...I am very concerned about
George Costanza.

227
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,807
- How about a "good morning"?
- Yes, sir. Good morning, sir.

228
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:52,956
Good morning, Wilhelm.

229
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:56,642
Anyway, his car is in the parking lot,
the front end is bashed in...

230
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:59,526
...and there's blood in the car,
and we can't find him anywhere.

231
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:02,599
Obviously, he was in some sort of
a terrible car accident...

232
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,884
...and trouper that he is,
he tried to make it into work, sir.

233
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,117
Wilhelm, listen to me.
I want the stadium scoured.

234
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,845
He could be bleeding in the bullpen.

235
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,601
Everyone on alert.
Check hospitals, clinics, shelters.

236
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,485
- We've gotta find that kid.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,205
- We must find George.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,358
- Find him, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,116
Excuse me. Do you know
the gentleman across the hall?

240
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes. Yes, I do.

241
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,559
Do you know if he'll
be back anytime soon?

242
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,402
No, I don't.

243
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,962
Is there something
I can help you with?

244
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,402
No, I really just needed
to speak with him.

245
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,117
Well, you can wait for him in here
if you like.

246
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:48,196
Well, maybe I will.

247
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,597
- Lf you don't mind.
- No, no, not at all.

248
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,678
- Thanks.
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

249
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,279
What is with these people?
All day long. Come in. Come in.

250
00:13:01,487 --> 00:13:03,796
Mr. Steinbrenner, you know,
we've searched everywhere.

251
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,320
There's no sign of him.

252
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,763
Not even anyone who
remotely fits his description, sir.

253
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,485
Oh, my God.

254
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,638
- Do you know what this means?
- What, sir?

255
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,446
He's dead. Costanza's dead.

256
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:18,360
- No, no, sir. You see...
- As quickly as he came, he's gone.

257
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,722
The poor little guy.

258
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,117
Easy, Big Stein, get it together.

259
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,515
- Okay, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:27,645
Find out where his parents live.
I'm gonna personally notify them.

261
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,958
And line up some candidates
to fill that assistant position.

262
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,685
- Yes, sir.
- We can't grieve forever.

263
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,121
Gotta get back to business.

264
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,562
- Back to business, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,442
Well, buddy, he's taking the case.

266
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:45,486
Jackie Chiles is right on it.
Right on it. He's all over it.

267
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:48,760
- Oh, really?
- Why? What's wrong? Come on.

268
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,646
I don't know. So the woman was
walking around in a bra.

269
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:54,241
I mean, it's no big deal.
You're still driving.

270
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:56,477
You should have been
watching the road.

271
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:58,717
Well, your attitude
has certainly changed.

272
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,400
I don't think it's changed.

273
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,159
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to testify.

274
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:05,080
- I don't know if I can.
- Jerry, you gotta testify.

275
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:06,680
- Kramer, I don't think l...
- Listen.

276
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,079
This is a million dollars we're talking
about, Jerry. This is the big league.

277
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:16,082
- I need you on my team, Jerry.
- Well, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

278
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,676
All right, what's gotten into you?
What's happened?

279
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:23,002
Nothing's happened.

280
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,286
What's this?

281
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:34,326
- No, wait a second. Wait a second.
- Oh, I see. Yes.

282
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,399
Little Miss Candy Bar
paid a visit, didn't she?

283
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,003
- Kramer, it is not what you think.
- I know what I think.

284
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,806
I think you're gaga over this dame.

285
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,197
She's twisted you around
her little finger...

286
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:49,279
...and now you're willing to sell
me and Elaine...

287
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:52,120
...and whoever else you have to
right down the river.

288
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,686
And what about you?

289
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,566
Trying to bilk an innocent bystander
out of a family fortune...

290
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,117
...built on sweat and toil manufacturing
quality Oh Henry! Candy bars...

291
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:03,165
...for honest, hardworking Americans.
- You're just out for sex!

292
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,555
You're just out for money!

293
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,843
- Mrs. Costanza?
- Yes.

294
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:16,281
My name is George Steinbrenner.

295
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,484
I'm afraid I have some very sad news
about your son.

296
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:25,238
I can't believe it. He was so young.
How could this have happened?

297
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,806
He'd been logging heavy hours.

298
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,118
First one in, last one to leave.
The kid was a human dynamo.

299
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:33,006
Are you sure you're talking
about George?

300
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,600
You are Mr. And Mrs. Costanza?

301
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,555
What the hell did you
trade Jay Buhner for?

302
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,242
He had 30 home runs
and over 100 RBls last year.

303
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,159
He's got a rocket for an arm.

304
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:45,841
You don't know what the hell
you're doing!

305
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:48,157
Buhner was a good prospect.
No question about it.

306
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:50,283
But my baseball people
loved Ken Phelps' bat.

307
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:51,880
They kept saying, "Ken Phelps."

308
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,005
I'm not here. Leave a message.

309
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,600
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza.

310
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:59,402
Mr. Steinbrenner's here.
George is dead. Call me back.

311
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,964
- Hello?
- Hey, it's George.

312
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:08,685
- Where have you been?
- What?

313
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:10,838
I just got a bizarre message
from your father.

314
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,237
Steinbrenner's at your house.
They think you're dead.

315
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,796
- Dead?
- And we had an accident with the car.

316
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,003
It's a little crumpled.

317
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,998
- My car's a little crumpled?
- Yeah, yeah.

318
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,681
I didn't know what to do,
so I put it back at the stadium.

319
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,406
Wait a second. Wait a second.

320
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,480
They saw the car and the blood, that's
why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead.

321
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:31,798
I gotta head back right away.
I gotta figure something out here.

322
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,925
- You gotta call your parents.
- I can't. Steinbrenner might be there.

323
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,555
Aren't you gonna tell your parents
you're still alive?

324
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:38,762
They could use the break.

325
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,522
Elaine, do you see this?

326
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,398
Do you see what I'm holding
in my hands?

327
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,325
Yeah, it's a bra.

328
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:56,000
I saw a woman in our hallway
wearing one of these as a top.

329
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,759
What exquisite beauty.

330
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,963
I ran down the hallway
to talk to her...

331
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:03,437
...but the elevator door closed.
It was not to be.

332
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,677
Perhaps our paths
will cross again someday.

333
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,160
What is this all about?

334
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,797
I want to market this item as
a new direction in women's fashion.

335
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:14,277
We're gonna sell this as a top.

336
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,280
Here's the angle. Zelda Fitzgerald...

337
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:18,641
...somebody of the '20s...

338
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:22,641
...wearing this at wild parties,
driving all the men crazy.

339
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:25,322
Have it on my desk
by the end of the week.

340
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,479
Come in. Come in.

341
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,561
Mr. Steinbrenner.

342
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:36,875
Is it you?

343
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:39,677
Yeah, it's me, sir.

344
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,122
It's been a harrowing few days.

345
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:45,916
After the car accident,
I crawled into a ditch.

346
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,725
I managed to survive...

347
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:52,438
...on grubs and puddle water until a
kindly old gentleman picked me up.

348
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,326
Grubs, huh? Gotta admit,
I never tasted one of those.

349
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:57,125
Anyway, as I was lying
in the puddle...

350
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:00,199
...I think I may have found a way
for us to get Bonds and Griffey...

351
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:01,959
...and we wouldn't
give up that much.

352
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:05,403
Don't tell it to me. Tell it to the
new assistant to the general manager.

353
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:06,966
I didn't get the job?

354
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,244
You were dead. We couldn't sit on
our hands. We had to make a move.

355
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,165
But you still have your old job.

356
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,443
Of course we'll have to
dock the time you missed.

357
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:15,881
We're running a ball club.

358
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:19,483
If I give special treatment to you,
everyone will want it. Next, it's chaos.

359
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:22,844
And I can tell you this: Chaos does
not work for the New York Yankees.

360
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:25,043
Not as long
as I'm running the show!

361
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:29,485
So it was the meeting on the street
that prompted you to buy the bra.

362
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,366
- Would you say that was correct?
- Yes.

363
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,199
Yes. That's correct.

364
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:39,836
And you have also brought with you
another bra...

365
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:45,085
...exactly like the one that she
so flagrantly exhibited herself in?

366
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,160
Yes, that's correct.

367
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,557
What was your golf score
the last round you played...

368
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
...before your shoulder was injured?
- Three under par.

369
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,324
Three under par.

370
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:58,677
That's what the professionals shoot,
isn't it?

371
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,485
Well, if they're lucky.

372
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,555
Would you tell this jury...

373
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,037
...exactly what you saw at the corner
of 83rd Street and Columbus?

374
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,517
I don't remember.

375
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,566
Did you or did you not see
the defendant wearing the bra?

376
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,286
I don't know. Maybe.

377
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:23,881
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you
that you are under oath.

378
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,480
Now, I ask you again.

379
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,445
Did you or did you not
see this woman wearing a bra?

380
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,676
All right, I saw her. I saw her.

381
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,755
And she was beautiful in that bra.
I'm crazy about her.

382
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,964
I love her whole free-swinging,
freewheeling attitude.

383
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,446
This court will come to order.

384
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:47,883
- No further questions, Your Honour.
- You may step down.

385
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:50,038
Well, Kramer,
I think we got this wrapped up.

386
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,765
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,724
What's your read, Stan?

388
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:56,447
You're close. You're on the green.

389
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:59,326
You just have to go for the cup.

390
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,876
- What do you mean?
- Have her try on the bra.

391
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:04,356
- See if it fits.
- No, no, no, no.

392
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,961
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

393
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:09,800
- Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
- He's my caddy.

394
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,640
Your caddy? This is a big mistake.

395
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:16,045
Your Honour...

396
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:20,325
...we request at this time
that Miss Mischke try on the bra.

397
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:24,442
This court will come to order.

398
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,677
Go ahead, Miss Mischke, try it on.

399
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:45,123
It doesn't fit. I can't put it on.

400
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:49,322
You damn fools! Look at that.
We got nothing now. Nothing.

401
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:52,320
I've been practicing law for 25 years,
you're listening to a caddy.

402
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,966
This is a public humiliation.

403
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,766
You can't let the defendant
control the key piece of evidence.

404
00:20:56,927 --> 00:21:00,363
Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard.
Of course it won't fit over a leotard.

405
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:04,884
A bra's gotta fit right up against
a person's skin. Like a glove!

406
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,607
Hey, Elaine. How about some lunch?

407
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,478
No, I don't think so.

408
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:22,844
Great job on the Gatsby Swing Top.
It's a winner.

409
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:24,565
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

410
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,797
Sure you don't wanna go?
We have reservations.

411
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,401
Oh, I don't think you'll have
any trouble getting a table.

412
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,437
- Ciao.
- Bye-bye.
