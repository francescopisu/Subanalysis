1
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,918
I love when you're in
the middle of a dream...

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:09,996
...and your alarm goes off, you
incorporate the sound into the dream...

3
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,725
...so you can keep sleeping.

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,526
And you'll make any adjustment
in the dream to do it.

5
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:17,155
I was with Marie Antoinette
in a dream last night.

6
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:19,602
She was on the guillotine,
the blade came down...

7
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:21,678
...her head fell in the basket,
rolled over...

8
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:25,283
...and she started singing
Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man."

9
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,567
And I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off.

10
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:32,116
This is actually happening."

11
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:38,687
It's June! Hey!

12
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:43,479
It's June! It's June, June, June!

13
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:46,765
It's June! June! June!

14
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:51,078
It's June!

15
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:57,165
June! June, baby!

16
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:59,318
- What?
- The catering hall screwed up.

17
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,557
The wedding is delayed until June.

18
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:04,924
- It's like a stay of execution.
- Dead man walking.

19
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,126
This is my lucky day.

20
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:10,039
Well, one out of 20,000.
That's not bad.

21
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:13,085
Yeah. Hey, wait a second.
You know, good news for you too.

22
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:15,602
Susan's friend, Hallie,
broke up with her boyfriend.

23
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,041
- She did?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,641
- So? Wheels?
- In motion.

25
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,957
- The wheels are in motion.
- Beautiful.

26
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:24,004
Hey, if this works out, forget about it.

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,284
Vacations together, movies together,
dinner together.

28
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:29,403
It's almost as good
as if I didn't get married.

29
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,797
Set it up. We can have
dinner at the Friars Club.

30
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:33,918
- The Friars Club?
- I'm thinking of joining.

31
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,760
Pat Cooper said he would
put me up for membership.

32
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:41,125
Hey. Listen, do me a favor, will you?
I got a hot date tonight with Connie.

33
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,959
Wake me up in 20 minutes,
all right?

34
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,595
- Catnap?
- No, no, no, no. This is evolutionary.

35
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:48,600
I've been reading this book
on Leonardo da Vinci.

36
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,156
See, that means "from Vinci."
Did you know that?

37
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:52,521
- Must be some book.
- Yeah.

38
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:56,475
Well, it turns out that the master slept
only 20 minutes every three hours.

39
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,524
That works to two and a half
extra days...

40
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,598
...that I'm awake per week,
every week.

41
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:06,524
Which means if I live to be 80, I will
have lived the equivalent of 105 years.

42
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,200
Not to mention how much
you'll accomplish.

43
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,676
- I got a lot in the hopper.
- Didn't know you had one.

44
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,725
Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.

45
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,121
All right, people...

46
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,324
...l'd like to begin with a hearty
"hail and well met, good fellow"...

47
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,796
...to Bob Grossberg,
joining us from Business Affairs.

48
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,276
Thanks. Hi, everybody.

49
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,517
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire
for you, so to speak.

50
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:30,804
Poor bastard.

51
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,242
You handle all the fact-checking
and copyediting...

52
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,601
...for the new catalog.

53
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:36,441
Could you repeat that?

54
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,915
Why don't you handle
all the copyediting?

55
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:43,318
- I'm sorry. What?
- Copyediting.

56
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:45,685
Never mind.

57
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,075
Elaine, you do it.

58
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,920
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper
made a reservation for me.

59
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:59,806
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld,
but all gentlemen are required...

60
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,878
...to wear jackets
in the dining room.

61
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,605
Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,076
How embarrassing
this must be for you.

63
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,646
You just bought your own dinner.

64
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:11,399
- No problem. Please, follow me.
- Excuse me.

65
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,759
Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy.

66
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,005
Friars.

67
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,042
Hey, not bad.
I kind of like this little thing here.

68
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:21,845
- It's nice.
- This way, please.

69
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,840
Here we go. Here we go.

70
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:27,959
Come on.

71
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,687
I'm telling you, I can coach
in the NFL. It's not that hard.

72
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:33,042
That might be the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

73
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,435
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

74
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,679
No, the stupidest thing was when you
said Steve Kroft from 60 Minutes...

75
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:39,246
...is the guy from Seals & Croft.

76
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:41,523
Watch the videos.
I'm telling you, look at them.

77
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:42,836
Oh, come on.

78
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:49,798
This is nice.

79
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:53,398
- Morning.
- Morning?

80
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,558
- Yeah, what time is it?
- Ten-thirty.

81
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:58,278
See, I got the whole night
ahead of me.

82
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,156
- Boy, that's a nice jacket.
- Oh, I don't believe this.

83
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,682
I forgot to give it back.
It belongs to the Friars Club.

84
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:06,917
Yeah, I like that crest.

85
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:08,440
All right.

86
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:09,801
- Breakfast?
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,639
Most important meal of the day.

88
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:14,275
- This da Vinci sleep is working?
- I'm percolating, Jerry.

89
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:19,202
I tell you, I have never felt so fertile.
I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy.

90
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,561
Listen to this idea:

91
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,287
A restaurant that serves
only peanut butter and jelly.

92
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,439
- What do you call it?
- PB and J's.

93
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,565
- What do you think?
- I think you need more sleep.

94
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,558
So how'd your date
work out with Connie?

95
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,082
I am telling you,
this woman is strange.

96
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:34,919
She never wants to leave
the apartment.

97
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,078
It's like she doesn't wanna
be seen with me.

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,760
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:41,999
- No milk?
- Oh, I'll be back.

100
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:59,079
Jerry?

101
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,316
Hey, Jerry.

102
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,360
Come on, buddy.

103
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:05,516
Kramer.

104
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,121
- Are you awake?
- Why? What time is it?

105
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:09,925
- It's 4.
- Four in the morning?

106
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:11,281
Yeah.

107
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,756
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm bored.

108
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,839
All this free time, I don't know what
to do. You wanna do something?

109
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:19,396
No. Would you just get out?

110
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,922
- Well, you wanna rent a movie?
- No.

111
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,078
Well, what am I gonna do?

112
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,325
- Ready for lunch?
- I'm stuck here...

113
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:31,843
...editing the stupid catalog
because of stupid Bob Grossberg.

114
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,919
Listen, there's something
really suspicious about this guy.

115
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,204
Every time Mr. Peterman
tries to assign him any work...

116
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,006
...he says he can't hear.
And it all gets dumped on me.

117
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,805
- You think he's faking?
- I don't know.

118
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,037
I'd like to try that earpiece,
see if it's real.

119
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:47,765
Hey, Elaine.

120
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,236
Oh, you have a friend.

121
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,406
Just wanted to say hi.

122
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,523
Bob, you know what?

123
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,157
I'm kind of swamped here. Could you
give me a hand with the catalog?

124
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:02,036
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm kind of swamped.

125
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,443
Thank you.

126
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:07,277
I'm having lunch with Mr. P.

127
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,958
I better get going.

128
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,601
Did you see that?
Did you see that, Jerry?

129
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:15,961
- That was him?
- Yes.

130
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,403
- Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
- All right. Listen.

131
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,922
We'll have to do this some other time.
I got work to do.

132
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,566
- See you later.
- All right.

133
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,965
Hey, Bob.

134
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,519
Bob?

135
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,796
Hey, Bobby, over here.

136
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:43,480
Bob?

137
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,558
Oh, Bob?

138
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,839
Bob?

139
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,125
Hey.

140
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,885
- Elaine.
- Hi.

141
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:58,446
I was just in the bathroom.

142
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,837
Okay, Jerry, please, please.
I'm really busy here.

143
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,759
No, no. I was in the bathroom
with Bob.

144
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:05,521
- So what?
- No, I kind of tried to test his hearing.

145
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:07,723
Get out! What did you do?

146
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:10,924
I snuck up behind him at the urinal,
tried to see if he could hear me.

147
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:15,561
- And?
- Well, he flinched sort of.

148
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,319
What do you mean, sort of?
What did he do?

149
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,557
Well, he kind of moved his head,
you know?

150
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,604
But it might have been
on the zip-up.

151
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:25,561
- So you don't know anything?
- Actually, no.

152
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:28,400
- All right. Good job.
- Right.

153
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:33,846
Come in.

154
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:40,559
Last night, huh? Was that something
or was that something?

155
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,763
- That was something.
- She's great, isn't she?

156
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:44,679
Fantastic. Fantastic woman.

157
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,281
- I told you.
- I'm nuts about her.

158
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:49,005
Do you think she could be an it?

159
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:51,119
- She could be.
- We might have an it!

160
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,803
- "Lt" written all over her.
- She's got everything.

161
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,435
She's intelligent, smart,
got a great sense of humor.

162
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,167
- I don't know. I didn't really talk to her.
- She's smart.

163
00:07:59,327 --> 00:08:01,716
- You take my word for it.
- Whatever.

164
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:03,559
We could be like the Gatsbys.

165
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:06,036
Didn't they always have
a bunch of people around...

166
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,198
...and they were all best friends?

167
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,198
- That doesn't sound right.
- No.

168
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,835
Tonight she's got tickets
for that show she's working on...

169
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:15,567
...The Flying Sandos Brothers.
- Flying Sandos, beautiful.

170
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:16,921
Great, 7:30, all right?

171
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,759
- Walk me down to the Friars.
- Sure.

172
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:22,442
So, Jerry, there's an empty apartment
in my building.

173
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:25,565
If you and Hallie want,
we could try to hold it maybe.

174
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,045
- It's not here.
- What?

175
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,198
The jacket. It's not here.
It's gotta be here.

176
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,397
Oh, boy.

177
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,127
Thanks for that 4 a.m.
Wake-up call last night.

178
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:37,879
Where the hell is that jacket?

179
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:41,077
- Oh, the one with the crest?
- Yeah.

180
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:44,080
- That's at the cleaner's.
- The cleaner's? How did it get there?

181
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:45,726
Well, I borrowed it last night...

182
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,037
...and it got a little dirty.
- Great.

183
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:52,280
Somehow I dozed off
and woke up in a pile of garbage.

184
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:56,042
Somehow? You've had an hour
and 20 minutes sleep in three days.

185
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:59,517
Well, so look, the cleaner's said
you could pick it up tonight at 6.

186
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,520
All right. I just hope I can get it
to the Friars before the show.

187
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:04,757
Won't be a problem,
don't worry about it.

188
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:07,645
Hey.

189
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,721
- Hey!
- Watch out, boy.

190
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,918
Can you give us a hand
with some of these boxes, Bob?

191
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,119
Bob?

192
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,319
I want you so bad, Bob.

193
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:32,196
You turn me on so much.

194
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:35,959
You're so damn sexy.

195
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:39,156
I'm starting to unbutton.

196
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:43,005
Anything getting through? Bob?

197
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,357
- They perform all over. Europe mostly.
- European tours.

198
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,165
- Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Jerry.

199
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:54,682
- You're wearing the jacket?
- It wasn't ready on time.

200
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:57,407
- I have to return it after the show.
- Sure, sure, sure.

201
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,922
How about these seats?
Are these fantastic, huh?

202
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:01,361
I feel like Lincoln.

203
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,882
Well, let's hope this evening
turns out a little better.

204
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,798
So are you sure you don't
wanna go to the movies?

205
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,561
No, Cosmo. I like
just being here with you.

206
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,558
Well, it's...

207
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,441
It's a bold adventure, huh?

208
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,684
This is risky business, huh?

209
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,439
I'm all atwitter.

210
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:10,684
How would you kind people like
to lend me a hand with our next trick?

211
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:13,884
- I don't think so.
- Please, take off your jacket.

212
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,878
- My jacket?
- Yes, the jacket.

213
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:18,766
What do you say,
ladies and gentlemen?

214
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:20,121
You can't argue with that.

215
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:21,276
- Come on.
- Do it.

216
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,280
- Come on, Jerry. Do it!
- Give him the jacket. Go ahead.

217
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,563
All right.

218
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:33,236
And now we say
the magic word:

219
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,965
And we make it disappear.

220
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,317
Oh, Cosmo.

221
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,045
Cosmo.

222
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,084
Oh, Cosmo.

223
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:52,043
Honey, can you move a little?
This hurts.

224
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,237
Cosmo?

225
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:58,364
Oh, my God. Cosmo, wake up.

226
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:01,718
Cosmo?

227
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,197
Oh, my God. He's dead.

228
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,198
He's dead.

229
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:18,765
Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie.
You gotta help me.

230
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,566
Some guy dropped dead
on top of me.

231
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:25,356
I can't call the cops
because Joey might find out.

232
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,876
I can't. I'm stuck.
You gotta help me.

233
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:40,284
This is very exciting.
The inner sanctum here.

234
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,801
Hi, I was in the audience earlier.
You threw my jacket.

235
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:47,606
- I just wanted to pick it up.
- Jacket?

236
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,042
- What jacket?
- I had a jacket with a crest on it.

237
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,198
You came into the audience,
you threw it away.

238
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:55,480
Are you sure it was me?

239
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:59,526
- It was you or one of your brothers.
- Well, two of them have left already.

240
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,806
- No.
- It doesn't even belong to me.

241
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:09,277
- It belongs to the Friars Club.
- Sorry.

242
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,006
- Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
- I'm sure it won't.

243
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,998
Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.

244
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,283
There you go.
She's gonna get the jacket back.

245
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,438
So let's go get some coffee, huh?

246
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,839
- I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
- Oh, that's too bad.

247
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,281
Yeah, we'll do it another time.

248
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,598
George, we'll go.

249
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:46,317
Broke a shoelace today.

250
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:47,966
I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.

251
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:50,806
Okay.

252
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,558
So, what color?

253
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,319
Brown.

254
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:01,606
Maybe a black.

255
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:05,282
- More coffee?
- No, check. Please.

256
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,999
That nut is always up to something.

257
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:03,320
Hey! Hey!

258
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,797
Mama!

259
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,684
No!

260
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:13,246
Help!

261
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,920
Help!

262
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:21,517
Elaine, I think I've been working you
a little too hard lately.

263
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:27,799
So I have two tickets for you to The
Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.

264
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,037
It is a real hoot.

265
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,960
- Well, thank you, Mr. Peterman.
- The tickets are for tonight...

266
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:37,245
...so you and Bob can knock off
a little early so you both can get ready.

267
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,085
Mr. Peterman, you...

268
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,203
There's no need to deny it, Elaine.

269
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,437
I heard every word you said.

270
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,561
And I know you wouldn't be
just having fun with his handicap.

271
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:52,285
That kind of cruelty
would be grounds for dismissal.

272
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:54,683
Of course, Mr. Peterman.

273
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,476
Tell him I'll come down
and talk to him. Okay. Bye.

274
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:00,200
Well, that was the Friars Club.

275
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,165
Think they're gonna let
a jacket stealer join? I don't think so.

276
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,318
They're gonna charge me
$800 for the jacket...

277
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,000
...and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper.

278
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,078
What kind of show
is that Sandos Brothers?

279
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:12,718
They take your jacket and just
throw it? I never heard of that.

280
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,639
It was a little unusual.

281
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,958
So Susan and I were thinking dinner
at our house Saturday night.

282
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,721
- Just the four of us.
- No, I don't think so.

283
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,966
- Why not?
- I don't know. I'm a little turned off.

284
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,598
Come on,
what are you talking about?

285
00:16:26,767 --> 00:16:28,758
I'm... I'm kind of soured.

286
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,406
- You're soured?
- Yeah, I'm soured.

287
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,398
- Don't be soured.
- I'm sorry. I'm soured.

288
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,319
Are you kidding?
We were getting along.

289
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:35,715
Where is this coming from?

290
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:38,447
Frankly, I didn't think she was
concerned about my jacket.

291
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:41,041
What are you talking about?
She's very concerned.

292
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:44,244
- She said she was gonna get it back.
- Yeah, we'll see.

293
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,921
If she gets it back, then you'll have
no reason to be sour.

294
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,406
You'll de-sour, right?

295
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:51,477
- I'll try and de-sour.
- That's not good enough.

296
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:54,036
You don't try and de-sour.
You have to sweeten too.

297
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,846
I'll try. I'll try and de-sour
and sweeten.

298
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,597
I wanna get it back
to when we were the Gatsbys.

299
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,359
- I still don't know what that means.
- Yeah.

300
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,006
God.

301
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,603
- Oh, my God, what happened to you?
- She tried to kill me, Jerry.

302
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,406
- Who?
- Connie!

303
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,842
- What did she do?
- I don't know.

304
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:17,079
But I woke up
in the Hudson River in a sack!

305
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,324
I think she drugged me. But she's
a murderer, and I'm calling the cops.

306
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,840
Why would she try and kill you?

307
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:26,966
Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't
want anybody else to have me.

308
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,566
- Hey, there's Uncle Miltie.
- Yeah, it is.

309
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,001
And there's David Steinberg.

310
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:38,045
- The comedian or the manager?
- The manager.

311
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,126
Hey, there's Pat. Hey, Pat.

312
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:42,403
What went wrong?
What's the matter with you?

313
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,479
- What, are you a kleptomaniac?
- I forgot to take it off.

314
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,126
You forgot to take it off?

315
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:51,326
Oh, you go into a department store,
you put a suit on and walk right out.

316
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,523
- What, are you some sort of an idiot?
- I'm sorry.

317
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,917
- Where's the jacket?
- One of the Gypsies took it.

318
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:57,315
Oh, the Gypsies took it.

319
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,398
Of course,
New York has a lot of Gypsies.

320
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:02,479
- On every block, there's a Gypsy.
- Well, it's true. I saw it.

321
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:05,036
Excuse me, are you an entertainer?

322
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,641
- Are you in show business?
- No, l...

323
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,799
Then what am I talking to you for?
Bring the jacket back tomorrow.

324
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:12,559
All right.

325
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:17,076
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Look at that guy.

326
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,807
Isn't that guy from the show?
He's wearing the jacket.

327
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,126
- Oh, my God. You're right.
- Come on.

328
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,926
Wait a second.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

329
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,043
- Are you members?
- I'm a prospective member.

330
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,437
Until then, that's the way out.

331
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,120
- That guy has my jacket.
- Let's go.

332
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:35,517
Excuse me. The guy is wearing
a jacket that my...

333
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:36,676
- Come on.
- Let's go.

334
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:38,326
- Lf I could talk to the guy...
- Hey!

335
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,202
These seats are fantastic.

336
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,835
It was nice of Mr. Peterman
to give us these tickets.

337
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,601
Yeah. Yeah, it was nice.

338
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,719
Yeah...

339
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,963
...we got our own little private box
here, don't we?

340
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:58,039
Get off of me. Stop it.

341
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:01,085
Stop it. Get off of me!

342
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:08,400
Get ahold of yourself!
Bob, get ahold of yourself!

343
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:21,678
I don't know how that guy
gave us the slip.

344
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,166
He probably went out the back.

345
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,804
Hey, it's you.

346
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,925
- That's my Friars Club jacket.
- No, it is not. This is my jacket.

347
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,284
No, no, that's my jacket. Give it back.
Come on. I need this jacket.

348
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,401
I wanna join.
I need it to become a member.

349
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:38,920
Help! Help!

350
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,763
What is he yelling about?
They're stealing.

351
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,599
I can't believe it.

352
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,837
- Hey, George, you know what?
- What?

353
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,475
I think this crest is different.

354
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,644
It's got a moose on it.

355
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,280
- Moose?
- Yeah.

356
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,844
- I don't think this is the jacket.
- No, it's not.

357
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:02,521
This is the jacket.

358
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:08,600
She got the jacket back. Thank you.

359
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:12,282
It got dirty, so they wanted to clean it
before they gave it back to you.

360
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:14,165
- That's nice of them.
- That is nice.

361
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,204
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

362
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:19,120
Let's call Susan.
We'll go have coffee.

363
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,683
I'll see you at the wedding.

364
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,719
Great. Now she's sour.

365
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,355
- Maybe she'll sweeten.
- She won't sweeten. And I'm bitter.

366
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,719
There they are!

367
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:50,843
Here. Here, we'll leave it
there for you.

368
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:13,881
That's her, officer.

369
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,765
Kramer. Oh, my God.
I thought you were...

370
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:18,600
What, sleeping with the fishes?
I guess I woke up.

371
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:21,804
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.

372
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,923
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

373
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:27,124
- Get your coat. We gotta take you in.
- Can I call my lawyer?

374
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,164
Okay. Go ahead.

375
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:36,283
Meet me at the police station. They're
arresting me for attempted murder.

376
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:39,484
- Attempted murder? Of who?
- This guy, Kramer.

377
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,922
- Cosmo Kramer?
- Yeah, that's right.

378
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:45,396
I don't want nothing to do with it.
