380
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:06,723
You know, like mechanic's pants,
a shirt that said "Tony."

381
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:09,276
Let me ask you,
have you ever seen a case like this?

382
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,484
All the time. The mechanic forms
an emotional attachment...

383
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,196
...thinks he's gonna lose the car.
He panics and does something rash.

384
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:18,399
I'm gonna ask you
some personal questions.

385
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,604
I'm sorry if I touch a nerve,
but I think it will help with the case.

386
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:24,687
Had you been
taking good care of the car?

387
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:26,883
- Had I been taking...?
- Did you leave the AC on?

388
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:30,517
Do you zip over speed bumps?
Ride the clutch? Things like that?

389
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:34,396
What does it matter? It's my car.
I can do whatever I want with it.

390
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:38,085
Not that I would think
of doing such things.

391
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:41,956
All right, Mr. Seinfeld,
we'll let you know if we find anything.

392
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:43,845
I gotta be honest with you.

393
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,599
These cases never end up well.

394
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,927
Well, whatever you can do.
Thanks.

395
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:55,602
Mr. Wilhelm, about the project, sir.

396
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,246
That's what I came to talk about.

397
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:00,479
Great job, George.
You really nailed it.

398
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,723
- I did?
- Yes, I read through it this morning.

399
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:07,675
I couldn't have done it better myself.
I turned it over to Mr. Steinbrenner.

400
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,280
Good work, George.

401
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,276
I don't get it.

402
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,007
He assigns it to you,
you don't do it...

403
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,441
...somehow it gets done...

404
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:19,882
...and now he's telling you
what a great job you did.

405
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,561
Maybe somebody did it
and didn't take credit for it.

406
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,764
Maybe it was already done and
didn't need doing in the first place.

407
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,647
I have no idea who did it...

408
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,196
...what they did,
or how they did it so well.

409
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:32,561
And you know what?

410
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,639
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.

411
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:40,003
The gardener did a nice job planting
the rose bushes, didn't he, dear?

412
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,045
You planted the rose bushes, dear.

413
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,877
- I did?
- Yesterday. You remember.

414
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:49,719
That's right.

415
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,641
- Oh, what's for dinner?
- We just ate.

416
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,719
Did you forget
to take your medicine?

417
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,527
The point is,
however it got done, it's done.

418
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,917
So any luck with the car?

419
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,315
No, the police have no leads.

420
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:08,921
And I just found out today
my insurance doesn't cover it.

421
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,884
- Why not?
- They don't consider it stolen...

422
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:13,117
...if you wilfully
give the guy the keys.

423
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,606
- Hey.
- Hey.

424
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:16,961
What did the detective say?

425
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,759
They're looking.

426
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,281
I gotta go.

427
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:24,766
- Hello.
- Mr. Seinfeld?

428
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:26,724
- Yeah.
- It's Detective McMahon.

429
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,765
I'm at the warehouse on pier 38.

430
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:32,365
I think you'd better get down here.

431
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,563
Yeah, okay.
They may have found the car.

432
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:36,406
Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

433
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,159
Are there golf clubs in the back?

434
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,477
We really can't tell.

435
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:43,480
You better bring
your service records.

436
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:48,800
Watch where you step.

437
00:23:48,967 --> 00:23:52,482
There's quite a bit of grease.

438
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,239
Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

439
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:56,799
How do you do?
Thanks for coming down.

440
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,605
This is Elaine Benes.

441
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,803
We used to date
but now we're just friends.

442
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:02,639
- I see.
- You know.

443
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,046
I'm sorry to make you go through this,
but we need to make sure.

444
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:07,799
What's going on?
What is this thing?

445
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:11,004
One of our patrolmen
stumbled over this.

446
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,316
Oh, my God.

447
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,883
The block is nearly split apart.

448
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,720
We found the overhead cams
30 feet away.

449
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,923
We can only hope
the body's sold for scrap.

450
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:21,680
Oh, my God.

451
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,326
And we know it's a Saab.

452
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:26,843
The angle on the V6
is definitely a '92.

453
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,966
The model is hard to determine
because the drive train is all burnt out.

454
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,078
What is that smell?

455
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,885
Look at the clutch.

456
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,639
Excuse me.

457
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:40,120
Whoever did this
didn't just dismantle it.

458
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:42,721
I mean, they took their time,
they had fun...

459
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,479
...they were very systematic.

460
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:47,207
They went out of the way
to gouge the sides of every piston.

461
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,756
And the turbo was separated
from the housing...

462
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:52,646
...and shoved right up
the exhaust pipe.

463
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:54,965
Wait a second. Turbo?

464
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,687
- I didn't have a turbo.
- Your car is not a turbo?

465
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,997
No, it's a 900 S.

466
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,522
It's a turbo, Elaine. A turbo.

467
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,166
It's a turbo!

468
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,080
Excuse me.
Did you say "Turbo"?

469
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:12,156
Saab Turbo 9000?

470
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:14,842
Is it midnight blue?

471
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,159
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,716
9999 bottles and cans in the truck

473
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:25,765
9999 bottles and cans

474
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:30,603
At $0. 10 a bottle and $0. 10 a can
We're pulling in $500 a man

475
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,998
9998 bottles and cans in the truck

476
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:37,125
9998 bottles and cans

477
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,721
We fill up with gas
We count up our cash

478
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:44,438
9997 bottles and cans in the truck

479
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:53,120
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry. It's Tony.

480
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:54,716
Tony, where are you?

481
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,447
Oh, look, I just want you to know
that the car is fine.

482
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:58,801
Got her all fixed up.

483
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:02,004
We're in a nice area,
no potholes, no traffic.

484
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,158
So there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

485
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,646
In fact, here.

486
00:26:05,807 --> 00:26:08,002
Somebody wants to talk to you.

487
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,281
Tony, you better
bring that car back.

488
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,960
Nobody's giving anything back.

489
00:26:15,127 --> 00:26:16,401
You tried to take it from me.

490
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:17,761
I don't forget that.

491
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,395
Tony, it is my car,
and I want it back.

492
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,842
Oh, your car?
You want your car back?

493
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,480
- Tony...
- Listen.

494
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:26,877
That registration may have
your name on it, Jerry...

495
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:30,881
...but this engine's running
on my sweat and my blood.

496
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:36,002
Where do I find these guys?

497
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:44,801
- How much gas we got?
- Three quarters of a tank.

498
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,521
Better than we estimated.

499
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:52,957
- Seven dollars and 22 cents better.
- Oh, baby.

500
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,836
- Maybe we could stop for a snack.
- No, that's not in the budget.

501
00:26:57,207 --> 00:27:00,756
Well, the budget changed, you know.
I mean, it might be a good investment.

502
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:03,441
That's not a good investment.
That's a loss.

503
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,800
Hey, you see that car?

504
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,483
It looks like Jerry's.

505
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:11,683
I'm gonna check out
that license plate.

506
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,519
Yeah, those are New York plates.

507
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,518
- Is that Jerry's number?
- I don't know.

508
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:21,441
But that's New York and we're in Ohio.
Those are pretty good odds.

509
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,120
- What are you doing?
- Calling Jerry.

510
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,404
- On what?
- I brought my phone.

511
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,355
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry.

512
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,597
- What's your license plate number?
- What's up?

513
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:35,405
Yeah, well,
I think I spotted your car.

514
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,559
Oh, my God, you're kidding.
Hang on a second.

515
00:27:39,207 --> 00:27:42,563
- It's JVN728.
- Hey, that's it.

516
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,797
That's it.
Hey, look, we got him.

517
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,525
We're driving behind him
in a truck.

518
00:27:46,687 --> 00:27:49,201
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He said he brought it to the country.

519
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,483
We're in the country,
and we're right on his tail.

520
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:53,399
Good work, Kramer.
This is incredible.

521
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,716
Yeah, don't worry, Jerry.

522
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:57,640
We're right on this guy
like stink on a monkey.

523
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,638
I'll check back with you.

524
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,401
Elaine Benes.

525
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,285
Yeah, it's me.
Kramer found the car.

526
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,041
Oh, my God. Where is it?

527
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,163
Somewhere in the country.
They're following him.

528
00:28:08,607 --> 00:28:10,802
- The clubs there?
- I don't know. They're tailing him.

529
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:14,323
- I'm waiting for them to call me back.
- All right. I'm heading over right now.

530
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:20,475
- What's the status?
- Last check-in, they were still on him.

531
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:22,240
Have they called the police yet?

532
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:24,443
- They won't call the police.
- What? Why not?

533
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,404
They'll get in trouble
for using the truck.

534
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,637
- Kramer doesn't want a record.
- Kramer has one.

535
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,160
Not a federal record.

536
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,556
- Kramer?
- Kramer?

537
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:36,080
- What's going on?
- Yeah, nothing.

538
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,441
We're still following him.

539
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,117
Wait a second. He's getting off.

540
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,596
Yeah, he's gonna be going south
on the 135.

541
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:46,201
- Keep following him.
- All right. I'll follow him.

542
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,005
We can't.
We're going north to Michigan.

543
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,604
Yeah, hey, listen, I can't.
It's gonna be taking us out of our way.

544
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,401
- I need those clubs.
- Kramer, I want my car.

545
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,479
- Well, I don't know what to do!
- We got 10,000 deposit bottles here.

546
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,285
This guy could be going
to Arkansas.

547
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,966
Keep following.
Don't let me down.

548
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,005
We can't afford a detour.
Our budget won't hold it.

549
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,566
I don't know what to do, man!

550
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,161
Stay left! Stay left!
Left, left, left. Stay left!

551
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:09,680
- Right! Go right!
- Go south!

552
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,680
All right, all right. I'm getting off.
I'm gonna go on the ramp.

553
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:14,519
I hope you realize
what you've done.

554
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,564
You've destroyed
our whole venture.

555
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:18,240
This ramp is steep.

556
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,604
All my work, my planning, my genius,
all for naught.

557
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,120
We're pulling too much weight.

558
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:25,881
- He's getting away. Take the wheel.
- Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,686
- I'm gonna get something.
- Are you crazy?

560
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,279
Keep your foot on the gas.

561
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,926
Hey, you're not dumping those
bottles back there, are you?

562
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:43,039
Kramer, those have wholesale value.
We can cut our losses.

563
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:45,641
Bottles below!

564
00:29:53,607 --> 00:29:56,405
I love this magnifying glass.
I feel like a scientist.

565
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,842
- Oh, yeah.
- You wanted to see me, sir?

566
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,398
Come in, George. Come in.

567
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:04,843
Wilhelm gave me
this project you worked on.

568
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:06,645
- Yes, sir.
- Let me ask you something.

569
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,605
Having any personal problems?
Girl trouble? Love trouble?

570
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,119
- No, sir.
- What about drugs?

571
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:14,403
Doing some of that crack cocaine?
You on the pipe?

572
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:17,518
- No, sir.
- Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

573
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,326
I got a flash for you, young man.
You're non compos mentis.

574
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,205
You got some bats in the belfry.

575
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,675
What are you talking about?

576
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:27,685
George, I read this report.
It's troubling. Very troubling indeed.

577
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,236
It's a sick mind at work here.
Okay, come on, boys.

578
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:32,204
Come in here.
George, this is Herb and Dan.

579
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:34,676
They're gonna take you
to where you can get some help.

580
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,281
Very friendly people there.
My brother-in-law was there.

581
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,039
Man was obsessed
with lactating women.

582
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:41,277
They cured him.
Although he eats a lot of cheese.

583
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:45,359
But you see... You see, I didn't
write that report. That's not mine.

584
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,358
Of course you didn't.
You didn't write it.

585
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:49,802
I didn't do it! It just got done!

586
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,322
I don't know how it got done
but it did!

587
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:53,602
Of course, it got done.

588
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:55,883
Things get done all the time.
I understand.

589
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:58,402
Your job will be waiting for you
when you get back.

590
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,525
Get better, George!
Get better!

591
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:08,438
Man, I don't understand this.

592
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,360
I ditched every bottle and can,
and we still can't gain.

593
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:13,119
It's like we're...

594
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,679
...sluggish.

595
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:19,556
We collected all those bottles and
all those cans for what? What a waste.

596
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:22,321
I'm really gonna catch hell
for those missing mailbags.

597
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:25,679
Hey, wasn't that a pie stand
back there?

598
00:31:26,287 --> 00:31:27,686
- A pie stand?
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:29,678
Homemade pies, 200 yards back.

600
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,963
Oh, come on, pull over.
Pull over, will you?

601
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,241
Where? I don't see it.

602
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:41,285
Well, open the door.
You'll get a better look.

603
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:43,119
I don't see any pie.

604
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:46,521
Kramer!

605
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,918
I'm sorry, Newman,
you were holding us back.

606
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,645
Kramer!

607
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:58,003
Jerry, we've lost the fat man
and we're running lean.

608
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,158
We're back on track, buddy.

609
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:04,158
Federal employee.

610
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,239
I hate corn.

611
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:01,886
- Hello, stranger.
- Look, I'm sorry to bother you...

612
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:03,526
...but I'm a U.S. Postal worker...

613
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,598
...and my mail truck
was just ambushed...

614
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,645
...by a band of backwoods,
mail-hating survivalists.

615
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,320
You just calm down now.
Calm down.

616
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:12,159
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

617
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:15,524
This farm ain't much,
but you're welcome to what we have.

618
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:20,078
- Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

619
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,726
I just have one rule.

620
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:24,082
Keep your hands off my daughter.

621
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:33,406
Jerry, we got him.
I'm riding his tail.

622
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:36,161
There's no escape.
He's running scared, buddy.

623
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:39,205
- How's the gas situation?
- I got enough to get to Memphis.

624
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:41,246
He's reaching in back.

625
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,160
Keeps grabbing at something.
He's pulling out a gun.

626
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:46,522
- He's got a gun, Jerry!
- Duck, Kramer, duck.

627
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,718
It's a golf club. There's no gun.

628
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,003
He threw a golf club at me!

629
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,919
Those are JFK's golf clubs.

630
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:00,315
Hey, I'm under fire.

631
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,523
I'm under heavy fire here.

632
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:07,478
Jeez, there goes a five-iron.

633
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,439
Stop the truck, Kramer.
Pick up the clubs.

634
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,326
No, don't stop, Kramer.
Keep going. Don't let him get away.

635
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,762
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think he's done.

636
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,724
Oh, no, he's taking out the woods!

637
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,677
You'll have to do
a lot better than that!

638
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,119
What's happening?

639
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,325
This truck is dying.
We're losing him.

640
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:52,319
- I think we lost him.
- Damn it.

641
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:54,398
Can you stop
and pick up those clubs, Kramer?

642
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:56,843
Yeah, yeah, I'll get them.

643
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:38,444
Enjoying that mutton?

644
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:40,241
It's delicious mutton.

645
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:43,126
This is... This is out of sight.

646
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:47,326
I would... I would love to get the recipe.
It's very good.

647
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,366
That cider too strong for you?

648
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,724
No, no, I love strong cider.

649
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:09,766
I'm a big strong-cider guy.

650
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,760
Gonna milk the Holsteins
in the morning, if you'd lend a hand.

651
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:17,606
You know, I don't know much about...
I don't have any...

652
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,327
- I don't think I know much about that.
- Susie will teach you.

653
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:22,998
Just gotta pull on the teets a little.

654
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,885
It's nice having
a big, strong man around.

655
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:34,842
You know, those mailbags,
they get mighty heavy.

656
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,641
I...

657
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,877
I Nautilus, of course.

658
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,164
Can I have some gravy?

659
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:52,000
Steinbrenner had me committed!
I'm in the nuthouse.

660
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,078
I'll be back
same time next week, Pop.

661
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:55,885
They took my belt, Jerry.

662
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,526
I got nothing to hold my pants up.

663
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,318
You gotta come over here now!

664
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:03,445
Just tell him what we talked about,
how I didn't do the project.

665
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,120
George?

666
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,319
I see you're finally
getting some help.

667
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:12,480
Oh, Deena, thank God.
Thank God, you're here.

668
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,921
Listen, you gotta help me.

669
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:15,964
You gotta tell these people
that I'm okay.

670
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,402
You know
that I don't belong in here.

671
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,919
George, this is
the best thing for you.

672
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:27,118
What? No, no, Deena.
Deena, wait! Deena, help!

673
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,481
It's not what it looks like.

674
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,603
Is that little Georgie C?

675
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:33,039
How's the folks?

676
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,516
You still got that nice little car?

677
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,317
- What are you doing?
- Kramer, help me, help me!

678
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:04,398
I told you to keep away
from my daughter.

679
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:09,359
No, Daddy, you'll hurt him.

680
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,199
I love him.

681
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:15,679
Goodbye, Norman! Goodbye!

682
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:26,115
Elaine, you found the clubs.
That's wonderful news.

683
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:28,403
- Where are they?
- Yep.

684
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,559
Let me get them for you,
Mr. Peterman.

685
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,083
I'll be inaugurating them this weekend
with none other than Ethel Kennedy.

686
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,958
A woman whose triumph
in the face of tragedy...

687
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:40,483
...is exceeded only
by her proclivity to procreate.

688
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:55,046
The...

689
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:59,646
The letter of authenticity
is in the side pocket there.

690
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,240
Elaine.

691
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,077
I never knew Kennedy
had such a temper.

692
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,039
Oh, yeah.

693
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:14,560
The only thing worse was his slice.

694
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:20,717
- See you on Monday.
- Have a good game.
