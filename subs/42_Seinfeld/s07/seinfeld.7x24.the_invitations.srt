1
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,883
If wedding invitations
were left up to men...

2
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:09,720
...we'd just drive around
sticking fliers in windshields.

3
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,276
Not even typed up either.

4
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,961
Just magic markers,
xeroxed, you know:

5
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:16,845
"Party."

6
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,322
What's needed
is a divorce announcement.

7
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:24,206
"Mr. And Mrs. Fred Johnson
request the honour of your presence...

8
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:29,919
...at the returning of their daughter
back to Mr. And Mrs. Fred Johnson."

9
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:38,039
- Hi.
- Hi, can I help you?

10
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:41,722
- Yes, we'd like wedding invitations.
- Oh, well, congratulations.

11
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:43,161
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

12
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:44,521
- When's the wedding?
- June.

13
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:49,317
- Late June.
- We have quite a few to pick from.

14
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:52,843
They're arranged in order of price.
The most expensive are in the front.

15
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,599
I don't know, what about this one?

16
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:05,076
To tell you the truth, they haven't
made those for a number of years.

17
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,602
I might have some boxes
in our warehouse in New Jersey.

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,406
- I'd have to check.
- Oh, no. George, that's so ugly.

19
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:11,920
We don't want that.

20
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:15,159
What's the difference?
You just read it and mail it right back.

21
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,522
- These ones.
- Why don't they make them anymore?

22
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:21,475
Well, for one thing,
the glue isn't very adhesive.

23
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,797
It takes a lot of moisture
to make them stick.

24
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,362
So we pick up some Elmer's.

25
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,800
All right.

26
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,884
Do you see what I do for you?

27
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,405
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, George.

28
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:39,641
- Lilly.
- No, Susan.

29
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,844
- No, no, it's Lilly.
- I think I know my own name.

30
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,235
It's Susan.

31
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:48,084
Well, you look like a Lilly.

32
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,480
It's coming, Jerry, it's coming.

33
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,286
- What's coming?
- The day.

34
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,278
The day.

35
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:01,086
We ordered
the wedding invitations today.

36
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,886
Nothing can stop it now, nothing.

37
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,682
It's here. It's happening.

38
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,078
Can I do this? I can't do this.
Look at me. Look at me, I can't do this.

39
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,203
I can't do it.
Help me, Jerry, help me.

40
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:14,801
Just break it off with her.
Tell her it's over.

41
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:16,761
I can't.

42
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,679
- Why not?
- Because I can't face that scene.

43
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,758
You know what kind of a scene
that would be?

44
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:23,885
I'd rather be unhappy for the rest
of my life than to go through that.

45
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:27,801
I can't. I've tried to psych myself up
a million times. I can't go through that.

46
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:29,878
All right, take it easy.
Just take it easy.

47
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,322
- What about a letter?
- A letter?

48
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,443
I write a letter
and then I go to China.

49
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:41,402
I disappear in a sea of people
for, like, six months, a year.

50
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,240
You know,
just while things simmer down.

51
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,799
"Dear Susan, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,958
I made a terrible mistake.

53
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:53,403
I'm really, really sorry."

54
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:57,245
- That's it?
- What, too short?

55
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,523
- Seems a little short, yeah.
- A little short.

56
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,877
You can't go to China.
What about your job?

57
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:04,402
Right. My job.

58
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,876
So write a letter
and move to Staten Island.

59
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:10,039
It's easier to blend into a sea of people
in Staten Island than China.

60
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:13,560
Yeah, yeah. Staten Island.

61
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:17,243
- How do I get the rest of my clothes?
- You come back for your clothes.

62
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:20,285
- I'm not going back in there.
- So forget about your clothes.

63
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,043
Well, I'm not starting up
a whole new wardrobe now!

64
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:28,358
Freedom and no clothes is a lot better
than no freedom with clothes.

65
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,838
If she would just
take a plane somewhere.

66
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,281
And what, hope for a crash?

67
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,522
It happens.

68
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:37,042
Do you know the odds on a crash?
It's a million to one.

69
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:41,321
It's something. It's hope.

70
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:44,006
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey.

71
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,044
Georgie, you know
what I just realized?

72
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,484
The wedding is like a month away.

73
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,480
- Elaine.
- What?

74
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,605
Oh, by the way, what am I gonna
get to be in the wedding party?

75
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,397
- What do you mean?
- Jerry's gonna be best man...

76
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,637
...and Kramer's the usher.
What am I gonna be?

77
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:01,400
I don't think you're anything.

78
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:05,879
Well, I have to be something.
I'm a close friend.

79
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,080
- What about being a bridesmaid?
- Well, those are Susan's friends.

80
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:14,685
- Then how about being an usher?
- All right, I'll ask Susan about it later.

81
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:18,203
You don't ask. You tell.

82
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,278
What about the letter?
Should I think about it?

83
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:25,677
Elaine, if a guy wanted
to end a relationship...

84
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:26,916
...what could he do?

85
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,879
Start smoking.

86
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,239
Smoking.

87
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,682
- Does she hate cigarettes?
- Yes, she hates cigarettes.

88
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,919
But you don't smoke.

89
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,404
No.

90
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:44,126
You know, I think I'm getting
depressed about George's wedding.

91
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,847
- Really?
- Yeah, once he gets married, that's it.

92
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,475
She'll probably get pregnant.
They'll move to Westchester.

93
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,445
- I'll never see him again.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

94
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,280
- Then it'll be just me, you and Kramer.
- No, not me, pal.

95
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,915
I can't keep this up much longer.
I'm sick of being single.

96
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,555
- I'm getting out.
- So it's just gonna be me and Kramer?

97
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,843
Yeah, just you and Kramer.

98
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,406
See you.

99
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,238
Me and Kramer.

100
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:10,642
Hey, buddy.

101
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:14,278
Hey, I thought of
a great invention for driving.

102
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,405
A periscope in a car,
so you can see traffic.

103
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,841
How are you gonna drive...

104
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,316
...while you're
looking through a periscope?

105
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,125
Besides which, it's not a submarine.

106
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:25,243
There's no room for a periscope
on a car.

107
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:28,126
- Oh, you make a higher roof.
- They're not making higher roofs.

108
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,045
Well, why can't you
make a higher roof?

109
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,598
Because it's a stupid idea.

110
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,918
No one's gonna go for it.
Don't you understand? It's stupid!

111
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,285
Stupid. It's stupid.

112
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,120
Hey, hey, hey, look out!

113
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,203
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

114
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,961
Yeah, thanks.

115
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:50,004
Oh, my God. You saved my life.

116
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,886
Shouldn't there be
some kind of reward for that?

117
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,679
You should be careful
crossing the street.

118
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,963
Otherwise you could die,
if that bothers you.

119
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,884
- Well, yeah...
- See? To me, this is a waste.

120
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,118
- What?
- The shirt under your sweater.

121
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,039
It sits in a drawer for three weeks...

122
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:09,358
...and when it finally comes out,
it only sticks up out of your collar.

123
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,718
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
- Jeannie Steinman.

124
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:15,642
- Same initials. How do you like that?
- I like it.

125
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:20,077
Listen, I was talking to Elaine today,
and she said...

126
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,807
...that she would really like
to be an usher at the wedding.

127
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,478
No, out of the question.

128
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:27,638
I don't want any women ushers
at my wedding.

129
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:31,038
And while we're on the subject,
Kramer's not an usher either.

130
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,675
- Why not?
- He doesn't even know my name.

131
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:36,681
- That was an honest mistake.
- No, he's too weird.

132
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:39,281
He'd fall or something.
He'd ruin the whole ceremony.

133
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,837
Yeah, you're probably right.

134
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,919
What are you doing?

135
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:51,966
Since when do you smoke?

136
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,478
I've always smoked.

137
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:00,319
- I've never seen you smoke.
- Oh, yeah, well, big smoker.

138
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,280
I gave it up for a while,
but it was too tough.

139
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:06,962
You know, I don't got the willpower.

140
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:11,678
- Oh, I don't like this one bit.
- Well, I can't stop now.

141
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,886
I'm addicted.
They've gotten a hold on me.

142
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,159
Well, you are gonna have to quit.

143
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:26,685
- Menus?
- No, I know what I want.

144
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,075
- The usual?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,681
- And for you?
- A bowl of Cheerios, not too much milk.

146
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,439
Okay, two bowls of Cheerios.

147
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,160
- You too?
- Yeah.

148
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,200
Hey, did you hear
the bank on the corner...

149
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:46,042
...is offering $100 if you go in there
and they don't greet you with a "hello."

150
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,926
Oh, really? That's nice.

151
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,595
- Come on. What's with you?
- I think I'm in love.

152
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,524
Oh, come on.

153
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,162
No, it's true.
This woman saved my life.

154
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:59,557
I was crossing the street.
I was almost hit by a car.

155
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:00,921
And then we talked...

156
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,442
...and the whole thing
just seemed like a dream.

157
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:06,838
If a guy saved your life,
you'd be in love with him too.

158
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,718
No, this woman is different.
She's incredible.

159
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:13,119
She's just like me.
She talks like me. She acts like me.

160
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:16,836
She ordered cereal in a restaurant.
We even have the same initials.

161
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,356
- Wait, I just realized what's going on.
- What?

162
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,200
Now I know what I've been
looking for all these years.

163
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:24,959
Myself.

164
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:30,598
I've been waiting
for me to come along.

165
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,725
And now I've swept myself
off my feet.

166
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,843
Will you stop it, man?
You're freaking me out.

167
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,725
Jeez.

168
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:46,681
- Hey.
- Hey.

169
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,999
- Wait a second, you didn't say "hello."
- Yes, I did.

170
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,442
No. No, you didn't.
Hundred dollars. I get $100.

171
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,962
- No, no, I said "hello."
- No, no, you said "hey."

172
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,277
Well, "hey" is "hello." Same thing.

173
00:08:57,447 --> 00:09:00,519
The ad said the bank will pay $100
if you're not greeted with a "hello."

174
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,837
You're taking that much too literally.

175
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,963
Now, sir, do you have
any business to transact?

176
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,436
- I wanna speak with the manager.
- He's not here.

177
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,565
Then I'll be back.

178
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,438
- So I'm not gonna be an usher?
- No.

179
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,200
So I'm nothing?

180
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:18,326
Jerry is best man,
Kramer is an usher, and I am nothing?

181
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,241
- Kramer's not an usher anymore.
- What are you talking about?

182
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,159
- You've been demoted.
- Why?

183
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,318
Because you called her
by the wrong name.

184
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,356
But she really looks like a Lilly.

185
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:32,922
Jerry. Hey, Jerry, Susan says
I can't be an usher at the wedding.

186
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:34,520
Yeah, me neither.

187
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,837
George, I wanna bring a date
to the wedding.

188
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,077
- Who?
- I just met her. She's incredible.

189
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:42,045
Oh, this is great!

190
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,325
Now I'm gonna be stuck
at the singles' table with all the losers?

191
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,081
- You can go with Kramer.
- No, no, no.

192
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,681
Weddings are a great place
to meet chicks.

193
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:55,156
I have to be unfettered.

194
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,083
Do you see
what this is turning into?

195
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:01,045
Do I need this?
I have got to get out of this thing.

196
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:04,244
- Did you try the cigarettes?
- Yeah, they made me sick.

197
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:07,479
All right, all right.
Let's get down here.

198
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:10,845
You really wanna get out
of this thing?

199
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,839
- Yeah.
- All right. I got two words for you:

200
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,918
Prenup.

201
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:18,846
Prenup, what does that mean?

202
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,285
- Ask her to sign a prenup.
- What does that do?

203
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,563
Because most women,
when asked to sign a prenup...

204
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:28,241
...are so offended,
they back out of the marriage.

205
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:30,845
They are?

206
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:34,166
- Elaine?
- I wouldn't sign one.

207
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:39,638
Prenup, of course.

208
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,326
- Kramer.
- Get out of here.

209
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,286
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:52,086
Hey, I've been going over the list.
Wanna invite The Drake?

211
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,636
Oh, got to invite The Drake.

212
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,240
Listen.

213
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,478
There's something
that's been on my mind...

214
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:02,435
...and we haven't really talked about it
and it's kind of important to me.

215
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,121
What is it?

216
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,960
Well, I've put a lot of thought
into this...

217
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:10,802
...and I think that I would like you
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

218
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,122
- A prenup?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,204
What's so funny?

220
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:24,284
You don't have any money.
I make more money than you do.

221
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,205
Yeah, give me the papers,
I'll sign them.

222
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,560
A prenup.

223
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,244
Excuse me.

224
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:07,085
Jerry.

225
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,959
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hello.

226
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,083
- Remember I told you about the bank?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:15,319
Well, I went in there
and they said, "hey."

228
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:17,839
"Hey" is the same as "hello."
What do you think?

229
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,838
Yeah, I think it's the same thing.

230
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,967
Oh, big surprise.

231
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,439
- Delivery from Melody Stationers.
- Oh, those are the invitations.

232
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:34,484
- Just sign here.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

234
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:39,204
- See you later.
- Oh, these are so cheap.

235
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:41,483
Don't forget tomorrow.
We're shopping for rings...

236
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:45,356
...so don't make any plans.
And this time we're not skimping.

237
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:48,166
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,204
- Jeannie left?
- Yeah, she's coming to see...

239
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,881
...my act tonight.
- Oh, yeah? Well, that's nice.

240
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:55,641
I'm sure that's right up her alley.

241
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,206
- What's with you?
- Nothing.

242
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:58,516
- Something on your mind?
- No.

243
00:12:58,687 --> 00:12:59,915
- Looks like there is.
- No.

244
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,601
Come on, something's
on your mind. Out with it.

245
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:04,877
I don't like her!

246
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,759
- You don't like her?
- That's right.

247
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:09,964
I don't like her.
I never liked her from the get-go.

248
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,915
- What's wrong with her?
- Everything she thinks, you think.

249
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,396
Everything you think, she thinks.
No, I can't take it.

250
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,798
I can't take it, Jerry.
It's too much. It's too much.

251
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,083
If you can't take her,
maybe you can't take me.

252
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,245
- So that's how it's gonna be?
- That's how it's gonna be.

253
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:27,285
Oh, God help us!

254
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:36,766
Awful.

255
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:22,042
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

256
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,040
I was in here the other day,
and I went up to that teller...

257
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,640
...and he didn't say "hello."

258
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,240
Well, then you are entitled to $100.
That's our policy.

259
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:33,398
Yeah, but he wouldn't
give me the money.

260
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,479
Jim, can I see you for a second?

261
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:39,960
- Yes, can you give me a minute?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,164
He'll be right over.

263
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,315
What is this, oak?

264
00:14:57,367 --> 00:15:00,518
- I think it's pine.
- Pine is good.

265
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,838
Yeah, pine's okay.

266
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:07,961
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,960
Jim, the man here
says he came in the other day...

268
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,436
...you didn't say "hello."
- No, that's not true.

269
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:16,519
I said "hey." You know,
like a friendly greeting, "hey."

270
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,326
- Yeah, but that's not "hello."
- That's a tough one.

271
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,798
Let me bring
some other people in on this.

272
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:27,165
Barbara, Jane, Mike,
can I see you, please?

273
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,326
- How you doing?
- What's happening?

274
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:32,966
What's up?

275
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:37,437
Can you excuse us
for just one minute? Just one minute.

276
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:39,766
Thanks.

277
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,799
How's it going?

278
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,924
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

279
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,600
Sir, have a seat.

280
00:15:56,807 --> 00:16:00,595
Well, we've discussed this.
Here's the feeling.

281
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:03,486
You got a greeting. It starts with an H.
How's 20 bucks sound?

282
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,160
- I'll take it.
- All right, sir.

283
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:23,963
Will you marry me?

284
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:41,359
I would like to propose a toast...
Wait a second!

285
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:43,961
George! George Costanza,
come in here!

286
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,765
- Georgie boy.
- George, big news.

287
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:47,883
- I'm getting married.
- Married? What?

288
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:51,756
September 21 st, first day of autumn.
Leaves changing, beautiful colours.

289
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,155
- All that crap.
- You see?

290
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:55,636
- I kept up my end of the pact.
- Oh, good for you.

291
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,638
- And look, champagne.
- Hey.

292
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,275
- To our future wives.
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:02,005
Yeah.

294
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,166
This has been quite a night.
I could sure use a cup of coffee.

295
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,841
Hey, what's the deal with decaf?

296
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,759
How do they get the caffeine
out of there?

297
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:24,760
- And then where does it go?
- I don't know.

298
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:29,645
That's a shame.

299
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:33,396
- I'll just have a cup of coffee.
- Bowl of corn flakes.

300
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,684
More cereal?
That's your third bowl today.

301
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,317
- You had it for breakfast and lunch.
- Hey. So, what's the deal with brunch?

302
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,478
If it's a combination
of breakfast and lunch...

303
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,480
...how come there's no "lupper,"
or no "linner"?

304
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,926
Hey!

305
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,847
Frank just called me.
Congratulations.

306
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,204
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Look, I'm sorry about before.

307
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:01,484
- I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry.
- Yeah, yeah.

308
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,320
Come on, come on.
What's the matter?

309
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,637
I think I may have
made a big mistake.

310
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,555
- Oh, come on.
- No, all of a sudden it hit me.

311
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:13,206
I realized what the problem is.

312
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,323
I can't be with someone like me.

313
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:17,478
I hate myself!

314
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,156
I need to be with someone
the complete opposite of me.

315
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:23,239
It's too much, Kramer.
I can't take it! I can't take it!

316
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,440
It's too bad you got engaged.

317
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,884
Yeah, too bad.

318
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,244
Hello? Oh, hey, George.

319
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,319
What? Really?

320
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,682
I'll call Elaine.
We'll meet you down there.

321
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:41,077
- What happened?
- They took Susan to the hospital.

322
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,922
- So she was just lying there?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:46,839
- I wonder what happened.
- I don't know.

324
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:49,077
There's the doctor.

325
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,805
Excuse me, are you the husband?

326
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:58,642
- Well, not yet. Fiancé.
- Yes. Well, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,445
She's gone.

328
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:04,606
What's that?

329
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,641
She expired.

330
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,679
Are you sure?

331
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,646
Yes, of course.

332
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,402
So...

333
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:19,795
...she's dead?

334
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:23,481
Yes.

335
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:29,606
Let me ask you...

336
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:35,205
...had she been exposed
to any kind of inexpensive glue?

337
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:39,803
- Why?
- We found traces...

338
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,606
...of a certain toxic adhesive...

339
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,601
...commonly found
in very low-priced envelopes.

340
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,321
Well, she was sending out
our wedding invitations.

341
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,681
That's probably what did it.

342
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,246
We were expecting
about 200 people.

343
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:03,879
Well, thank you, doctor.

344
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,404
She's...

345
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:24,760
...gone.

346
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:27,720
Dead?

347
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:33,762
I'm so sorry, George.

348
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,564
Yeah, me too.

349
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,476
Poor Lilly.

350
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:42,478
- Susan.
- Susan.

351
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,115
- How did it happen?
- Apparently the glue...

352
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:53,404
...in the wedding invitations was...

353
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:56,245
...toxic.

354
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,999
Well, that's weird.

355
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:04,484
So I guess...

356
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:08,199
...you're not getting married.
- Yeah.

357
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,440
But...

358
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,875
- Yeah?
- Well, now I'm engaged.

359
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:18,481
Yeah?

360
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:20,758
Well, I thought
we'd both be getting married.

361
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:24,275
Hey, what can I tell you?

362
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,716
All right.

363
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,238
Well, let's get some coffee.

364
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:32,756
We had a pact!

365
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:43,397
Yes, I'd like to speak
with Marisa Tomei, please.

366
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:49,040
Marisa, hi. It's George Costanza.

367
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:53,638
I'm the short, funny, quirky
bald man you met a little while ago.

368
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:56,162
Yeah, I was just calling
because I wanted you to know...

369
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:59,478
...that I'm not engaged anymore.

370
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,282
Well, she died.

371
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:06,164
Toxic glue
from the wedding invitations.

372
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,566
Well, we were expecting
about 200 people.

373
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:14,682
Yeah. Anyway,
I've got the funeral tomorrow...

374
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:18,675
...but my weekend
is pretty wide open...

375
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,684
...and, you know,
I was wondering... Hello?

376
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:24,439
Hello?
