1
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:07,366
I love when the car place
puts that paper mat on the floor.

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:10,325
Like they're so obsessed
with cleanliness.

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:12,717
They don't even want their shoes
to touch the carpet.

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,242
The mechanic comes out,
he looks like Al Jolson.

5
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:19,082
He's covered in goo from head to toe.
You can't even see him.

6
00:00:19,447 --> 00:00:22,564
I prefer that to when they have the
lab coat, the clipboard, the glasses.

7
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,683
Now you know
you're getting screwed.

8
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,236
"Can I see it?"

9
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:29,205
"You better not.
It's idling quietly right now.

10
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,800
I think it should stay overnight.

11
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:34,039
We want to keep an eye on it,
and want to keep the bill running up."

12
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:42,317
Tell the players that
I reimbursed the trainer...

13
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:43,966
...for the cigarettes and shakes.

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,277
- The players will be reimbursed?
- The trainer.

15
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,244
Tell the players
I reimbursed the trainer.

16
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:50,717
This is the third time
I've had to repeat myself.

17
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,639
- Sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

18
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,399
We're running
a ball club here, George.

19
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,444
You've got to pay attention.

20
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:57,881
I know. It won't happen again.

21
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:00,766
Let me see.
I had an assignment for you.

22
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:04,280
Let me... Let me think here.

23
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,361
Elaine.

24
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:14,801
Hi, Mr. Peterman.

25
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,403
You know what a huge fan
I am of John F. Kennedy.

26
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,080
I do.

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,602
The Peace Corps gave me
my start in this business.

28
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,998
Clothing the naked natives
of Bangtubesh.

29
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,646
The Pygmy pullover.

30
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,521
Sotheby's is having an auction
of JFK's memorabilia.

31
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,645
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

32
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,286
The presidential golf clubs.

33
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,999
To me, they capture that indefinable
romance that was Camelot.

34
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,156
Whatever.

35
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,522
Unfortunately, I will be
out of town with my lady...

36
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:47,598
...and therefore unable
to bid on the lot.

37
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,564
I was hoping you would go
in my stead.

38
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,480
Oh, yeah. I'd be happy to.

39
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:56,959
How much do you want this thing?
How high are you willing to go?

40
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:01,518
I would see no trouble in spending
up to, say, $10,000.

41
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,285
Have my secretary give you a check.

42
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,636
- When you're done, George,
and bring it directly to me.

43
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:15,640
Mr. Steinbrenner is
very interested in this.

44
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,718
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, George.

45
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:21,003
I want you to make this project
a top priority.

46
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,805
I will, sir. Top priority.

47
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,527
- Top priority, George.
- Top priority.

48
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:33,366
So he walks out of the stall.
He's been talking the whole time.

49
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:35,643
- He pulled an LBJ on you.
- LBJ?

50
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,162
Lyndon Johnson used to do that
to his staffers.

51
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,316
- No kidding?
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,398
He'd hold national security
meetings in there.

53
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,957
He planned the Hanoi bombing
after a bad Thai meal.

54
00:02:45,487 --> 00:02:47,205
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

55
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,119
I don't even know
what my assignment is.

56
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,357
Ask him to repeat it.
Tell him there was an echo.

57
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,836
I can't. He's been on me
about not paying attention.

58
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,077
It's too late.
I already told him I heard him.

59
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,076
You know what you do?
Ask him a follow-up question.

60
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:02,319
Tell him you're having trouble getting
started, and you want his advice.

61
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:06,166
Yeah, follow-up question.
That'll work.

62
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:07,602
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

63
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:08,916
- Can I have my keys...
- Yeah.

64
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,156
- Back please.

65
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,602
- You should have come, Jerry.
- We made quite a haul.

66
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,723
- Where did you go?
- Price Club.

67
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:17,606
- Why didn't you take your car?
- Oh, the steering wheel fell off.

68
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,962
I don't know where it is.

69
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,879
What are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

70
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,959
Well, I'm not paying the 5 cents
for that stupid recycling thing.

71
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,482
You don't pay 5 cents.
You get 5 cents back.

72
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:28,636
Read the label.

73
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,877
"Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York.

74
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,480
Refund, 5 cents."

75
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:33,841
- Refund?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,316
Well, what do you think
the hobos are doing?

77
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,160
I don't know. They're deranged.

78
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,282
Listen. Can you give me
a lift back to my place?

79
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:45,917
No, I can't. I've gotta pick up Elaine.
I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.

80
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,282
- All right. I'll see you later.
- All right.

81
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:51,678
- What is this "MI, 10 cents"?
- That's Michigan.

82
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,360
In Michigan you get 10 cents.

83
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:54,721
- Ten cents?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,606
Wait a minute, you mean you get
5 cents here and 10 cents there?

85
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,997
You could round up bottles
and run them to Michigan.

86
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,839
- No, it doesn't work.
- What do you mean?

87
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,042
You get enough bottles...

88
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:06,199
You overload your inventory, and you
blow your margins on gasoline.

89
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,516
Trust me. It doesn't work.

90
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:10,247
You're not talking that Michigan
deposit-bottle scam?

91
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,398
- No, I'm off that.
- You tried it?

92
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,956
Oh, yeah. Every which way.
Couldn't crunch the numbers.

93
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,799
It drove me crazy.

94
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,400
You keep an eye on each other?

95
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,920
- No problem.
- You bet.

96
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:32,320
Are you sure you didn't hear
my car making a funny noise?

97
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,364
I know those two idiots did
something to it.

98
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,961
No, I didn't hear anything.

99
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:40,326
Oh, my God. Look who's here.

100
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:46,005
Sue Ellen Mischke, the braless,
Oh Henry! Candy bar heiress.

101
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:51,161
Well, hello, Elaine, Jerry.

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,079
- Hi, Sue Ellen.
- Hi, Sue Ellen.

103
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,760
I'm surprised to see you here.

104
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,918
Come to catch a glimpse
of high society?

105
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,723
No, no, I'm actually here to bid,
Sue Ellen.

106
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,718
I mean,
that is if anything's to my liking.

107
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:10,035
I'm here to catch
a glimpse of high society.

108
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,801
Well, I hope you find something
that fits your budget.

109
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,879
I hate that woman.

110
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,316
I don't understand.

111
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,555
You fill an 18-wheeler.

112
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,366
No, an 18-wheeler's no good.
Too much overhead.

113
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,757
You got permits,
weigh stations, tolls.

114
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:31,758
Look, you're way out of your league.

115
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,885
I wanna learn.

116
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,515
I want to know why.

117
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,286
Oh, those are handsome.

118
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:46,880
Look at that set.

119
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,720
Yeah, think I might bid on those.

120
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,478
Lot number 745.

121
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,478
We have a full set of golf clubs...

122
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:57,115
...that were owned
by President John F. Kennedy...

123
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:01,121
...as seen in the famous photo of the
president chipping at Burning Tree...

124
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,198
...on the morning
of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

125
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:08,964
The set is in perfect condition,
and we will start the biding at $4000.

126
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,721
Four thousand dollars?
Do I have $4000? I have $4000.

127
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:15,038
Do I have 5? Five thousand dollars?
I have $5000. Do I have 6?

128
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,721
Six thousand dollars
for this set of beautiful clubs.

129
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:21,402
Six? I have $6000.
Can I have 6500?

130
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,521
Sixty-five hundred
to the dark-haired person on the right.

131
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:29,363
We are at 6500.
Do I hear 6600?

132
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:31,597
The president's own golf clubs.

133
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,519
Leisure life at Camelot.

134
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,359
Sixty-five hundred going once.

135
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,836
Eight thousand.

136
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:41,683
Eight thousand. We have 8000.
The bid is now $8000.

137
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:43,360
What is she doing?

138
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,166
She's starting in on the biding now?

139
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,680
Eighty-five hundred.

140
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:50,407
- We have 85.
- Nine thousand.

141
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,239
Nine thousand dollars.

142
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:53,601
I think she wants those clubs.

143
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:56,122
Do I hear 95?
Ninety-five hundred.

144
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,517
- Ninety-five hundred.
- Ten thousand.

145
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:02,324
Ten thousand
to the shapely woman on the left.

146
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,045
Ten thousand going once.

147
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,721
- That's you're ceiling.
- Ten thousand going twice.

148
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,117
- Eleven thousand.
- Twelve thousand.

149
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,916
- Thirteen thousand.
- Fourteen thousand.

150
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:16,562
Fifteen thousand.

151
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,799
Peterman is gonna kill me.

152
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,878
I really thought
you had her there at 17,000.

153
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,765
Why didn't you stop me?

154
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,121
Do you hear this clunking?

155
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:30,321
A little.

156
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,279
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna grab these from you later.

157
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,915
You'll take care of them.
Okay? Okay.

158
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,440
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

159
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:46,167
- Alrighty. Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,397
What is going on here?

161
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:53,841
Oh, my God.

162
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:03,637
Oh, you idiots!

163
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:07,198
So we could put the bottles
in a U-Haul.

164
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,756
- Go lean and mean.
- Newman, it's a dead end. Come on.

165
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,481
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

166
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,877
You put your groceries under
the hood of my car?

167
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,959
Oh, that's right.
We forgot about those.

168
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,719
That's where my missing soda is.

169
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,037
And your crab legs?
And a thing of cheese?

170
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,358
The AAA guy said I was close to
sucking a muffin down the carburettor.

171
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,724
- What were you thinking?
- We ran out of space.

172
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,355
Now I gotta take the car to Tony
and get it checked out.

173
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,676
- He's good.
- He's real good.

174
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,678
But he's so obsessive
about the car.

175
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,202
He makes me feel guilty about
everything wrong with it.

176
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,086
I gotta get it washed before
I take it down or he'll yell at me.

177
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:41,444
- Choke?
- No, thank you.

178
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,077
Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:48,445
I remember this car. Beautiful car.

180
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,440
Yeah, so anyway, the engine's been
idling a little rough.

181
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,804
I thought it might be time
for a check-up.

182
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,719
There's nothing wrong on the inside.

183
00:08:56,887 --> 00:08:58,878
The shift knob is loose.
You know about that?

184
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,686
- No, I hadn't noticed.
- Have you been picking at it?

185
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:03,596
Have I been picking at it?

186
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,402
No, you know,
it's just wear and tear.

187
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,876
Wear and tear, I see.

188
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,117
The engine's the only thing
that needs checking.

189
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:13,357
- You been rotating the tires?
- Try to.

190
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:14,960
You don't try to. You do it.

191
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,243
Fifty-one percent of all turns
are right turns.

192
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,080
That's right.

193
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:23,515
Twenty thousand dollars?

194
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,121
Elaine, that's twice the amount
I authorized you to spend.

195
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,596
I know, Mr. Peterman,
but once I saw them...

196
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,679
...I just couldn't stand to let anyone
else have them, you know.

197
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,883
Certainly not some
stuck-up candy-bar heiress...

198
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,163
...who flaunts herself in public
without regard...

199
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,363
Well, where are they?

200
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,320
They should be here today.

201
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,638
- Mr. Wilhelm.
- Yes, George.

202
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,603
Hi, I was just...

203
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,565
I just had one little question
about my assignment.

204
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,445
Well, I trust things are
moving smoothly.

205
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,120
Mr. Steinbrenner's counting on you.

206
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,358
Yes, yes, very smooth,
super smooth.

207
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:06,566
But I really want to attack this thing.
You know, sink my teeth into it.

208
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,683
So I was just wondering...

209
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:12,840
...what do you think would be
the very best way to get started?

210
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,475
Get started?
I don't understand, George.

211
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,842
- I was wondering...
- You haven't been to Payroll?

212
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,877
- No, I haven't done that.
- What's the problem?

213
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:24,005
Now, come on, George. I told
the big man you were moving on this.

214
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,839
Now, don't let him down!

215
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,719
Payroll!

216
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:41,679
Hello there.
I'm George Costanza.

217
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:42,882
Yes.

218
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,075
Assistant to the travelling secretary.

219
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:49,364
I'm working on the project.

220
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,879
- What project?
- The payroll project.

221
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:56,685
Wilhelm?

222
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:59,202
Big, big payroll project.

223
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,359
You're gonna have to fill me in.

224
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,078
You know what?
I'll look around for awhile.

225
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,966
- I'll just browse around.
- Hey, wait. Excuse me.

226
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,560
You can't come back here.

227
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,958
I'm under direct orders
from Mr. Wilhelm.

228
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:15,357
If you have a problem,
you just take it up with him.

229
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:16,996
Well, maybe I will.

230
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:21,446
You know what?
I urge you to take it up with him.

231
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:22,881
Go ahead. Give him a call.

232
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,481
He'll tell you what I'm doing here.
Then you can tell me.

233
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,002
Mr. Wilhelm,
this is Lafarge in Payroll.

234
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:32,399
There's a Costanza here,
says he's working on some project.

235
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:40,760
Oh, I see. Interesting.
Well, that's quite a project.

236
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,158
All right. Thank you.

237
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:48,238
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

238
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,600
Whatever you need,
just make yourself at home.

239
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:54,999
So he explained it all to you?

240
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,996
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.

241
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:01,921
- What did he tell you?
- Look, you were right, I was wrong.

242
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,998
You don't have
to humiliate me about it.

243
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,725
Damn.

244
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
Oh, Mother's Day.

245
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,846
Wait a second.

246
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,077
Mother's Day.

247
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:44,959
Yes!

248
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,517
Come on, Kramer!

249
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,442
- What?
- It's the truck, Kramer, the truck.

250
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,518
Look, Newman,
I told you to let this thing go.

251
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,915
No, no, no, listen to me.

252
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,476
Most days, the post office sends
one truckload of mail...

253
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:15,957
...to the second domestic regional
sorting facility in Saginaw, Michigan.

254
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:19,119
But on the week before holidays,
we see a surge.

255
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:20,925
On Valentine's Day,
we send two trucks.

256
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,396
On Christmas, four,
packed to the brim.

257
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,206
And tomorrow,
if history is any guide...

258
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,598
...we'll see some spillover
into a fifth truck.

259
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:34,079
- Mother's Day.
- The mother of all mail days.

260
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,920
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

261
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,318
A free truck?

262
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,160
Oh, boy, that completely changes
our cost structure.

263
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,283
Our G and A goes down 50 percent.

264
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:46,722
We carry a couple of bags of mail,
the rest is ours!

265
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,765
Newman, you magnificent bastard,
you did it!

266
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,201
Let the collecting begin!

267
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:02,726
So did you go down to Payroll?

268
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,445
Yes, Payroll. Yes, I did.

269
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:07,041
Very productive. Payroll paid off.

270
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,675
Then I guess
you'll be heading downtown, huh?

271
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:14,601
Oh, yeah. Downtown, definitely.

272
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,122
I'm very interested
to see how this thing turns out.

273
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:20,962
You said it. Excuse me, Mr. Wilhelm,
do you really think...?

274
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:23,357
Well...

275
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:28,647
Is this downtown trip really necessary,
you know, for the project?

276
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:31,082
Oh, no, you've got
to go downtown, George.

277
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:33,238
It's all downtown.

278
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:36,399
- Just like the song says.
- The song?

279
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:40,641
There's your answer, "Downtown."

280
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:46,958
The song "Downtown"?
The Petula Clark song?

281
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,162
Yeah.

282
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:51,205
You're sure he didn't mention it
because you were going downtown?

283
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,564
I think he was trying to tell me
something, like it had some meaning.

284
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,401
Okay, so how does it go?

285
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:01,444
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

286
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,041
You can always go

287
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,959
Downtown

288
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:11,081
Maybe you know
Some little places to go to

289
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,078
Where they never close

290
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,839
- Downtown
- Wait a second.

291
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,965
Little places to go that never close.
What little place never closes?

292
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,566
- 7-Eleven.
- Maybe.

293
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:28,515
Just listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city

294
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,123
Linger on the sidewalk
Where the neon lights are pretty

295
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,359
Where the neon lights are pretty.
The Broadway area?

296
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,358
No, that's midtown.

297
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:38,516
Midtown.

298
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,838
The lights are much brighter there

299
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,956
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares

300
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,355
Just go

301
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,995
Downtown

302
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:55,682
Things will be great
When you're

303
00:16:57,927 --> 00:16:59,565
Downtown

304
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,727
I got nothing, Jerry, nothing.

305
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:07,802
Well, don't hang around
and let your troubles surround you.

306
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,764
There are movie shows.

307
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,638
You think I should come clean?

308
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,798
What do you think?
You think I should confess?

309
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,844
How can you lose?

310
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:29,679
Yeah, Jerry,
it's Tony Abado at the shop.

311
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,644
Look, we gotta talk.
You better come down.

312
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,923
Anytime after 4.

313
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,286
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

314
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:42,165
- Oh, hi.
- Listen, I need to come over...

315
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,646
...and pick up the clubs.

316
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:47,277
- Oh, you know what?
- Oh, no. What?

317
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,723
No, it's no big deal.
I left the clubs in the car.

318
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,082
You left them in the car?

319
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:55,205
- How could you leave them in the car?
- I forgot.

320
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,085
Oh, go down and get them.

321
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,760
I can't.
The car's at the mechanic's.

322
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:00,480
Oh, this is great.

323
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,046
All right. Where's the mechanic?

324
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,799
I'll just go and pick them up myself.

325
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,197
No, no, you can't.
He's working on the car right now.

326
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,722
You cannot disturb him
while he's working.

327
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,121
I'm going there in an hour
if you wanna meet me there.

328
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:13,959
You know the place.
It's on 56th Street.

329
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,119
Oh, okay. All right. Fine.

330
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:20,966
Hey, Tony.

331
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:23,641
- Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
- Sure.

332
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:28,444
I think I know what's going on here,
and I just want to hear it from you.

333
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,563
But I want you
to be straight with me.

334
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,399
Don't lie to me, Jerry.

335
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,323
You know that motor oil
you're putting in there?

336
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,398
It's from those
quickie-lube places, isn't it?

337
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:43,243
- Well, I change it so often. I mean...
- Motor oil is the lifeblood of a car.

338
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,319
You put in a low-grade oil,
you can damage vital engine parts.

339
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,923
Okay, see this gasket?
I have no confidence in that gasket.

340
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,477
- Tony, I really don't...
- Here's what I wanna do.

341
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,763
I wanna overhaul the entire engine.

342
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,487
But it's gonna take
a major commitment from you.

343
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,320
You're gonna have to keep it under
60 miles an hour for awhile.

344
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:05,162
You gotta come in, and you gotta get
the oil changed every 1000 miles.

345
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,045
How much money is
this gonna cost me?

346
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,199
I don't understand you.

347
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,725
It's your own car
we're talking about.

348
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:16,482
You know, you wrote
the wrong mileage down on the form.

349
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:17,636
You barely know the car.

350
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,684
Don't know the mileage,
the tire pressure.

351
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,917
When's the last time you checked
the washer fluid?

352
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,806
- But the washer fluid is fine.
- The washer fluid is not fine!

353
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,597
You know what...

354
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:33,482
...I just wanna take my car and
I'm gonna bring it someplace else.

355
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,726
- What do you mean?
- Just can I have my car.

356
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,878
I'm gonna to pay my bill
and be on my way.

357
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,075
- Well, the car's on a lift.
- Well, just get it down.

358
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,000
All right.

359
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:48,321
Okay. Well, wait here and I'll...
I'll bring it around.

360
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,842
Okay. Thank you very much.

361
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,718
Hey, where's the car?

362
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,878
- He's bringing it.
- Good.

363
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:12,726
Okay. Thank you.

364
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:14,081
So, what did they say?

365
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,283
They're sending
a detective tomorrow.

366
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,041
What the hell were you thinking
leaving my clubs in that car?

367
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:22,404
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic
pulling a Mary Beth Whitehead, did I?

368
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,159
Well, what kind of maniac
is this guy?

369
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,318
He's a very special maniac.

370
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,407
- What do I tell Mr. Peterman?
- I don't know.

371
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,479
Why couldn't
you take better care of that car?

372
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,077
- Well, are they here?
- Mr. Peterman...

373
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,637
...there seems to be a bit of a snag.

374
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:42,802
Snag?

375
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:47,279
It seems that
a psychotic mechanic...

376
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,803
...has absconded
with my friend's car.

377
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,639
What does that have
to do with my clubs?

378
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,002
They happened to be
in the back seat at the time.

379
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,961
What was the suspect wearing
at the time of the incident?
