1
00:00:02,527 --> 00:00:04,279
I was thinking about the wig
historically.

2
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:08,162
The Revolutionary War
was the last war fought in wigs...

3
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:11,524
...and it seems like that must have
been hard. They're going into battle:

4
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,281
"Well, do I have my bullets?
Do I have my bobby pins?"

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,245
You gotta make sure you have
everything. Lot more to worry about.

6
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,365
"What if I get killed?
Is my wig on straight?"

7
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:24,364
I don't know when the whole wig thing
came into style for a man...

8
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:25,960
...but I know when it went out:

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,721
When the mirror was invented.

10
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:30,445
No guy is looking in a mirror...

11
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:33,565
...powdering a thatch of horsehair
on his head, going:

12
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:37,561
"All right, let's go
rap to the ladies."

13
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,245
- I'm looking for a crested blazer.
- A crested blazer.

14
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:46,763
I wore one once, and I really think
it did something for me.

15
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:48,679
Yes, I think we might
have something.

16
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:53,160
The Joseph Abboud crested blazer
is the finest.

17
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,761
That's hand ticking
around the crest...

18
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:59,397
...and these are the world-famous
corisso buttons...

19
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,319
...made from
the finest antelope horn.

20
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:04,597
Then they'll match my sneakers.

21
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:09,565
It looks fabulous on you.
Shall I wrap it up?

22
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:12,400
You know, I'm not sure.

23
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,046
I'll tell you what.

24
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,085
I'll come back later with someone,
see what they think.

25
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,284
- Really, I'll be back.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:28,517
So I didn't like the crest all that much,
but the guy spent 15 minutes with me.

27
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:32,043
To get out of the store, I said I wanted
to see what someone else thought.

28
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:34,482
Then he makes a face
like he doesn't believe me.

29
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:36,239
So he knew
you were making it up?

30
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:37,442
Yeah, he caught me.

31
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:39,486
So here's what I want you to do.

32
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,480
Come with me to the store,
and we'll pretend to look at the coat.

33
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:44,115
That's ridiculous.

34
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,198
Why go back there
if you don't want the coat?

35
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:49,963
Because he thinks I was lying.
I wanna show him I wasn't.

36
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:51,481
But you were.

37
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:54,605
But if you go back with me,
then I'm not.

38
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:57,004
All right, fine. Whatever.

39
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,485
Problems with the houseguest?

40
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:00,841
What houseguest?

41
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,760
This friend of Susan's
is staying with us for two weeks.

42
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:05,838
Now, am I wrong,
or is that excessive?

43
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:10,481
Well, Bob Sacamano, he stayed
with me once for a year and a half.

44
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,362
- Who is he?
- He's a wig master.

45
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,006
- What is a wig master?
- He's with the touring company...

46
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,761
...of Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

47
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,565
He's the guy in charge of the wigs.

48
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:26,684
Boy, imagine liking wigs to the point
it becomes a career choice.

49
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,600
So how about some tickets, George?
You know, I'd kill for a peek.

50
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,725
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
I gotta drop my car off at the new lot.

51
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,242
- What lot's that?
- Jiffy Park. It's incredible.

52
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:36,726
Seventy-five dollars a month.

53
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,445
Seventy-five bucks a month?

54
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:40,404
You get this cool T-shirt
when you sign up.

55
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,636
Oh, I'm down.

56
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,039
Remember me? I said I'd come back
with someone, and I did.

57
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,037
- Surprised?
- No, I believed you.

58
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:50,839
This is Elaine.

59
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,475
Oh, hello. I'm Craig.

60
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,080
Oh, hi.

61
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,963
Well, here it is.

62
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,963
Joseph Abboud.

63
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:05,880
And look at this hand ticking
around the crest.

64
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,480
You know your clothes.

65
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,923
Well, I'm in the biz.
I work for J. Peterman.

66
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:14,443
I love J. Peterman.
I especially enjoy the catalog.

67
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:16,723
Those fanciful narratives
really take me away.

68
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:18,036
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:19,686
- You know what? I write those.
- No.

70
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:22,919
Elaine, what about the crest?
What do you think of the crest here?

71
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,679
Well, I love it.

72
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:26,360
- You what?
- I think it's great.

73
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,280
- I think you should get it.
- Well...

74
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:34,604
- Will it be check or credit card?
- Check.

75
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,239
I'll need you to write down your
phone number on the check for me.

76
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,045
Perhaps you could do the same.

77
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,566
You weren't supposed to say that.

78
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,922
- But I really did like it.
- That's not the point.

79
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:52,647
You put me in a position
where I had no choice.

80
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:53,842
Sorry.

81
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:56,641
What about that guy
asking you out right in front of me?

82
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:58,718
What is the big deal?

83
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:02,004
It was very emasculating. He doesn't
know the nature of our relationship.

84
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,398
You're there approving new clothes.
That's a girlfriend job.

85
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,761
How dare he?

86
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,838
He dared.

87
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,686
Hi, George. How was your day?

88
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,403
Good. Good day.

89
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:23,483
- You?
- I am getting so much work done.

90
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:26,684
- See?
- Very nice.

91
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:28,758
Hey, sweetie, how was your day?

92
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:31,157
I already asked him that.
He said, "Good. Good day."

93
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,245
Thank God you're home.
I'm locked out.

94
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,999
I dropped my car at Jiffy Park...

95
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,476
...and I forgot to take
my apartment key off the ring.

96
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:49,083
- So you got my spare?
- No, I gave it back to you.

97
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,396
You did?

98
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:52,876
Well, look,
can you take me over there?

99
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,446
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on, Jerry.

100
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,679
- It's all the way over to 12th Avenue.
- I didn't tell you to park there.

101
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,407
Now someone's gotta drive you
every time you need your car?

102
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,922
- Take the bus.
- I'm not gonna take the bus.

103
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,043
That's why I got a car.

104
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:08,036
- Forget it.
- I'm gonna get George to pick me up.

105
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,959
He won't take you.

106
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,767
Got it, got it. Hello?

107
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,440
Can you take me over to Jiffy Park?

108
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,202
Yeah, I'll pick you up right now.
All right. Okay. Gotta go.

109
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,005
So the wig mas...

110
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,761
The wig master said
you could stop by the theater tonight...

111
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,804
...and he'll show you around.

112
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,926
Would you pick a station!

113
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,476
I like them all.

114
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,476
Oh, great.

115
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,036
Now the volume knob fell off.

116
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,196
What's this?

117
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,676
- Oh, God.
- What?

118
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:50,326
It's a c...

119
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,762
It's a condom!

120
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,686
How do you like working there
at The Andover Shop?

121
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:02,078
I mean, it's pretty swanky.
Upscale clientele.

122
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:04,124
Except for Jerry.

123
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:08,118
So did you see anything you liked?

124
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:11,398
Because I can get you
a considerable discount.

125
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,803
Really? Well, actually,
yeah, I did see...

126
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:17,676
...this amazing little black dress.
It was sleeveless.

127
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,644
- The Nicole Miller.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,638
- I'll take care of it.
- Really?

129
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:23,001
But I barely know you.

130
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:27,319
Well, we'll just have to
do something about that, won't we?

131
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,358
- Hey, Greg.
- It's Craig.

132
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,324
Oh, right. Nice lunch with Elaine?

133
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,561
Yes, lovely.

134
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,685
You know, I'm just curious, how did
you know she wasn't my girlfriend?

135
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:49,236
Well, I could just sense it.

136
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:50,840
You know, we used to go out.

137
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:55,046
- Oh, you did?
- Oh, yeah, we went way out and wild.

138
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,316
- Hey, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.

139
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:01,638
Would you like to buy a rose
for your wife?

140
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,556
How do you know
she's not my wife?

141
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,443
I wanna know,
how did that get into my car?

142
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:13,202
Hey, look, you walk in this city,
things are gonna stick to your foot.

143
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,881
You open your car and... condom.

144
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,317
That doesn't explain
the lipstick on the dashboard.

145
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:22,604
Here, take a few shirts.

146
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,798
- What?
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kramer...

147
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:31,004
...but we can't get your car now.
The keys have been misplaced.

148
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,727
I need those keys. I won't be able
to get into my apartment.

149
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,243
Mr. Kramer, you like Cadillacs?

150
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:40,835
Yeah, I like Cadillacs.
Why, what do you got on your mind?

151
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:44,360
Take that pink Cadillac Eldorado
over there.

152
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,960
It's a Mary Kay car.

153
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,561
- Mary Kay?
- Mary Kay car.

154
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:50,604
I'll see you later.
Thanks for driving me.

155
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:53,076
Hey, what's happening?

156
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:55,283
I'm gonna hang around here
a little while.

157
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,199
Something funny going on here.

158
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,485
You were wrong about Craig.
He's a very sweet guy.

159
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, what about the ponytail?

160
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,600
- What about it?
- Come on.

161
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,042
Ponytail? Get real.

162
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:10,684
All I know is he promised me
a discount on that dress.

163
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,565
Of course he did.
The guy's working you.

164
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,719
Oh, Jerry, I've been around enough
to know when I'm being worked.

165
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:19,562
- Have you slept with him yet?
- I just met him this morning.

166
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,641
It's been known to happen.

167
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,439
I'm telling you right now, Elaine...

168
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,962
...this guy's gonna dangle that dress
in front of you...

169
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:30,005
...like a dirt farmer
dangles a carrot in front of a mule.

170
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,359
Well, this is all very flattering...

171
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,644
- Like a shark fisherman with chum.
- Okay.

172
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,605
- Like a shrimp farmer...
- Okay.

173
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,998
Well, that's the grand tour...

174
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,476
...but I saved the best for last.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,483
Behold, the Technicolor Dreamcoat.

176
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,125
Spectacular.

177
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:55,326
Excuse me. Would you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

178
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:57,635
Are you a cop?

179
00:08:57,807 --> 00:09:01,004
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not a cop.
I work for the Yankees.

180
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,961
They stink.

181
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:09,725
Nevertheless, I was wondering
if you and your friends...

182
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,685
...are doing business
here at the Jiffy Park?

183
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,964
You know,
what do you people call it?

184
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:18,004
Turning tricks?

185
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,440
Anyway, see, the thing is,
I found a condom in my car.

186
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:24,120
Now, I'm not saying it's yours...

187
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,596
...I just wanna know
if I should change parking lots.

188
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,641
Get lost, mister.
I'm trying to make a living here.

189
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:32,446
I'll pay for your time.
I just need some information.

190
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:34,677
How much do you want?
Ten? Fifteen?

191
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:36,565
- You have change for 20?
- Fifteen?

192
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,046
- Well...
- George?

193
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:39,686
Hi, honey.

194
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,918
- I hope that you're telling me the truth.
- Of course I'm telling the truth.

195
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:55,043
Because I have to be able
to trust you.

196
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:58,119
If I can't trust you,
there's no way that this can work.

197
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,605
Really?

198
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,200
Yeah.

199
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,116
Well, then you really have
something to think about...

200
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:10,926
...because, you know,
if there's any doubt in your mind...

201
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,317
And it doesn't even have
to be a big doubt, you know.

202
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,125
Even a tiny doubt,
a dot of a doubt...

203
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:16,276
There's no doubt.

204
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,564
Because if there's any doubt at all,
I feel that we should cultivate it.

205
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,161
Cultivate it?

206
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:24,605
Yes, you know, deal with it.
We have to deal with the doubt, Susan.

207
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,837
The doubt must be dealt with.

208
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:29,646
I have no doubt, George. Do you?

209
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,678
No.

210
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,243
You know, I can't wait
to get that dress.

211
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,444
Yeah, it should arrive imminently.

212
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:40,835
Arrive?

213
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,680
- Yes, from Milan.
- But you said it was in the store.

214
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,361
No, no, no. We sold out.
We've had to order some more.

215
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,519
- But I thought Nicole Miller was ma...
- Well...

216
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,882
- lan.
- Hey, Craig.

217
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,366
Elaine, this is lan.

218
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,483
- Oh, hi, lan.
- Lan.

219
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:57,478
- Lan.
- Lan.

220
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,877
He's a friend of mine from England.

221
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,400
So tell me, how are you doing?

222
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,797
Well, I'm working over
at The Andover Shop, actually.

223
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,286
You should come by.

224
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,085
I'll get you a great discount.

225
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,680
Maybe I will.

226
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:11,602
- Nice meeting you.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

227
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:14,201
- Cheerio.
- Bye, lan.

228
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,798
So you getting him a discount too?

229
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,878
Well, why so surprised?

230
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,605
No reason.

231
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:28,084
That clothing salesman had a lot of
nerve hitting on Elaine in front of me.

232
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,798
He stands to make a big commission
too, on that jacket with the crest...

233
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,719
...that nobody seems to like.

234
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,518
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take that jacket back.

235
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,520
I'm putting this guy
right out of commission.

236
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,525
All right. I'm gonna turn in.

237
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:47,326
- Turn in?
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

238
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,555
It's only 9:00.

239
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:53,363
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't argue with the body, Jerry.

240
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:55,961
That's an argument you can't win.

241
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,560
I can't go to sleep at 9:00.

242
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:01,398
Well, you can
go to your room and read.

243
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,721
Hey, look, you know,
you're the one who's locked out.

244
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,196
I'm letting you stay here.
You're wearing my bathrobe.

245
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:09,561
You should adapt to me.

246
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,399
But I'm tired.

247
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,319
Why don't you go sleep
at Newman's?

248
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,159
Oh, he's got a girl up there.

249
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:18,797
This quilt is too thin.
I know I'm gonna get cold.

250
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,720
I don't even fit on this couch.

251
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,159
I don't even know if I'm gonna sleep.

252
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,521
Well, that's all I've got.

253
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:29,763
Well, can I sleep with you?

254
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,763
Well, you've got that big,
comfortable bed...

255
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,883
...and that nice, warm quilt.

256
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:41,164
Kramer, there's no way
you're sleeping with me.

257
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:42,726
- Why?
- Why?

258
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,038
- Yeah.
- Do I really have to explain why?

259
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,640
- Well, l...
- Hey.

260
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:50,196
- Hey.
- What's that?

261
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:54,435
Squire's walking stick.
I had to write about it for the catalog.

262
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:57,805
- You want it?
- Yeah.

263
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,764
You can have it.
I don't need it anymore.

264
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:02,487
Oh, mama.

265
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,639
Okay, so I am positive
you are wrong about Craig.

266
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:11,956
Yeah, why?

267
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:16,120
Because he told a man he'd give him
a discount too. A man, Jerry.

268
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:18,517
- So? Who is he?
- Some friend of his from England.

269
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,598
Don't you see?

270
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,804
- It's all a big scam.
- You're nuts.

271
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,845
Well, how do you know he's not
wondering the same thing about you?

272
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,683
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

273
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:33,396
Well, perhaps he thinks that
you're working him for the discount.

274
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,924
Shaking that little butt of yours
into big, big savings.

275
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:40,920
Then when you get it, you know,
you drop him like a hot potato.

276
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,202
Oh, please.

277
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,881
No, see, the two of you
need to work on trust.

278
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:46,400
And then, and only then...

279
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,798
...will there be a free exchange
of sex and discounts.

280
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,205
The cornerstones
of a healthy relationship.

281
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:58,326
And now, if you would excuse us...

282
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:01,043
...we need to get to bed.

283
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:23,639
Yeah.

284
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:27,480
This patio furniture's on sale.

285
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:33,285
Excuse me.
I think I made a big mistake.

286
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:36,439
- I'd like my deposit back, please.
- What's the problem?

287
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,440
You got hookers turning tricks
in my car. How's that for starters?

288
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:40,926
That is all hearsay.

289
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:44,235
All right, very good.
I'd like my car and deposit back.

290
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,156
- Can't do it.
- What do you mean?

291
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:49,966
If you read the agreement,
the deposit is nonrefundable.

292
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,119
Does it say anything
in the contract...

293
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,084
...about my car
being used as a whorehouse?

294
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,124
I don't remember reading
that clause either.

295
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,646
What can I tell you, buddy?
Take it up with Consumer Affairs.

296
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,560
All right, just give me my car
and let me get the hell out of here.

297
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,797
That's going to be a problem.

298
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,359
- Why?
- It's all the way in the back.

299
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,279
We can't get it out
for a couple of days.

300
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:15,879
What are you talking about?
I want my car.

301
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,197
We ask that you
please bear with us.

302
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,245
Bear with you?

303
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:21,760
This is a parking lot.

304
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:24,077
People are supposed
to be able to get their cars.

305
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,319
Ideally.

306
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:30,199
Excuse me,
I'd like to return this jacket.

307
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:31,959
Certainly. May I ask why?

308
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,399
For spite.

309
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:37,765
Spite?

310
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:41,044
That's right. I don't care for
the salesman that sold it to me.

311
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:44,040
I don't think you can
return an item for spite.

312
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,127
- What do you mean?
- Lf there was some problem with it...

313
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:50,245
...if it were unsatisfactory in some way,
then we could do it for you.

314
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:54,036
But I'm afraid spite doesn't fit
any of our conditions for a refund.

315
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,767
I wanna return it. What's the difference
what the reason is?

316
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,635
Let me speak with the manager.
Excuse me.

317
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,206
Bob?

318
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,643
This gentleman...
Spite.

319
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,527
- What seems to be the problem?
- I wanna return this jacket.

320
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,724
She asked me why, I said, "For spite,"
and now she won't take it back.

321
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:19,397
That's true. We can't return an item
based purely on spite.

322
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,964
Well, so fine, then. Then I don't
want it. That's why I'm returning it.

323
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:26,164
Well, you already said spite, so...

324
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:30,044
- But I changed my mind.
- No, you said spite.

325
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,925
Too late.

326
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:36,285
- Nice hat.
- Get a calendar, honey. It's the '90s.

327
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:38,075
- Elaine.
- Oh, hey.

328
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,965
These are my friends,
Jerry and Elaine.

329
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:41,401
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

330
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,159
- I'm Charmaine.
- I'm Ethan.

331
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,364
Yeah, she's the costume designer,
and he's the wig master for the show.

332
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:48,802
- Oh, you're staying with George.
- Right, George.

333
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,764
I get the feeling
he doesn't want me there.

334
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,918
He doesn't even want himself there.

335
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,963
- Why don't you sit down and join us?
- All right.

336
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:57,879
I can't. I've gotta go meet a friend.

337
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,436
Well, what are we, dog meat?

338
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,677
Another champagne coolie, please.

339
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,964
- You have really beautiful hair.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks very much.

340
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,595
Ever thought of selling it?
It would make a brilliant wig.

341
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:11,645
- They make wigs out of human hair?
- And pay plenty for them.

342
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,718
Okay, well, you guys
are gonna have fun here.

343
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,798
- All right.
- See you later.

344
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:18,845
I just remembered, I gotta get
the Dreamcoat from the dry cleaner.

345
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,965
- You'll let me wear the other one?
- Yeah, but you have to be careful.

346
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,721
- It's my only backup.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

347
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:26,036
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

348
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:27,606
Bye.

349
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:31,197
There's your champagne coolie.

350
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,316
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, cowboy.

351
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,920
Yeah, I guess so.

352
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:37,881
Well, here we are.

353
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,561
I am beat.

354
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,319
That's nice.

355
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,280
So...

356
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:50,360
So do you have any idea when
the Nicole Millers are coming in?

357
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,083
Oh, yeah, the Nicole Millers.

358
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:54,760
Well, the funniest thing.

359
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,236
I've learned that the new shipment's
coming by boat...

360
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:00,683
...which does tend to take a bit longer,
what with the waves and all.

361
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:05,805
So you'll just have to be
a little bit patient.

362
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:08,765
So you have no idea
when they'll arrive?

363
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:11,077
No, I'm really not sure.

364
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,116
How can you love a guy like that?
He's a mess.

365
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,720
I don't see them together at all.

366
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,358
- Ethan?
- Yes?

367
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:22,677
Hi, it's me, Jesse.

368
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,405
George Hamilton's
personal assistant.

369
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,923
- Right, right. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

370
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,486
- This is Jerry.
- Hello.

371
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,080
Yeah.

372
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:32,600
Ethan, what brings you to town?

373
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,997
Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

374
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:39,240
You're kidding. Listen, maybe
you and I should get together.

375
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:42,160
Have you been on the slide
at Club USA? It's intense.

376
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:45,239
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you asking him out?

377
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,160
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

378
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,919
Right in front of me?

379
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,679
How do you know
we're not together?

380
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:53,725
Two guys sitting, laughing,
drinking champagne coolies.

381
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,278
I don't know.
I just didn't think you were.

382
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,403
Well, we're sitting here together.

383
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,761
Why wouldn't you think that?

384
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,166
I don't know. I just didn't.

385
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,397
Well, it's very emasculating.

386
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,121
- Hello?
- This is Bob from The Andover Shop.

387
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart.
He left this number.

388
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:19,397
Oh, is it important?

389
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,161
- Well...
- Hey, let me ask you something.

390
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,205
Do you know when the Nicole Millers
are coming in from Milan?

391
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:26,356
Nicole Millers?

392
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:30,679
We aren't expecting any Nicole Millers.
In fact, we have too many as it is.

393
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,478
Well, do you have any
in a size four?

394
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,366
Yes, several.

395
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:40,360
Just tell him he doesn't have
to be in tomorrow until 11.

396
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,644
Oh, yeah, I'll make sure
he gets the message.

397
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:49,925
They mak e wigs out of human hair?

398
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,203
And pay plenty for them.

399
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,280
Oh, sweet Maria.

400
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:46,675
Hey, let's go.

401
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,720
What are you doing in my car?

402
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,605
Hey, hey, where are you going?

403
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,122
- Hey, you just cost me some money.
- Hey, cool it, lady.

404
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:01,361
Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.

405
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,166
Police officers, freeze right there.

406
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:15,440
Okay, big daddy, take the hat off.

407
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,363
All right, turn to your right.

408
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,916
I said turn, pimp!

409
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:23,963
I'm not a pimp.
