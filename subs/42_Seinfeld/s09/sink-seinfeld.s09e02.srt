1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,835
George, you're not really
handicapped, are you?

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,600
I've had my difficulties.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,809
I saw you running
down Amsterdam Avenue...

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,916
...lifting that 200-pound motorized cart
with one hand.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,310
Mr. Thomassoulo,
during times of great stress...

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,922
...people are capable
of superhuman strength.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,318
Have you ever seen...

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,392
<i>- ... The Incredible Hulk, sir?
- No.</i>

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,757
<i>How about the old
Spider-Man live-action show?</i>

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,024
George, I realize that we've signed
a one-year contract with you.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,863
But at this point, I think it's best
if we both go our separate ways.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,437
I don't understand.

13
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,404
We don't like you.
We want you to leave.

14
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,433
Clearer.

15
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,808
- So you're staying at Play Now?
- Why not?

16
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,646
The pay is good, I got dental
and private access...

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,880
...to one of the great handicapped
toilets in the city.

18
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,753
But they know you're not handicapped.
Aren't you ashamed?

19
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,416
They're the ones that should be.

20
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,289
They signed me
to a one-year contract.

21
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,399
As long as I show up for work
every day, they have to pay me.

22
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,296
- Hey.
- Hello.

23
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,664
Hello, Elaine.

24
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,439
- What's that?
- It's just his stupid thing.

25
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,041
Well, I'm sure it's stupid.

26
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,772
It's not about me, is it?

27
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,277
- No.
- Not at all.

28
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,916
- Tell me.
- All right.

29
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,075
- You know this girl Claire I'm seeing?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,584
He and I started joking
that when she falls asleep...

31
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,246
...her stomach stays awake
all night and talks to me.

32
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,052
- How's it talking?
- Well, the bellybutton's like a mouth.

33
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,559
I'm bored.

34
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,993
Talk to me.

35
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:43,158
Oh, I gotta start taking these
"stupid" warnings more seriously.

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,439
- Hey, look who's here. Puddy.
- My Puddy?

37
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,542
- We broke up.
- And yet he continues to live.

38
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,236
Hey, Benes.

39
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,846
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.

40
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,311
Great.

41
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,845
- See you.
- Well, that's it.

42
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,611
You two are back together.

43
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,449
- What?
- The bump-into.

44
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,057
The bump-into,
always leads to the backslide.

45
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,957
David and I will not
be getting back together.

46
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,655
Elaine, breaking up is like
knocking over a coke machine.

47
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,663
You can't do it in one push.

48
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,793
You gotta rock it back and forth
a few times, and then it goes over.

49
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,234
That's beautiful.

50
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,466
What about you?
You were even engaged...

51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,304
...and you cut it off just like that.

52
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,675
That's different.
I had no feelings for those people.

53
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,543
But you, you'll backslide.

54
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,150
- You wanna bet?
- Stakes?

55
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,876
- Fifty.
- Dollars?

56
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,816
- All right. Witness?
- Witness.

57
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,047
- Done.
- Percentage?

58
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,918
- No.
- No.

59
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,689
- So I'll call you tonight?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,192
What's wrong with the belt?

61
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,893
At the movies last night, I went
to the bathroom and I unbuckled wildly...

62
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,300
...and the buckle kind of banged
against the side of the urinal...

63
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,997
...so that's it.

64
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,008
- So you're insane.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

65
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,513
- Hello.
- Of course, it's a sliding scale.

66
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,377
See you later.

67
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,342
- Hello.
- Hello.

68
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,954
Look at this:
They're redoing the Cloud Club.

69
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,925
The restaurant
on the Chrysler Building?

70
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,621
- Good idea.
- Of course it is. It's my idea.

71
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,893
I conceived this whole project
two years ago.

72
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,038
Which part? The " renovating
the restaurant you don't own" part...

73
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,733
...or " spending the 200 million
you don't have" part?

74
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,543
I come up with these things,
I know they're gold...

75
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,373
...but nothing happens.
You know why?

76
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,175
No resources, skill, talent,
ability, brains-?

77
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,045
No. No time.

78
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,743
It's all these menial tasks.

79
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,117
Laundry, grocery shopping,
coming in here and talking to you.

80
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,659
Do you have any idea how much time
I waste in this apartment?

81
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,960
I could ballpark it.

82
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,900
Hello.

83
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,068
Here we go. Now she comes in.
My whole day is shot.

84
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,806
I called you last night.
Where were you?

85
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,308
I went out with a friend.

86
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,641
- George?
- No. No. No.

87
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,908
Well, I was here. That's everyone.

88
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,921
Are those the same shoes
as yesterday's?

89
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,392
You know,
I wear these shoes all the time.

90
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:27,499
Your hair, it's somewhat depoofed.

91
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,430
Oh, it's the new look, you know?

92
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,570
Heroin chic.

93
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,808
Wait a second.

94
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,409
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

95
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,102
Nothing!

96
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,538
You're wearing the same clothes
as yesterday.

97
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,208
- You saw Puddy.
- Oh, hoochie-moochie.

98
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,786
- Game over. Pay up.
- No.

99
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,857
It was an isolated sexual incident.

100
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,927
- We are not back together.
- Then what do you call it?

101
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,393
People don't just bump
into each other and have sex.

102
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,792
This isn't Cinemax.

103
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,528
It was no big deal, okay?

104
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,535
We fooled around, then we went out,
grabbed a little dinner.

105
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,605
Dinner? That's it.

106
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,366
- What?
- You're all the way back.

107
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,344
Sex, that's meaningless.
I can understand.

108
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,377
Dinner, that's heavy.
That's an hour.

109
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,243
2.9-percent financing
on a Toyota one-ton.

110
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,216
That was my idea too!

111
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,887
- Good morning.
- Go to hell.

112
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,519
- Hi, Alice. That's a nice dress.
- Don't even look at me.

113
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,223
- Hey, Glenn.
- Go to hell.

114
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,564
Heard that one already.

115
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,506
So that's the bedroom.
Here's the bathroom.

116
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,076
You need to familiarize yourself
with the kitchen.

117
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,975
Yeah, go ahead and look through
some of the drawers.

118
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,811
- And you are...?
- Oh, hey, I'm Darin. I'm new here.

119
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,950
Yeah, that's Jerry.
You don't have to worry about him.

120
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,586
Why don't you go and get started
on that mail?

121
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,626
- Right.
- Okay, good.

122
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,695
He's a go-getter.

123
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,724
- Who's he?
- My intern from NYU.

124
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,938
You remember my corporation,
Kramerica Industries?

125
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,042
- All right.
- Yeah, well apparently...

126
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,576
...NYU is very enthusiastic
about their students...

127
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,874
...getting some real-world
corporate experience.

128
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,485
But you only provide fantasy-world
corporate experience.

129
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,950
Well, this'll really free up my time...

130
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,091
...so I can focus on more important
things, like my bladder system.

131
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,158
- All right, it's time to go.
- No, Jerry.

132
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,296
- It's not for people. It's for oil tankers.
- I know.

133
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,658
The idea is a rubber bladder
inside the tanker...

134
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,630
...so if it crashes,
the oil won't spill out.

135
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,292
That is not a bad idea.

136
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,295
Now it's time to go.

137
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,971
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

138
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,171
Hello.

139
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
<i>- What's going on?
- Siege mentality, Jerry.</i>

140
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,984
They want me out of here.

141
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,587
They've downgraded me
to some sort of a bunker.

142
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,484
I'm like Hitler's last days here.

143
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,626
<i>- So you gonna leave?
- Oh, no. I'm invigorated.</i>

144
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,455
They'll never get me out.

145
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,187
I'm like a weed, Jerry.

146
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,594
I thought you're like Hitler
in the bunker.

147
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,030
I'm a weed in Hitler's bunker.

148
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,170
I'm uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff.

149
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,599
<i>I got another call. See you.</i>

150
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,503
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, this is Darin from Kramer's office.</i>

151
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,203
Mr. Kramer would like to schedule
lunch with you at Monk's coffee shop.

152
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,479
- Really? When?
- Ten minutes.

153
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,644
- Do you need directions?
- No, I don't.

154
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,518
- I'll call back in five minutes to confirm.
- Yeah, five.

155
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,154
- Hey.
- Hey. So where's my money?

156
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,455
No money. I'm Puddy-free.

157
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,690
- So are we eating or what?
- Oh, yeah, hold on.

158
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,927
Hello, Darin, this is Jerry
from Jerry's office.

159
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,538
We're gonna be three for lunch.

160
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,698
What do you mean he's already left?

161
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,369
Hey, Elaine's gonna come with us.

162
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,979
- When did this happen?
- Just-

163
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,945
Darin!

164
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,854
<i>I am not calling Puddy.</i>

165
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,590
<i>What did I do with my gloves?</i>

166
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,624
<i>Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy's.</i>

167
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,698
<i>I should call him.
I need those gloves.</i>

168
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,459
<i>No, I better not.</i>

169
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,296
<i>I'll call him.</i>

170
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,805
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>

171
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,305
<i>There are the gloves.
I was just about to call.</i>

172
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,375
<i>And there they are. That's funny.</i>

173
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:32,943
<i>That's really funny.</i>

174
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,240
<i>That is really, really funny.</i>

175
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,074
<i>You know who loves funny stories?
David Puddy.</i>

176
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,084
Play Now's through playing.

177
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,190
They turned the heat
way up in my office.

178
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,124
Tried to sweat me out.

179
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,262
Do you have to write
all this stuff down?

180
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,329
Mr. Kramer's in a meeting
with Mr. Lomez...

181
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,466
...but he didn't wanna miss anything.

182
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,900
So how hot did it get?

183
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,130
I don't know, 120, 130.

184
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,936
Then they sent some guys in
to sandblast for six hours.

185
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,511
Tomorrow,
they're putting in asbestos.

186
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,374
I guess you can take anything
but actual work.

187
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,142
Bring it on.

188
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,879
- Hello, Kramer.
- Welcome.

189
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,216
I'm sorry. I couldn't get out of there.
What did I miss?

190
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,156
After ordering, Mr. Seinfeld
and Mr. Costanza debated...

191
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,126
...on whether Iron Man
wore some sort of undergarment...

192
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,993
...between his skin and his iron suit.

193
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,599
I say he's naked under there.

194
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,168
- That makes a lot of sense.
- Shut up.

195
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,670
Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom,
at which point...

196
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,400
...Mr. Costanza scooped ice
from Mr. Seinfeld's drink...

197
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,273
...with his bare hand,
and used it to wash up.

198
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,279
And then Mr. Costanza
then remarked to me:

199
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,817
"This never happened."

200
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,189
- What's so funny?
- Oh, nothing.

201
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,791
What are you laughing about?
Tell me.

202
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,199
All right, but this is really dumb,
really stupid.

203
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,972
We've been doing this
silly kind of voice.

204
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:14,101
- So is it fun humiliating me?
- No, it's not you. It's your stomach.

205
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,512
He's talking with this funny,
booming, jovial voice.

206
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,447
Hello.

207
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,645
- So you think I'm fat?
- No, it-

208
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,153
Mr. Kramer says, "Hey, buddy."

209
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,190
We're in the middle of something.
You mind coming back later?

210
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,692
- Sure. Should we set something up-?
- Get out!

211
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,128
- I'm leaving too.
- Nobody said you're fat.

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,961
He's a lovable character.

213
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,864
He's like the Kool-Aid guy.

214
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,529
- He is fat.
- No. He's just a little bloated.

215
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,643
- Goodbye!
- It's mostly water weight!

216
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,245
Boysenberry. Kid's still learning.

217
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,974
Mr. Kramer, the dean
of my internship's on line two.

218
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,051
- She wants to set a meeting.
- Yeah, well, nothing before noon.

219
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,614
- Line two?
- Yeah, your phone is line one.

220
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,884
So the gloves
were right by the phone?

221
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,859
That is pretty funny.

222
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,423
See? This is what Jerry
doesn't understand.

223
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,828
We can see each other.

224
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,731
We can see each other,
but it doesn't mean we're together.

225
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,270
No. I mean, I love just seeing you
and having sex.

226
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,103
- Yeah.
- Not having to do all that...

227
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,871
- ...you know, work.
- Well, either way...

228
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,107
- All that calling you and buying stuff.
- David.

229
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,912
Hearing about how everyone at work
isn't as smart as you. It's brutal.

230
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,220
All right, that's it.

231
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,085
- We're back together.
- Oh, no.

232
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,820
- Oh, yeah.
- Look, Elaine, be reasonable.

233
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,657
Get those clothes off.
You're spending the night.

234
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,026
- We're gonna cuddle.
- What?

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,225
You heard me: strip.

236
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,479
All right.

237
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,178
Okay.

238
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,321
All right.

239
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,875
Hello, Marjorie. George Costanza.

240
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,342
How are you, sweetheart?

241
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,380
Listen, could you give
Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me?

242
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,542
Yes. If he needs me,
tell him I'm in my office!

243
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,948
Thanks, dear.

244
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,756
Dean Jones,
you wanted to talk to me?

245
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,322
I've been reviewing
Darin's internship journal.

246
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,630
- Doing laundry?
- Yeah.

247
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,794
Mending chicken wire?

248
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,603
High tea with a Mr. Newman.

249
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,602
I know it all sounds
pretty glamorous...

250
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,708
...but it's business as usual
at Kramerica.

251
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,371
Far as I can tell...

252
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,445
...your enterprise is a little more
than a solitary man...

253
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,549
...with a messy apartment, which may
or may not have a chicken.

254
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,014
And with Darin's help,
we'll get that chicken.

255
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,884
I'm sorry, but we can't allow Darin
to continue working with you.

256
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,121
Well, I have to say,
this seems capricious and arbitrary.

257
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,526
Your fly's open.

258
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,362
You're sure you're not angry
about last night?

259
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,766
No. I'm fine.

260
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,737
Just as long as you don't ever
do that voice again.

261
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,171
- Never?
- Never.

262
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,243
- What about if you're not around?
- No.

263
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,040
I have to choose between
seeing you and doing the voice?

264
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,580
- That's right.
- I can do that.

265
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,014
- What's your decision?
- I don't know.

266
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,028
Hello.

267
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,074
Jerry, hi.

268
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,550
Hello.

269
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,960
- You broke up with her? Why?
- So we could do the voice.

270
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,970
- What's the matter?
- I think I'm getting tired of it.

271
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,971
I mean, is that all it does?
Hello and...?

272
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,701
It could do anything.
It could be Spanish.

273
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,473
Hello.

274
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,873
I like the girl better than the voice.

275
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,986
Really? Hello.

276
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,486
- Still?
- I told you.

277
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,156
All right, here you go.

278
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,553
Choke on it.

279
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,592
See. Never bet against the backslide.

280
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,492
- I knew you two would get back together.
- Not for long.

281
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:02,065
- I'm breaking up with him.
- Oh, I don't think so.

282
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,794
I've seen you together.
You make each other miserable.

283
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,096
It's kismet.

284
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,967
- Double or nothing?
- Done.

285
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,973
- Witness.
- You're in there again?

286
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,839
I think Play Now
is putting something in my food.

287
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,672
All right, I'm out of here.

288
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,812
What is this?

289
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,453
I don't know.
I found them in your closet.

290
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,758
Since Darin left,
I can't find anything.

291
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,728
He took all my clothes
to some cleaners. I'm clueless.

292
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,867
- Is that clock right?
- Yeah. 9:00.

293
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,799
I was supposed to pick up Newman
at the zoo 12 hours ago.

294
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,206
Goodbye, Kramer.

295
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,502
Jerry, buddy, I gotta tell you something.
That voice is played.

296
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,669
- Really?
- So played.

297
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,608
I told you.

298
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,757
Darin. What are you doing here?

299
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,122
The college canceled the internship.

300
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,196
I don't care about the internship.

301
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,855
I care about Kramerica.

302
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,194
No, no, no. Kramerica is no more.

303
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,166
What about
the tanker bladder system?

304
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,034
We were gonna put an end
to maritime oil spills.

305
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,336
Probably.

306
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,443
Darin, you go home.
Forget about Kramerica.

307
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,243
- Well, you're still here?
- I haven't had time to leave.

308
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,184
Well, I haven't changed my mind.

309
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,291
You are a tenacious little monkey.

310
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,724
All right, I'll do it.

311
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,659
- Kramerica Industries lives.
- Yes.

312
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,561
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

313
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,162
Let's see what Jerry's got to eat.

314
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,274
You win, George. We've had it.

315
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,006
You leave right now...

316
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,704
...and Play Now
will give you six-months' pay.

317
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,748
That's half of your entire contract.

318
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,943
Please, just go.

319
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,517
See, if I stay the whole year...

320
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,057
- ...I get it all.
- Wanna play hardball, huh?

321
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,717
Fine.

322
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,057
Attention, Play Now employees.

323
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,793
George Costanza's handicapped
bathroom on the 16th floor...

324
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:21,372
...is now open to all employees
and their families.

325
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,634
- Well played.
- I'll see you in hell, Costanza.

326
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,908
Claire, thanks for giving me
a second chance.

327
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,612
Our relationship is certainly worth more
than some silly, stupid voice.

328
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,778
Hold on one second.

329
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,424
- We don't wanna do the voice anymore?
- Don't think so.

330
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,186
All right, we're back together again.
Great. Bye-bye.

331
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,166
- Hey.
- Trouble down at the plant?

332
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,827
It's a drum of oil.

333
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,804
Darin and I are finally gonna test
my bladder system.

334
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,806
You have to drink that whole thing?

335
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,977
No, no, no. It's for oil tankers.

336
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,082
All I need to do is fill
a rubber container with oil...

337
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,185
...then drop it to see
if it can withstand the impact.

338
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,116
I understand.

339
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,156
Would a giant rubber ball work?

340
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,816
Conceivably.

341
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,827
Well, Play Now has all kinds
of different rubber balls.

342
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,694
Why don't we test
your bladder system at my office?

343
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,495
- You're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

344
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,366
Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty.

345
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,473
Well, there's nothing dirtier...

346
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,541
...than a giant ball of oil.

347
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,841
You wanna split a Reuben?

348
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,106
I don't think so, David.

349
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,647
We're through.

350
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,316
That's a nice sweater.

351
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,523
That was a doozy.

352
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,729
- Go again?
- Book it.

353
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,390
Witness.

354
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,902
David, I know this hurts,
but it's the way it has to be.

355
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,679
I'm gonna go get some popcorn.

356
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,214
- So how did it end?
- They got away.

357
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,555
Listen, David, I've gotta run.
Can you lend me 50 bucks?

358
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,054
Hey.

359
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,258
- Jerry, you bring the video camera?
- Yeah.

360
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,834
I put a six-hour tape in.

361
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,462
That should cover the experiment,
the arrest and most of your trial.

362
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,869
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

363
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,340
Oh, you might wanna stick around,
Jerry.

364
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,411
Mr. Thomassoulo
picked the wrong man...

365
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,174
...to hire because
he was fake handicapped.

366
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,248
I can't. I gotta meet Claire.

367
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,913
- You gave up the voice?
- Yeah, that was stupid.

368
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,715
- Unless you're liking it again.
- No.

369
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,591
- Darin?
- Sorry, Mr. Seinfeld.

370
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,252
- Bathroom?
- Hey, use mine. I'll let you in.

371
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,762
I thought it was open to the public.

372
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,364
I took care of that.

373
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,534
Xanadu.

374
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,914
No wonder you're putting in
so many hours.

375
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,910
- May I?
- I insist.

376
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,081
I'll fix us a drink.

377
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,778
I got it.

378
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,117
You know, Darin,
if you had told me 25 years ago...

379
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,126
...that some day
I'd be standing here...

380
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,492
...about to solve the world's
energy problems...

381
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,258
...I would've said you were crazy.

382
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,127
Now, let's push this giant ball
of oil out the window.

383
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,610
So check out my view.

384
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,806
There's Claire. I better go down.

385
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,248
Hey, there's Kramer and Darin.

386
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,043
There's the giant ball of oil.

387
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,251
Claire's right underneath that thing.

388
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,360
Claire. Hello!

389
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,428
Hello!

390
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,428
Hello!

391
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,930
I don't believe this.

392
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,162
I'm not looking up,
if you're going to do that voice.

393
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,101
Bombs away.

394
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,610
This is going to be a shame.

395
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,476
Hello.

396
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,111
Well, that didn't work.

397
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,351
Hey, how about this?

398
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,822
Ketchup and mustard
in the same bottle?

399
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,258
- Oh, that sounds interesting, sir.
- Yeah.

400
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,006
Claire won her lawsuit
against Play Now.

401
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,611
Gee, Play Now's filing for bankruptcy.

402
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,610
- Guess you're not going in anymore.
- No.

403
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,339
- They're not paying you-?
- No.

404
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,484
- So you're pretty much-?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,583
Whatever happened to Darin?

406
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,687
Darin's going away
for a long, long time.

407
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,121
Claire sure looked pretty funny
all covered in oil like that.

408
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:17,234
Hello. I got beaned
with a giant ball of oil.

409
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,529
I'm slippery as an eel.

410
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,175
I'm just so glad it's back.

411
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,808
See? This is good.

412
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,345
This is the way it should be.

413
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,040
You know,
why were we fooling ourselves?

414
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,617
We belong together.

415
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,447
Elaine, I wanna break up.

416
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,748
Nuts.
