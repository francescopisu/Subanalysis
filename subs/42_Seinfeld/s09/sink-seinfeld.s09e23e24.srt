1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,497
It seems like whenever people
call you in for a meeting...

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,336
...it's all about sitting down. "I would
really like to sit down with you."

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
"I think we need
to sit down and talk."

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,375
"Why don't you come in
and we'll sit down?"

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,312
Sometimes sitting doesn't work.
People get mad at the sitting.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,682
"You know, we've been sitting here
for I don't know how long.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,086
How much longer
are we just gonna sit here?"

8
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,456
I'll tell you what I think we should do.
I think we should all sleep on it.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,359
Maybe we're not
getting down low enough.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,468
Maybe if we all lie down,
then our brains will work.

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,942
I can't eat this without ketchup.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,579
Would it kill her to check up on us?
Would that be a terrible thing?

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,446
"How's everything? You need
anything? What can I do for you?"

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,951
- I know what you mean.
- Do you?

15
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,146
It's like going out with someone
and not hearing back.

16
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,053
- Same thing.
- Not really, but it's something.

17
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,592
Ask the people behind you.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,193
Excuse me.
Are you using your ketchup?

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,768
What do you think?
You wanna give him the ketchup?

20
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,467
It's up to you.

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,572
You know what? I don't think so.
I'm gonna need it from time to time.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,609
You wanna go to the movies?

23
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,083
What for?

24
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,687
To see a movie.

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,488
- I've been to the movies.
- Not this movie.

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,785
They're all the same.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,520
You go, you sit,
you eat popcorn, you watch.

28
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,323
I'm sick of it.

29
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,398
- Did you take a shower today?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,001
That's the kind of mood I'm in
when I haven't showered.

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,030
When is it gonna be
my turn, Jerry?

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,729
When do I get my 15 minutes?

33
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,999
- I want my 15 minutes.
- Oh, quit complaining.

34
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,405
- You have your health.
- Health's not good enough.

35
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,840
I want more than health.

36
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,674
Health's not doing it for me
anymore. I'm sick of health.

37
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,248
All right, we're done.
You can have it now.

38
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,886
Oh, very gracious.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,857
- Nice day.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,623
What is that?

41
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,630
- Hey, Jo Jo.
- Hey, hey.

42
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,168
Hey.

43
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,041
- All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
- No, thank you.

44
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,743
- So, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

45
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,209
- Come on, let's go to the beach.
- Are you crazy?

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,746
- No, it's a beautiful day.
- Have a good time.

47
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,146
Yeah, there's something
in the air today.

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,411
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air.

49
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,181
You know you're turning
into Burt Lancaster?

50
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,357
Yeah, there's something
in the air.

51
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,691
Oh, I forgot to call Jill.

52
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,362
Jill. Hi, it's Elaine.

53
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,333
How is your father?
Is everything okay?

54
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,561
What?

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,665
I can't hear you so good.
There's a lot of static.

56
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,971
Wha-?
I'm gonna call you back.

57
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,214
Jill's father is in the hospital, and you
call to ask about him on a cell phone?

58
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,350
- What? No good?
- Faux pas.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,750
- Faux pas?
- Big, hefty, stinking...

60
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,050
- ...faux pas.
- Why?

61
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,386
You can't make a health inquiry
on a cell phone.

62
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,587
It's like saying, "I don't wanna
take up my important time at home.

63
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,629
I'll get it out of the way
on the street."

64
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,235
And the street cell phone call
is the lowest phone call you can make.

65
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,735
It's an act of total disregard.
It's selfish.

66
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,668
- It's dismissive.
- It's pompous.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,274
Why don't you think
before you do something?

68
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,775
Here's a thought.

69
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,646
Bye-bye.

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,784
Too much?

71
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,559
Boy, I'm really surprised
at Elaine.

72
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,490
You know,
that whole phone business.

73
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,789
She should know
better than that.

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,091
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

75
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,499
Where do you think
this relationship is?

76
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:04,307
If you are thinking of instituting
an open door urination policy...

77
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,745
...let me disabuse you
of that notion right now, my friend.

78
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,780
- You're so uptight.
- Yeah, I'm uptight.

79
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,885
Let's all just have
a big pee party.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,845
Hey, everybody, grab a bucket.
We're going up to Jerry's.

81
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,048
It's a pee party.

82
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,030
<i>Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark...</i>

83
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,325
<i>...calling from
James Kimbrough's office at NBC.</i>

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>Could you please
give us a call? Thanks.</i>

85
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,770
Hello. Hi.
This is Jerry Seinfeld...

86
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,970
...calling for James Kimbrough.

87
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,005
Hello?

88
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,547
Hi.

89
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,544
Really?

90
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,748
No problem. Definitely.

91
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,859
Okay. Bye-bye.

92
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,856
- That was James Kimbrough.
- Who's he?

93
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,227
He is the new president of NBC.

94
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,868
<i>He wants to sit down with us
and talk about Jerry.</i>

95
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,038
<i>- Our show, Jerry?
- Right.</i>

96
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,663
<i>Jerry? Oh, my God...</i>

97
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,399
<i>- ... he wants to talk about Jerry?
- Yeah.</i>

98
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,339
- When?
- Today, like right now.

99
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,604
Right now?

100
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,974
<i>- Jerry?
- Jerry.</i>

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,639
<i>- He wants to talk about Jerry?
- He wants to talk about Jerry.</i>

102
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,806
<i>- Jerry.
- Jerry.</i>

103
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,509
- Can I go like this?
- Sure.

104
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,520
No sports jacket? I don't need one?
Writers wear sports jackets.

105
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,487
- Forget it.
- I won't feel like a writer.

106
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,819
- You're not a writer.
- Right.

107
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,793
Water.

108
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,203
Need some water.

109
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,006
Water here.

110
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,880
Okay, now, listen. I don't want any
scenes in here like the last time.

111
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,072
- Don't worry. No scenes.
- Don't blow this.

112
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,341
I will not blow this.

113
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,850
If he says he doesn't want it to be
a show about nothing, don't go nuts.

114
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,581
- It doesn't have to be.
- He might not want nothing.

115
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,384
Something, nothing.
I could care less.

116
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,356
He might want a show
about everything.

117
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,223
Anything. Everything. Something.
Nothing. Who the hell cares?

118
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,957
- Put me down. I'm down.
- All right.

119
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,226
Mr. Kimbrough
is ready to see you.

120
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,400
- Magic time.
- What?

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,464
Mr. Kimbrough.

122
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,938
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hello.

123
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,099
Hey, hey, hey.

124
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,575
- How you been?
- Good. You remember George.

125
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,844
- George, good to see you.
- Hello, Stu.

126
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,277
You remember Jay Crespi.

127
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,113
Jay Crespi.
I'm gonna forget Jay Crespi, huh?

128
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,346
- This is James Kimbrough.
- Nice to meet you.

129
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,047
- Thanks for coming in.
- Kimbrough.

130
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,662
- Don't spell.
- K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H.

131
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,956
- That's right.
- Yeah. It's a talent I have.

132
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,027
Why don't we sit down?
I'm glad you're here.

133
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,463
Some day out there, huh?

134
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,797
Did you ever see
weather like that?

135
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,996
It's crisp.

136
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,470
It's Crespi-crisp.

137
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,938
Shut up, George.

138
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,167
Can I get you anything?

139
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,411
What do we have
in the fruit department?

140
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,272
Pineapple.

141
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,144
That's a dangerous fruit.
It's like a weapon, that thing.

142
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Got spikes on the end.
Get killed from one of those things.

143
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,656
Anyway, let me tell you
why I called.

144
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,589
When I took over here, I reviewed
what was in development...

145
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,524
...and it was pretty much
same old.

146
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,060
Been there, done that.

147
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,530
Right. I was looking for something
different. Something that would have...

148
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,169
- ...people talking at the water coolers.
- Water coolers?

149
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,101
We call it a water-cooler show.

150
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,175
Because the next day, people gather
around the water coolers...

151
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,640
...to talk about it, right?

152
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,114
I would think people would talk about it
at the coffee machines.

153
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,911
Well, it's probably just easier
to say water-cooler show...

154
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,076
...than coffee-machine show.

155
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,516
It's really not accurate.

156
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,351
Nobody drinks from a water cooler
anymore, they use bottles.

157
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,824
But I think Mr. Kimbrough
makes a good point.

158
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,294
<i>Anyway, Stu here started telling me
about a show, Jerry...</i>

159
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,127
...that he developed
five years ago.

160
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,360
I have always loved it.

161
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,299
He said it was a show
about nothing.

162
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,839
So I saw the pilot,
and I've gotta tell you...

163
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,066
...I flipped out.

164
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,336
He totally flipped out.

165
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,475
What I wanna do is put it on the air.
Thirteen episode commitment.

166
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,049
Start it off on Wednesday night,
build an audience.

167
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,210
This show needs time to grow.

168
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,854
I love that Kramer guy.

169
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,512
He's a little off-the-wall.

170
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,488
- Oh, yeah, off-the-wall.
- Kramer.

171
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,628
And Elaine, I wouldn't mind seeing
something happening between you.

172
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,821
- Definitely.
- I tell you, I-

173
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,297
I really don't think
so-called relationship humor...

174
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,197
...is what this show's all about.

175
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,168
Or we can not do the show
altogether. How about that?

176
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,908
Or we could get them together.

177
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,287
Jill. Hi, it's Elaine.

178
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,622
Yeah, well,
I'm calling from my home.

179
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,525
Indoors.

180
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,863
Well- Well, I was just calling
to see how your fath-

181
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,537
I'm sorry, I'm getting another call.
Hang on just a second.

182
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,638
- Hello.
- Hi, Elaine, it's me.

183
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,136
<i>- I'm on the other line.
- This is an emergency.</i>

184
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,302
Get off the phone.

185
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,477
I'm sorry, Jill.

186
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,915
I'm gonna have to take this call.

187
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,048
Jerry, what's the emergency?

188
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,315
<i>Jerry's back on, the TV show.</i>

189
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,721
George and I
are moving to California.

190
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,383
That's the emergency?

191
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,963
- Did you hear what I said?
- I was on the other line talking to Jill.

192
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,590
Jill? Well,
why didn't you say so?

193
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,633
You said it was an emergency.

194
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,135
So now she's lost
a phone face-off?

195
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,934
That's even worse than
your cell phone walk-and-talk.

196
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,939
Congratulations.
They're doing the show.

197
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,378
They should have
put that show on five years ago.

198
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,108
Bunch of idiots at that network.

199
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,309
Can I tell you something, Jerry?

200
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,250
It's all crap on TV.

201
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,153
<i>The only thing I watch
is Xena: The Warrior Princess.</i>

202
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,816
She must be about 6'6".

203
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,859
She's not 6'6".

204
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,123
- Jerry, you ever watch that?
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

205
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,695
They picked up the show?

206
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,529
I'm moving to California.

207
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,264
Oh, baby doll, this kid's going places.
I told you.

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,203
The NBC guy liked it?

209
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,310
- Of course he liked it.
- He told you he liked it?

210
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,637
He wouldn't put it on
if he didn't like it.

211
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,672
Well, what are you doing?

212
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,613
- I'm writing.
- You know how to write?

213
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,777
Without the writing, you have nothing.
You make them look good.

214
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,752
Since when do you know
how to write?

215
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,552
- I never saw you write anything.
- Ma.

216
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,624
I don't know how you're gonna
write all those shows.

217
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,957
And where are you gonna
get all the ideas?

218
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,124
Would you leave him alone?
You'll shatter his confidence.

219
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,237
I don't need any ideas.
It's a show about nothing.

220
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,373
Nothing, please.
I'll tell you the truth.

221
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,135
The whole thing
sounds pretty stupid to me.

222
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,543
NBC is letting me
use their private jet?

223
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,878
And I can go anywhere I want?

224
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,652
That is fantastic.

225
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,947
Thanks. Yeah.

226
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,216
Great. Okay, bye.

227
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,252
Oh, hey.

228
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,860
Hey. How was the beach?

229
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,894
<i>You missed it, buddy.
Lot of femeninas.</i>

230
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,157
<i>Some major femeninas.</i>

231
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,267
Had a little meeting today
at NBC.

232
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,266
What are you doing?

233
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,573
You know, I went swimming.
I can't get this water out of my ear.

234
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,606
<i>So do you remember five years ago,
we did that pilot, Jerry?</i>

235
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,214
Well, the new guy at NBC
wants to do it.

236
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,977
They're putting it on the air. They're
giving us a 13 episode commitment.

237
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,678
George and I
are moving to California.

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,790
You're moving to California?

239
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,357
Yeah, but only for a while.

240
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
Yeah, but, Jerry,
what happens if the show's a hit?

241
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,094
You could be out there for years.

242
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,755
You might never come back.

243
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,959
- No, I'll be back.
- Jerry, it's L.A.

244
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,694
Nobody leaves.

245
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,205
She's a seductress,
she's a siren, she's a virgin...

246
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,606
...she's a whore.

247
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,310
And my agent said as a bonus
I can use their private jet.

248
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,450
So we'll all go somewhere,
the four of us.

249
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,313
One big fling before George
and I go to California.

250
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,045
A fling.

251
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,554
- So we can go anywhere we want?
- Go anywhere.

252
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,632
- Why are they doing this?
- I think they wanna make it up to us...

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,268
...because they let this
sit on their shelf for years.

254
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,428
This is all very exciting.

255
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,335
So where we going?

256
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,170
Well, I say Japan.

257
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,174
- Why Japan?
- Oh, geishas.

258
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,643
You know,
they cater to your every whim.

259
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,783
They're shy at first, but they're
quite skilled at conversation.

260
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,648
They can discuss anything, from
world affairs to the fine art of fishing.

261
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,015
Or baking.

262
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,921
I got it.
How about Russia?

263
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,486
Russia. It's so bleak.

264
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,857
It's not bleak.

265
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,329
- It's springtime.
- It's still bleak.

266
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,991
You can't be bleak in spring.

267
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,636
You can be bleak in spring.

268
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,830
If you're bleak, you're bleak.

269
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,209
What about Switzerland?

270
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,279
Switzerland.
The von Trapp family, huh?

271
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,879
It's a bit hilly. No?

272
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,010
You're not gonna do any walking.

273
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,155
What if I wanna
walk around a little?

274
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,023
So then you'll walk down the hill
and we'll pick you up.

275
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,022
- What if I'm at the bottom?
- You know what, forget it.

276
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
All right, come on.
Come on now, people.

277
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,363
Let's face it. We're not all
gonna agree on anything.

278
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,734
Why don't we just
all go to Paris?

279
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,974
I'll go to Paris.

280
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,269
- Me too.
- Yeah.

281
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,713
- So that's it. It's settled.
- Yeah.

282
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,920
We're going to Paris.

283
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,817
Yeah!

284
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,622
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs.

285
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,437
I'm just gonna call Jill
one more time before we go.

286
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,165
Elaine, you can't make a call
like that on your way out.

287
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,502
You can't rush that conversation.

288
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,373
Well, I can't call from the limo.
Can I call from the plane?

289
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,480
First you make
a cell phone walk-and-talk...

290
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,639
...then she loses
a call waiting face-off...

291
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,876
...now you're talking about
a plane call?

292
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,613
All right, I'll just have
to call her from Paris.

293
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,191
Hello, Jerry.

294
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,125
Hello, Newman. What gives?

295
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,890
I was speaking earlier
with Kramer...

296
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,661
...and he mentioned something
about a private jet to Paris.

297
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,928
Yeah, that's right.

298
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,596
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful
there this time of year...

299
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,639
...and you know
I'm one-quarter French.

300
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,936
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

301
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,079
In fact, I still have family there.

302
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,647
This probably
won't interest you...

303
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,580
...but I have a cousin there
who's suffering very badly.

304
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,545
She's lost all use
of her muscles.

305
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,191
She can only communicate
by blinking.

306
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,293
I would so love to see her.

307
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,589
Bring a ray of sunshine
into her tragic life.

308
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,459
But, alas, I can't afford it.

309
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,933
For I am, as you know,
but a simple postal worker.

310
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,263
- That's a shame.
- Take me! Take me!

311
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,428
Oh, forget it.

312
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,700
Pull yourself together.
You're making me sick.

313
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,468
Be a man.

314
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,003
All right.

315
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,477
But hear me and hear me well.

316
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,052
The day will come. Oh, yes.

317
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,349
Mark my words, Seinfeld.

318
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,515
Your day of reckoning
is coming.

319
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,924
When an evil wind will blow
through your little play world...

320
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,157
...and wipe that smug smile
off your face.

321
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,395
And I'll be there,
in all my glory, watching.

322
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:44,031
Watching as it all
comes crumbling down.

323
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,616
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

324
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,819
I'm Captain Maddox.

325
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,123
This is my copilot, Kurt Adams.

326
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,323
- Ready to go to Paris?
- All set.

327
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,832
- We'll just grab the bags.
- Don't worry about that.

328
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,461
- We'll take care of them for you.
- Just keeps getting better and better.

329
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,605
Not bad.

330
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,572
The only way to fly.

331
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,415
This is it?

332
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,347
I'm sorry, I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

333
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,821
I thought it would be a lot nicer.

334
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,188
You're complaining
about a private jet?

335
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,557
You think this is the plane
that Ted Danson gets?

336
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,564
Ted Danson is not even
on the network anymore.

337
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,635
I bet when they gave him a plane,
it was a lot nicer than this.

338
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,101
Will you shut up?

339
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,173
You are ruining the whole trip.

340
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,576
This is a real piece of junk.

341
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,275
I don't even feel safe
on this thing.

342
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,178
- I have a good mind to write a letter-
- You're not writing any letters.

343
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,843
- Will you turn around?
- Why?

344
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,649
You are annoying me
sitting like that.

345
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,347
It's effeminate.

346
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,016
- It's effeminate to sit like this?
- Yes.

347
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,958
I think it's a little effeminate.

348
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,689
How is this effeminate?

349
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,269
I don't know. It just is.

350
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,108
- What are you doing?
- You still got water in your ear?

351
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,576
I can't get rid of it.
Maybe it leaked inside my brain.

352
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,580
Kramer, stop that. It's not safe
to be jumping on a plane.

353
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,877
I gotta get it out.
I can't take this anymore.

354
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,385
Kramer, don't be
fooling around up here.

355
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,923
- Kramer!
- Hey, get the hell out of here.

356
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,218
What is that?

357
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,054
Oh, my God.

358
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,156
- What is that noise?
- Kramer, what the hell did you do?

359
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,492
I lost my balance.

360
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,895
Oh, my God.

361
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,468
What's going on?

362
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,472
- Kramer!
- It was an accident!

363
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,575
I told you to stop
with the hopping!

364
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,337
Oh, my God,
we're going down.

365
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,740
We're gonna die.

366
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,611
Just when I was doing great.

367
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,082
I told you God wouldn't let me
be successful.

368
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,086
Is this it? Is this how it ends?

369
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,816
It can't. It can't end like this.

370
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,550
I'm ready. I'm ready.

371
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,752
Glory hallelujah.

372
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,633
- Jerry? Jerry, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

373
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,701
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What? What is it?

374
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,606
- I cheated in the contest.
- What?

375
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,436
- The contest, I cheated.
- Why?

376
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,838
Because I'm a cheater!

377
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,481
I had to tell you.

378
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,742
Great, I won.

379
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,287
- Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
- Yeah.

380
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,583
Elaine, I've got something
I wanna say to you.

381
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,250
- No, no. Me first.
- All right.

382
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,330
Jerry, I've always-

383
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,899
Hey, what's going on?

384
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,126
We're straightening out.

385
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,566
- We're straightening out.
- We're straightening out.

386
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,764
- We're straightening out.
- Yeah!

387
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,075
Well, again,
sorry about that little mishap.

388
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,045
Once we get everything checked,
shouldn't be any more problems.

389
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,481
- Where are we?
- Latham, Massachusetts.

390
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,622
Why don't you take a cab into town,
get yourself something to eat?

391
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,190
I got your beeper number,
I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.

392
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,349
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

393
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,428
We'll see you later.

394
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,501
Well, what are we gonna do
about Paris?

395
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,170
I mean, are we actually
gonna get back on this plane?

396
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,408
I say we go back to New York
and take a regular flight.

397
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,450
I'm not getting on
a regular plane now.

398
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,485
I'm all psyched up
to go on a private jet.

399
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,681
No way I'm getting on
a regular plane.

400
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,725
Well, I'm sure that they would
fly us first class.

401
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,192
First class
doesn't make it anymore.

402
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,924
You get on the phone with Kimbrough
and tell him to get another plane here.

403
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,967
But this time, the good one.
The Ted Danson plane.

404
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,231
- All right, I'll feel him out.
- Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.

405
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,270
Nice day.

406
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,171
Another one.

407
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,808
All right, fatso,
out of the car.

408
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,309
I'm gonna capture this.

409
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,179
- Come on.
- I'm getting out. Give me a minute.

410
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,253
- Give me your wallet.
- Don't shoot.

411
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,687
Well, there goes the money
for the lipo.

412
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,621
See, the great thing about
robbing a fat guy is...

413
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,353
...it's an easy getaway,
you know?

414
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,055
They can't really chase you.

415
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,094
He's actually doing him a favor.

416
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,736
It's less money for him
to buy food.

417
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,671
I want your wallet. Come on.
Come on, come on!

418
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,134
That's a shame.

419
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,607
All right, I'm gonna call NBC.

420
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,246
Officer, he's stealing my car.

421
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,745
Officer, I was carjacked.

422
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,816
- I was held up at gunpoint.
- I understand.

423
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,111
Okay. Thanks anyway.
They can't get another plane.

424
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,950
What's wrong with the plane we got?
They're checking it out.

425
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,591
- No, no, no.
- Forget that.

426
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,488
- Forget it.
- We're not getting on there.

427
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,129
Come on, let's get something
to eat here in Sticksville.

428
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,657
- All right. Hold it right there.
- What?

429
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,762
- You're under arrest.
- Under arrest? What for?

430
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,498
Article 223-7
of the Latham County Penal Code.

431
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,665
What? No, no,
we didn't do anything.

432
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,333
That's exactly right.

433
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,878
The law requires you to help
or assist anyone in danger...

434
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,039
...as long as it's reasonable
to do so.

435
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,476
I never heard of that.

436
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,281
It's new. It's called
the Good Samaritan Law.

437
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,318
- Let's go.
- Well-

438
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,001
A Good Samaritan law?
Are they crazy?

439
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,864
- Why would we help somebody?
- I know.

440
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,529
That's what nuns
and Red Cross workers are for.

441
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,574
The Samaritans
were an ancient tribe.

442
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,472
Very helpful to people.

443
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,812
All right.

444
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,915
Excuse me. Hi.

445
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,177
Could you tell me
what kind of law this is?

446
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,514
Well, they just passed it
last year.

447
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,418
And it's modeled
after the French law.

448
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,854
I heard about it
after Princess Diana was killed...

449
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,051
...and those photographers
were standing around.

450
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,490
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

451
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,654
You're the first ones
to be arrested on it...

452
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,732
...probably in the whole country.

453
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,658
All right,
so, what's the penalty?

454
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,202
Let's pay the fine
and get the hell out of here.

455
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:25,366
Well, it's not that easy. See, the law
calls for a maximum fine of $85,000...

456
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,375
...and as much as
five years in prison.

457
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,038
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no.

458
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,080
We have to be in California
next week.

459
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,717
We're starting a TV show.

460
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,080
California?
Oh, gosh, I don't think so.

461
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,620
My guess is
you're gonna be prosecuted.

462
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,781
Better get yourselves
a good lawyer.

463
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,226
Who told you to put the cheese on?
Did I tell you?

464
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,163
<i>- I didn't tell you to put it on.
- Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.</i>

465
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,236
You people with the cheese.
It never ends.

466
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,505
Hello.

467
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,242
Good Samaritan Law?
I never heard of it.

468
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,315
You don't have to help anybody.
That's what this country's about.

469
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,782
That's deplorable,
unfathomable, improbable.

470
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,012
Hold on. Susie.

471
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,247
Cancel my appointment
with Dr. Byson.

472
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,482
And pack a bag for me.

473
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,354
I wanna get to Latham,
Massachusetts right away.

474
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,328
So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?

475
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,899
And you know what that means.

476
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,764
This whole place
is gonna be swarming with media.

477
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,404
By the time this thing is over...

478
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,473
...you're not gonna be able
to find a hotel room in this town.

479
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,206
The whole country
is going to be watching this.

480
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,176
Now, we gotta do
whatever it takes to win it.

481
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,441
No matter what the cost.

482
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:43,111
And a big issue in this trial
is going to be character.

483
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,154
Find out everything
about these people.

484
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,885
And I mean everything.

485
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,265
It's pretty good chow, huh?

486
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,400
It would kill him
to check up on us?

487
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,637
No. Drops off the meals
and that's it.

488
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,641
I realize we're prisoners,
but we're still entitled to ketchup.

489
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,117
I guess we could have
called for help.

490
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,656
But then we would have missed
the whole thing.

491
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,556
I still had it on video.
We could have watched it later.

492
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,025
Yeah, he's right.

493
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,824
I forgot about the video.

494
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,558
Oh, sure, video.

495
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,497
What is that?

496
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,130
Plane's ready.

497
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,043
I'm Geraldo Rivera.
We'll be talking about...

498
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,280
...what most of you have probably
been discussing in your homes...

499
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,754
...and around the water coolers
in your offices.

500
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,019
I'm speaking of the controversial
Good Samaritan trial...

501
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,993
...that gets underway Thursday
in Latham, Massachusetts.

502
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,963
Now, before we meet our panel,
let's go to Latham live...

503
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,432
...where Jane Wells
is standing by. Jane.

504
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,094
<i>Yes, good evening, Geraldo.</i>

505
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,137
<i>What's the mood?
What's going on tonight?</i>

506
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,537
<i>Well, Latham
is fairly quiet tonight...</i>

507
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,441
<i>...considering the media circus that
has descended upon this quaint town.</i>

508
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,674
And what about the defendants,
the so-called New York Four?

509
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,044
How are they holding up?

510
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,243
Well, I did speak
with one of the deputies...

511
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,617
...who has some contact with them,
and he told me, quote:

512
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,951
"There's no love lost
with that group."

513
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,354
Anything else, Jane?

514
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,621
There also seems to be some friction
between Mr. Seinfeld and Ms. Benes.

515
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,962
The rumor is that they once dated,
and it's possible that ended badly.

516
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:42,470
Well, who knows, maybe this trial
will bring them closer together.

517
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,132
Maybe they'll even end up
getting married.

518
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,378
I hope you packed enough.

519
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,014
This trial could last for weeks.

520
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,443
What's all that?

521
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,914
- Cereal.
- You're packing cereal?

522
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,746
I'm bringing it for Jerry.

523
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,253
- You got enough for a life sentence.
- He likes it.

524
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,981
He misses that
more than anything.

525
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,625
So bring a snack pack.

526
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:02,953
Poor Georgie.

527
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,221
Was it our fault
this happened to him?

528
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,365
Did we do something wrong?

529
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,261
Maybe it was our fault.

530
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,992
Maybe it was your fault.

531
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,932
It wasn't my fault,
I can tell you that.

532
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,096
Oh, so it was my fault
but not yours.

533
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,832
You were the one
who smothered him.

534
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,341
- I did not smother him.
- You smothered.

535
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,845
He couldn't get any air. He couldn't
breathe. He was suffocating!

536
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:28,281
Sure. And you were always in Korea
with your religious chachkas.

537
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,978
I had to make a living!

538
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,834
This is excellent, huh?

539
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,482
Don't worry, I didn't use too much milk,
because I know we gotta make it last.

540
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,044
You know, I've had to reduce
my milk level.

541
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,588
I've always filled to three-quarters,
sometimes to the top of the cereal.

542
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,522
Now to conserve,
I can't even see the milk anymore.

543
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,356
- It's a big adjustment.
- I bet.

544
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,998
It's one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

545
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,826
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jackie.

546
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,029
- Good morning.
- Is everybody ready?

547
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,636
Didn't I tell you I wanted you
to wear the cardigan?

548
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,071
- Makes me look older.
- Look older?

549
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,646
You think this is a game?
That what you think this is?

550
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,215
I'm trying to give you a moral
compass. You have none.

551
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,113
You're gonna walk
into that courtroom...

552
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,754
...and they'll see a mean,
nasty, evil George Costanza.

553
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,050
I want them to see Perry Como.
No one's gonna convict Perry Como.

554
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,819
Perry Como helps out a fat tub
who's getting robbed.

555
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,252
You think it's funny?

556
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,521
No.

557
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,962
You damn right it isn't.

558
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,602
You better not be laughing
in that courtroom, funnyman.

559
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,900
If you start getting all smart-alecky,
making wisecracks, acting a fool...

560
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,010
...you're gonna find yourself in here
for a long, long time.

561
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,043
I don't like that tie.

562
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,110
Susie, get one of my ties
from my briefcase.

563
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,443
How do I look, Jackie?

564
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,915
Oh, you looking good.

565
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
You look strong.

566
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,119
You one fine-looking,
sexy lady.

567
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,258
Thank you, Jackie.

568
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,520
What about me, Jackie?

569
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,493
Kramer, you always look good.

570
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,099
You got respect for yourself.
You're genuine.

571
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,167
The jury's gonna pick up on that.

572
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,902
Here.

573
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,963
- This one?
- That's right.

574
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,269
- Do I have to?
- Jackie says put it on, Jerry.

575
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,238
All rise.

576
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,947
Fourth District County Court, Latham,
Massachusetts is now in session.

577
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,413
The Honorable Judge
Arthur Vandelay presiding.

578
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,216
Vandelay?

579
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,517
- The judge's name is Vandelay?
- Vanda who?

580
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,490
- Jerry, did you hear that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,923
I think that's a good sign.

582
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,792
Is the district attorney
ready to proceed?

583
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,795
We are, Your Honor.

584
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,093
Mr. Hoyt.

585
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,266
Ladies and gentlemen,
last year our city council...

586
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,569
...by a vote of 12-to-2,
passed a Good Samaritan law.

587
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,042
Now, essentially,
we made it a crime...

588
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,647
...to ignore a fellow
human being in trouble.

589
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,808
Now, this group
from New York...

590
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,682
...not only ignored,
but as we will prove...

591
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:55,383
...they actually mocked the victim
as he was being robbed at gunpoint.

592
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,088
I can guarantee you one other thing,
ladies and gentlemen...

593
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,995
...this is not the first time
they have behaved in this manner.

594
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,559
On the contrary.

595
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,705
They have quite a record
of mocking and maligning.

596
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,467
This is a history of selfishness,
self-absorption...

597
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,476
...immaturity and greed.

598
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,615
And you will see
how everyone...

599
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,945
...who has come into contact
with these four individuals...

600
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,054
...has been abused, wronged...

601
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,055
...deceived and betrayed.

602
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:29,715
This time...

603
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,522
...they have gone too far.

604
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,255
This time...

605
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,992
...they are going to be
held accountable.

606
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,601
This time...

607
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,230
...they are the ones who will pay.

608
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,878
Mr. Chiles?

609
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,838
I am shocked and chagrined.

610
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,344
Mortified and stupefied.

611
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,453
This trial is outrageous.

612
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,715
It is a waste of the taxpayers'
time and money.

613
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,485
It is a travesty of justice
that these four people...

614
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,185
...have been incarcerated
while the real perpetrator...

615
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,627
...is walking around laughing.

616
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,929
Lying and laughing.
Laughing and lying.

617
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,733
Do you know what
these four people were?

618
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,067
They were innocent bystanders.

619
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,073
Now, you just think
about that term.

620
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,645
Innocent bystanders.

621
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,281
That's exactly what they were.

622
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,917
We know they were bystanders,
nobody's disputing that.

623
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,315
So how can a bystander be guilty?
No such thing.

624
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,251
Have you ever heard
of a guilty bystander?

625
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:36,223
No. Because you cannot be
a bystander and be guilty.

626
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,123
Bystanders are,
by definition, innocent.

627
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,093
That is the nature
of bystanding.

628
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,789
But, no.

629
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
They wanna change
nature here.

630
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,765
They wanna create
a whole new animal.

631
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,134
The guilty bystander.

632
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,810
But don't you let them do it.

633
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,547
Only you can stop them.

634
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,511
Thank you.

635
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,083
<i>That was wonderful. Thank you.</i>

636
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,625
Is the prosecution ready
to present its first witness?

637
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,265
We are, Your Honor.

638
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,529
Call Officer Matt Vogel
to the stand.

639
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,866
Call Matt Vogel.

640
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,779
- So they were just standing there?
- Yes.

641
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,280
Did one of them have
a video camera?

642
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,539
Yes.

643
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,681
With the court's permission,
we would like to play back that video...

644
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,720
...and enter it into evidence
as Exhibit A.

645
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,750
Proceed.

646
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,960
<i>- Come on.
- Okay, I'm getting out.</i>

647
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,494
<i>Well, there goes the money
for the lipo.</i>

648
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,100
<i>See, the great thing about robbing
a fat guy is it's an easy getaway.</i>

649
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,826
<i>They can't really chase you.</i>

650
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,992
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

651
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,934
<i>He's actually doing him a favor.</i>

652
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,267
<i>It's less money
for him to buy food.</i>

653
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,210
So they just stood there
and did nothing?

654
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,520
Yeah. Nothing. Nothing.

655
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,886
No further questions.

656
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,355
Hey, great plane.

657
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,093
Thanks a lot.

658
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,250
Piece of junk.

659
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,021
You know,
you almost got us killed.

660
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,161
Call Mabel Choate to the stand.

661
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,028
Call Mabel Choate.

662
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,340
Your Honor, I most strenuously
and vigorously object to this witness.

663
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,173
She was not present
at the incident.

664
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,544
Her testimony is irrelevant,
irrational and inconsequential.

665
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,351
The prosecution has gone to great
lengths and considerable cost...

666
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,455
...to find these character witnesses.

667
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,582
It is imperative that we establish
this is not merely an isolated incident.

668
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,888
It's part of a pattern
of antisocial behavior...

669
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,758
...that's been going on for years.

670
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,693
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you.

671
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,027
I'll hear the witness.

672
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,471
Now, Mrs. Choate,
would you please tell the court...

673
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,870
...what happened
the evening of January 4th?

674
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,373
Well, I was in Schnitzer's Bakery
when I got accosted by that man.

675
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,709
Let the record show
that she's pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.

676
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,874
What did he want?

677
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,915
My marble rye.

678
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,083
Your marble rye?

679
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,554
I got the last one.

680
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,920
He kept persisting,
and I said no.

681
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,584
- Then you left the bakery.
- Right.

682
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,889
But it didn't end there,
did it, Mrs. Choate?

683
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,430
Oh, no.

684
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,628
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it. Let go.

685
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,099
I want that rye, lady.

686
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,601
Help. Someone, help.

687
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,261
Shut up, you old bag.

688
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,070
Stop, thief. Please, stop him.
Stop him, he's got my marble rye.

689
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,773
No further questions.

690
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,941
I call Marla Penny to the stand.

691
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,742
Call Marla Penny.

692
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,653
The virgin.

693
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,356
What was your connection
to the defendants?

694
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,260
I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks
in the autumn of 1992.

695
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,871
Then on October 28th, there was
an abrupt end to that relationship.

696
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,301
Tell us what happened.

697
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,100
Well, it's rather difficult
to talk about.

698
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,272
It's all right. Take your time.

699
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,881
Well, I became aware of a-

700
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,108
A what?

701
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,678
- A...
- Yes?

702
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,556
A contest.

703
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,691
- A contest?
- Yes.

704
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,952
What was the nature
of the contest?

705
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,460
Oh, please, I can't.

706
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,564
It's okay.

707
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,623
The four of them...

708
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,793
- ...made a wager to see if they could-
- Yes?

709
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,605
To see who could
go the longest...

710
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,174
...without gratifying themselves.

711
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,976
- Boy, this is an outrage.
- For the love of God.

712
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,478
It was horrible. Horrible.

713
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,983
Call Donald Sanger to the stand.

714
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,846
Who the hell is that?

715
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,651
Come on, Donald.
You're doing fine.

716
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,124
- The Bubble Boy.
- Bubble Boy?

717
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,286
That's right, the Bubble Boy.

718
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,556
What's a Bubble Boy?

719
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,700
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.

720
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,962
What the hell
are you all looking at?

721
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,537
Would you please tell the court
about the incident...

722
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:20,336
...that occurred in your house,
October 7th, 1992?

723
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,810
Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed
to come to my house...

724
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,711
...but his friend Costanza
showed up instead.

725
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,183
So I challenged him
to a game of Trivial Pursuit.

726
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:34,052
Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?

727
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,284
That's a joke. The Moors.

728
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,690
Oh, no.

729
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,088
I'm so sorry, it's the Moops.

730
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,631
The correct answer
is the Moops.

731
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,827
Moops? Let me see that.

732
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,397
That's not Moops, you jerk.

733
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,873
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

734
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,343
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

735
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,184
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.

736
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,081
There's no Moops.

737
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,280
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

738
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,915
Moops.

739
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,491
Help, someone.

740
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,184
There's no Moops, you idiot.

741
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,726
Stop it. Let go of him.

742
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,387
Donald. Stop it.

743
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,432
No. Donald, stop it.

744
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,402
- It was Moops.
- Moors.

745
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,072
So Mr. Costanza parked in
a handicapped spot, and as a result...

746
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,414
...you got in an accident
and your wheelchair was destroyed?

747
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,748
- That's right.
- And then Mr. Kramer...

748
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,289
...gave you a used wheelchair?

749
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,051
That's right.

750
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,000
So you were the doctor on duty
the night Susan Ross died?

751
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,640
Yes, that's right.

752
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:02,040
It was May 16th, 1996.

753
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,544
I'll never forget it.

754
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,308
So you broke the news
to Mr. Costanza?

755
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,451
Would you tell the court, please,
what his reaction was.

756
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,286
I would describe it...

757
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,687
...as restrained jubilation.

758
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,156
- Murderer!
- He killed our daughter.

759
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,821
He knew those envelopes
were toxic!

760
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,961
Order in this court.

761
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,166
Call Sidra Holland to the stand.

762
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,240
Look at this one. She's fine.

763
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,945
She's a 12.

764
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,949
You dated her?

765
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,222
So you met Jerry Seinfeld
in a health club...

766
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,484
- ...sometime in 1993?
- Yes.

767
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,652
- You met Ms. Benes in the same club?
- Yes, that's true.

768
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,890
Would you describe
the circumstances of that meeting?

769
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,367
We were in the sauna,
making chitchat.

770
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,266
You know,
I've seen you around the club.

771
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,304
My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

772
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh, hi.

773
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,174
- I'm Elaine.
- Hi.

774
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,743
So she pretended to trip...

775
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,578
...and she fell into your breasts.

776
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,078
Yes.

777
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,017
Why would she do that?

778
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,592
Because he sent her in there
to find out if they were real.

779
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,866
- State your name.
- Bookman. Joe Bookman.

780
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,969
- And what's your occupation?
- I'm a library cop.

781
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,565
What's a library cop do?

782
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,270
We chase down
library delinquents.

783
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,811
Anyone in this room
ever delinquent?

784
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,543
Yeah, he was. Right over there.
Seinfeld.

785
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,549
- How long was his book overdue?
- Twenty-five years.

786
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,547
We don't call them delinquent
after that long.

787
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,386
- What do you call them?
- Criminals.

788
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,127
So you and Mr. Costanza
were dating.

789
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,892
- Yes.
- And then what happened?

790
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,496
Well, I invited him to attend
my son's birthday party and...

791
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,770
Fire!

792
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,247
At the time, I was employed
as a security guard...

793
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,909
...in the parking garage
at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.

794
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,724
Okay, let's go.

795
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,418
Why would I
unless I was in danger?

796
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,189
- I know it's against the law.
- I don't know.

797
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,267
Because I could get uromysitisis
poisoning and die, that's why.

798
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,864
Uromysitisis.

799
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,065
I wonder if they're having any trouble
controlling themselves now.

800
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,473
Perhaps these two hooligans would
like to have a pee party right here!

801
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,206
Objection, Your Honor.
This is completely inappropriate.

802
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,475
My client's medical condition
is not on trial.

803
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,642
May I refer you
to the Disability Act of 1990.

804
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,015
Sit down, Mr. Chiles.

805
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,119
All right, detective,
then what happened?

806
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,521
We got a tip that a lot
of prostitutes had been...

807
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,354
...turning tricks in the parking lot.

808
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,723
- You just cost me some money.
- Hey, cool it, lady.

809
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,625
Cool it.

810
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,234
Cool it, lady. Cool it.

811
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,997
Police officers. Freeze right there.

812
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:19,375
So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact...

813
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,234
...a pimp.

814
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,377
So you asked Mr. Seinfeld
if he would wear your puffy shirt...

815
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,811
<i>...on the Today show?</i>

816
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,153
Excuse me?

817
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,755
Excuse me, Your Honor.
What is the point of this testimony?

818
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,089
This woman's a low talker.
I can't hear a word.

819
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,064
So either get some other kind of
microphone up there or let's move on.

820
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,296
Call George Steinbrenner
to the stand.

821
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,473
Call George Steinbrenner.

822
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,973
So George Costanza came
to work for you in May of 1994?

823
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,236
That's right. He was a good kid.
A lovely boy.

824
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,210
Shared his calzone with me.
That was a heck of a sandwich.

825
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,215
Yes, sir, that was
a good sandwich, sir.

826
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,751
- Had one little problem though.
- What was that?

827
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,321
He was a communist.
Pink as they come.

828
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,890
Like a big, juicy steak.

829
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,124
How could you give $12 million
to Hideki Irabu?

830
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,558
Order.

831
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,689
Cockfighting?

832
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,762
Cockfighting.

833
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,535
Sponges. And I don't mean
the kind you clean your tub with.

834
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,694
They're for sex.

835
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,775
She said she needed
a whole case of them.

836
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,911
She exposed her nipple.

837
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,844
- How did she try to kill you?
- She tried to smother me with a pillow.

838
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,756
Call Yev Kassem to the stand.

839
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,894
- Call Yev Kassem.
- Who?

840
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,125
The Soup Nazi.

841
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,288
Soup Nazi?

842
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,128
You people have a little pet name
for everybody.

843
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,725
State your name.

844
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,065
- Yev Kassem.
- Could you spell that, please?

845
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,764
No. Next question.

846
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,137
- How do you know the defendants?
- They used to come to my restaurant.

847
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,679
Medium turkey chili.

848
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,691
Medium crab bisque.

849
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,159
- I didn't get any bread.
- Just forget it. Let it go.

850
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,171
Excuse me. I think you forgot
my bread.

851
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,002
- You want bread?
- Yes, please.

852
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,837
Three dollars.

853
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,037
- What?
- No soup for you.

854
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,379
But the idiot clowns
did not know how to order.

855
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,787
I banned that one,
the woman, for a year.

856
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,550
Then one day...

857
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,989
...she came back.

858
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,255
Five cups chopped
porcine mushrooms...

859
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,331
...half a cup of olive oil...

860
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,491
...three pounds celery...

861
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,534
That's my recipe
for wild mushroom.

862
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,561
You're through, Soup Nazi.

863
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,065
Pack it up.

864
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,873
No more soup for you.

865
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,238
Next!

866
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,511
She published my recipes.

867
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,049
I had to close the store
and move to Argentina.

868
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,312
She ruined my business.

869
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,649
His soup's
not all that good anyway.

870
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,814
What did you say?

871
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,397
The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt
to the stand.

872
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,164
- How did they find Babu?
- I thought he was deported.

873
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,210
You've come a long way
to be here today, haven't you?

874
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,779
Yes. All the way from Pakistan.

875
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,109
And what's your connection
to the defendants?

876
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,813
I owned a restaurant.

877
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,081
Seinfeld told me to change
the menu to Pakistani.

878
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,781
But nobody came.

879
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,687
There were no people.

880
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,054
And then what happened?

881
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:02,130
Then he got me an apartment
in his building...

882
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,766
...but they mixed up the mail...

883
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,461
...and I never got
my immigration renewal papers.

884
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,037
So they deported me.

885
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:16,204
It's all his fault.
Him and the woman.

886
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,611
But they did not care.
They're totally indifferent.

887
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,581
All they do is mock me.
Just like they did the fat fellow.

888
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,745
All the time mocking,
mocking, mocking.

889
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,049
All the time.

890
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,988
Now it is Babu's turn to mock.

891
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,890
Finally, I will have some justice.

892
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,226
Send them away. Send them all away.
Lock them up forever.

893
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,132
They're not human.

894
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,700
They're very bad.

895
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,465
Very, very, very bad.

896
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,050
<i>Hi, I'm Geraldo Rivera, and welcome
to this special edition of Rivera Live.</i>

897
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,160
Arguments in the Good Samaritan
trial ended today...

898
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:08,765
...the jury has been in deliberation
for four and a half hours now.

899
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,833
Let's go live to Jane Wells,
who is in Latham, Massachusetts...

900
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,936
...covering this trial for us. Jane.

901
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,096
<i>Just a few minutes ago,
the jury asked to see the videotape.</i>

902
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,936
That's the one where they are
overheard making sarcastic remarks...

903
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,510
...during the robbery.

904
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,909
<i>Yes, it's a very incriminating
piece of evidence.</i>

905
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,413
<i>But I must tell you,
Geraldo...</i>

906
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,177
<i>...this courtroom and everyone
who's attended this trial...</i>

907
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,947
<i>...is still reeling from the endless
parade of witnesses...</i>

908
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,987
<i>...who've come forth
so enthusiastically...</i>

909
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,150
<i>...to testify against these
four seemingly ordinary people.</i>

910
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,728
One had the feeling that if Judge
Vandelay didn't put a stop to it...

911
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,559
...it could have
gone on for months.

912
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,133
Jane, whose testimony
do you think resonated...

913
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,793
...most strongly with this jury?

914
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,165
That is so hard to say.

915
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,001
Certainly, there's the doctor
with the poison invitations.

916
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,942
The Bubble Boy was an extremely
sympathetic and tragic figure.

917
00:46:56,113 --> 00:47:00,072
And that bizarre contest certainly
didn't sit well with this small-town jury.

918
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,718
There's the woman they sold
the defective wheelchair to.

919
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,013
The deported
Pakistani restaurateur.

920
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:10,354
Geraldo, it just went
on and on and on into the night.

921
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,552
And so we wait.

922
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,327
Do they make you wear uniforms
in prison?

923
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,758
I think so.

924
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,167
It's not that bright orange one, is it?

925
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,738
I hope it's not that one...

926
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,365
...because I cannot wear orange.

927
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,635
Will you stop worrying?

928
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,212
Jackie's gonna get us off.
He never loses.

929
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,645
How about when he asked that cop
if a black man...

930
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,685
...had ever been to his house.
Did you see the look on his face?

931
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,849
Sorry to bother you, judge.

932
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,516
How did you get in here?

933
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,323
Please. If he's found guilty...

934
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,931
...please be kind to him.

935
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,897
He's a good boy.

936
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,060
This is highly irregular.

937
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,696
Well, maybe there's something
I can do for you.

938
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,206
What do you mean?

939
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,276
You know.

940
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,092
Oh, Jackie. You're so articulate.

941
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,456
We got plenty of time too.

942
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,531
This jury could be out for days.

943
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,238
Hello.

944
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,564
Damn.

945
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,374
They're ready.

946
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,051
Hey, Elaine. What was it you were
about to say to me on the plane...

947
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,884
...when it was going down?

948
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,951
I've always loved...

949
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,620
...United Airlines.

950
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,989
I think it's gonna be okay.

951
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,761
That girl just smiled at me.

952
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,731
Maybe because she knows
you're going to jail.

953
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,897
What?

954
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,501
All rise.

955
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,810
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

956
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,011
...have you reached a verdict?

957
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,287
We have, Your Honor.

958
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,548
Will the defendants please rise?

959
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:04,587
And how do you find with respect
to the charge of criminal indifference?

960
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,292
We find the defendants...

961
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:08,621
...guilty.

962
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,334
Oh, no!

963
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,731
Order in this court.

964
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,271
Order! Order in this court!

965
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,811
I will clear this room.

966
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,244
I do not know how...

967
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,353
...or under what circumstances
the four of you found each other.

968
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,655
But your callous indifference
and utter disregard...

969
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,991
...for everything
that is good and decent...

970
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:45,760
...has rocked the very foundation
upon which our society is built.

971
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:50,161
I can think of nothing
more fitting...

972
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,434
...than for the four of you
to spend a year...

973
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,942
...removed from society...

974
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,973
...so that you can contemplate...

975
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:04,052
...the manner in which
you have conducted yourselves.

976
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,517
I know I will.

977
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,689
This court is adjourned.

978
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,789
You had to hop.

979
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,296
You had to hop on the plane!

980
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,225
Puddy.

981
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,704
- Don't wait for me.
- All right.

982
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,801
We gotta get out of here.

983
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,807
We wanna beat the traffic.

984
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,709
Come on, Jackie. Let's go.

985
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,379
What?

986
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,343
Oh, and by the way...

987
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,355
...they're real,
and they're spectacular.

988
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,760
Well, it's only a year.

989
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,490
That's not so bad.

990
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,294
We'll be out in a year.

991
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,766
And then we'll be back.

992
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,199
Could be fun.

993
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:58,671
Don't have to worry about your meals
or what you're gonna do Saturdays.

994
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,934
And they do shows.

995
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,509
Yeah, we could put on a show.

996
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,875
<i>Maybe Bye Bye Birdie
or My Fair Lady.</i>

997
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,040
Yeah, Elaine,
you could be Liza Doolittle.

998
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,552
Why don't you just
blow it out your a-?

999
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,804
If I call Jill from prison, you think that
would make up for the other ones?

1000
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:39,642
- Sure.
- Because you only get one call.

1001
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:43,547
The prison call is like
the king of calls.

1002
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,314
I think that would be
a very nice gesture.

1003
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,858
I got it.

1004
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,660
It's out.

1005
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,900
Not that bad, huh?

1006
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,668
Oh, boy, what a relief.

1007
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:12,011
See, now, to me, that button
is in the worst possible spot.

1008
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,374
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1009
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,814
The second button
is the key button.

1010
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,012
It literally makes
or breaks the shirt.

1011
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,020
Look at it. It's too high.

1012
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,182
It's in no man's land.

1013
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,760
Haven't we had
this conversation before?

1014
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,727
You think?

1015
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,930
I think we have.

1016
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,501
Yeah, maybe we have.

1017
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,077
So, what is the deal
with the yard?

1018
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,479
When I was a kid, my mother
wanted me to play in the yard...

1019
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,052
...but she didn't have to worry
about my neighbor...

1020
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,882
...sticking a shiv in my thigh.

1021
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,457
What's with the lockdown?
Why do we have to be locked in cells?

1022
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,223
Are we that bad that we have
to be sent to prison in prison?

1023
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,368
You would think the weightlifting
and the sodomy is enough.

1024
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,734
- So anyone from Cellblock D?
- I am.

1025
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,875
I'll talk slower.

1026
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,910
I'm kidding. I love Cellblock D.

1027
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,875
My friend George
is in Cellblock D.

1028
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,008
- What are you in for, sir?
- Murder one.

1029
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,948
Murder one.

1030
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,653
Watch out, everybody.
Better be nice to you.

1031
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,791
I'm only kidding, sir. Lighten up.

1032
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,949
- How about you?
- Grand theft auto.

1033
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,118
Grand theft auto.
Don't steal any of my jokes.

1034
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,854
You suck. I'm gonna cut you.

1035
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,693
I don't knock the license plate
out of your hand.

1036
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,062
All right, Seinfeld,
that's it. Let's go. Come on.

1037
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,726
All right.
Hey, you've been great.

1038
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,430
See you in the cafeteria.
