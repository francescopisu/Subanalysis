1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,766
- You sure you can't stay longer?
- No, we just came up for the funeral.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,035
Poor Marvin Kessler.
He went too early.

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,679
He was 96 years old.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,839
That had nothing to do with it.
The man was out of shape.

5
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,883
That's why we joined a program.

6
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,249
We walk once around the block
three times a week.

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,687
And every morning I eat a plum.

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,259
Well, whatever you're doing,
you're wearing me out.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,452
What about you?

10
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,894
Yeah, looks like you're getting
a little spare tire there, tiger.

11
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,466
- Really?
- Hey, Seinfelds.

12
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,694
- Hey, Mr. Kramer.
- How long you staying?

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,395
We just came to town for funeral.

14
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,473
Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard.
Yeah, Marvin Kessler.

15
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,803
Boy, that makes you think.

16
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,140
If he could go.

17
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,280
See you downstairs at the car.

18
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:50,711
Sure you don't need a hand?

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,045
No, no.
The luggage is on the program.

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,413
I got a brick in here.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,728
- Did you give blood?
- No, no, not giving. Hoarding.

22
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,832
I'm storing it at the blood bank,
just in case.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,024
In case of what?

24
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,499
Jerry, I know myself.

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,968
If I'm out on the street
and it starts to go down...

26
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,733
...I don't back off until it's finished.

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,973
- Are we finished?
- Done.

28
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,013
- Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,347
- You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
- I know.

30
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,354
Well, I'm glad I got to see him
before he hit puberty and got...

31
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:35,290
...you know, all lurchy and awkward.

32
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,761
Actually, I'm gonna need someone
to look after him tomorrow evening.

33
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,992
- Tomorrow evening? Sure.
- Do you know anyone responsible?

34
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,336
Do I know anyone?

35
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,870
If you think of anybody,
give me a call.

36
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,434
What are you doing?

37
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,241
Oh, incense. For the mood.

38
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,884
Oh, yes, by all means. The mood.

39
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:03,855
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to lend support for the mood.

40
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,319
- Cream soda?
- Vanilla.

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,799
Can you believe that?

42
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,635
Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible.

43
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,471
Who wants to be responsible?
Whenever anything goes wrong...

44
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,512
...the first thing they ask is,
"Who's responsible for this?"

45
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,410
I couldn't raise a kid?

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,983
Come on,
I love bossing people around.

47
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,586
- I thought you're with Tara tonight.
- I was. I had to leave.

48
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,751
She lit this vanilla incense.
The smell drove me nuts.

49
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,295
All I could think about was food.
I had to get out.

50
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,400
Gonna need some pudding here.
Pudding.

51
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,866
You just left? What did you tell her?

52
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,564
Told her I had a bus transfer
that was only good for another hour.

53
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,239
- What?
- I don't know. I was starving, Jerry.

54
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,175
Oh, pudding.

55
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,712
You want some?

56
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,283
Hey, you guys think
I'm getting a little chunky?

57
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,353
What? Are you kidding?
We look great.

58
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,546
You know what this pudding needs?

59
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,921
The skin on the top, like when your
mother used to make it on the stove.

60
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,083
What do you think?

61
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,390
I think you're getting a little pudding
under the skin yourself.

62
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,564
My service rates went up?

63
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,329
You banks are all the same...

64
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,771
...with your hidden fees
and your service charges.

65
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,104
Maybe I'll just take my blood
elsewhere, yeah.

66
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,212
We could transfer it
to another bank for you.

67
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,213
Oh, no, no. No more banks.
I'm keeping my blood in my freezer...

68
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,715
...with my money!

69
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,717
So, what do you say?

70
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,919
I guess we could use some food
in our lovemaking.

71
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,428
Okay, we got your-
Got your strawberries.

72
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,569
Your chocolate sauce.

73
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,136
Your pastrami on rye with mustard.

74
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,072
- Your honey-
- Wait.

75
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,142
Pastrami on rye with mustard?

76
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,709
Don't you remember they-?

77
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,540
<i>They used pastrami in that movie,
9 1/2 Weeks.</i>

78
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,275
- Remember the pastrami scene?
- No.

79
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,180
<i>Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters.</i>

80
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,015
Whatever it was, it worked.

81
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,460
- Didn't go for it, huh?
- No.

82
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,826
So she didn't appreciate the erotic
qualities of the salted-cured meats.

83
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,562
She tolerated the strawberries
and the chocolate sauce...

84
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,033
...but it's not a meal, you know?

85
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,372
Food and sex.
Those are my two passions.

86
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,876
It's only natural to combine them.

87
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,403
Natural?

88
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:46,609
Sex is about love between a man and
a woman, not a man and a sandwich.

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,788
Jerry, I'm not suggesting
getting rid of the girl.

90
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,446
She's integral.

91
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,092
Maybe instead of trying
to satisfy two of your needs...

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,956
...how about satisfying one
of somebody else's?

93
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,925
Speaking of which,
I found a way to separate the skin...

94
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,933
...from the top of the pudding
without leaving any on the edges.

95
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,798
X-Acto knife.

96
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,430
I told you, George, no more pudding.
I'm starting a purification program.

97
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,839
Keep all that kind of food
away from me.

98
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,311
Well, then I guess these would be
out of the question.

99
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,546
What the hell is that?

100
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,351
Pudding skin singles.

101
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,181
Hey, buddy.

102
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,794
Hey, I'm borrowing
all your Tupperware.

103
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,865
- Why?
- Closed my account at the blood bank.

104
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,032
What? It's here? It's in the building?

105
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,694
Right across the hall.

106
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,999
- What, you wanna go see it?
- No, I don't.

107
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,076
In fact, if even one corpuscle
of that blood...

108
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,112
...should find its way across that hall,
I will freak out on you, Kramer.

109
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,216
Freak out.

110
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,877
You know, for a fat guy,
you're not very jolly.

111
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,954
Hey. Working out?

112
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,061
You know it.
And I ditched all my junk food.

113
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,719
What the heck is going on here?

114
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,024
Sorry, buddy, cleaned house.
All health food.

115
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, I may have to take it,
but I don't have to like it.

116
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,605
Vivian left me a message.

117
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,003
I guess a certain someone...

118
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,973
...changed her mind whether
someone was responsible enough...

119
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,737
...to watch a certain other someone.

120
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,744
- Is this about me?
- No.

121
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,473
Then I've lost interest.

122
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,808
Vivian. Hi, it's Elaine.

123
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,045
Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's.
I got your message.

124
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,121
What?

125
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,918
Yeah, he's right here. Hold on.

126
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:37,085
For me? Go.

127
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,599
Yeah. What-? Yeah. Tonight?

128
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,261
Yeah, I'll be there.

129
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,930
Yeah, later.

130
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,934
Well, somebody's babysitting.

131
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,835
You? I'm more responsible
than you are.

132
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,236
Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,641
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
fill my freezer with my own blood.

134
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,659
Oh, Tara.

135
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,064
Hello, Vivian?

136
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,266
Boy, this is a nice screen.

137
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,600
- Kramer.
- Don't take my money.

138
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,177
It is me, you idiot.

139
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,715
Hi. You gotta get out of here. I'm
gonna babysit the hell out of that kid.

140
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,647
Wait a minute, I'm the babysitter.

141
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,118
No, no. You're out. I'm in.
Now, hit the road.

142
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,390
Elaine.

143
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,722
What are you doing here?

144
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:48,126
Kramer is actually sleeping one off,
so I thought that I would help out.

145
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,997
What is-? You got some raccoons
or something.

146
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,872
Well, I guess this will be all right.

147
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,443
Jimmy, you remember Elaine.

148
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,239
She's gonna watch you tonight.

149
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,574
Hi, Jimmy.

150
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,713
Hey, what are you doing here?

151
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,950
I thought you were supposed
to be babysitting.

152
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,855
There was an incident.

153
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,128
Oh, no. Where's the blood?

154
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,289
- It's in here, isn't it?
- Will you stop it?

155
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,832
What is this?

156
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,799
It's Jell-O.

157
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,999
What about this?
This is blood, isn't it?

158
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,573
This is tomato juice. Look.

159
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,404
Oh, you're sick. You're sick.

160
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,103
Will you calm down.
I took all my blood down to Newman's.

161
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,010
He let me put it in his meat freezer.

162
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,580
Hey, what's going on?
Who made pudding?

163
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,450
Oh, yeah. George, he came by.

164
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,385
He made more of those pudding skin
singles. They're delicious.

165
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,115
Damn that, George.

166
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,726
I told him I didn't want this stuff
around anymore.

167
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,522
Heads up.

168
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,993
You're dead, President Lincoln.

169
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,429
You're dead.

170
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,269
I wish I was dead.

171
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,100
Can I have your juice?

172
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,606
As long as you don't -

173
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,335
Thanks for the refill.

174
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,214
Hey, Elaine. How did it go?

175
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,410
Oh, he's a- He's a joy.

176
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,988
Really? Some sitters have told me
he's a bit of a handful.

177
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,717
Oh, handful of sunshine.

178
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,255
I wish I could do this every day.

179
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,887
Elaine, that's so good to hear.

180
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,556
I've been having
a few health problems lately.

181
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,464
- It's not serious, is it?
- Well, it might be.

182
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,571
Well, just in case
anything does happen...

183
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,139
...it's nice to know there's
somebody like you around.

184
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,104
Oh, yeah. That-

185
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,637
That is nice to know.

186
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,085
Hey, Jerry, it's okay. I'm right here.

187
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,851
I can see that. What happened?

188
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,729
Well, that-
That knife it... nicked your jugular.

189
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,990
You know, Jerry,
when somebody yells, "Heads up"...

190
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,364
...you're not supposed to
actually look up.

191
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,799
I'll remember that.

192
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,702
Anyway, you're lucky I was there.
You lost a lot of blood.

193
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,138
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

194
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,303
You got three pints
of Kramer in you, buddy.

195
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,151
Three pints of Kramer's blood?

196
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,495
I can feel his blood inside of me.

197
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,132
Borrowing things from my blood.

198
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,996
Well, so much for purification week.

199
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,972
So how's the fornicating gourmet?

200
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,936
Doing quite well, thank you.

201
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,912
Yesterday I had a soft-boiled egg
and a quickie.

202
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,711
You know what?

203
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,253
If I could add TV to the equation,
that would really be the ultimate.

204
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,254
George, we're trying
to have a civilization here.

205
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,051
- Hey.
- Hey, how was babysitting?

206
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,355
Oh, just great.

207
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,363
I found out that Vivian's got
some sort of a medical problem...

208
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,832
...and if the worst happens,
she wants me to take care of Jimmy.

209
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,801
- Well, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
- It doesn't matter.

210
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,033
I mean, if anything happens to her,
I'm on deck.

211
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:22,977
Scissor mishap, air show disaster,
Chinese organ thieves.

212
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,913
- It's a dangerous world.
- She's right.

213
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,851
I heard Kramer got mugged out
in the suburbs on a babysitting gig.

214
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,190
Really?

215
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,350
Look at this.

216
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,463
Look at the hair
on the back of my neck.

217
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,729
It's all brambly. See?

218
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,595
It's like a thicket back there.

219
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,800
Look, I need somebody
to shave it for me.

220
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,872
I'm not touching that thing.

221
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,910
Well, I have to say
I'm very surprised.

222
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,569
And disappointed, blood brother.

223
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,271
Oh, no.

224
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,475
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood.

225
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,983
Listen to your pulse.

226
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,449
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.

227
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,084
- Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
- Oh, so my blood's not enough?

228
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,889
Would you like a kidney too?
Because I'll give it to you.

229
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,761
I'll rip it out right here
and smack it on the table.

230
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,394
All right, all right. I'll do it. Sit down.

231
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,870
No, no. I don't have time right now.

232
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,239
I'll catch you tonight. We'll do sort of
an all over kind of thing, all right?

233
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,105
Hello?

234
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,774
Kramer called.
He told us you were in the hospital.

235
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,250
Kramer called you?

236
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,911
He calls every week.

237
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,488
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

238
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,924
- He says he's fine.
- Tell him to eat a plum.

239
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,731
Jerry, you really have to take
better care of yourself.

240
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,630
We bought you some sessions
with a personal trainer.

241
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,862
I don't need a personal trainer.

242
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,970
All right, I gotta go.
We'll talk about this later.

243
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,507
<i>Plum.</i>

244
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,440
Why are you calling my parents?

245
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:05,109
Well, maybe if you called more often,
I wouldn't have to.

246
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,013
- Is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
- Why here?

247
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,555
I'm taping Canadian parliament,
you know, on C-SPAN.

248
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,184
Okay.

249
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,620
Is it all right if I watch in your
bedroom? Because your bed is nice.

250
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,198
Fine.

251
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,028
Okay.

252
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

253
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,632
No, no, I do not want that in here.

254
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,703
Blood?

255
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,206
All right.

256
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,309
Hello, doughboy.

257
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,475
Mr. Mandelbaum,
you're the personal trainer?

258
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,087
I'm here to whip you into shape.

259
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,986
So grab your jock if you need one.

260
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,990
It's go time.

261
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,362
Elaine? Elaine?

262
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,064
Oh, hey. Oh, God.

263
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,170
I didn't hear you come in.

264
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,327
Where's Jimmy?

265
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,665
I don't know. I don't know.
We had Ho Hos for dinner and then-

266
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,904
And then he put this plastic bag
over his head...

267
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,344
...and started running around
until he got tired...

268
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,780
...and he laid down somewhere.

269
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,678
I tell you,
I'm no good at watching that kid.

270
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,849
Sleeping like an angel.

271
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,848
Elaine, you're the best.

272
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,686
No. I'm a scatter-brain.

273
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,627
It's probably why I can't hold a job
or keep a man.

274
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,527
You're a riot.

275
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,191
- You gonna watch Jimmy tomorrow?
- All right.

276
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,000
But I'm running out of purses here.

277
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,073
Okay, Mr. Mandelbaum,
what do you want me to do?

278
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,178
Drop your purse, honey...

279
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,406
...and pick up that medicine ball.

280
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,643
Is this a gym
or some kind of fitness museum?

281
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,949
Not funny. Over your head with it.

282
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,887
- Are you ready?
- For what?

283
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,959
All aboard the pain train.

284
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,230
How many sessions
did my parents pay for?

285
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,234
Not enough to make
a man of you, daffodil.

286
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,971
Spicy mustard.

287
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,581
You are hot tonight.

288
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,009
Oh, George.

289
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,883
Now for the trifecta.

290
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,589
George?

291
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,688
George?

292
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,625
What are you doing?

293
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,972
Pleasuring you.

294
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,870
- What is this?
- We're making sausages.

295
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,447
I thought you were gonna watch
a video.

296
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,487
Well, yeah. An instructional video
on how to make your own sausages.

297
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,954
- Kramer, I'm not in the mood for this.
- All right.

298
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,854
Newman, let's go grab
some mail sacks...

299
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,359
...and haul these beauties out of here.

300
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,632
Blood over there, sausage over here.
I'm living in a slaughterhouse.

301
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,172
Tonight I want you to sleep on this.

302
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,208
Toughens the vertebrae.

303
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,341
What in holy hell.

304
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,947
Sausages.

305
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,376
- Is this your diet?
- No, they're not mine-

306
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,578
Don't lie to me, butterbean.

307
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,852
We're taking it up a notch.

308
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,928
So the free love buffet is over?

309
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,155
I got greedy.

310
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,823
I flew too close to the sun
on wings of pastrami.

311
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,529
Yeah, that's what you did.

312
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,200
I can't believe I got another session
with Izzy Mandelbaum.

313
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,901
He's probably gonna make me
box a kangaroo.

314
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,838
What's going on?

315
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,546
I don't know.

316
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,214
This sandwich is making me flush.

317
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,517
Oh, no. I'll tell you
what you did, Caligula.

318
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,393
You've combined food and sex into
one disgusting, uncontrollable urge.

319
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,524
I think you're right.

320
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,222
Are you gonna eat that?

321
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,233
No, but please tell me that's all
you're gonna do with it.

322
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,600
Jerry, I tell you, if this woman dies...

323
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,867
...it is gonna
be a major inconvenience.

324
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,068
These fries are really, really good.

325
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,475
All right, that's enough of that.

326
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,205
I mean, I can't shake this woman.

327
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,816
You know, now I gotta go
to Jimmy's birthday party.

328
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,143
Sleepy.

329
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,620
I mean, no matter what I do,
I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.

330
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,490
Sleepy here's quite a weasel.
Maybe he can bat for you.

331
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,059
Yeah. That's what I need.
A pinch weasel.

332
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,293
- Why did you get rid of that sausage?
- It wasn't me. It was Mr. Mandelbaum.

333
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,169
Well, Newman's not happy.
He booted me out of his freezer.

334
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,505
I gotta take my blood
back to the bank.

335
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,805
- Can I borrow your car?
- What's wrong with yours?

336
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,006
Well, I got no a.c. and I gotta
keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.

337
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,778
All right, but this is the last favor.
Okay? We're even.

338
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,353
All right. Even-Steven, okay?

339
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,514
Oh, by the way, when you get back
to your apartment...

340
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,252
...keep it down because
Newman's taking a nap in your bed.

341
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,336
Oh, man.

342
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,171
What is that?

343
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,689
"If the engine begins to overheat
turn off air conditioner."

344
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,354
Never. I can't do that.

345
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,460
Oh, Mama.

346
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,034
This thing is bone dry.

347
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,487
Vivian.

348
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,317
- Elaine.
- Hi.

349
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,652
This is my friend, George.

350
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,261
- I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
- Okay.

351
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,658
You're up.

352
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,765
- Isn't Elaine fantastic?
- Yes, she is.

353
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,461
It's-It's a pity we won't be seeing
much more of her.

354
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,732
- Really? Why?
- You haven't heard?

355
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,036
No, she's going to live with her
grandparents in Pennsylvania.

356
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,941
Her grandparents passed away
five years ago.

357
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,342
Yes, they did.

358
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,173
I was covering.

359
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,781
Elaine has been deported
back to Scotland.

360
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,548
She's an American citizen.
I've seen her passport.

361
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,150
All right, no more lies.

362
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,594
Elaine has been chosen to represent
the Upper West Side...

363
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,527
...in the next Biosphere project.

364
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,196
I haven't heard anything
about another Biosphere.

365
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,762
That's because it's underwater.

366
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,371
This is insane.

367
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,036
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

368
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,542
Well, it's all for charity,
so, what's the difference?

369
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,380
You are very knowledgeable.

370
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,881
I'm - I'm also an architect.

371
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,917
- Is that pastrami?
- Yes, it is.

372
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:34,728
I find the pastrami to be the most
sensual of all the salted-cured meats.

373
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,564
- Hungry?
- Very.

374
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,397
Wait.

375
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,675
Vivian!

376
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,911
Is this really necessary?

377
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,281
If you wanna live
in a butcher shop...

378
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,980
...I'm gonna treat you
like a piece of meat.

379
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,185
What if I can't keep up?

380
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,918
You lag, you drag.

381
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,592
- Fire it up, son.
- Right, Dad.

382
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,131
- Mandelbaum. Mandelbaum.
- Mandelbaum. Mandelbaum.

383
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,697
Move it. Move it. Move it.

384
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,101
Get those knees up.

385
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,133
Come on. Kick it. Kick it.

386
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,448
What's going on?

387
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,810
There's something wrong
with your car.

388
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,111
It's dripping something on my feet.

389
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,812
Yeah. Some kind of red liquid.

390
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,650
Oh, my God. The blood.

391
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,452
Blood?

392
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,358
Get up, boy. Get up.

393
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,897
We got a problem here.

394
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,997
Tough it out. This is for real.

395
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,331
You gotta want it.

396
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,801
So how far did they drag you?

397
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,468
Well, for the first quarter-mile
they thought I was just dogging it.

398
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,344
Hi, George.

399
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,142
Hi, Jimmy.

400
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,819
Yeah, Jimmy,
why don't you go wait outside.

401
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,012
You know, play with something.

402
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,893
- What's the kid doing here?
- I'm babysitting.

403
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,527
Vivian asked me to raise him
if she doesn't make it.

404
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,564
Oh, that's a drag.

405
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,495
That kid.

406
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,193
You put blood in the car?

407
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,031
Jerry, it was overheating.

408
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,037
You should take
better care of that thing.

409
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,336
Well, they told me I got more blood,
so I guess I owe you again.

410
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,002
- You didn't get the blood from me.
- Then who?

411
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,174
Hello, Jerry.
