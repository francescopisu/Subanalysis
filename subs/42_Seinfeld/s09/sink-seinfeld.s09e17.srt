1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,338
- You hanging out?
- Yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,453
Hello? Hello?

3
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,778
You're bad, huh?

4
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:59,254
I'd like to see you come up here
and say that to my face.

5
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:15,241
So, what's the deal with politics?

6
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,277
I don't get it. Am I right, people?

7
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,524
I don't believe this.

8
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,771
I read somewhere
that this Brentano's is the place...

9
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,238
...to meet girls in New York.

10
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,038
First it was the health club, then
the supermarket, now the bookstore.

11
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,148
They can put it anywhere they want.
No one's meeting anybody.

12
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,012
Jerry, look at all
these pagodas, huh?

13
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,553
I gotta get over to Hong Kong
before it all goes back to China.

14
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,850
You better hurry.

15
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,322
I'm gonna hit the head.

16
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,024
Boy, look at this.
Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw.

17
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:13,392
I thought those would be perfect
for New York.

18
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,525
Yes. The city needs more
slow moving wicker vehicles.

19
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,377
Well, Elaine's been to Hong Kong.

20
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,705
I should give her a call.

21
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,815
She's at that annual
Peterman party tonight.

22
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,644
The one she danced at last year.

23
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,615
No, that wasn't dancing.

24
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,552
Hey, there's Leo.

25
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,815
- Oh, who's Leo?
- Uncle Leo.

26
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,755
Oh, yeah, right. Uncle Leo.

27
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,389
Forgot his first name.

28
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,427
Did I just see that?

29
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,829
Well, that ought to keep you busy
for a couple of days, huh?

30
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,107
So, Elaine, are you gonna dance
this year?

31
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,906
Maybe. All over your face.

32
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,517
If you do dance,
the cooks wanna know,

33
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,589
so they can be brought out
of the kitchen.

34
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,191
They missed it last year.

35
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,897
My friends, a toast.

36
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:23,365
As the woolly-haired Melanesians
of Papua New Guinea once said:

37
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,277
All right. Who's dancing?

38
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,781
No? All right, I'll just have
to get things started.

39
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,086
Hi, I'm Zach.

40
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,592
Hi. I'm miserable.

41
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,305
Excuse me, sir.
What are you doing?

42
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,036
I'm all set.

43
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,913
Did you take that book with you
into the bathroom?

44
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,751
What do you want to hear?

45
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,283
They made me buy it.
A hundred bucks, this thing cost me.

46
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,983
How dare they.

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,153
I got news for you. If it wasn't
for the toilet, there would be no books.

48
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,165
Yeah, I understand Gutenberg used
to spend a fair amount of time in there.

49
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,462
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.

50
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,538
You're surrounded
by reading material.

51
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,867
It's entrapment.

52
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,637
<i>"French Impressionist Paintings"?</i>

53
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,644
I find the soothing pastoral images
very conducive-

54
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,476
Thank you very much.

55
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,314
I'm gonna go back there and return it
when there's different people working.

56
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,651
- You wanna catch a movie?
- I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo.

57
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,019
I saw him shoplifting
at the bookstore.

58
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,661
All right, Leo. Sticking it to the man.

59
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,834
- Sleeping in the car again?
- Cocktail flu.

60
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,561
Oh, right, the big party.

61
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,765
You didn't dance again, did you?

62
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,943
No.

63
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,444
I found a better way
to humiliate myself.

64
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,815
There was this guy
and we had a few too many.

65
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,646
- You went home with him?
- Worse.

66
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,120
We made out at the table
like our plane was going down.

67
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,923
Oh, the drunken make-out.
An office classic.

68
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,428
Did you end up Xeroxing anything?

69
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,329
Do you know how embarrassing
this is to someone in my position?

70
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,165
- What is your position?
- I'm an associate.

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,332
- Hey, me too.
- Yeah, me too.

72
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,272
Oh, God. Why did I do this?

73
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,143
Now, I'm the office skank.

74
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,248
Well, unless, you tell everybody
you're dating.

75
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,910
Oh, right.

76
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,922
Because if we're dating,
what everyone saw was just...

77
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,584
...a beautiful moment
between two lovers.

78
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:07,096
As opposed to a spirited bout
of skanko Roman wrestling.

79
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,530
Bravo.

80
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:20,637
Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas
some drinks and sandwiches?

81
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,871
No, we've already eaten.

82
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,346
But you can clear
some of this stuff out of the way.

83
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,144
Jerry, check this out.

84
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,651
Remember my idea
about rickshaws in New York?

85
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,382
- Well, we're gonna make it happen.
- No, you're not.

86
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,618
Well, Newman, he knows a guy
in the Hong Kong post office.

87
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,319
No, he doesn't.

88
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,294
He's shipping a rickshaw.
It can't miss.

89
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,228
Yes, it can.

90
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,595
We'll start out with one.

91
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,203
When it catches on
we're gonna have a whole fleet.

92
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,999
It's the romance of the handsome cab
without the guilt...

93
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,608
...or dander of the equine.

94
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,204
So who's gonna pull this thing?

95
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,151
- Well, I just assumed you would.
- Yeah, but I thought-

96
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,151
My, isn't this an awkward moment?

97
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,892
What about the homeless?

98
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,861
Can't we worry about them later?

99
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,862
To pull the rickshaw.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,659
They have an intimate knowledge
of the street.

101
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,667
Always walking around the city.

102
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,739
Why not just strap
something to them?

103
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,474
Now, that's the first sensible idea
I've heard all day.

104
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,880
Jerry, hello.

105
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,179
So, Leo, how's everything?
You doing okay?

106
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,551
I still have the ringing in the ears.
Sounds like the phone.

107
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,419
Yeah, yeah, but what about money?

108
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,288
Are you strapped?
Do you need a little?

109
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,954
Are you kidding?
I should be loaning you money.

110
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,565
But I'm not.

111
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,464
Leo, I saw you in Brentano's
yesterday.

112
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,798
Why didn't you say hello?

113
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,237
Because you were too busy
stealing a book.

114
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,504
You still say hello.

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,345
Oh, I saw you steal.

116
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,313
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.

117
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,645
Who, criminals?

118
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,414
Senior citizens. No big deal.

119
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,822
- You could get arrested.
- Arrested? Come on.

120
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,428
I'm an old man. I'm confused.
I thought I paid for it.

121
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,858
What's my name?
Could you take me home?

122
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,728
Leo.

123
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,837
All right, all right,
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.

124
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,870
- You made your point.
- Thank you.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,441
Will somebody answer
that damn phone.

126
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,937
Of course, Zach and I
have been dating.

127
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,345
What did you think?
I was the office skank?

128
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,542
Well...

129
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,914
Well? We've been dating
for three months...

130
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,922
...between you and me
and anyone else you wanna tell.

131
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,124
Oh, man.

132
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,958
- Isn't that Zach?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,464
Aren't you upset?

134
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:00,534
Yes. Oh, man.

135
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,034
All right, listen up. Now,
you three have been hand-picked...

136
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,080
...out of possibly dozens
who applied.

137
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,444
Now, what we're looking for
are motivated...

138
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:17,715
...hard-working, homeless gentlemen,
like yourselves, to pull rickshaws.

139
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,484
Now, I don't care where you're from,
or how you got here...

140
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,824
...or what happened to your homes,
but you will have to be physically fit.

141
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,899
The government.

142
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,528
Because to pull rickshaws
requires more than just strong legs.

143
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,571
You're also gonna need
a well-toned upper body...

144
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,337
...or a shirt.

145
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,808
All right, who's first?

146
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,982
- Name please?
- Rusty.

147
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,140
Rusty.

148
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,618
You know, I once knew a horse
named Rusty. No offense.

149
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,189
All right, now.
Take it down to the end of the block.

150
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,327
Make a controlled turn and bring
her back. Let's see what you got.

151
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,258
- Okay, ready and go.
- Giddap.

152
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,420
Good form.

153
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,091
Pace yourself. You're gonna have
to do this all day for very little money.

154
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,204
- Hey, what's he doing?
- I think he's stealing our rickshaw.

155
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,442
Well, then he's out.

156
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,171
I'll take the job. Potato salad.

157
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,019
Yes, I need to return this book.

158
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,953
I'm sorry,
we can't take this book back.

159
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,116
- Why not?
- It's been flagged.

160
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,529
- Flagged?
- It's been in the bathroom.

161
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,063
It says that on the computer?

162
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,495
Please take it home.

163
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,863
We don't want it near
the other books.

164
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:43,300
Well, you just lost a lot of business
because I love to read.

165
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,837
I don't believe this.

166
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,343
I wonder if you could do me
a favor.

167
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,080
My uncle's having a little problem
with shoplifting.

168
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,348
Where's your uncle?

169
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,653
He's over there in the overcoat.

170
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,761
If you could just kind of put a scare
into him. Set him straight.

171
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,389
We have a 5150
in paperbacks. All units respond.

172
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,159
<i>Roger. Ten-four.</i>

173
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,133
5150. That's just a scare, right?

174
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,602
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stand out of the way...

175
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,742
...and let us handle this.

176
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,776
Swarm. Swarm.

177
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,836
What?

178
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,847
- I'm an old man. I'm confused.
- You're under arrest.

179
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,575
I just wanted you to scare him.

180
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,743
Jerry, you ratted me out.

181
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,845
Hello?

182
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,251
Hello.

183
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,694
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo.

184
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,726
I just wanted the guard
to scare him straight.

185
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,029
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.

186
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,402
Prison? I'm sure it's just a fine.

187
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,700
He's got priors.

188
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,370
Prior convictions? Leo?

189
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,105
It was a crime of passion.
Leave it alone.

190
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,375
Besides, it's not stealing
if it's something you need.

191
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,419
- What does that mean?
- Nobody pays for everything.

192
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,785
You're stealing too?
What are you stealing?

193
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,186
Nothing.

194
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,590
Batteries.
Well, they wear out so quick.

195
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,162
Mom, you too?

196
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,960
Sometimes your father forgets,
so, I have to steal them.

197
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,433
All right, I'll talk to you later.

198
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,471
Well, the rickshaw's gone.

199
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,975
We strapped it to a homeless guy
and he bolted.

200
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,079
Well, you know, 85 percent of all
homeless-rickshaw businesses fail...

201
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,912
...within the first three months.

202
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,354
We should've got
some collateral from him.

203
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:41,960
Like his bag of cans,
or his other bag of cans.

204
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,320
We gotta find that rickshaw.
You check the sewers and dumpsters.

205
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,763
I'll hit the soup kitchens,
bakeries and smorgasbords.

206
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,865
To the idiot-mobile.

207
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,008
So even though you're not really
going out with this guy, he's...

208
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,770
- ...cheating on you.
- That is correct.

209
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,674
But here's the beauty part.

210
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:06,875
Now, I stand up for myself by telling
everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass...

211
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,782
...and I'm the office...

212
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,423
- Tina Turner?
- All right.

213
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,794
Well, I've been to every Brentano's.

214
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,023
This thing is flagged
in every database in town.

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,692
Is it so horrible
to have to keep a book?

216
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,237
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

217
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,998
They let you try on pants.

218
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,200
Not underpants.

219
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,877
- Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
- Uncle Leo. Hello.

220
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,107
- Jerry.
- Uncle Leo.

221
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,482
I'm sorry.
I didn't know about your past.

222
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,590
You mean my crime of passion?

223
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,258
Anyone betrays me, I never forget.

224
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,690
Uncle Leo. Wait. Hello.

225
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,427
French Impressionism.
Oh, I love this.

226
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,696
Now, what is the problem
with this book?

227
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,167
- Nothing.
- How much you want for it?

228
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,869
You know, I could let it go for
say a hundred and twenty-five.

229
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,247
Leo's furious.
What is that doing on the table?

230
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,247
Jerry. Simmer down.

231
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,787
I'm not eating anything
in the vicinity of that book.

232
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,551
- What is wrong with this book?
- Simmer.

233
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,856
That book has been on a wild ride.
George took into the bathroom...

234
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,124
- ...at Brentano's -
- All right. Everyone clear.

235
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,259
Biohazard, coming through.
Clear. Clear.

236
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,301
May I ask...

237
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,735
...what do you read
in the bathroom?

238
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,936
I don't read in the bathroom.

239
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,913
Well, aren't you something?

240
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,379
Elaine, do you have a moment?

241
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,251
It's about your lover.

242
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:57,460
Oh, yes, I know all about his little
performance in the break room.

243
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,997
Elaine. Who among us hasn't snuck
into the break room...

244
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,498
...to nibble on a love newton?

245
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,434
Love newton?

246
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,802
I'm afraid the problem
with Zach is more serious.

247
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,840
He's back on the horse, Elaine.

248
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,411
Smack. White palace.

249
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,310
The Chinamen's nightcap.

250
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,351
An addict.
Well, it just keeps getting better.

251
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,546
And in a tiny way
I almost feel responsible.

252
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:28,489
I'm the one who sent him to Thailand
in search of low-cost whistles...

253
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:33,689
...filled his head with pseudo-erotic
tales of my own opium excursions.

254
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,800
Plus, I gave him
phone numbers of places...

255
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,833
...he could score near the hotel.

256
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,169
Look, Mr. Peterman...

257
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,968
...the fact is, is that I was planning
on breaking up with Zach anyway.

258
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,633
He was cheating on me.

259
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,075
Damn it, Elaine, that wasn't Zach.

260
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,044
That was the yam-yam.

261
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,509
Now, he is going cold turkey
and you will be at his side.

262
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,589
- Oh, what, you know, I had planned-
- No buts, Elaine...

263
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,191
...or I will strip you
of your associate status.

264
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,193
Oh, P.S...

265
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,661
...the first 24 hours are the worst.

266
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,959
Better bring a poncho.

267
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,905
<i>It was a crime of passion.</i>

268
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,009
<i>If anyone betrays me,
I never forget it.</i>

269
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,441
<i>He won't last a day in prison.</i>

270
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,583
Jerry.

271
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,719
Hello.

272
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,451
Jerry.

273
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,298
Hello. Jerry.

274
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,866
Answer the damn phone.

275
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,935
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

276
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,703
- Uncle Leo?
- Oh, that's nice.

277
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:53,936
What are you up to?

278
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,206
Nightmares. You?

279
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,317
My fake boyfriend is going
through real withdrawals.

280
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,387
- I'm burning up.
- Eat your soup.

281
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,490
- You're not feeding him, are you?
- Why?

282
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:11,061
I told you, away from
the curtains. Away.

283
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,891
Use your bucket.

284
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,057
There you go, that's it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

285
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,208
Hey, buddy.

286
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,935
- Kramer.
- Thought I heard you.

287
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,672
- Get out of here.
- Kramer. Kramer. There you are.

288
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,248
Will everybody please leave.

289
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,216
I just heard a postman spotted
a rickshaw down in Battery Park.

290
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,911
- Our rickshaw?
- It's possible.

291
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,649
I want everyone out.

292
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,623
Hey, let's talk in Jerry's kitchen.
I'll make some cocoa.

293
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,654
Goodnight, Jerry.

294
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,499
Goodnight, Newman.

295
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,107
- There it is.
- Rusty.

296
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,571
Oh, there you are.
Oh, do I get the job?

297
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,645
Yeah, yeah, we'll get back to you.

298
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,577
Let's get this baby home.

299
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,914
- What?
- You know, when you think about it...

300
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,958
...it's kind of silly for us both to pull
this thing all the way back up town.

301
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,460
I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.

302
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,461
Yes, that's true.

303
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,829
So which one of us is gonna pull?

304
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,501
Well, there's only way to settle this.

305
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,472
One spot, two spot, zigzag, tear,
pop-dye, penny got, tennyum, tear...

306
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:34,009
...harum-scarum, rip them,
tear them, te, ta, toe.

307
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,305
Yeah.

308
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,347
Best two out of three.
One spot, two spot...

309
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:43,012
Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there.
Too much jostling.

310
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,155
So you wanna donate
this to charity?

311
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,023
Well, I assume there's
some sort of write-off.

312
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:55,030
- What's the value of the book?
- About $200 Miss DeMooney.

313
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,998
It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.

314
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,466
Oh, wait a second.

315
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,632
This book has been in a bathroom.

316
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,012
Well, what are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

317
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,049
It's been flagged. I know.
I used to work in a Brentano's.

318
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,512
Mister, we're trying to help
the homeless here. It's bad enough...

319
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,317
...that we have some nut out there
trying to strap them to a rickshaw.

320
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,860
All right. I'll just take 50.
Do we have a deal?

321
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,590
Yeah and here it is.

322
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,532
You get your toilet book out of here
and I won't jump over this counter...

323
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,762
...and punch you in the brain.

324
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,033
- I could take it in merchandise.
- Here I come.

325
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,006
So this book will tell me
how to get puke out of cashmere?

326
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,618
- Yeah.
- Great.

327
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,217
- So the worst is over?
- Yeah.

328
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,448
Now I can break up with him.

329
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,058
He's clean and I'm the office hero.

330
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,525
You're better at fake relationships
than real ones.

331
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:02,224
Yeah. I even got an idea out of it.
The detox poncho.

332
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,398
I'll see you.

333
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,069
I'd like to speak
with the manager, please.

334
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,202
Fine your pace, boy. Chop chop.

335
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,946
Well, I've hit the wall.
I gotta take a break.

336
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,144
Well, don't tarry,
I'm behind schedule as it is.

337
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,609
Boy. Boy.

338
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,755
Kramer!

339
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,921
Well, this is the first day
of the rest of my life.

340
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,409
George, what are you doing here?

341
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,086
I can't sell the book.
It's been marked.

342
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,249
It certainly has.

343
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,195
So, I'm gonna steal another one
and then I'm gonna return it.

344
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,458
That way, everything is even.

345
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:13,367
You defile one book, steal another,
ask for your money back...

346
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,335
...and to you that's even.

347
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,075
I'm going in.

348
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,940
Did you want to speak
to the manager?

349
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,173
Yes. My Uncle Leo was caught
shoplifting here the other day.

350
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,409
Yes. Uncle Leo. I remember him.

351
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,453
I'm sorry. Our policy is
we prosecute all shoplifters.

352
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,955
Oh, come on. He's just a lonely
old man. All old people steal.

353
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,618
That's right. That's why we stopped
carrying batteries.

354
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,854
I'll be honest with you.

355
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,727
We've had trouble with theft
lately and my boss said...

356
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,663
...I have to make an example
of someone.

357
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,030
- So it could be anyone?
- Well, I guess.

358
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,536
As long as we catch him in the act.

359
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,036
That guy. Swarm. Swarm.

360
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,711
Oh, Jerry!
