1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,237
- Hey.
- Morning.

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,006
Oh, this is crazy.
You know, I can't go on like this.

3
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,947
- But why?
- I need some space.

4
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,952
Does that mean I have to go too?

5
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,421
Well, you don't think
she's just talking to me.

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,355
- Hey, shut up.
- You shut up.

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,290
I hate this.

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,294
You'll get used to it.
It's like a rugby scrum.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,560
- No. No, I don't want this anymore.
- We're going to work with you.

10
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:38,431
- And on your dates.
- And shopping.

11
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,936
And to the bathroom.

12
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,097
- Elaine. Elaine. Elaine.
- I can't breathe.

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,903
- Elaine. Elaine.
- I'm suffocating. I can't breathe.

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,410
You're all killing me.

15
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,715
Turn your alarm off.

16
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,958
Your background
is impressive, George.

17
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:13,834
But how does it apply to what we do
here at Kruger Industrial Smoothing?

18
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,374
Well, at the Yankees, it was
all about smoothing things over...

19
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,172
...you know, chiseling away,
grinding down.

20
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,645
In fact, we used to call it the grind.

21
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:27,947
It says here you worked at Play Now
for four days.

22
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,215
That should be a 14.
Let me just...

23
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:37,261
Well, George, I'll be honest.
I could go either way on you.

24
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,925
But what the hell,
we need someone, huh?

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,659
You won't regret this, sir.

26
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,898
I don't care.

27
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,775
Let's find you an office, huh?

28
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,675
When I saw the photo
I remembered where I'd seen him.

29
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,014
The boom-box incident.

30
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,815
The boom-box incident?

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,924
Summer of '89,
I'm at the beach.

32
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,787
This family sets up next to me.

33
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,426
I go into the surf.
When I come out...

34
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,124
...my clothes, my towel,
my umbrella, they're all gone.

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,860
I am furious.
I start screaming at these kids...

36
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,504
...demanding my stuff back
and finally I lose it.

37
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,768
I grab their boom box
and I chuck it into the ocean.

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,807
- Yeah.
- Seems reasonable.

39
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,775
Then I see my clothes
floating out there.

40
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,645
The tide took them out, not the kids.

41
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,548
Even more reasonable.

42
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,814
So now the father
is screaming at me.

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,890
He's demanding I pay
for the boom box.

44
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:43,358
So finally I gave him a fake address
and got the hell out of there.

45
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,555
And that guy is your new boss?

46
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,223
Until that stupid photo
jogs his memory.

47
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,064
Kruger. That's not Kruger
Industrial Smoothing, is it?

48
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,968
- Yeah.
- Yeah, grinders, sanders, whetstones.

49
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,268
They botched
the Statue of Liberty job.

50
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,843
Right. They couldn't
get the green stuff off.

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,176
It is a horrible company.
There is no management whatsoever.

52
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,579
I could go hog-wild in there.

53
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,280
You know what to do?
You sneak that photo out...

54
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,581
...for a couple of days
and get it airbrushed.

55
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,782
- Like retouched?
- Remember the photo of me...

56
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,722
...and Gerald Ford and I took it in.

57
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,556
Got that Ford right out of there.

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,291
Oh, this is good.

59
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,127
This Kruger guy is clueless.

60
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,930
I can't wait to work for him.

61
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,636
Jeez. Look at this.

62
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,208
This sandwich is terrible.

63
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,608
Everywhere you go they always give
you these misshaped, shoddy meats.

64
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,544
Look, look, look.

65
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,782
I haven't had a decent sandwich
in 13 years.

66
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,923
Neither have I.

67
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,720
Hey.
Well, our meat problems are solved.

68
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,396
- Where'd you get this thing?
- I traded in my sausage press.

69
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,469
I mean, look how thin that is.
See, that's all surface area.

70
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,232
The taste has nowhere to hide.

71
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,737
- Hey.
- Hey. Slice?

72
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,972
Welcome to flavor country.

73
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,408
Hey, that's pretty good.

74
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,650
Hey, I got a date
with that doctor you met.

75
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,277
Sara Sitarides?

76
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,814
What's with you?

77
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,415
Remember that next-door
neighbor of mine?

78
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,823
The apartment
that always smells like potatoes?

79
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,157
Your whole building
smells like potatoes.

80
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:30,291
This jackass goes to Paris,
leaves her alarm on.

81
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,539
It's been beeping since 3:30
this morning.

82
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:38,166
You know, that happened to Lomez,
so he blew his neighbor's circuit.

83
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,569
- How did he do that?
- Yeah, well, it's easy.

84
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,205
Just let me finish this mile-high
and I'll be right with you.

85
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,942
Oh, we're gonna need
a case of Kaiser Rolls.

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,315
I think we might have one left
in the stockroom.

87
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,757
This hallway smells like potatoes.

88
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,227
- I know. I know. This is it.
- Okay.

89
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,529
Oh, see, this socket, it's probably
connected to her apartment.

90
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,196
So, what we'll do...

91
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,163
...we'll take this paper clip...

92
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,539
...and we'll bend it
so it'll short out the entire circuit.

93
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,179
There you go.

94
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,246
- I think I'll let you do it.
- No, no. It's easy.

95
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,045
Just do it quickly.

96
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,587
No, I really don't want to.

97
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,086
Well, I don't want to either.

98
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,522
- I thought you've done this before.
- Yeah, well, I have, it's just...

99
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,594
...it's no picnic.

100
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,128
- How are we gonna do it?
- All right, all right.

101
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,391
Fine, fine. I'll do it.

102
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,835
- Oh, mama.
- Are you okay?

103
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,536
I'm gonna lose that nail.

104
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,811
I enjoy the challenge of medicine.

105
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,751
You'd have no idea what it's like to
have someone's life depend on you.

106
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,515
Well, I have this neighbor.

107
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,250
A joke.

108
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,760
Do you have any idea what it
feels like to save someone's life?

109
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,195
Is it anything
like hitting a homer in softball?

110
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,929
- No.
- Because I hit a whomper last week.

111
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,902
Here you go.
Airbrushed you into sand and sky.

112
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,008
What did you do here?

113
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,972
You took out the wrong guy.

114
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,581
Thought you said
you wanted to be out.

115
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,279
But I'm still here.
You took out the other guy.

116
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,385
You've really lost a lot of hair.

117
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,688
I am aware.

118
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,563
<i>The world's best pizza-cutter.</i>

119
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,470
<i>Seventy-six bucks.</i>

120
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,630
<i>How often do I make-?</i>

121
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,003
<i>I've gotta buy a book.</i>

122
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,614
The cat.

123
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,184
He took out Kruger?

124
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,756
I just pray Kruger doesn't realize
it's gone until this guy can fix it.

125
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,153
Slicer is indomitable.

126
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,817
Where'd you get that coat?

127
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,590
You buy enough meat,
they'll give you anything.

128
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,657
Kramer?

129
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,728
My neighbor has a cat.

130
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,997
When we blew the power, we must
have shut off the automatic feeder.

131
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,698
See, that's the same thing
that happened to Lomez.

132
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,870
What did he do about it?

133
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,174
Well, he moved into a motel
and the cat eventually died.

134
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,112
Well, this meowing
is absolutely worse than the alarm.

135
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,686
Oh, well, that's a prickly one.

136
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,122
- How was the doctor date?
- It died on the table.

137
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,454
She spent an hour and a half
making me feel like I'm worthless.

138
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,427
Well, you know, she's very focused.

139
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,861
Dermatology is her life.

140
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,833
Dermatology?

141
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,131
Yes. She's a dermatologist.

142
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,934
Saving lives?

143
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,839
The whole profession is,
"Just put some aloe on it."

144
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,508
The slicer. Elaine. Let's go.

145
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,309
- Where are we going?
- The cat.

146
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,146
Just grab that meat and let's ride.

147
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,216
When are you going
on your next date?

148
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,880
Oh, what's the point?

149
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,822
You're gonna pass up
an opportunity...

150
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,326
...to put that aloe-pusher
in her place?

151
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,058
A revenge date?

152
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,200
That sounds more like you than me.

153
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,568
This could be so sweet, Jerry.
Saving lives?

154
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,002
She's one step above working
at the Clinique counter.

155
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,277
Dermatologists.
Skin doesn't need a doctor.

156
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,279
Of course not.
Wash it, dry it, move on.

157
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,283
You're right. I'm gonna call her up
and tell her off.

158
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,444
Oh, no, no, no.
This has to be carefully orchestrated.

159
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,681
You go to a fancy diner, flowers-

160
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,190
- Flowers?
- Yeah. You gotta do it classy.

161
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,053
So you've done this?

162
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,992
Almost.

163
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,263
Couldn't get the girl to go out
with me a second time.

164
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,198
I think we're looking
at half a millimeter.

165
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,107
Can it cut that thin?

166
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,111
Oh, I've cut slices so thin
I couldn't even see them.

167
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,673
How'd you know you cut it?

168
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,752
Well, I guess, I just assumed.

169
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,720
Don't worry, kitty.
Dinner's coming.

170
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,451
Look at that, huh?
That's a hall of famer.

171
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,095
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah, all right, here we go.

172
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,925
- Yeah, watch this baby slide.
- Okay.

173
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,865
Come on, come on, go ahead.
Go, kitty. Go.

174
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,972
Oh, my God, it worked. Wow.

175
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,008
- Can I borrow that thing for a while?
- Oh, I don't think so.

176
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,771
- Why not?
- Well, you're not checked out on it.

177
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,106
What do I have to know?

178
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,771
Well, where the meat goes.

179
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,974
Right there?

180
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,482
Where do you turn it on?

181
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,108
Right there.

182
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,312
But where does the meat go?

183
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,456
The restaurant, flowers.
This is so nice.

184
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,097
Well, I'm a classy guy.

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,359
- How's the life-saving business?
- It's fine.

186
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,869
It must take a really,
really big zit to kill a man.

187
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,939
What is with you?

188
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,044
You call yourself life saver.
I call you Pimple Popper, M.D.

189
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,611
Dr. Sitarides?

190
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,441
Mr. Parry, how are you?

191
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,017
I just want to thank you again
for saving my life.

192
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,619
She saved your life?

193
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,245
- I had skin cancer.
- Skin cancer.

194
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,948
Damn.

195
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,062
You were right, Kramer,
this slicer is absolutely amazing.

196
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,798
Yeah, Yeah.
No, no, no, I'll bring it by tonight.

197
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,473
Okay. Bye.

198
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,545
These heels are so uneven.

199
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,808
Here you go, Mr. Costanza.

200
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,985
What is this?

201
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,093
This is a drawing?

202
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,256
It looks real, doesn't it?

203
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,988
This is a cartoon.

204
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,929
Hey. I had to draw that guy
from memory.

205
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,729
Considering,
I think that's damn good.

206
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,101
But it's not a photograph.
I need a photograph.

207
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,504
Then you better get a camera.

208
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,712
He looks like a Peanuts' character.

209
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:30,185
I know. The only way to fix it now
is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.

210
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,290
- You could do that.
- Without his shirt on?

211
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,358
You can't do that.

212
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,393
Well, maybe Kruger
wasn't the place for you.

213
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,464
- They seemed so disorganized.
- I understand.

214
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,193
What about the Coast Guard?

215
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,893
Seems like a lot of pride there.
A lot of tradition.

216
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,266
True.

217
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,805
You mean for you?

218
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,470
- You think?
- What about your sea sickness?

219
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,580
Maybe I could be a land guy.

220
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,409
I don't know if they have land guys.

221
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,917
Someone's gotta unhook the boat
before it leaves the place.

222
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,949
- Pliers?
- Drawer.

223
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,992
- Got it.
- What are they for?

224
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,097
I got a piece of my heel
stuck in the slicer.

225
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,860
- Come again?
- Okay. I got a little slicer happy.

226
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,526
But don't tell Kramer, okay?

227
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,003
He has very strong feelings for it.

228
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,302
I almost forgot to ask you.
How did the revenge date go?

229
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,171
It went okay.

230
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,280
Did you dress nice?
Did you do it classy?

231
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,915
Yeah, I started out real classy.

232
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,608
Yeah, you did. You classed it up.

233
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,277
But then I found out
about the skin cancer.

234
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,753
- Oh, so it backfired?
- Yes.

235
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,925
So I guess I'm lucky
I never tried that myself.

236
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,962
Of course she treats skin cancer.
That's how I met her.

237
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,430
She was doing a skin-cancer
screening at Peterman.

238
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,967
This is what dermatologists do.

239
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,629
Sadly, that knowledge
could have helped me.

240
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,304
Wait a second. She did a
skin-cancer screening at Peterman?

241
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,878
Could she do that at Kruger?
I don't know. I guess.

242
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,175
So I set up a screening,
everyone takes their shirt off...

243
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,980
...and click, I snap me a shot
of a bare-chested Kruger.

244
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,522
Do you got a little thing
for this fella?

245
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,319
Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.

246
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,327
Yesterday you told me
I had to take my revenge on her.

247
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,124
And that was wrong, Jerry.

248
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,833
You simply must apologize.

249
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,128
- Must I?
- Yes.

250
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,999
Because it is the mature,
adult thing to do.

251
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,141
How does that affect me?

252
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,977
Elaine. All right,
where's the SP 2000?

253
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,171
Because I gotta slice.

254
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,149
I forgot it. I gotta get home.

255
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,809
Oh, okay. Well, I'll go with you.

256
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,682
I'm not really going straight home.

257
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,825
I have to first stop off at the...

258
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,491
...circus.

259
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,564
You know, with all the clowns.

260
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,561
All right, you have fun.

261
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,498
Oh, no clowns. I don't like clowns.

262
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,729
The clowns.

263
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,740
So again, I'm sorry.
I had no right to yell at you.

264
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,178
You're a life-saving doctor
and I'm just a comedian.

265
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,910
Jerry, enough. I'll do your
friend's cancer screening...

266
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:18,045
...because I believe in that, but as far
as you and I are concerned, it's off.

267
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,714
Was it Pimple Popper, M.D.?

268
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,226
That's the one.

269
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,392
Still got it.

270
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,698
Out, damn heel.

271
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,433
- Elaine?
- Kramer?

272
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,075
Yeah, listen, I need my slicer back.

273
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,869
Just hold on.

274
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,312
- Hey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

275
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,951
Here. Here you go.

276
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,253
Okay. I'm on the phone, all right?
I'm on the phone with someone.

277
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,227
My blade is all dinged up.
Oh, come on.

278
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,422
- Elaine.
- Phone call.

279
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,501
- I'm on a big phone call.
- Oh, come on. This is important.

280
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,130
Hey. Get the hell out of here.

281
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,969
Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.

282
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,804
So, George took
my slicer down to Kruger...

283
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,210
...and they're
smoothing it out for me.

284
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,948
What the hell is this?

285
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,949
Boy, that looks like
an allergic reaction.

286
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,613
Have you been
wearing a fake beard?

287
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,419
- No.
- Well, what have you been doing?

288
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,425
Nothing. I got up,
I ran some errands...

289
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,120
...went to Sara and apologized-

290
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,960
Whoa, back up. Dr. Sitarides?
Yeah, what happened there?

291
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,864
Well, I tried to apologize.
It didn't go over too well.

292
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,095
There's your hives.

293
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,205
What? She gave me hives?

294
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:46,640
Jerry, as the Bible says,
"Thou who cureth can maketh ill."

295
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,142
She did kind of touch my face.

296
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,873
Listen to me. Find this woman...

297
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,177
...tell her you're not
a test-tube pincushion.

298
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,482
It does itch. Maybe I will go down
to Kruger and talk to her.

299
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,386
All right, great. I gotta go
there and pick up my blade.

300
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,959
Oh, hey, and I couldn't find
that stockroom.

301
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,100
Oh, that's fantastic.

302
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,681
I just talked to Mr. Kruger.
He'll be down in a minute.

303
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,010
He wanted me to take a photograph.

304
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:30,019
- What record?
- His personal file. I don't ask.

305
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,514
Jerry, what brings you here?

306
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,818
I don't know. This?

307
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,359
Looks like hives.

308
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,154
Where do you think
that came from?

309
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,730
- What're you doing?
- Setting the record straight.

310
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,366
Come on, Sitarides. Cop to it.

311
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,934
What brand of perverted science
do you practice?

312
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,198
Are you suggesting I somehow
infected you on purpose?

313
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,205
I want the antidote, Pimple Popper.

314
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,311
That's it. I'm out of here.

315
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,208
You're insane.

316
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,507
Am I?

317
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,150
You touched my face.
I didn't imagine that.

318
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,582
Dr. Sitarides. Don't go.

319
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,222
Thanks, Jerry.

320
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,321
Hey, George. Hey, doc.

321
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,551
We doing screening in here?

322
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,491
Yeah, why don't you head on in.
We'll be in a second.

323
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,964
Be right with you.

324
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,970
- Doc?
- Oh, Kramer, this is perfect.

325
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,301
Go in there, pretend you're a doctor
and check this guy for moles.

326
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,135
Moles. Yes.

327
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,937
Freckle's ugly cousin.

328
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,615
And just get a picture
of him with his shirt off.

329
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,041
You're really cooking up
a Ischeme here.

330
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,381
All right. Come on, let's get in there.
Quick, quick, quick.

331
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,561
That is it.
I can't take this anymore.

332
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,705
Male mammal.

333
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:03,143
Approximately 30 to 60
years of age.

334
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:07,547
Weight, oh, indeterminate.

335
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,785
Okay, Mr. Kruger...

336
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,946
...we'll take a photo for the records...

337
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,285
...so if you'll stand up please.

338
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,257
Give me a big smile.

339
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,196
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that big.

340
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,356
Yeah, that's nice.
Yes. Okay.

341
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,729
Yes, let's have a look-see?

342
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,098
Okay, so...

343
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,832
...fiber from shirt on left shoulder.

344
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,009
I'll have to keep my eye on that.

345
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:37,615
How long have you been doing this,
Dr. Van Nostrand?

346
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,274
Oh, a long, long time.

347
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,650
Yes, I've seen moles so big
they have their own moles.

348
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,587
Freckles that cover two men.

349
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:51,327
- So how am I looking?
- Oh, so far, so good.

350
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,699
- Kramer, I really owe you.
- George, we got a problem.

351
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,871
What?
- Well, he's got a mole...

352
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,204
...on his shoulder, very suspicious.

353
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,007
Tell him you're concerned
and he should see someone else.

354
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:14,044
George, why would I,
a Julliard-trained dermatologist...

355
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,050
...send him to another doctor?

356
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,587
Because you're not a dermatologist.

357
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,419
Oh, but he thinks I am
and I won't betray that trust.

358
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,289
Now, here's what I wanna do.
I think I can get a section...

359
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,363
- ...then I'll go down-
- Whoa, a section?

360
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,762
If I can grab my slicer
and if he holds still.

361
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,630
No. You're not taking
a deli slicer to my boss.

362
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,398
- It'll be ultrathin. He'll barely feel it.
- No. Absolutely not.

363
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,569
It's my medical opinion
that you're making a big mistake...

364
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,237
...and it's going in my chart.

365
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,680
Yeah, hello,
is this Allied Locksmith?

366
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,349
Finally. Okay, I need somebody
to come over here right away.

367
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,223
Turn that off. Turn it off!

368
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,891
I am getting a locksmith.
All right. Relax!

369
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,899
All right. That's it.

370
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,972
Yeah, the address is 78 West-

371
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,871
- Oh, mama.
- Hello?

372
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,876
So, Kramer pulled it off?

373
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,744
Yep. And the photo is all fixed and
back on his desk, no thanks to you.

374
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,215
That woman had it coming to her.
Look at my neck.

375
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,081
I look like I had a beard of bees.

376
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,689
- You should see somebody.
- I called everyone.

377
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,315
You know how hard it is to get
a dermatologist in this town?

378
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,793
A real dermatologist?

379
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,933
Squamous cell carcinoma.

380
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,568
You're not a doctor.
You shouldn't have books like this.

381
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,466
That's what he has, I gotta call.
We gotta come clean.

382
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,937
You can't tell him.
You'll blow the whole thing.

383
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:47,044
- I don't want this on my conscience.
- I will get him to see a real doctor.

384
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,442
- You just stay away from him.
- All right.

385
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,981
Hey, I wonder if they have a picture
of my rash in here.

386
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:57,518
Yeah, they got everything, Jerry.
I underlined the best parts.

387
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,690
Hey, this looks like what I have.

388
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,290
Caused by exposure to benzene...

389
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,863
...a common ingredient
in metal cleaners.

390
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,260
Well, that's weird.

391
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,768
What are you doing?

392
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,096
Well, I'm, cleaning my slicer.

393
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,968
That's my hand towel.

394
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,371
I use that on my face,
neck and chest.

395
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,603
That's where the hives are coming
from. It's not Dr. Sitarides.

396
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,214
It was Dr. Van Nostrand.

397
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:28,444
So somehow the Bronze-O is reacting
to the poison she's giving you.

398
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,653
All right, get out.

399
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,952
And take your Bronze-O with you.

400
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,151
Whoa, that's toxic.

401
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,666
George, come on in.

402
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,829
I'm just going over our annual report.

403
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,199
Boy, did we take it on the chin
last year.

404
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,469
Mr. Kruger, I got a
message from Dr. Van Nostrand.

405
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,842
He says, it might be wise for you
to see another doctor about that mole.

406
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,676
I'm not too worried about it.

407
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,876
He said it could be cancerous,
you should have it checked out.

408
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,521
George...

409
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,021
...take a look at this photo.

410
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,919
This was taken 10 years ago.

411
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,188
Now, that mole looks
exactly as it does today.

412
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,129
So there's no cause
for concern, huh?

413
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,332
Whatever.

414
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,131
And actually...

415
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,534
...funny thing about this photo.

416
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,371
We were at the beach...

417
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,809
...and there was this dumb-looking
guy nearby.

418
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,882
When he went in for a swim,
my sons and I took all his stuff...

419
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,042
...threw it in the ocean, huh?

420
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,780
What a pear-shaped loser.

421
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,157
Well, that pear-shaped loser
was me.

422
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,659
And I was in that photo
until I broke in here...

423
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,061
...stole the photograph
and airbrushed myself out of it.

424
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,064
Well, I'll be.

425
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,863
You have lost a lot of hair.

426
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,966
That's what they tell me.

427
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,514
So you want more pastrami?

428
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,278
What was that last thing?
That was pretty good.

429
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,080
- Yeah, it was olive loaf.
- Oh.

430
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,381
- You want that?
- Yeah.

431
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,115
I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you
after all that.

432
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,228
He said he didn't care.
God, I love that place.

433
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,830
You see another dermatologist?

434
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,966
Yeah, I finally got in to see
Dr. Kazarian.

435
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,294
He said it was bad.

436
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,096
- What'd he give you for it?
- Aloe.

437
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,132
So where's that locksmith?

438
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,467
Tough to get him out at this hour.

439
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,373
- Can I have a sip?
- Oh, yeah, coming up.
