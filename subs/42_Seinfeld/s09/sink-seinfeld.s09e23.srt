1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:06,497
It seems like whenever people
call you in for a meeting...

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:10,336
...it's all about sitting down. "I would
really like to sit down with you."

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,478
"I think we need
to sit down and talk."

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,375
"Why don't you come in
and we'll sit down?"

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,312
Sometimes sitting doesn't work.
People get mad at the sitting.

6
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,682
"You know, we've been sitting here
for I don't know how long.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,086
How much longer
are we just gonna sit here?"

8
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,456
I'll tell you what I think we should do.
I think we should all sleep on it.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,359
Maybe we're not
getting down low enough.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,468
Maybe if we all lie down,
then our brains will work.

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,942
I can't eat this without ketchup.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,579
Would it kill her to check up on us?
Would that be a terrible thing?

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,446
"How's everything? You need
anything? What can I do for you?"

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,951
- I know what you mean.
- Do you?

15
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,146
It's like going out with someone
and not hearing back.

16
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,053
- Same thing.
- Not really, but it's something.

17
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:03,592
Ask the people behind you.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,193
Excuse me.
Are you using your ketchup?

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,768
What do you think?
You wanna give him the ketchup?

20
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,467
It's up to you.

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,572
You know what? I don't think so.
I'm gonna need it from time to time.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,609
You wanna go to the movies?

23
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,083
What for?

24
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,687
To see a movie.

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,488
- I've been to the movies.
- Not this movie.

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,785
They're all the same.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,520
You go, you sit,
you eat popcorn, you watch.

28
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,323
I'm sick of it.

29
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,398
- Did you take a shower today?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,001
That's the kind of mood I'm in
when I haven't showered.

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,030
When is it gonna be
my turn, Jerry?

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,729
When do I get my 15 minutes?

33
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,999
- I want my 15 minutes.
- Oh, quit complaining.

34
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,405
- You have your health.
- Health's not good enough.

35
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,840
I want more than health.

36
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,674
Health's not doing it for me
anymore. I'm sick of health.

37
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,248
All right, we're done.
You can have it now.

38
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,886
Oh, very gracious.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,857
- Nice day.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,623
What is that?

41
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,630
- Hey, Jo Jo.
- Hey, hey.

42
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,168
Hey.

43
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,041
- All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
- No, thank you.

44
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,743
- So, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

45
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,209
- Come on, let's go to the beach.
- Are you crazy?

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,746
- No, it's a beautiful day.
- Have a good time.

47
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,146
Yeah, there's something
in the air today.

48
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,411
Can you feel it?
There's something in the air.

49
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,181
You know you're turning
into Burt Lancaster?

50
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,357
Yeah, there's something
in the air.

51
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,691
Oh, I forgot to call Jill.

52
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,362
Jill. Hi, it's Elaine.

53
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,333
How is your father?
Is everything okay?

54
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,561
What?

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,665
I can't hear you so good.
There's a lot of static.

56
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,971
Wha-?
I'm gonna call you back.

57
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,214
Jill's father is in the hospital, and you
call to ask about him on a cell phone?

58
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,350
- What? No good?
- Faux pas.

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,750
- Faux pas?
- Big, hefty, stinking...

60
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,050
- ...faux pas.
- Why?

61
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,386
You can't make a health inquiry
on a cell phone.

62
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,587
It's like saying, "I don't wanna
take up my important time at home.

63
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,629
I'll get it out of the way
on the street."

64
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,235
And the street cell phone call
is the lowest phone call you can make.

65
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,735
It's an act of total disregard.
It's selfish.

66
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,668
- It's dismissive.
- It's pompous.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,274
Why don't you think
before you do something?

68
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,775
Here's a thought.

69
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,646
Bye-bye.

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,784
Too much?

71
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,559
Boy, I'm really surprised
at Elaine.

72
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,490
You know,
that whole phone business.

73
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,789
She should know
better than that.

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,091
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

75
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,499
Where do you think
this relationship is?

76
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:04,307
If you are thinking of instituting
an open door urination policy...

77
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,745
...let me disabuse you
of that notion right now, my friend.

78
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,780
- You're so uptight.
- Yeah, I'm uptight.

79
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,885
Let's all just have
a big pee party.

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,845
Hey, everybody, grab a bucket.
We're going up to Jerry's.

81
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,048
It's a pee party.

82
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,030
<i>Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark...</i>

83
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,325
<i>...calling from
James Kimbrough's office at NBC.</i>

84
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>Could you please
give us a call? Thanks.</i>

85
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,770
Hello. Hi.
This is Jerry Seinfeld...

86
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,970
...calling for James Kimbrough.

87
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,005
Hello?

88
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,547
Hi.

89
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,544
Really?

90
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,748
No problem. Definitely.

91
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,859
Okay. Bye-bye.

92
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,856
- That was James Kimbrough.
- Who's he?

93
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,227
He is the new president of NBC.

94
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,868
<i>He wants to sit down with us
and talk about Jerry.</i>

95
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,038
<i>- Our show, Jerry?
- Right.</i>

96
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,663
<i>Jerry? Oh, my God...</i>

97
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,399
<i>- ... he wants to talk about Jerry?
- Yeah.</i>

98
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,339
- When?
- Today, like right now.

99
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,604
Right now?

100
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,974
<i>- Jerry?
- Jerry.</i>

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,639
<i>- He wants to talk about Jerry?
- He wants to talk about Jerry.</i>

102
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,806
<i>- Jerry.
- Jerry.</i>

103
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,509
- Can I go like this?
- Sure.

104
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,520
No sports jacket? I don't need one?
Writers wear sports jackets.

105
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,487
- Forget it.
- I won't feel like a writer.

106
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,819
- You're not a writer.
- Right.

107
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,793
Water.

108
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,203
Need some water.

109
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,006
Water here.

110
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,880
Okay, now, listen. I don't want any
scenes in here like the last time.

111
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,072
- Don't worry. No scenes.
- Don't blow this.

112
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,341
I will not blow this.

113
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,850
If he says he doesn't want it to be
a show about nothing, don't go nuts.

114
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,581
- It doesn't have to be.
- He might not want nothing.

115
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,384
Something, nothing.
I could care less.

116
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,356
He might want a show
about everything.

117
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,223
Anything. Everything. Something.
Nothing. Who the hell cares?

118
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,957
- Put me down. I'm down.
- All right.

119
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,226
Mr. Kimbrough
is ready to see you.

120
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,400
- Magic time.
- What?

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,464
Mr. Kimbrough.

122
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,938
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hello.

123
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,099
Hey, hey, hey.

124
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,575
- How you been?
- Good. You remember George.

125
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,844
- George, good to see you.
- Hello, Stu.

126
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,277
You remember Jay Crespi.

127
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,113
Jay Crespi.
I'm gonna forget Jay Crespi, huh?

128
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,346
- This is James Kimbrough.
- Nice to meet you.

129
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,047
- Thanks for coming in.
- Kimbrough.

130
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,662
- Don't spell.
- K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H.

131
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,956
- That's right.
- Yeah. It's a talent I have.

132
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,027
Why don't we sit down?
I'm glad you're here.

133
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,463
Some day out there, huh?

134
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,797
Did you ever see
weather like that?

135
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:46,996
It's crisp.

136
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,470
It's Crespi-crisp.

137
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,938
Shut up, George.

138
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,167
Can I get you anything?

139
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,411
What do we have
in the fruit department?

140
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,272
Pineapple.

141
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,144
That's a dangerous fruit.
It's like a weapon, that thing.

142
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Got spikes on the end.
Get killed from one of those things.

143
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,656
Anyway, let me tell you
why I called.

144
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,589
When I took over here, I reviewed
what was in development...

145
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,524
...and it was pretty much
same old.

146
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,060
Been there, done that.

147
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,530
Right. I was looking for something
different. Something that would have...

148
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,169
- ...people talking at the water coolers.
- Water coolers?

149
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,101
We call it a water-cooler show.

150
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,175
Because the next day, people gather
around the water coolers...

151
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,640
...to talk about it, right?

152
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,114
I would think people would talk about it
at the coffee machines.

153
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,911
Well, it's probably just easier
to say water-cooler show...

154
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,076
...than coffee-machine show.

155
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,516
It's really not accurate.

156
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,351
Nobody drinks from a water cooler
anymore, they use bottles.

157
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,824
But I think Mr. Kimbrough
makes a good point.

158
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,294
<i>Anyway, Stu here started telling me
about a show, Jerry...</i>

159
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,127
...that he developed
five years ago.

160
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,360
I have always loved it.

161
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,299
He said it was a show
about nothing.

162
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,839
So I saw the pilot,
and I've gotta tell you...

163
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,066
...I flipped out.

164
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,336
He totally flipped out.

165
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,475
What I wanna do is put it on the air.
Thirteen episode commitment.

166
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,049
Start it off on Wednesday night,
build an audience.

167
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,210
This show needs time to grow.

168
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,854
I love that Kramer guy.

169
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,512
He's a little off-the-wall.

170
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,488
- Oh, yeah, off-the-wall.
- Kramer.

171
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,628
And Elaine, I wouldn't mind seeing
something happening between you.

172
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,821
- Definitely.
- I tell you, I-

173
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,297
I really don't think
so-called relationship humor...

174
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,197
...is what this show's all about.

175
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,168
Or we can not do the show
altogether. How about that?

176
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,908
Or we could get them together.

177
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,287
Jill. Hi, it's Elaine.

178
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,622
Yeah, well,
I'm calling from my home.

179
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,525
Indoors.

180
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,863
Well- Well, I was just calling
to see how your fath-

181
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,537
I'm sorry, I'm getting another call.
Hang on just a second.

182
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,638
- Hello.
- Hi, Elaine, it's me.

183
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,136
<i>- I'm on the other line.
- This is an emergency.</i>

184
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,302
Get off the phone.

185
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,477
I'm sorry, Jill.

186
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,915
I'm gonna have to take this call.

187
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,048
Jerry, what's the emergency?

188
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,315
<i>Jerry's back on, the TV show.</i>

189
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,721
George and I
are moving to California.

190
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,383
That's the emergency?

191
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,963
- Did you hear what I said?
- I was on the other line talking to Jill.

192
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,590
Jill? Well,
why didn't you say so?

193
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,633
You said it was an emergency.

194
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,135
So now she's lost
a phone face-off?

195
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,934
That's even worse than
your cell phone walk-and-talk.

196
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,939
Congratulations.
They're doing the show.

197
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,378
They should have
put that show on five years ago.

198
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,108
Bunch of idiots at that network.

199
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,309
Can I tell you something, Jerry?

200
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,250
It's all crap on TV.

201
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,153
<i>The only thing I watch
is Xena: The Warrior Princess.</i>

202
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,816
She must be about 6'6".

203
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,859
She's not 6'6".

204
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,123
- Jerry, you ever watch that?
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

205
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,695
They picked up the show?

206
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,529
I'm moving to California.

207
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,264
Oh, baby doll, this kid's going places.
I told you.

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,203
The NBC guy liked it?

209
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,310
- Of course he liked it.
- He told you he liked it?

210
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,637
He wouldn't put it on
if he didn't like it.

211
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,672
Well, what are you doing?

212
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,613
- I'm writing.
- You know how to write?

213
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,777
Without the writing, you have nothing.
You make them look good.

214
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,752
Since when do you know
how to write?

215
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,552
- I never saw you write anything.
- Ma.

216
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,624
I don't know how you're gonna
write all those shows.

217
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,957
And where are you gonna
get all the ideas?

218
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,124
Would you leave him alone?
You'll shatter his confidence.

219
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,237
I don't need any ideas.
It's a show about nothing.

220
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,373
Nothing, please.
I'll tell you the truth.

221
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,135
The whole thing
sounds pretty stupid to me.

222
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,543
NBC is letting me
use their private jet?

223
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,878
And I can go anywhere I want?

224
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,652
That is fantastic.

225
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,947
Thanks. Yeah.

226
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,216
Great. Okay, bye.

227
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,252
Oh, hey.

228
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,860
Hey. How was the beach?

229
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,894
<i>You missed it, buddy.
Lot of femeninas.</i>

230
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,157
<i>Some major femeninas.</i>

231
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,267
Had a little meeting today
at NBC.

232
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,266
What are you doing?

233
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,573
You know, I went swimming.
I can't get this water out of my ear.

234
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,606
<i>So do you remember five years ago,
we did that pilot, Jerry?</i>

235
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,214
Well, the new guy at NBC
wants to do it.

236
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,977
They're putting it on the air. They're
giving us a 13 episode commitment.

237
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,678
George and I
are moving to California.

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,790
You're moving to California?

239
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,357
Yeah, but only for a while.

240
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
Yeah, but, Jerry,
what happens if the show's a hit?

241
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,094
You could be out there for years.

242
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,755
You might never come back.

243
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,959
- No, I'll be back.
- Jerry, it's L.A.

244
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,694
Nobody leaves.

245
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,205
She's a seductress,
she's a siren, she's a virgin...

246
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,606
...she's a whore.

247
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,310
And my agent said as a bonus
I can use their private jet.

248
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,450
So we'll all go somewhere,
the four of us.

249
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,313
One big fling before George
and I go to California.

250
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,045
A fling.

251
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,554
- So we can go anywhere we want?
- Go anywhere.

252
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,632
- Why are they doing this?
- I think they wanna make it up to us...

253
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,268
...because they let this
sit on their shelf for years.

254
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,428
This is all very exciting.

255
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,335
So where we going?

256
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,170
Well, I say Japan.

257
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,174
- Why Japan?
- Oh, geishas.

258
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,643
You know,
they cater to your every whim.

259
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,783
They're shy at first, but they're
quite skilled at conversation.

260
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:35,648
They can discuss anything, from
world affairs to the fine art of fishing.

261
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,015
Or baking.

262
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,921
I got it.
How about Russia?

263
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,486
Russia. It's so bleak.

264
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,857
It's not bleak.

265
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,329
- It's springtime.
- It's still bleak.

266
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,991
You can't be bleak in spring.

267
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,636
You can be bleak in spring.

268
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,830
If you're bleak, you're bleak.

269
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,209
What about Switzerland?

270
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,279
Switzerland.
The von Trapp family, huh?

271
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,879
It's a bit hilly. No?

272
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,010
You're not gonna do any walking.

273
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,155
What if I wanna
walk around a little?

274
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,023
So then you'll walk down the hill
and we'll pick you up.

275
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,022
- What if I'm at the bottom?
- You know what, forget it.

276
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,600
All right, come on.
Come on now, people.

277
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,363
Let's face it. We're not all
gonna agree on anything.

278
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,734
Why don't we just
all go to Paris?

279
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,974
I'll go to Paris.

280
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,269
- Me too.
- Yeah.

281
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,713
- So that's it. It's settled.
- Yeah.

282
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,920
We're going to Paris.

283
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,817
Yeah!

284
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,622
Hey. NBC limo is downstairs.

285
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,437
I'm just gonna call Jill
one more time before we go.

286
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,165
Elaine, you can't make a call
like that on your way out.

287
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,502
You can't rush that conversation.

288
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,373
Well, I can't call from the limo.
Can I call from the plane?

289
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,480
First you make
a cell phone walk-and-talk...

290
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,639
...then she loses
a call waiting face-off...

291
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,876
...now you're talking about
a plane call?

292
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,613
All right, I'll just have
to call her from Paris.

293
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,191
Hello, Jerry.

294
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,125
Hello, Newman. What gives?

295
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,890
I was speaking earlier
with Kramer...

296
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,661
...and he mentioned something
about a private jet to Paris.

297
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,928
Yeah, that's right.

298
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,596
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful
there this time of year...

299
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,639
...and you know
I'm one-quarter French.

300
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,936
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

301
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,079
In fact, I still have family there.

302
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,647
This probably
won't interest you...

303
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,580
...but I have a cousin there
who's suffering very badly.

304
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,545
She's lost all use
of her muscles.

305
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,191
She can only communicate
by blinking.

306
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,293
I would so love to see her.

307
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,589
Bring a ray of sunshine
into her tragic life.

308
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,459
But, alas, I can't afford it.

309
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,933
For I am, as you know,
but a simple postal worker.

310
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,263
- That's a shame.
- Take me! Take me!

311
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,428
Oh, forget it.

312
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,700
Pull yourself together.
You're making me sick.

313
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,468
Be a man.

314
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,003
All right.

315
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,477
But hear me and hear me well.

316
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,052
The day will come. Oh, yes.

317
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,349
Mark my words, Seinfeld.

318
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,515
Your day of reckoning
is coming.

319
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,924
When an evil wind will blow
through your little play world...

320
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,157
...and wipe that smug smile
off your face.

321
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:39,395
And I'll be there,
in all my glory, watching.

322
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:44,031
Watching as it all
comes crumbling down.

323
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,616
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

324
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,819
I'm Captain Maddox.

325
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,123
This is my copilot, Kurt Adams.

326
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,323
- Ready to go to Paris?
- All set.

327
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,832
- We'll just grab the bags.
- Don't worry about that.

328
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,461
- We'll take care of them for you.
- Just keeps getting better and better.

329
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,605
Not bad.

330
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,572
The only way to fly.

331
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,415
This is it?

332
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,347
I'm sorry, I have to say,
I'm a little disappointed.

333
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,821
I thought it would be a lot nicer.

334
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,188
You're complaining
about a private jet?

335
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,557
You think this is the plane
that Ted Danson gets?

336
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,564
Ted Danson is not even
on the network anymore.

337
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,635
I bet when they gave him a plane,
it was a lot nicer than this.

338
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,101
Will you shut up?

339
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,173
You are ruining the whole trip.

340
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,576
This is a real piece of junk.

341
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,275
I don't even feel safe
on this thing.

342
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,178
- I have a good mind to write a letter-
- You're not writing any letters.

343
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,843
- Will you turn around?
- Why?

344
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,649
You are annoying me
sitting like that.

345
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,347
It's effeminate.

346
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,016
- It's effeminate to sit like this?
- Yes.

347
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,958
I think it's a little effeminate.

348
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,689
How is this effeminate?

349
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:18,269
I don't know. It just is.

350
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,108
- What are you doing?
- You still got water in your ear?

351
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,576
I can't get rid of it.
Maybe it leaked inside my brain.

352
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,580
Kramer, stop that. It's not safe
to be jumping on a plane.

353
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,877
I gotta get it out.
I can't take this anymore.

354
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,385
Kramer, don't be
fooling around up here.

355
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,923
- Kramer!
- Hey, get the hell out of here.

356
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,218
What is that?

357
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,054
Oh, my God.

358
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,156
- What is that noise?
- Kramer, what the hell did you do?

359
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,492
I lost my balance.

360
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,895
Oh, my God.

361
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,468
What's going on?

362
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,472
- Kramer!
- It was an accident!

363
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,575
I told you to stop
with the hopping!

364
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,337
Oh, my God,
we're going down.

365
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,740
We're gonna die.

366
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,611
Just when I was doing great.

367
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,082
I told you God wouldn't let me
be successful.

368
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,086
Is this it? Is this how it ends?

369
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,816
It can't. It can't end like this.

370
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,550
I'm ready. I'm ready.

371
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,752
Glory hallelujah.

372
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,633
- Jerry? Jerry, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

373
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,701
- There's something I have to tell you.
- What? What is it?

374
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,606
- I cheated in the contest.
- What?

375
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,436
- The contest, I cheated.
- Why?

376
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,838
Because I'm a cheater!

377
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,481
I had to tell you.

378
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,742
Great, I won.

379
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,287
- Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
- Yeah.

380
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,583
Elaine, I've got something
I wanna say to you.

381
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,250
- No, no. Me first.
- All right.

382
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,330
Jerry, I've always-

383
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,899
Hey, what's going on?

384
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,126
We're straightening out.

385
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,566
- We're straightening out.
- We're straightening out.

386
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,764
- We're straightening out.
- Yeah!

387
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,075
Well, again,
sorry about that little mishap.

388
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,045
Once we get everything checked,
shouldn't be any more problems.

389
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,481
- Where are we?
- Latham, Massachusetts.

390
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,622
Why don't you take a cab into town,
get yourself something to eat?

391
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,190
I got your beeper number,
I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.

392
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,349
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

393
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,428
We'll see you later.

394
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,501
Well, what are we gonna do
about Paris?

395
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,170
I mean, are we actually
gonna get back on this plane?

396
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,408
I say we go back to New York
and take a regular flight.

397
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,450
I'm not getting on
a regular plane now.

398
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,485
I'm all psyched up
to go on a private jet.

399
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,681
No way I'm getting on
a regular plane.

400
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,725
Well, I'm sure that they would
fly us first class.

401
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,192
First class
doesn't make it anymore.

402
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,924
You get on the phone with Kimbrough
and tell him to get another plane here.

403
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,967
But this time, the good one.
The Ted Danson plane.

404
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,231
- All right, I'll feel him out.
- Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.

405
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,270
Nice day.

406
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,171
Another one.

407
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,808
All right, fatso,
out of the car.

408
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,309
I'm gonna capture this.

409
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,179
- Come on.
- I'm getting out. Give me a minute.

410
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,253
- Give me your wallet.
- Don't shoot.

411
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,687
Well, there goes the money
for the lipo.

412
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,621
See, the great thing about
robbing a fat guy is...

413
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,353
...it's an easy getaway,
you know?

414
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,055
They can't really chase you.

415
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,094
He's actually doing him a favor.

416
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,736
It's less money for him
to buy food.

417
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,671
I want your wallet. Come on.
Come on, come on!

418
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,134
That's a shame.

419
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,607
All right, I'm gonna call NBC.

420
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,246
Officer, he's stealing my car.

421
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,745
Officer, I was carjacked.

422
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,816
- I was held up at gunpoint.
- I understand.

423
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,111
Okay. Thanks anyway.
They can't get another plane.

424
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,950
What's wrong with the plane we got?
They're checking it out.

425
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,591
- No, no, no.
- Forget that.

426
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,488
- Forget it.
- We're not getting on there.

427
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,129
Come on, let's get something
to eat here in Sticksville.

428
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,657
- All right. Hold it right there.
- What?

429
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,762
- You're under arrest.
- Under arrest? What for?

430
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,498
Article 223-7
of the Latham County Penal Code.

431
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,665
What? No, no,
we didn't do anything.

432
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,333
That's exactly right.

433
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,878
The law requires you to help
or assist anyone in danger...

434
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,039
...as long as it's reasonable
to do so.

435
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,476
I never heard of that.

436
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,281
It's new. It's called
the Good Samaritan Law.

437
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,318
- Let's go.
- Well-

438
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,001
A Good Samaritan law?
Are they crazy?

439
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,864
- Why would we help somebody?
- I know.

440
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,529
That's what nuns
and Red Cross workers are for.

441
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,574
The Samaritans
were an ancient tribe.

442
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,472
Very helpful to people.

443
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,812
All right.

444
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,915
Excuse me. Hi.

445
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,177
Could you tell me
what kind of law this is?

446
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,514
Well, they just passed it
last year.

447
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,418
And it's modeled
after the French law.

448
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,854
I heard about it
after Princess Diana was killed...

449
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,051
...and those photographers
were standing around.

450
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,490
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

451
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,654
You're the first ones
to be arrested on it...

452
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,732
...probably in the whole country.

453
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,658
All right,
so, what's the penalty?

454
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,202
Let's pay the fine
and get the hell out of here.

455
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:25,366
Well, it's not that easy. See, the law
calls for a maximum fine of $85,000...

456
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,375
...and as much as
five years in prison.

457
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,038
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no.

458
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,080
We have to be in California
next week.

459
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,717
We're starting a TV show.

460
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,080
California?
Oh, gosh, I don't think so.

461
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,620
My guess is
you're gonna be prosecuted.

462
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,781
Better get yourselves
a good lawyer.

463
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,226
Who told you to put the cheese on?
Did I tell you?

464
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,163
<i>- I didn't tell you to put it on.
- Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.</i>

465
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,236
You people with the cheese.
It never ends.

466
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,505
Hello.

467
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,242
Good Samaritan Law?
I never heard of it.

468
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,315
You don't have to help anybody.
That's what this country's about.

469
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,782
That's deplorable,
unfathomable, improbable.

470
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,012
Hold on. Susie.

471
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,247
Cancel my appointment
with Dr. Byson.

472
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,482
And pack a bag for me.

473
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,354
I wanna get to Latham,
Massachusetts right away.

474
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,328
So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?

475
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,899
And you know what that means.

476
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,764
This whole place
is gonna be swarming with media.

477
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,404
By the time this thing is over...

478
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,473
...you're not gonna be able
to find a hotel room in this town.

479
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,206
The whole country
is going to be watching this.

480
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,176
Now, we gotta do
whatever it takes to win it.

481
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,441
No matter what the cost.

482
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:43,111
And a big issue in this trial
is going to be character.

483
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,154
Find out everything
about these people.

484
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,885
And I mean everything.

485
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,265
It's pretty good chow, huh?

486
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,400
It would kill him
to check up on us?

487
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,637
No. Drops off the meals
and that's it.

488
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,641
I realize we're prisoners,
but we're still entitled to ketchup.

489
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,117
I guess we could have
called for help.

490
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,656
But then we would have missed
the whole thing.

491
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,556
I still had it on video.
We could have watched it later.

492
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,025
Yeah, he's right.

493
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:26,824
I forgot about the video.

494
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,558
Oh, sure, video.

495
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,497
What is that?

496
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,130
Plane's ready.

497
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,043
I'm Geraldo Rivera.
We'll be talking about...

498
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,280
...what most of you have probably
been discussing in your homes...

499
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,754
...and around the water coolers
in your offices.

500
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,019
I'm speaking of the controversial
Good Samaritan trial...

501
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,993
...that gets underway Thursday
in Latham, Massachusetts.

502
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,963
Now, before we meet our panel,
let's go to Latham live...

503
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,432
...where Jane Wells
is standing by. Jane.

504
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,094
<i>Yes, good evening, Geraldo.</i>

505
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,137
<i>What's the mood?
What's going on tonight?</i>

506
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,537
<i>Well, Latham
is fairly quiet tonight...</i>

507
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,441
<i>...considering the media circus that
has descended upon this quaint town.</i>

508
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,674
And what about the defendants,
the so-called New York Four?

509
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,044
How are they holding up?

510
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,243
Well, I did speak
with one of the deputies...

511
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,617
...who has some contact with them,
and he told me, quote:

512
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,951
"There's no love lost
with that group."

513
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,354
Anything else, Jane?

514
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,621
There also seems to be some friction
between Mr. Seinfeld and Ms. Benes.

515
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,962
The rumor is that they once dated,
and it's possible that ended badly.

516
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:42,470
Well, who knows, maybe this trial
will bring them closer together.

517
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,132
Maybe they'll even end up
getting married.

518
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,378
I hope you packed enough.

519
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,014
This trial could last for weeks.

520
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,443
What's all that?

521
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,914
- Cereal.
- You're packing cereal?

522
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,746
I'm bringing it for Jerry.

523
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,253
- You got enough for a life sentence.
- He likes it.

524
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,981
He misses that
more than anything.

525
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,625
So bring a snack pack.

526
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:02,953
Poor Georgie.

527
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,221
Was it our fault
this happened to him?

528
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,365
Did we do something wrong?

529
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,261
Maybe it was our fault.

530
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,992
Maybe it was your fault.

531
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,932
It wasn't my fault,
I can tell you that.

532
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,096
Oh, so it was my fault
but not yours.

533
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,832
You were the one
who smothered him.

534
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,341
- I did not smother him.
- You smothered.

535
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,845
He couldn't get any air. He couldn't
breathe. He was suffocating!

536
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:28,281
Sure. And you were always in Korea
with your religious chachkas.

537
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,978
I had to make a living!

538
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,834
This is excellent, huh?

539
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,482
Don't worry, I didn't use too much milk,
because I know we gotta make it last.

540
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,044
You know, I've had to reduce
my milk level.

541
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,588
I've always filled to three-quarters,
sometimes to the top of the cereal.

542
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,522
Now to conserve,
I can't even see the milk anymore.

543
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,356
- It's a big adjustment.
- I bet.
