544
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,998
It's one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

545
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,826
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Jackie.

546
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,029
- Good morning.
- Is everybody ready?

547
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,636
Didn't I tell you I wanted you
to wear the cardigan?

548
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,071
- Makes me look older.
- Look older?

549
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,646
You think this is a game?
That what you think this is?

550
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,215
I'm trying to give you a moral
compass. You have none.

551
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,113
You're gonna walk
into that courtroom...

552
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,754
...and they'll see a mean,
nasty, evil George Costanza.

553
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,050
I want them to see Perry Como.
No one's gonna convict Perry Como.

554
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,819
Perry Como helps out a fat tub
who's getting robbed.

555
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,252
You think it's funny?

556
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,521
No.

557
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,962
You damn right it isn't.

558
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,602
You better not be laughing
in that courtroom, funnyman.

559
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,900
If you start getting all smart-alecky,
making wisecracks, acting a fool...

560
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,010
...you're gonna find yourself in here
for a long, long time.

561
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,043
I don't like that tie.

562
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,110
Susie, get one of my ties
from my briefcase.

563
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,443
How do I look, Jackie?

564
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,915
Oh, you looking good.

565
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
You look strong.

566
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,119
You one fine-looking,
sexy lady.

567
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,258
Thank you, Jackie.

568
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,520
What about me, Jackie?

569
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,493
Kramer, you always look good.

570
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,099
You got respect for yourself.
You're genuine.

571
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,167
The jury's gonna pick up on that.

572
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,902
Here.

573
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,963
- This one?
- That's right.

574
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,269
- Do I have to?
- Jackie says put it on, Jerry.

575
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,238
All rise.

576
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,947
Fourth District County Court, Latham,
Massachusetts is now in session.

577
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,413
The Honorable Judge
Arthur Vandelay presiding.

578
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,216
Vandelay?

579
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,517
- The judge's name is Vandelay?
- Vanda who?

580
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,490
- Jerry, did you hear that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,923
I think that's a good sign.

582
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,792
Is the district attorney
ready to proceed?

583
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,795
We are, Your Honor.

584
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,093
Mr. Hoyt.

585
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,266
Ladies and gentlemen,
last year our city council...

586
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,569
...by a vote of 12-to-2,
passed a Good Samaritan law.

587
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,042
Now, essentially,
we made it a crime...

588
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,647
...to ignore a fellow
human being in trouble.

589
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,808
Now, this group
from New York...

590
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,682
...not only ignored,
but as we will prove...

591
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:55,383
...they actually mocked the victim
as he was being robbed at gunpoint.

592
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,088
I can guarantee you one other thing,
ladies and gentlemen...

593
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,995
...this is not the first time
they have behaved in this manner.

594
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,559
On the contrary.

595
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,705
They have quite a record
of mocking and maligning.

596
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,467
This is a history of selfishness,
self-absorption...

597
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,476
...immaturity and greed.

598
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,615
And you will see
how everyone...

599
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,945
...who has come into contact
with these four individuals...

600
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,054
...has been abused, wronged...

601
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,055
...deceived and betrayed.

602
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:29,715
This time...

603
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,522
...they have gone too far.

604
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,255
This time...

605
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,992
...they are going to be
held accountable.

606
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,601
This time...

607
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,230
...they are the ones who will pay.

608
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,878
Mr. Chiles?

609
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,838
I am shocked and chagrined.

610
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,344
Mortified and stupefied.

611
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,453
This trial is outrageous.

612
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,715
It is a waste of the taxpayers'
time and money.

613
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:02,485
It is a travesty of justice
that these four people...

614
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,185
...have been incarcerated
while the real perpetrator...

615
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,627
...is walking around laughing.

616
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,929
Lying and laughing.
Laughing and lying.

617
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,733
Do you know what
these four people were?

618
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,067
They were innocent bystanders.

619
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,073
Now, you just think
about that term.

620
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,645
Innocent bystanders.

621
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,281
That's exactly what they were.

622
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,917
We know they were bystanders,
nobody's disputing that.

623
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,315
So how can a bystander be guilty?
No such thing.

624
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,251
Have you ever heard
of a guilty bystander?

625
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:36,223
No. Because you cannot be
a bystander and be guilty.

626
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,123
Bystanders are,
by definition, innocent.

627
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,093
That is the nature
of bystanding.

628
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,789
But, no.

629
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
They wanna change
nature here.

630
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,765
They wanna create
a whole new animal.

631
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,134
The guilty bystander.

632
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,810
But don't you let them do it.

633
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,547
Only you can stop them.

634
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,511
Thank you.

635
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,083
<i>That was wonderful. Thank you.</i>

636
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,625
Is the prosecution ready
to present its first witness?

637
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,265
We are, Your Honor.

638
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,529
Call Officer Matt Vogel
to the stand.

639
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,866
Call Matt Vogel.

640
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,779
- So they were just standing there?
- Yes.

641
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,280
Did one of them have
a video camera?

642
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,539
Yes.

643
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,681
With the court's permission,
we would like to play back that video...

644
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,720
...and enter it into evidence
as Exhibit A.

645
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,750
Proceed.

646
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,960
<i>- Come on.
- Okay, I'm getting out.</i>

647
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,494
<i>Well, there goes the money
for the lipo.</i>

648
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,100
<i>See, the great thing about robbing
a fat guy is it's an easy getaway.</i>

649
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,826
<i>They can't really chase you.</i>

650
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:52,992
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

651
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,934
<i>He's actually doing him a favor.</i>

652
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,267
<i>It's less money
for him to buy food.</i>

653
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,210
So they just stood there
and did nothing?

654
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,520
Yeah. Nothing. Nothing.

655
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,886
No further questions.

656
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:15,355
Hey, great plane.

657
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,093
Thanks a lot.

658
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,250
Piece of junk.

659
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,021
You know,
you almost got us killed.

660
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,161
Call Mabel Choate to the stand.

661
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,028
Call Mabel Choate.

662
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,340
Your Honor, I most strenuously
and vigorously object to this witness.

663
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,173
She was not present
at the incident.

664
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,544
Her testimony is irrelevant,
irrational and inconsequential.

665
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,351
The prosecution has gone to great
lengths and considerable cost...

666
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,455
...to find these character witnesses.

667
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,582
It is imperative that we establish
this is not merely an isolated incident.

668
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,888
It's part of a pattern
of antisocial behavior...

669
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,758
...that's been going on for years.

670
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,693
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you.

671
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,027
I'll hear the witness.

672
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,471
Now, Mrs. Choate,
would you please tell the court...

673
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,870
...what happened
the evening of January 4th?

674
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,373
Well, I was in Schnitzer's Bakery
when I got accosted by that man.

675
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,709
Let the record show
that she's pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.

676
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,874
What did he want?

677
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,915
My marble rye.

678
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,083
Your marble rye?

679
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,554
I got the last one.

680
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,920
He kept persisting,
and I said no.

681
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,584
- Then you left the bakery.
- Right.

682
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,889
But it didn't end there,
did it, Mrs. Choate?

683
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,430
Oh, no.

684
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,628
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it. Let go.

685
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,099
I want that rye, lady.

686
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,601
Help. Someone, help.

687
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,261
Shut up, you old bag.

688
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,070
Stop, thief. Please, stop him.
Stop him, he's got my marble rye.

689
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,773
No further questions.

690
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,941
I call Marla Penny to the stand.

691
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,742
Call Marla Penny.

692
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,653
The virgin.

693
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,356
What was your connection
to the defendants?

694
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,260
I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks
in the autumn of 1992.

695
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,871
Then on October 28th, there was
an abrupt end to that relationship.

696
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,301
Tell us what happened.

697
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,100
Well, it's rather difficult
to talk about.

698
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,272
It's all right. Take your time.

699
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,881
Well, I became aware of a-

700
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,108
A what?

701
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,678
- A...
- Yes?

702
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,556
A contest.

703
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,691
- A contest?
- Yes.

704
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,952
What was the nature
of the contest?

705
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,460
Oh, please, I can't.

706
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,564
It's okay.

707
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,623
The four of them...

708
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,793
- ...made a wager to see if they could-
- Yes?

709
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,605
To see who could
go the longest...

710
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,174
...without gratifying themselves.

711
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,976
- Boy, this is an outrage.
- For the love of God.

712
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,478
It was horrible. Horrible.

713
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,983
Call Donald Sanger to the stand.

714
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,846
Who the hell is that?

715
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:01,651
Come on, Donald.
You're doing fine.

716
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,124
- The Bubble Boy.
- Bubble Boy?

717
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,286
That's right, the Bubble Boy.

718
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,556
What's a Bubble Boy?

719
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,700
He's a boy who lives in a bubble.

720
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,962
What the hell
are you all looking at?

721
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,537
Would you please tell the court
about the incident...

722
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:20,336
...that occurred in your house,
October 7th, 1992?

723
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,810
Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed
to come to my house...

724
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,711
...but his friend Costanza
showed up instead.

725
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,183
So I challenged him
to a game of Trivial Pursuit.

726
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:34,052
Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?

727
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,284
That's a joke. The Moors.

728
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,690
Oh, no.

729
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,088
I'm so sorry, it's the Moops.

730
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,631
The correct answer
is the Moops.

731
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,827
Moops? Let me see that.

732
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,397
That's not Moops, you jerk.

733
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,873
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

734
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,343
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

735
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,184
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.

736
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,081
There's no Moops.

737
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,280
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

738
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,915
Moops.

739
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,491
Help, someone.

740
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,184
There's no Moops, you idiot.

741
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,726
Stop it. Let go of him.

742
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,387
Donald. Stop it.

743
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,432
No. Donald, stop it.

744
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,402
- It was Moops.
- Moors.

745
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,072
So Mr. Costanza parked in
a handicapped spot, and as a result...

746
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,414
...you got in an accident
and your wheelchair was destroyed?

747
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,748
- That's right.
- And then Mr. Kramer...

748
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,289
...gave you a used wheelchair?

749
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,051
That's right.

750
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,000
So you were the doctor on duty
the night Susan Ross died?

751
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,640
Yes, that's right.

752
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:02,040
It was May 16th, 1996.

753
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,544
I'll never forget it.

754
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,308
So you broke the news
to Mr. Costanza?

755
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,451
Would you tell the court, please,
what his reaction was.

756
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,286
I would describe it...

757
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,687
...as restrained jubilation.

758
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,156
- Murderer!
- He killed our daughter.

759
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,821
He knew those envelopes
were toxic!

760
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,961
Order in this court.

761
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,166
Call Sidra Holland to the stand.

762
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,240
Look at this one. She's fine.

763
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,945
She's a 12.

764
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,949
You dated her?

765
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,222
So you met Jerry Seinfeld
in a health club...

766
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,484
- ...sometime in 1993?
- Yes.

767
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,652
- You met Ms. Benes in the same club?
- Yes, that's true.

768
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,890
Would you describe
the circumstances of that meeting?

769
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,367
We were in the sauna,
making chitchat.

770
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,266
You know,
I've seen you around the club.

771
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,304
My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

772
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh, hi.

773
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,174
- I'm Elaine.
- Hi.

774
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,743
So she pretended to trip...

775
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,578
...and she fell into your breasts.

776
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,078
Yes.

777
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,017
Why would she do that?

778
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,592
Because he sent her in there
to find out if they were real.

779
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,866
- State your name.
- Bookman. Joe Bookman.

780
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,969
- And what's your occupation?
- I'm a library cop.

781
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,565
What's a library cop do?

782
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,270
We chase down
library delinquents.

783
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,811
Anyone in this room
ever delinquent?

784
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,543
Yeah, he was. Right over there.
Seinfeld.

785
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,549
- How long was his book overdue?
- Twenty-five years.

786
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,547
We don't call them delinquent
after that long.

787
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,386
- What do you call them?
- Criminals.

788
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,127
So you and Mr. Costanza
were dating.

789
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,892
- Yes.
- And then what happened?

790
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,496
Well, I invited him to attend
my son's birthday party and...

791
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,770
Fire!

792
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,247
At the time, I was employed
as a security guard...

793
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,909
...in the parking garage
at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall.

794
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,724
Okay, let's go.

795
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,418
Why would I
unless I was in danger?

796
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,189
- I know it's against the law.
- I don't know.

797
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,267
Because I could get uromysitisis
poisoning and die, that's why.

798
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,864
Uromysitisis.

799
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,065
I wonder if they're having any trouble
controlling themselves now.

800
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,473
Perhaps these two hooligans would
like to have a pee party right here!

801
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,206
Objection, Your Honor.
This is completely inappropriate.

802
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,475
My client's medical condition
is not on trial.

803
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,642
May I refer you
to the Disability Act of 1990.

804
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,015
Sit down, Mr. Chiles.

805
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,119
All right, detective,
then what happened?

806
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,521
We got a tip that a lot
of prostitutes had been...

807
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,354
...turning tricks in the parking lot.

808
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,723
- You just cost me some money.
- Hey, cool it, lady.

809
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,625
Cool it.

810
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,234
Cool it, lady. Cool it.

811
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,997
Police officers. Freeze right there.

812
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:19,375
So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact...

813
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,234
...a pimp.

814
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,377
So you asked Mr. Seinfeld
if he would wear your puffy shirt...

815
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,811
<i>...on the Today show?</i>

816
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,153
Excuse me?

817
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,755
Excuse me, Your Honor.
What is the point of this testimony?

818
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,089
This woman's a low talker.
I can't hear a word.

819
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,064
So either get some other kind of
microphone up there or let's move on.

820
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,296
Call George Steinbrenner
to the stand.

821
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,473
Call George Steinbrenner.

822
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,973
So George Costanza came
to work for you in May of 1994?

823
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,236
That's right. He was a good kid.
A lovely boy.

824
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,210
Shared his calzone with me.
That was a heck of a sandwich.

825
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,215
Yes, sir, that was
a good sandwich, sir.

826
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,751
- Had one little problem though.
- What was that?

827
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,321
He was a communist.
Pink as they come.

828
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,890
Like a big, juicy steak.

829
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,124
How could you give $12 million
to Hideki Irabu?

830
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,558
Order.

831
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,689
Cockfighting?

832
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,762
Cockfighting.

833
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,535
Sponges. And I don't mean
the kind you clean your tub with.

834
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,694
They're for sex.

835
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,775
She said she needed
a whole case of them.

836
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,911
She exposed her nipple.

837
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,844
- How did she try to kill you?
- She tried to smother me with a pillow.

838
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,756
Call Yev Kassem to the stand.

839
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,894
- Call Yev Kassem.
- Who?

840
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,125
The Soup Nazi.

841
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,288
Soup Nazi?

842
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,128
You people have a little pet name
for everybody.

843
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,725
State your name.

844
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,065
- Yev Kassem.
- Could you spell that, please?

845
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,764
No. Next question.

846
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,137
- How do you know the defendants?
- They used to come to my restaurant.

847
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,679
Medium turkey chili.

848
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,691
Medium crab bisque.

849
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,159
- I didn't get any bread.
- Just forget it. Let it go.

850
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,171
Excuse me. I think you forgot
my bread.

851
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,002
- You want bread?
- Yes, please.

852
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,837
Three dollars.

853
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,037
- What?
- No soup for you.

854
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,379
But the idiot clowns
did not know how to order.

855
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,787
I banned that one,
the woman, for a year.

856
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,550
Then one day...

857
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:50,989
...she came back.

858
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,255
Five cups chopped
porcine mushrooms...

859
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,331
...half a cup of olive oil...

860
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,491
...three pounds celery...

861
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,534
That's my recipe
for wild mushroom.

862
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,561
You're through, Soup Nazi.

863
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,065
Pack it up.

864
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,873
No more soup for you.

865
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,238
Next!

866
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,511
She published my recipes.

867
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,049
I had to close the store
and move to Argentina.

868
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,312
She ruined my business.

869
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,649
His soup's
not all that good anyway.

870
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,814
What did you say?

871
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,397
The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt
to the stand.

872
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,164
- How did they find Babu?
- I thought he was deported.

873
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,210
You've come a long way
to be here today, haven't you?

874
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,779
Yes. All the way from Pakistan.

875
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,109
And what's your connection
to the defendants?

876
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,813
I owned a restaurant.

877
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,081
Seinfeld told me to change
the menu to Pakistani.

878
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,781
But nobody came.

879
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,687
There were no people.

880
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,054
And then what happened?

881
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:02,130
Then he got me an apartment
in his building...

882
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,766
...but they mixed up the mail...

883
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,461
...and I never got
my immigration renewal papers.

884
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,037
So they deported me.

885
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:16,204
It's all his fault.
Him and the woman.

886
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,611
But they did not care.
They're totally indifferent.

887
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,581
All they do is mock me.
Just like they did the fat fellow.

888
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,745
All the time mocking,
mocking, mocking.

889
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,049
All the time.

890
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,988
Now it is Babu's turn to mock.

891
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,890
Finally, I will have some justice.

892
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,226
Send them away. Send them all away.
Lock them up forever.

893
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,132
They're not human.

894
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,700
They're very bad.

895
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,465
Very, very, very bad.

896
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,050
<i>Hi, I'm Geraldo Rivera, and welcome
to this special edition of Rivera Live.</i>

897
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,160
Arguments in the Good Samaritan
trial ended today...

898
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:08,765
...the jury has been in deliberation
for four and a half hours now.

899
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,833
Let's go live to Jane Wells,
who is in Latham, Massachusetts...

900
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,936
...covering this trial for us. Jane.

901
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,096
<i>Just a few minutes ago,
the jury asked to see the videotape.</i>

902
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,936
That's the one where they are
overheard making sarcastic remarks...

903
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,510
...during the robbery.

904
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,909
<i>Yes, it's a very incriminating
piece of evidence.</i>

905
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,413
<i>But I must tell you,
Geraldo...</i>

906
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,177
<i>...this courtroom and everyone
who's attended this trial...</i>

907
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,947
<i>...is still reeling from the endless
parade of witnesses...</i>

908
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,987
<i>...who've come forth
so enthusiastically...</i>

909
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:37,150
<i>...to testify against these
four seemingly ordinary people.</i>

910
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,728
One had the feeling that if Judge
Vandelay didn't put a stop to it...

911
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,559
...it could have
gone on for months.

912
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,133
Jane, whose testimony
do you think resonated...

913
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,793
...most strongly with this jury?

914
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,165
That is so hard to say.

915
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,001
Certainly, there's the doctor
with the poison invitations.

916
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,942
The Bubble Boy was an extremely
sympathetic and tragic figure.

917
00:46:56,113 --> 00:47:00,072
And that bizarre contest certainly
didn't sit well with this small-town jury.

918
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,718
There's the woman they sold
the defective wheelchair to.

919
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,013
The deported
Pakistani restaurateur.

920
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:10,354
Geraldo, it just went
on and on and on into the night.

921
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,552
And so we wait.

922
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,327
Do they make you wear uniforms
in prison?

923
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:19,758
I think so.

924
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,167
It's not that bright orange one, is it?

925
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,738
I hope it's not that one...

926
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,365
...because I cannot wear orange.

927
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,635
Will you stop worrying?

928
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,212
Jackie's gonna get us off.
He never loses.

929
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,645
How about when he asked that cop
if a black man...

930
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,685
...had ever been to his house.
Did you see the look on his face?

931
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,849
Sorry to bother you, judge.

932
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,516
How did you get in here?

933
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,323
Please. If he's found guilty...

934
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,931
...please be kind to him.

935
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,897
He's a good boy.

936
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,060
This is highly irregular.

937
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,696
Well, maybe there's something
I can do for you.

938
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,206
What do you mean?

939
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,276
You know.

940
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,092
Oh, Jackie. You're so articulate.

941
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,456
We got plenty of time too.

942
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,531
This jury could be out for days.

943
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:03,238
Hello.

944
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,564
Damn.

945
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,374
They're ready.

946
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,051
Hey, Elaine. What was it you were
about to say to me on the plane...

947
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,884
...when it was going down?

948
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,951
I've always loved...

949
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,620
...United Airlines.

950
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,989
I think it's gonna be okay.

951
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,761
That girl just smiled at me.

952
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,731
Maybe because she knows
you're going to jail.

953
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,897
What?

954
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,501
All rise.

955
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,810
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

956
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,011
...have you reached a verdict?

957
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,287
We have, Your Honor.

958
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,548
Will the defendants please rise?

959
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:04,587
And how do you find with respect
to the charge of criminal indifference?

960
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,292
We find the defendants...

961
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:08,621
...guilty.

962
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,334
Oh, no!

963
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,731
Order in this court.

964
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,271
Order! Order in this court!

965
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,811
I will clear this room.

966
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,244
I do not know how...

967
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,353
...or under what circumstances
the four of you found each other.

968
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,655
But your callous indifference
and utter disregard...

969
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,991
...for everything
that is good and decent...

970
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:45,760
...has rocked the very foundation
upon which our society is built.

971
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:50,161
I can think of nothing
more fitting...

972
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,434
...than for the four of you
to spend a year...

973
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,942
...removed from society...

974
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,973
...so that you can contemplate...

975
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:04,052
...the manner in which
you have conducted yourselves.

976
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,517
I know I will.

977
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,689
This court is adjourned.

978
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,789
You had to hop.

979
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,296
You had to hop on the plane!

980
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,225
Puddy.

981
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,704
- Don't wait for me.
- All right.

982
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,801
We gotta get out of here.

983
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,807
We wanna beat the traffic.

984
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,709
Come on, Jackie. Let's go.

985
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,379
What?

986
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,343
Oh, and by the way...

987
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:41,355
...they're real,
and they're spectacular.

988
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,760
Well, it's only a year.

989
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,490
That's not so bad.

990
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,294
We'll be out in a year.

991
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,766
And then we'll be back.

992
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,199
Could be fun.

993
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:58,671
Don't have to worry about your meals
or what you're gonna do Saturdays.

994
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,934
And they do shows.

995
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,509
Yeah, we could put on a show.

996
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,875
<i>Maybe Bye Bye Birdie
or My Fair Lady.</i>

997
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,040
Yeah, Elaine,
you could be Liza Doolittle.

998
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,552
Why don't you just
blow it out your a-?

999
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,804
If I call Jill from prison, you think that
would make up for the other ones?

1000
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:39,642
- Sure.
- Because you only get one call.

1001
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:43,547
The prison call is like
the king of calls.

1002
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,314
I think that would be
a very nice gesture.

1003
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,858
I got it.

1004
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,660
It's out.

1005
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,900
Not that bad, huh?

1006
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,668
Oh, boy, what a relief.

1007
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:12,011
See, now, to me, that button
is in the worst possible spot.

1008
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,374
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1009
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,814
The second button
is the key button.

1010
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,012
It literally makes
or breaks the shirt.

1011
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,020
Look at it. It's too high.

1012
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,182
It's in no man's land.

1013
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,760
Haven't we had
this conversation before?

1014
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,727
You think?

1015
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,930
I think we have.

1016
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,501
Yeah, maybe we have.

1017
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,077
So, what is the deal
with the yard?

1018
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,479
When I was a kid, my mother
wanted me to play in the yard...

1019
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:51,052
...but she didn't have to worry
about my neighbor...

1020
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,882
...sticking a shiv in my thigh.

1021
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,457
What's with the lockdown?
Why do we have to be locked in cells?

1022
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,223
Are we that bad that we have
to be sent to prison in prison?

1023
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,368
You would think the weightlifting
and the sodomy is enough.

1024
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,734
- So anyone from Cellblock D?
- I am.

1025
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,875
I'll talk slower.

1026
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,910
I'm kidding. I love Cellblock D.

1027
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,875
My friend George
is in Cellblock D.

1028
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,008
- What are you in for, sir?
- Murder one.

1029
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,948
Murder one.

1030
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,653
Watch out, everybody.
Better be nice to you.

1031
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,791
I'm only kidding, sir. Lighten up.

1032
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,949
- How about you?
- Grand theft auto.

1033
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,118
Grand theft auto.
Don't steal any of my jokes.

1034
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,854
You suck. I'm gonna cut you.

1035
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:37,693
I don't knock the license plate
out of your hand.

1036
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,062
All right, Seinfeld,
that's it. Let's go. Come on.

1037
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,726
All right.
Hey, you've been great.

1038
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,430
See you in the cafeteria.
