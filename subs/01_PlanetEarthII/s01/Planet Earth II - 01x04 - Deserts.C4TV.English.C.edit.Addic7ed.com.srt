2
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,550
Imagine a world where temperatures
rise to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

3
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,430
Where there's no escape
from sun, wind and dust.

4
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,870
Imagine a world with
almost no food or water.

5
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,809
These are the conditions in

6
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,110
one third of the lands of our planet.

7
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,590
To live here demands the most
extraordinary survival strategies.

8
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,369
This is the oldest desert in the world.

9
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,750
The Namib in south-west Africa.

10
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,350
It's been dry for 55 million years.

11
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,470
Life here for a hunter
is as hard as it gets.

12
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,129
A pride of lions.

13
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,609
One of the very few that endures
this desert's scorching temperatures

14
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,590
and lack of water.

15
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,430
Hunting here presents special problems.

16
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,630
A herd of oryx, the only
prey within 20 miles.

17
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,129
Out here, there is no cover for an ambush.

18
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,390
It'll have to be a straight chase.

19
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,889
They have failed

20
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,590
and each failed hunt brings
the lions closer to starvation.

21
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,169
To find enough to eat,

22
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,510
the pride continually searches
an area the size of Switzerland.

23
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:26,350
Three days and 100 miles
later, and still no kill.

24
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,369
These are desperate times.

25
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,230
A dry riverbed on the
edge of their territory.

26
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,609
The only animals here are giraffe,

27
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,790
but these one-tonne giants could
kill a lion with a single kick.

28
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,070
Lions seldom tackle such formidable prey...

29
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,030
...but this pride can't go
on much longer without food.

30
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,470
The whole pride must work together
as a team if they're to succeed.

31
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,169
Two lionesses lead the chase.

32
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,750
Others race to cut off
possible escape routes.

33
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,350
The giraffe has the speed and
stamina to outrun the pride...

34
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,310
...but it's being chased into a trap.

35
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,510
Up ahead, the lead female waits.

36
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,310
It's now up to her.

37
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,790
Most lion hunts end in failure.

38
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,510
But no lions fail more often than
those that live in the desert.

39
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,030
Once again, the pride
must continue their search.

40
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,390
It does, sometimes, rain in the desert.

41
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,990
Here, in the American West, storms
can strike with devastating force.

42
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,009
After ten months of drought,

43
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,070
millions of tonnes of water are
dumped on the land in under an hour.

44
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,209
Over millions of years,

45
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,569
sand and gravel carried
by the rampaging floods

46
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,830
have carved channels
through the solid rock.

47
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,670
Slot canyons, 150 feet deep.

48
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,609
In some places, these canyons have widened

49
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,569
until the land between them
is sculpted into tablelands

50
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,889
and isolated pinnacles,

51
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,150
some of the most dramatic
landscapes on the planet.

52
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,830
The rain may be long gone...

53
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,470
...but there is water here...

54
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:47,310
...locked away within the tissues
of specialist desert plants.

55
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,150
Cacti are unique to American deserts.

56
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,929
They all hoard water,

57
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,449
storing it in swollen stems

58
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,230
and protecting it behind
a barricade of spines.

59
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,950
They're so successful that
they dominate these deserts.

60
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,649
But this forest of spikes can cause

61
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,710
problems for the animals that live here.

62
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,150
A Harrisxxx hawk.

63
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,230
It has developed special techniques
for hunting amongst the cacti.

64
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,489
Ground squirrels.

65
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,870
Prey.

66
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,750
At the first sign of danger they
bolt for the safety of the thorns.

67
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,230
But the hawks have a
tactic to flush them out.

68
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,550
These are the only birds
of prey that hunt in packs.

69
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,350
Flying in formation, they try to
drive their quarry into the open.

70
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,990
But this squirrel is staying put.

71
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,950
So now the hawks continue the hunt...

72
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,390
...on foot.

73
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,070
They're closing in from all sides.

74
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,070
Soon, all escape routes are cut off.

75
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,070
The squirrel is trapped.

76
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,129
The spines that cover almost
every plant in this desert

77
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,030
can provide protection and
shelter for many animals.

78
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:01,030
So, why should these
spikes be hung with corpses?

79
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,529
What kind of creature could be responsible

80
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,310
for creating such a gruesome scene?

81
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,470
There's a mysterious killer
at work in this desert.

82
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,630
It's a butcherbird.

83
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,609
This little songbird uses the
spines as a butcher uses his hook...

84
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,110
to hold its prey as it dismembers it.

85
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,750
And with chicks to feed, he
also uses the spines as a larder.

86
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,790
He's been stocking it for weeks.

87
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,489
Hanging his prey out of the
reach of scavengers on the ground

88
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,390
ensures that his newly hatched
young will never go hungry.

89
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,870
An ingenious solution to making
the good times last in the desert...

90
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,809
...if a little macabre.

91
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,009
Some deserts are so arid,

92
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,550
they appear totally
devoid of all vegetation.

93
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,430
Yet even these landscapes can be
transformed in a matter of days.

94
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,249
The deserts of Peru are
amongst the driest in the world,

95
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,209
but just add a little water and
plants that have lain dormant

96
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,070
for months will burst into life.

97
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,609
And when a desert suddenly turns green,

98
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:39,230
even the most seemingly desolate
can become a land of opportunity.

99
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,249
No creature exploits the
greening of a desert more quickly

100
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,870
or more dramatically than a locust.

101
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,089
Madagascar's arid south-west

102
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,190
has received its highest rainfall in years.

103
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,889
Now, an army is on the march,

104
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,070
attracted by the smell
of newly sprouting grass.

105
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,449
Locusts are normally solitary creatures,

106
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,129
but when food becomes suddenly
plentiful they come together

107
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,750
into an unstoppable force that
devours everything in its path.

108
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,710
But this devastation is
about to get a lot worse.

109
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,169
The locusts now transform
into winged adults,

110
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,249
and with conditions as good as this,

111
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,710
they do so three times faster than normal.

112
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,209
Now they are at their most voracious...

113
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,470
and with wings, they can take to the skies.

114
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,369
Once airborne, the locusts
can travel over 60 miles a day

115
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,070
in their search for new feeding grounds.

116
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,950
A super swarm of this scale may
only appear once in a decade.

117
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,409
This one extends over 200 square miles

118
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,630
and contains several billion individuals.

119
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,550
Between them, they will devour
40,000 tonnes of food in a day.

120
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,089
Nothing can strip a land of
its vegetation with such speed

121
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,670
and thoroughness as a plague of locusts.

122
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,289
When the food eventually runs
out, the whole army will die...

123
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,190
but not before it's devastated the land.

124
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,449
With no plants to bind them,

125
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,470
thin soils soon turn to dust and blow away.

126
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,910
Now, these barren lands are left
to the mercy of the elements.

127
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,529
Scorched by the sun and
scoured by windblown sand,

128
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:37,630
desert rock is shaped into
strange, otherworldly landscapes.

129
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,969
These rocky deserts may
have a beguiling beauty,

130
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,030
but when they become this barren,
very little life can endure.

131
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,849
For many animals, the only way
to survive the most hostile times

132
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,870
is to keep moving.

133
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,350
In the Kalahari, brief rains
have given way to the dry season.

134
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,750
Food and water are becoming
increasingly scarce.

135
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,070
For these zebra, it's time to leave.

136
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,129
They're setting off on

137
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,809
the longest overland migration
made by any mammal in Africa,

138
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,430
marching towards the
scent of distant rains.

139
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,329
As drought intensifies,

140
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,729
desert-living elephants must
also undertake long journeys

141
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,030
in search of water.

142
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,249
The older females can remember where,

143
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:27,249
even in times of extreme
drought, there may still be water

144
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,129
and sometimes lead the herd to a
water hole they may not have visited

145
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,750
for decades.

146
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,310
These zebra are almost at
the end of their journey.

147
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,390
This is what they've been heading for...

148
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,950
...a rare water hole.

149
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,729
In deserts, most water
holes are short lived.

150
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,209
They appear after rains,

151
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,270
but then vanish almost
as quickly as they came.

152
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,670
Animals have come here
from many miles around.

153
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:58,990
Yet this can be a dangerous
place in which to linger.

154
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,169
60 miles away, in the heart of the desert,

155
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,510
sandgrouse chicks are hatching.

156
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,790
It's safer for them to be here.

157
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,070
But being so distant
from water is a gamble.

158
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,169
With only their mother to
shield them from the sun,

159
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,150
if they get nothing to drink,
they will be dead within hours.

160
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,950
Their only hope is their father.

161
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,289
Every morning he makes
the 120-mile round trip

162
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,830
to get water for the family.

163
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,609
Grouse from all over the
desert visit this oasis,

164
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:04,849
arriving together in large flocks,

165
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,710
and that is important.

166
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,270
There's safety in numbers.

167
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,449
The male snatches a drink,

168
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,430
but he also needs to
collect water for his chicks.

169
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,449
Using specially adapted breast feathers,

170
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,390
he can soak up water like a sponge.

171
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,550
But it takes time, and he is in danger.

172
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,950
Goshawk.

173
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,510
Sandgrouse here are their main prey.

174
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,929
Again and again, the male
sandgrouse risk their lives

175
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,710
in order to collect water for their chicks.

176
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:49,430
This is why sandgrouse nest
so far from water holes.

177
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,670
At last, he's soaked up as much as he can.

178
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,089
Carrying a quarter of
his body weight in water,

179
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,550
he can now set off on
the long journey home.

180
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,070
He's back, and just in time.

181
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,350
He can give the chicks
their first ever drink.

182
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,769
But he will have to undertake
this perilous journey every day

183
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,129
for the next two months until his
chicks can finally make the flight

184
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,630
to the water hole for themselves.

185
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,910
It's July in the deserts of Nevada
in the western United States.

186
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,630
The hottest time of the year.

187
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,929
Bands of wild horses, mustang,

188
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:58,350
are converging on one of the last
remaining water holes for miles.

189
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,209
Now, water not only offers
them the chance to drink,

190
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,630
it can also bring power.

191
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,289
If a stallion can control access to water,

192
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,430
he will have secured mating
rights to the entire herd.

193
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,969
So stallions try to dominate these pools,

194
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,750
fighting off rivals who venture too close.

195
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,110
A stranger.

196
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,129
He's travelled ten miles to be here

197
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,510
because the pools where he's
come from have already dried up.

198
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,910
With him come his females.

199
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,849
If he can't provide them with
water, they will leave him

200
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,350
for the white stallion who
already dominates this pool.

201
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,990
So, he will have to fight.

202
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,910
There is everything to lose.

203
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,729
A broken leg or a shattered jaw

204
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,830
would mean a slow and painful death.

205
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,390
A missed kick, and it's all over.

206
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,929
The new arrival has won...

207
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,169
and his prize is more than
just the chance to drink.

208
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,369
He has provided for his
herd, and in the process,

209
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,030
stolen his rival's females.

210
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,470
The white stallion's rule is over.

211
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,369
Desert life is not only shaped
by the scarcity of water,

212
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,270
but also by the relentless
power of the sun.

213
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,849
The highest temperatures on Earth

214
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,790
have all been recorded in its deserts.

215
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,009
Changes in the climate
mean temperatures here

216
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,129
are rising more than
the global average and,

217
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:59,710
as deserts heat up,
they are also expanding.

218
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,609
Every year, a further 50,000
square miles of grass and farmland

219
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,670
are turning into barren
stretches of dust and rock.

220
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:21,489
In the heat of the day, surface
temperatures can reach 160 degrees,

221
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,390
far too hot to handle for most.

222
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,270
But not for this shovel-snouted lizard.

223
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,270
Raising its feet off the ground in turn...

224
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,070
...enables each to briefly cool.

225
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,289
But even this dancing desert specialist

226
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,310
can't stand the heat for long.

227
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,390
One option is to find shade.

228
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,969
Dune grass, the only vegetation
here, provides virtually none,

229
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,889
but just an inch beneath
the surface of the sand,

230
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,750
it is several degrees cooler.

231
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,110
Avoiding the extreme heat
imposes a rhythm on desert life.

232
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,590
And many animals here choose
the simplest option of all...

233
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,849
...staying hidden all day,

234
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,110
and only venturing out
in the cool of the night.

235
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,030
As darkness falls, animals
appear from seemingly nowhere.

236
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:11,329
And, among them, inevitably,

237
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,830
are hunters.

238
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,089
One of the most voracious
nocturnal predators

239
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,750
is also one of the hardest to see.

240
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,670
This mysterious creature hardly ever
appears on the surface of the dunes.

241
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,430
But there are signs on the
sand that can give it away.

242
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,609
It lives only here, where the
sand grains are so perfectly dry

243
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,230
and polished, that they
flow almost like water.

244
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,670
It's no bigger than a ping-pong ball.

245
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,950
A golden mole.

246
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,329
It's totally blind,

247
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,950
but there's nothing to
see underground anyway.

248
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,030
Instead, it has superb hearing.

249
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,129
Its entire head acts as an amplifier

250
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,449
that picks up vibrations through
the sand, so, to locate prey

251
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,929
on the surface of the
dune, it has, paradoxically,

252
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,870
to thrust its face into the dune.

253
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,289
Termites.

254
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,750
Not easy to catch when you're blind.

255
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,670
Far better to go into stealth mode.

256
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,710
Once below the sand, it can
detect the slightest movement...

257
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,150
...allowing it to strike
with pinpoint accuracy.

258
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,350
Well, most of the time.

259
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,910
They can travel two thirds of a mile
a night in search of its dinner...

260
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,790
...and right now, it has
just detected its main course.

261
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,390
Little wonder it's sometimes
called "the shark of the dunes".

262
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:21,329
Food can be so scarce in the
desert that, even at night,

263
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,190
animals can't afford to be
choosy about what they eat.

264
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,390
Israel's Negev desert.

265
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:47,470
Otonycteris, the desert
long-eared bat, is on the hunt.

266
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,769
Most bats catch flying insects
on the wing, but there are so few

267
00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:00,430
of these in the desert that this
bat must do things differently.

268
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,150
It has to hunt on the ground.

269
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,270
But what really sets it
apart is what it's hunting...

270
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,070
...a deathstalker scorpion.

271
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,870
The venom of this species is
potent enough to kill a human.

272
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:38,990
Tackling it seems madness for a
bat weighing just half an ounce.

273
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:48,369
In the pitch-black, both predator
and prey are effectively blind,

274
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,849
but the scorpion has one advantage...

275
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,670
he can sense the approach of the
bat through vibrations in the sand.

276
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,430
Otonycteris must rely
entirely on its hearing.

277
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,670
If the scorpion doesn't move,
it won't know it's there.

278
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,750
The battle is on.

279
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,329
Armed with crushing pincers
and a sting loaded with venom,

280
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,270
this scorpion is a dangerous opponent.

281
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,710
A direct strike on the head.

282
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,710
Is it all over?

283
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,470
Not for this bat.

284
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,729
Otonycteris clearly has
some immunity to the venom,

285
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,870
but repeated stings must still
be extraordinarily painful.

286
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,769
And if the bat is not to go hungry,

287
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:35,790
it must catch another three
scorpions before sunrise.

288
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,889
Desert animals have developed
remarkable strategies

289
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,590
to make the most of the rare
opportunities that come their way.

290
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,329
Although some deserts may not
see rain for several years,

291
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:20,150
most will hold a little
water in one form or another.

292
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:24,430
The trick is simply
knowing how to reach it.

293
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:38,470
Dawn in the dunes of the Namib,
and something magical is happening.

294
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:01,529
Moist air lying over the
neighbouring Atlantic is cooled

295
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,910
and blown inland, forming fog banks
that shroud the desert in mist.

296
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,209
This precious moisture lies
tantalisingly out of reach

297
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,729
at the top of the dunes,
and it won't last long.

298
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,950
It'll be burnt off by the
sun just hours after it rises.

299
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,289
Darkling beetles race
to the top of the dunes

300
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,030
to reach the fog before it vanishes.

301
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,649
Some of the Namib's
dunes are 1,000 feet high,

302
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,230
the tallest in the world.

303
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,609
For a beetle no larger than a
thumbnail, this is the equivalent

304
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,230
of us climbing a dune
twice the height of Everest.

305
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:20,510
But even more impressive
is what it does next.

306
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,609
Standing perfectly still,
facing into the wind,

307
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:31,230
the beetle does a headstand.

308
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:37,350
Fog begins to condense on its body.

309
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:44,169
Microscopic bumps on its
wing cases direct the water

310
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,790
to grooves that channel
it towards the mouth.

311
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,489
Before returning down the slip face,

312
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,510
it will drink 40% of its body weight.

313
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,689
This little beetle has learned
how to conjure water out of the air

314
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,750
in one of the driest places on earth.

315
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,830
And it's not alone on the top of the dunes.

316
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,150
Web-footed geckos use a similar trick.

317
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,950
Surely, few animals go to
greater lengths to get a drink.

318
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,209
Unfortunately, Namaqua chameleons
know that on foggy mornings,

319
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,270
the beetles coming down the dunes
are juicier than those going up.

320
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:24,009
The diversity of life that thrives
in a world almost totally devoid

321
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,710
of water is truly remarkable.

322
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:33,289
Success in the desert depends
on an extraordinary variety of

323
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:37,590
survival strategies that have
evolved over millions of years.

324
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,430
But our planet is changing.

325
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:49,089
The world's deserts are growing
bigger, hotter and drier,

326
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,270
and they're doing so
faster than ever before.

327
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,950
How life will cope here in
the future remains to be seen.

328
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,809
Finding animals in these vast empty
landscapes was a persistent problem

329
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,449
for the Deserts team.

330
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,649
But surely this wouldn't be the
case when they set out to film

331
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:28,150
one of the greatest concentrations
of wildlife on earth.

332
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:35,710
It can't be hard to find
a billion locusts, can it?

333
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,369
OK.

334
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,849
With news that freak rains have triggered

335
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,489
a mass emergence of locusts
in a remote part of Madagascar,

336
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,630
the team sets off in pursuit.

337
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:58,529
We've got some young hopper
locusts just crossing the road

338
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,929
in front of us here. We've
just had to stop the cars.

339
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,769
Here they are, here, all on
the side of the road, look.

340
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,769
It looks promising.

341
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,089
But though finding hoppers is easy,

342
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,649
filming them proves more of a challenge.

343
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,809
Can we rethink this? Because
it's not really working.

344
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,529
The locusts are really skippy.

345
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,169
Any kind of movement, they just
freak out, So we're now doing

346
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,169
our best locust-herding
techniques to try to get them to go

347
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,750
in front of the lens, which is
proving harder than anticipated.

348
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,630
This is my Monday morning
locust-herding jazz hands.

349
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,569
- Ah!
- What? What's that?

350
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,270
- What?
- It's a wasp nest.

351
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,489
Soon, the crew find themselves
surrounded by locusts.

352
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:08,510
No need for jazz hands now.

353
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:16,169
It's a good start, but the team
still need to film the winged swarms

354
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,990
that complete the story.

355
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,689
But, once airborne, they
can travel 60 miles a day,

356
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,110
so finding a swarm won't be easy.

357
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,289
Fortunately, the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organisation

358
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,590
are here, too, to help.

359
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:44,209
The FAO are on a mission
to eradicate the plagues

360
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,449
decimating crops across Madagascar,

361
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:52,169
and if anyone knows where the locusts are,

362
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:55,529
it's the local expert, Hasibelo.

363
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:58,470
He thinks that they are moving this way.

364
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,350
Time to go swarm-chasing.

365
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,369
But chasing is the operative word.

366
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,910
The locusts always seem one step ahead.

367
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,729
It's amazing, really,
because this plan's completely

368
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:19,769
- radically changing, hour by hour.
- We now have to travel

369
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,049
several hours further north, which is...

370
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,030
- a bit of a pain.
- It's a bit of a pain.

371
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:30,409
As they venture into the unknown,

372
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,710
it's clear it's been
a very wet year indeed.

373
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:44,649
Traffic is one thing,
but boats on the road?

374
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:46,830
Unconventional traffic.

375
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,670
Progress is slow, and
soon stops altogether.

376
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,790
The locusts are just across the
water, so the team must follow...

377
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,950
...on this.

378
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,150
What could possibly go wrong?

379
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:22,049
We're now stuck on, possibly,
the world's most antiquated raft

380
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,969
trying to cross a very fast-flowing river.

381
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,569
But, onwards and upwards.

382
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:31,049
We've now got an hour-long river
crossing, and we'll just have to see

383
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,790
what's on the other side.

384
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,270
With the river behind them,
it should be plain sailing.

385
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,769
But once across, the team
discovers that, yet again,

386
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:03,310
the locusts are nowhere to be seen.

387
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,889
And, after two weeks on the road,

388
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,630
the local street food is
beginning to take its toll.

389
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,550
So Ed's not very well.
Been yacking up and...

390
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:27,529
And not very nice stomach.

391
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,169
We just need to do whatever it takes now

392
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,289
to get us to where the swarms are.

393
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,750
The next day, the team forges on.

394
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:38,310
Briefly.

395
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,649
Here's Jamal, our driver.

396
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,710
What do we think? Yeah?

397
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:49,089
No?

398
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,249
The road has turned into a bog.

399
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,729
The cars can go no further.

400
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,449
We need to cross this area
of water to get to the savanna

401
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,470
and find our locust swarms.

402
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,489
And it's amazing to think that,
with the combined might of the

403
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:10,030
United Nations and the BBC, we are
eventually defeated by a puddle.

404
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,990
Back to the drawing board.

405
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,030
Once again, it's Hasibelo to the rescue.

406
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:24,070
Well, we have a plan.

407
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,049
Taking to the air was never on the cards,

408
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,569
but thanks to the FAO's helicopter,

409
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:36,230
the team can now play the
locusts at their own game.

410
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,230
More smoke?

411
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:07,990
This time, it's a billion locusts...

412
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,670
...and one very relieved producer.

413
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,209
Woohoo!

414
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:39,510
Against the odds, the team
has located a super-swarm.

415
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,489
This is exactly what we've been
looking for. We've driven halfway

416
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,609
across Madagascar to one of
the most remote parts there is.

417
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,289
It's just been a nightmare,
but, finally, we're here.

418
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:10,129
I mean, this is the biggest swarm
we could have even hoped for.

419
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,529
It is just amazing.

420
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,910
Look at here, I'm going to film here.

421
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,569
It's incredibly exhilarating,
and yet totally shocking,

422
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,809
to think of the devastation that
swarms like this are causing.

423
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,889
It just makes you realise
how important the FAO are

424
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,790
in getting this under control.

425
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,529
I'm just going to run through it.

426
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,790
I should be naked for this, but...

427
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,689
Thankfully, Rob kept his clothes
on, and, more importantly,

428
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,089
this plague has now been halted,

429
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:59,729
but not before the team had
witnessed one of the biggest swarms

430
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,390
ever recorded on film.

431
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:18,849
Next time, we journey to
the world's great plains,

432
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:24,110
where spectacular gatherings of
wildlife cope with extreme change...

433
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,790
...and surprising creatures
survive in unexpected ways.

434
