00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,739
Looking down from two miles
above the surface of the Earth

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,219
it's impossible not to be impressed

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,579
by the sheer grandeur and splendour

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,980
and power of the natural world.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,899
Ten years ago, in a television
series called Planet Earth,

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,340
we revealed many of those wonders,
but today, much has changed.

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,740
We can now show life on our
planet in entirely new ways.

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,740
Bring you closer to
animals than ever before.

10
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,540
And reveal new wildlife
dramas for the very first time.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,620
But that's not all.

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,579
Our planet has changed too.

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,819
Never have those wildernesses
been as fragile and as precious

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,340
as they are today.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,499
At this crucial time for the natural world,

16
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,820
we will journey to every
corner of the globe...

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,380
...to explore the greatest
treasures of our living planet...

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,219
...and reveal the extreme
lengths animals go to

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,580
to survive.

20
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,339
Finally, we will explore our cities

21
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,859
to see how life is adapting

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,020
to the newest habitat on Earth.

23
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,100
This is Planet Earth II.

24
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,299
There are hundreds of thousands of islands,

25
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,939
each one a world in miniature,

26
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,940
a microcosm of our living planet.

27
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,979
The struggles to survive
on these remote lands

28
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,140
reflect the challenges
faced by all life on Earth.

29
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,300
The tiny island of Escudo
off the coast of Panama.

30
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,260
Home to the pygmy three-toed sloth.

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,820
This is a male and life
here suits him well.

32
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,779
Mangroves provide all the leaves he can eat

33
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,140
and there are no predators to worry him.

34
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,100
Island life may seem idyllic
but it comes at a price.

35
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,340
There are only a few hundred
pygmy sloths in existence.

36
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,900
And he needs a mate.

37
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
That's an enticing call...

38
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,700
...from a female.

39
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,860
Somewhere out there.

40
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,900
And this, for a sloth, is a quick reaction.

41
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,460
The problem is, there's
deep water between them.

42
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,420
So what should any red-blooded sloth do?

43
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,460
Swim, of course.

44
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,380
Could this be her?

45
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,940
He does his best to put on a turn of speed.

46
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,699
But she's not the one.

47
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,819
She already has a baby and she
won't mate again until it leaves her

48
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,500
in about six months' time.

49
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,020
Even life on a paradise island
can have its limitations.

50
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,180
But at least she can't be far away.

51
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,939
The world's entire population
of pygmy sloths is isolated

52
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,500
on a speck of land no bigger
than New York's Central Park.

53
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,259
The size of an island has
a huge influence on the fate

54
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,060
of those cast away there.

55
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,580
The island of Komodo in Indonesia.

56
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,140
Home to dragons.

57
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,619
Ten feet long and weighing
an impressive 150 lbs,

58
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,060
these are the largest
living lizards on the planet.

59
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,860
It's unusual to find
large predators on islands.

60
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,500
Yet, for four million years, the
Komodo dragon has dominated here.

61
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,619
It might seem there wouldn't be enough food

62
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,860
to support such giants on
this relatively small island.

63
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,019
But reptiles, being cold-blooded,

64
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,060
need only about a tenth of the
food a carnivorous mammal would.

65
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,780
A single meal will last a dragon a month.

66
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,619
There are so successful that their
only serious competition comes from

67
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,380
others of their own kind.

68
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,700
And there are some 2,000 of them here.

69
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,940
This giant, however, isn't looking
for food... he's looking for a mate.

70
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,660
Female dragons come into
season only once a year.

71
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,380
She's receptive.

72
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,700
So far, so good.

73
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,860
But he's strayed into someone else's patch.

74
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,260
Another huge male thinks
he is the king here.

75
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,619
Space being limited on islands,

76
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,620
dragon territories overlap and
that creates continual conflict.

77
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,380
In dragon society, size is everything.

78
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,220
But if rivals are closely matched,
the outcome can be uncertain.

79
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,460
Muscular tails strike with
the power of sledgehammers.

80
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,500
And their serrated teeth
are as sharp as steak knives.

81
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,620
Each tries to topple his opponent.

82
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,940
Defeated.

83
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,979
Only the most powerful dragons

84
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,620
win the right to mate.

85
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,939
The limited food and space on small islands

86
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,460
can often lead to intense competition.

87
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,420
But some islands are immense.

88
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,460
More like miniature continents.

89
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,980
And these provide opportunities
for life to experiment and evolve.

90
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,219
Madagascar is one of the biggest
islands and also one of the oldest,

91
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,060
having split away from Africa
over 120 million years ago.

92
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,979
With time and isolation,

93
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,980
its animals have adapted to take
advantage of every available niche.

94
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,299
The island now has some
250,000 different species,

95
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,220
most found nowhere else on Earth.

96
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,420
These are not monkeys, but lemurs.

97
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,460
From a single ancestor, about
100 different types have evolved.

98
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,820
The largest, the indri, seldom
comes down from the branches.

99
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,539
The much smaller ringtails wander
in troops across the forest floor

100
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,700
searching for food.

101
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,620
And tiny bamboo lemurs
eat nothing except bamboo.

102
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,259
With few competitors, lemurs
have been free to colonise

103
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,900
almost every environment on the island.

104
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,940
Even the most extreme.

105
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,740
This baby sifaka has a
hard life ahead of it.

106
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,579
He's been born in the most
arid and hostile corner

107
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,060
of Madagascar's vast landscape.

108
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,100
If he is to survive here,
he has much to learn.

109
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,860
The spiny forest is like a desert.

110
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,140
It rarely rains, so water
and food is very hard to find.

111
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,540
Moving from tree to tree
is a perilous business.

112
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,580
Here, nearly all the plants are
covered with ferocious spines.

113
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,020
His mother searches the tree
tops for the youngest leaves.

114
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,180
They provide the only food and
water to sustain the family.

115
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,500
At three months old, the
youngster is starting to explore.

116
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,740
All too soon he will have
to fend for himself up here.

117
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,420
But it's altogether easier
to stay on mother's back.

118
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,500
If he can master the strange
ways of this forest...

119
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,620
...he will have a little
corner of Madagascar to himself.

120
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,860
Island life encourages animals
to do things differently.

121
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,300
And on some islands that is essential.

122
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,340
There are islands still forming today...

123
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,500
...built by volcanoes.

124
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,900
Some erupt explosively.

125
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,820
Others pour out rivers of molten rock.

126
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,980
Lava.

127
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,739
In the last 50 years,

128
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,780
ten new volcanic islands have been formed.

129
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,140
Newly created and often remote,
they're hard for colonists to reach.

130
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,820
Even those that do find these
are tough places to survive.

131
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,340
This is Fernandina, one of the
Galapagos Islands in the Pacific.

132
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,060
Young and still volcanically
active, it's a desolate place.

133
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,740
The surrounding sea, however,
is particularly rich with life.

134
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,619
And the frontier between these two
very different worlds is the home of

135
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,780
one of the strangest of reptiles.

136
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,380
Seagoing iguanas.

137
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,659
They are vegetarians,

138
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,739
but since there's little
food for them on the land,

139
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,740
marine iguanas graze on the sea floor.

140
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,939
A big male like this
one can dive to 30 metres

141
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,420
and hold his breath for half an hour.

142
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,020
There are more than 7,000
individuals on Fernandina alone.

143
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,259
And by bringing nutrients
from the sea to the land,

144
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,420
the iguanas help other
animals to survive here, too.

145
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,779
Crabs feed on dead skin
on the iguana's back

146
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,820
and, in turn, provide a
welcome exfoliation service.

147
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,580
While smaller lizards prey on
the flies that pester the colony.

148
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,420
But not all the relationships
on this island are so harmonious.

149
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,660
Marine iguanas lay their eggs in sand.

150
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,140
In June, when the hatchlings
emerge, they are vulnerable.

151
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,699
They must join the adults
at the edge of the sea.

152
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,020
But the journey will be a dangerous one.

153
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,740
Racer snakes.

154
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,580
The snakes miss their chance.

155
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,900
But more babies are hatching.

156
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,220
And now the snakes are on the alert.

157
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,580
This is the best feeding
opportunity they will get all year.

158
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,020
On flat ground, a baby iguana
can outrun a racer snake.

159
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,820
But others are waiting in ambush.

160
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,860
Another hatchling has its first
glimpse of a dangerous world.

161
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,939
A snake's eyes aren't very good,

162
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,660
but they can detect movement.

163
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,500
So if the hatchling keeps its
nerve, it may just avoid detection.

164
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,140
A near miraculous escape.

165
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,179
The lucky survivors can begin
learning the unique way of life

166
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,820
demanded by this hostile island.

167
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,659
Although marine iguanas
are expert swimmers,

168
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
they can't cross open oceans.

169
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,100
But even the stormiest waters
are no barrier for birds.

170
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,059
Gale force winds and cold
temperatures make the sub-Antarctic

171
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,820
islands off New Zealand
particularly unwelcoming in winter.

172
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,380
But, when the brief summer comes,
temperatures rise and winds slacken.

173
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
It's now that visitors arrive.

174
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,380
All here to breed before winter returns.

175
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,460
There's the Snares penguins.

176
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,940
Shearwaters come, too.

177
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,659
This is an excellent place for
them to dig their nesting burrows,

178
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,140
for no predators have managed to get here.

179
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,740
Soon the island is crowded with birds.

180
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,180
Every one of them eager to make the
most of the short breeding season.

181
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,980
But not everyone has a partner.

182
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,860
A male Buller's albatross
waits for his mate.

183
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,180
Each year they spend six months
apart, travelling the ocean.

184
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,180
They reunite here to breed.

185
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,220
But this year, she's late.

186
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,220
No, that's not her.

187
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,700
The other birds come and go.

188
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,340
The clock is ticking.

189
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,539
If she doesn't appear soon,

190
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,380
it could be too late for
them to breed successfully.

191
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,460
Every morning the shearwaters fly
off to collect food for their young.

192
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,340
Everybody else seems to
be getting on with it.

193
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,100
The shearwaters' return
marks another lost day.

194
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,780
There are three million birds on the
island, but only one matters to him.

195
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,700
Could this be her?

196
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,460
At last.

197
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,220
At first, he's a little coy.

198
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,820
But not for long.

199
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,179
They greet each other
with the special dance

200
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,820
they've perfected over many years.

201
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:54,140
There is much to do if they're to
raise a chick before winter returns.

202
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,740
But when you have been apart for six
months, some things can't be rushed.

203
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,500
Islands in warm tropical waters
don't experience seasonal extremes.

204
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,939
The Seychelles, lying off
the coast of East Africa,

205
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,820
provide a sanctuary for sea
birds all the year round.

206
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,540
Fairy terns are permanent residents.

207
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,740
They take a fairly relaxed view
about what constitutes a nest.

208
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,420
A bare branch is quite enough.

209
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,300
Climbing onto it to incubate
has to be done with care.

210
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,900
Once a year, the noddies arrive.

211
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,259
They do make nests,

212
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,899
and pisonia trees provide their young

213
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,140
with a rather less
precarious start in life.

214
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,100
Nesting on this island looks idyllic.

215
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,660
But behind the beauty,
there's a sinister side.

216
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:05,100
The Seychelles fody makes
quick work of an unattended egg.

217
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,179
She knows something's not quite right,

218
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,500
but her drive to incubate is strong.

219
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
The noddies too have a problem.

220
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,219
As their chicks grow,

221
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,339
so the pisonia trees
develop seeds that are sticky

222
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
and equipped with hooks.

223
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,659
By the time the young noddies leave,

224
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,860
they carry these hitchhiking
seeds away to other islands.

225
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,420
But sometimes the pisonia
trees are too successful.

226
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,419
If a fledgling, testing out
its wings, drops to the ground,

227
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,700
it can get covered with the seeds.

228
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,099
Entangled and weighed down,
if it can't free itself,

229
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,540
the youngster will starve.

230
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,900
The pisonia may have failed
to disperse these seeds...

231
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,180
...but it will soon have
fertiliser for its roots.

232
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,180
This is why some people call the
pisonia the "bird catcher tree".

233
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,539
The fairy tern laid another egg,

234
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,540
and now she has a tiny chick to feed.

235
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,540
This chick is lucky.

236
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,339
By the time it fledges, the
pisonia seeds will have dispersed,

237
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,740
and the danger they brought will be gone.

238
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,179
Even the most idyllic-looking
of islands presents challenges

239
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,860
for the animals living there.

240
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,340
But the greatest threat
they face is change.

241
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,860
Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.

242
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,219
For millions of years,

243
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,140
this remote speck of land
has been ruled by crabs.

244
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,219
Their ancestors came from the sea,

245
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,500
but most have now adopted
a land-based existence.

246
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,900
Given there are so many of them,
they get on relatively harmoniously.

247
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,140
They're the gardeners and
caretakers of a tiny crab utopia.

248
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,939
Once a year, they must all
return to the sea to breed,

249
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,619
and the march of the red crabs

250
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,700
is one of the greatest
natural spectacles on earth.

251
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,860
There are 50 million of them.

252
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,820
It's an event that has brought
the island worldwide fame.

253
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,379
But in recent years,

254
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,140
millions of red crabs haven't
managed to reach the sea.

255
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,260
An invader has occupied this island.

256
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,380
Yellow crazy ants.

257
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,779
They escaped from visiting ships and
with no predators to control them,

258
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,900
they have now created vast
super colonies in the forest.

259
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,460
When migrating red crabs march into
their territory, the ants attack.

260
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,580
Squirting acid into the
crabs' eyes and mouths.

261
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,940
The crabs have no defence.

262
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,420
Blinded and confused...

263
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,860
...they're doomed.

264
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,819
Humans brought these ant invaders here,

265
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,300
and now humans are having to control them.

266
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,580
Isolated communities may evolve from
millions of years in relative peace.

267
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,140
But, when new challenges arrive,
they can struggle to cope.

268
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,539
Of all the species that have
become extinct in recent years,

269
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,460
around 80% have been islanders.

270
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,820
Our impact on the Earth is
greater today than ever before.

271
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,459
Yet some islands are so remote

272
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,380
that few humans have even set foot on them.

273
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,140
Zavodovski Island is one.

274
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,299
It lies in the great Southern Ocean.

275
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,579
It's not only surrounded
by the stormiest of seas,

276
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,140
it is itself an active volcano.

277
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,140
It's the last place on Earth
you would choose to live.

278
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,180
Unless you're a chinstrap penguin.

279
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,379
There is plenty of food in
these waters, but to exploit it,

280
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,540
the penguins have to risk their lives.

281
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,260
Life here is dangerous in the extreme.

282
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,020
But there are some benefits
from living on a volcano.

283
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:35,779
Its warmth melts the
snow early in the year.

284
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,219
And, by January, the
Antarctic's mid-summer,

285
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,580
the island is covered in chicks.

286
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,539
Parents take turns at guarding them

287
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,860
until they're large
enough to be left alone.

288
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,300
This mother's chicks are hungry, but
she has no food left to give them.

289
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,140
Their survival depends on their
father returning with the next meal.

290
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,260
But some don't make it.

291
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,660
Skuas harass the colony,
hoping to snatch a chick.

292
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,020
She can't risk leaving them.

293
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,940
Everything will be fine, as long
as their father comes back soon.

294
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,260
He's been fishing 50 miles
offshore, but now he's not far away.

295
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,659
For him, however, and for
all the other parents here,

296
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,980
the worst of the journey is still to come.

297
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,540
Tiny claws help him to get whatever
grip he can on the rough lava.

298
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,300
For these commuters, it's rush hour.

299
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,660
Some have had a really bad day.

300
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:53,259
The father now has a
two-mile walk to the nest,

301
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,700
and a stomach loaded
with food doesn't help.

302
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,420
This is the largest
penguin colony in the world.

303
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,819
But as he makes the same
journey every other day,

304
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,860
he should be able to do
it with his eyes closed.

305
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,619
It's true that there
can be safety in numbers,

306
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,099
but numbers can also be
something of a problem

307
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,500
when you're trying to find your own nest.

308
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,900
The mother is still waiting.

309
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,979
Her chicks are now desperate.

310
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,659
In the midst of all this deafening chorus,

311
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,700
he can recognise her particular cry.

312
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,900
At last.

313
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,380
Both chicks will get a meal.

314
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:50,059
With a head bob of acknowledgement,
their mother now leaves.

315
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,260
It's her turn to do the feeding run.

316
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:06,300
This formidable commute is the price
these penguins pay for sanctuary.

317
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,659
A strange vision of
paradise to us, perhaps,

318
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,460
but, for one and a half million
penguins, this island has it all.

319
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,979
Islands may seem remote and insignificant,

320
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:40,780
but they are home to some of the
most precious wildlife on Earth.

321
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,619
The expedition to film on
the island of Zavodovski

322
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,220
was the most intrepid shoot of the series.

323
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,499
To ensure its success,
the team have called in

324
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,979
Antarctic expert Jerome Poncet,

325
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,140
one of the few people to
have set foot on the island.

326
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,220
This whole region of
Antarctica is rarely visited.

327
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,300
And this is the planet's roughest ocean.

328
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,579
After seven long days and nights at sea,

329
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,499
they get their first glimpse
of the final destination.

330
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,499
It's actually quite
surreal after a whole year,

331
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,379
trying to put the expedition together.

332
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,739
And then today we wake up,
and there's the volcano.

333
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,220
That's Zavodovski.

334
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,299
The explorers who discovered this place

335
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,499
spoke of the stench of sulphurous gases,

336
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,219
treacherous waters,

337
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,820
and astonishing numbers of penguins.

338
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,700
It seems not much has changed.

339
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,499
Jerome's been round the whole place,

340
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,459
and there literally is only
one safe area to get on,

341
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,619
and he's telling us

342
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,300
it's that rock face over there.

343
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,940
The team must take everything
they need to survive.

344
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,700
There are the penguins!

345
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,499
Though the boat'll stay nearby,

346
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,420
they will need to be self-sufficient.

347
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,459
But that means taking a tonne
of equipment up this cliff.

348
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,099
Just get to that lot to help.

349
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,700
Many flippers make light work.

350
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,820
They work all day getting the gear ashore.

351
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,979
But the fact there are so
many penguins on the island

352
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,580
doesn't make it easy.

353
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,499
The hardest thing for us has
been finding a pathway through,

354
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,820
because there's absolutely
penguins everywhere you look.

355
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,900
Finally, it's time to make camp.

356
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,660
They choose a sheltered place
that won't disturb the locals.

357
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,019
But since most of the penguins
won't have seen a human being before,

358
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,420
they seem keen to pop over and visit.

359
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,140
Hello. Nosy neighbours.

360
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,379
The team set off

361
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,539
to start documenting the
daily lives of the penguins,

362
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,020
and what they find is astonishing.

363
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,579
As soon as you walk over that ridge,
you sort of get a tingly feeling,

364
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,899
because I've never seen that
many animals in one spot.

365
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,420
It's mind-blowing.

366
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,059
It's like Glastonbury Festival.

367
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,299
The whole landscape

368
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,380
is full of little black and
white penguins waddling around.

369
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,700
This is penguin paradise, and
that's what we're trying to show.

370
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,860
A promising start.

371
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,460
But here, fortunes can change quickly.

372
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,060
♪ Summertime... ♪

373
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,940
Every season within ten minutes.

374
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,780
As the snow melts, it
creates an unforeseen problem.

375
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,419
We purposely chose this campsite

376
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,539
because it was a place where
the penguins didn't seem to go.

377
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,779
I think we've realised why
the penguins don't nest here.

378
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,659
It's because of the spray
and because of some run-off,

379
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,180
so we are literally in a bit of a bog.

380
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,300
And it's not just mud.

381
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,459
A couple of these guys, as they
wander down to do a spot of fishing,

382
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,859
they tend to use my tent
as a little poop spot.

383
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,659
You kind of get used to it at night,

384
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,859
just hearing a constant
splat on top of the tent.

385
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,059
But, as you can see, all of the kit,

386
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,659
I'm afraid that's getting splat on as well.

387
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,259
And, when the wind changes,
it brings a noxious reminder

388
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:30,100
that they're camping on an active volcano.

389
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,019
It's the first time we've smelt sulphur,

390
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,259
which is welcome relief
from smelling penguins.

391
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,660
It's smoking away.

392
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,299
I think if they start running for the sea,

393
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,260
we're going to be calling
Jerome pretty quick for the boat.

394
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,940
Each day filming on Zavodovski
seems to present a new challenge.

395
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,180
Next, a huge storm hits the island.

396
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,179
Only now do the team realise

397
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,300
just how tough life
can be for the penguins.

398
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,339
It's hard not to be moved
by the effort they go to

399
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,940
to feed their chicks.

400
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,379
These huge waves are coming in.

401
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,379
The penguins are surfing here,

402
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,539
getting battered on these big boulders.

403
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,299
Now and then you just get a
penguin that gets catapulted

404
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,420
15 metres in the air...
it's totally ludicrous.

405
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,820
And really, I think there are quite
a few penguins getting killed in it.

406
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,980
The beach in the afternoon was just
a scene of death and destruction.

407
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,580
It was absolute carnage.

408
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,059
It was heartbreaking.

409
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,939
I mean, they're trying so hard to
get up the beach with broken legs

410
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,860
and bleeding and very,
you know, sobering, really.

411
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,059
After witnessing the struggles,
the penguins must endure,

412
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,220
the team now face the same problem.

413
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,740
Getting off the island.

414
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,340
With another storm coming in,
they decide to take their chance.

415
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,140
Jerome has seconds to get
in and out between the waves.

416
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,620
Or the Zodiac could tip...

417
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,580
...leaving them all stranded.

418
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,540
Hurray, that's the
first box off the island.

419
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,499
What took a day to get
ashore must be off in minutes.

420
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,100
And the swell is getting bigger.

421
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,700
Their window of opportunity is closing.

422
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,340
Look at this swell now,
watch out, watch out!

423
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,140
The equipment's off, but
now the team has to follow.

424
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,379
She's just leaving us now, is she?

425
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,980
That's the producer, she's
gone! We have to swim now.

426
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,860
They're gone. Yeah.

427
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,220
Luckily it didn't come to that.

428
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:31,219
Safely aboard, they leave with
an unforgettable experience

429
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,540
of how hard life is on an
island at the edge of the world.

430
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:45,419
Next time, we ascend into
the planet's highest peaks

431
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,259
to discover a spectacular
but hostile world,

432
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,060
where only the toughest animals can endure.

433
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,939
This is life on the roof of the world.

434
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,260
Mountains.
