3
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,678
All right, everybody.
Listen up.

4
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:37,513
Tuco Salamanca.

5
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,693
For those of you not with us this
morning, we raided his headquarters.

6
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,916
Also his last known address.

7
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,075
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth hag girlfriend.

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,066
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The big man himself smelled us coming.

9
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,191
So...

10
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,745
Study the face.

11
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,216
Study the file.

12
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,154
Get a big ol'raging hard on

13
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:03,397
at the idea of catching
this piece of shit.

14
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:06,487
My apologies to the HR department.

15
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:09,467
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

16
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,463
All right.

17
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:14,220
On the hit parade, 1998.

18
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:18,167
Reputed to have whacked "Dog" Paulson,
back when our home-grown banditos

19
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,979
where wrestling the crank trade away
from the So Cal biker gangs.

20
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:24,393
Also, we're pretty sure he knifed
a Mexican national in '03.

21
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,212
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals,

22
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:30,403
I'd say he is a prime suspect

23
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,319
in the disappearance
of our dearly-missed Krazy-8.

24
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,568
Hats over your heart
for that dirtball.

25
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:38,731
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that one,

26
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:40,535
but as usual,
we couldn't make it stick.

27
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,037
He runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

28
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,082
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

29
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:50,476
I know it's...
We all know what's going on down there.

30
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,606
We sure as hell don't
want it going on up here.

31
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,562
Which brings us to the good news.

32
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:58,310
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

33
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,050
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name, No Doze.

34
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:06,926
Found him tucked in the junkyard,
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law,

35
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,501
A.K.A. Gonzo.

36
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,148
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,

37
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,085
was moving No Doze's body,

38
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,528
either hiding it there
or pulling it out, still not sure,

39
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,545
when he got his arm
crushed clean off.

40
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:22,660
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my Web site. Hilarious.

41
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,983
Anyway. The upshot is,
we got us a nice,

42
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:29,521
big, juicy, bloody fingerprint,

43
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,973
which belongs to <i>señor</i> Tuco.

44
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,885
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

45
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:40,179
That is, provided we find this guy.

46
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,810
So to all present,

47
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,349
I ask you, you wanna find this guy?

48
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,098
What the hell was that?
Jesus.

49
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:50,953
Wanna try that again?

50
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:53,315
Do you want to find this guy?

51
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,652
Are we going to find this guy?

52
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:58,696
Louder, damn it!

53
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,259
- Give me a hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

54
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,465
They ain't gonna find him.

55
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,558
Guy's in Mexico by now.

56
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,715
Appearances, Gomie.
It's all about appearances.

57
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,177
Listen,
I gotta take some personal time.

58
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,096
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

59
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:28,945
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,062
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

61
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,296
Damn. You don't think he...

62
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,565
- Holler if you need me.
- Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that.

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,013
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

64
00:05:57,503 --> 00:06:00,322
But that's what he looks like now.

65
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,391
Without the hair.

66
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:06,365
Hey, it's me.

67
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,619
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate
you sparing us your day off.

68
00:06:10,883 --> 00:06:13,012
No worries. Happy to help.

69
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,519
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

70
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,305
- What about height and weight?
- Five eleven...

71
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,421
most recently, about 170.

72
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,559
165. That's what I weigh.

73
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:26,385
I guess...

74
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:29,972
- he weighs a little less.
- That's fine. That's close enough.

75
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
Good.

76
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,088
What about other
distinguishing features?

77
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,622
Tattoos or moles or scars?

78
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:39,447
- Anything that might help us...
- Tattoos?

79
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,025
Not really.

80
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,428
That's fine.

81
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:46,792
- Is that the list of medications?
- Yes. I wrote them all down.

82
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,664
And there's no drug interactions.
None that are listed.

83
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:51,910
I called his doctor, so, no.

84
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:54,538
Has he been depressed?

85
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,381
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

86
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,081
Last night, he was...

87
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:10,637
agitated.

88
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,211
Agitated.

89
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,755
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was...

90
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,518
agitated, upset.

91
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,355
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

92
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:28,151
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said...

93
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,658
"I don't know where to begin."

94
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,765
Then he just walked out
of the bathroom...

95
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,632
I was in the tub. Taking a bath.

96
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,667
And when I came out about ten
minutes later, he was gone.

97
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,454
Nothing else missing?

98
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,049
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

99
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:52,214
What about the phone call?

100
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:56,445
I'm looking into it.

101
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,021
What phone call?

102
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,772
Walt's cell phone rang.
He pulled it out,

103
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,599
looked at it, and didn't answer it.

104
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:08,112
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

105
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:09,668
I mean...

106
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,989
couldn't that be...

107
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:14,076
important, right?

108
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,581
Anything else you can think of?

109
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,054
Anything else.

110
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,986
I called the credit card providers,

111
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,932
and there's no report

112
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,398
of any recent activity.

113
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:33,547
Let's see...
I checked with every hospital

114
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:36,779
within 50 miles.
Every police station. Every morgue.

115
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:39,683
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

116
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:42,858
I was actually hoping
that you had something else,

117
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:44,606
being that you're the expert.

118
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:53,097
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

119
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:56,743
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

120
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:03,616
Thank you.

121
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:17,032
So that cell phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

122
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,283
- And?
- Never happened. No record of it.

123
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:22,895
- Second cell phone.
- Yeah. I'm thinkin'...

124
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:00,354
I understand.

125
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,413
Out!

126
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,666
Get away from me!

127
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,424
Settle down, bitch!

128
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,714
You gonna shoot me?

129
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:16,958
Shoot me in here!

130
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,628
I hope I bleed like a mother, too!

131
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:21,513
That way, you have to clean it up!

132
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,937
It's your ride, retard.
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now get out!

133
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,433
Get up!

134
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,380
Get up.

135
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,218
Don't do this, Tuco.

136
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,048
No more posters?

137
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,326
Walter Junior's making more.

138
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:30,756
Thank you, Marie.

139
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,906
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

140
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:41,015
I mean, he just doesn't
strike me as the type.

141
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:43,488
He'll turn up.

142
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,621
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

143
00:13:55,952 --> 00:13:59,246
I just find it bewildering that...

144
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,374
you didn't believe that...

145
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,416
Not now.

146
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:39,980
Empty your pockets.

147
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:10,825
Thought your name was Heisenberg,

148
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,610
"Walter Hartwell White."

149
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:17,183
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

150
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:21,726
A business name.

151
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,580
I like doing business
with a family man.

152
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,041
There's always a lot of collateral.

153
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,708
Answer me one thing.

154
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,760
Can I trust you?

155
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,217
Yes, absolutely.

156
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,752
Sit down.

157
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:49,100
DEA...

158
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,363
hit my place
of business this morning.

159
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:56,449
About a hundred cops looking for me.

160
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,335
You two haven't been talking, right?

161
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:07,698
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

162
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,334
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:18:11,273 --> 00:18:12,835
That's weird, right?

164
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,384
I mean,

165
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:16,803
don't you think that that's weird?

166
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:19,234
That's weird. Yes.

167
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:21,133
Unusual.

168
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,260
Unusual.

169
00:18:24,707 --> 00:18:26,356
Last two days,

170
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:29,774
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

171
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:34,195
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No Doze.

172
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:37,292
Explain to me,

173
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,879
how is it my fault

174
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:43,117
that that little bitch
did not know his place?

175
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,570
I saw this coming.

176
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,603
I can see the future, you know?

177
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:58,053
It's this gift that I have

178
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,472
deep inside my head.

179
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:06,770
I knew last night they were going
to come and try and bust me. Gonzo...

180
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:11,353
He went and snitched to the cops!

181
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,277
That lousy son of a bitch!

182
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:17,363
I trusted him like a brother!

183
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:20,817
I was good to him!
I was good!

184
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:23,973
I see Gonzo, I'm going to gut him,

185
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:25,688
I'm going to skin him,

186
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:28,763
and I'm going to stuff
his hide for a heavy bag,

187
00:19:28,931 --> 00:19:31,049
and every time I hit him,

188
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,326
it's going to be like
a lesson to myself!

189
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:36,909
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

190
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,153
So, you plan to ice Gonzo,

191
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,103
like, future tense?

192
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:51,272
What?

193
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:54,030
You're saying...

194
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:56,365
You're saying that...

195
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:59,721
Gonzo is currently...

196
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:03,409
operating as a police informant,
as far as you know?

197
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,945
I'm very sorry to hear that.

198
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,842
That's disappointing.

199
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,798
- I'd waste him, too, yo.
- Shut up.

200
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:21,577
They're out there
looking for me right now.

201
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:24,475
They got ghetto birds and black ops.

202
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,378
I need to get high.

203
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:28,685
I need to get good and high.

204
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,568
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

205
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,335
It's killer.

206
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,490
Yeah, seriously.

207
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:49,335
So, I was thinking last night.

208
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,791
I came up with this great idea.

209
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:54,955
<i>México.</i>

210
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,838
Mexico?

211
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,633
We'll disappear way
out in the jungle.

212
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,887
We'll set you up in a superlab.

213
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,590
We'll do nothing but cook 24-7.

214
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:09,685
And nofederales are going to mess
with us, because I got my people there.

215
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,810
Connections.

216
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:13,824
We're going to make

217
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,065
<i>beaucoup</i> bucks, Heisenberg.

218
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:21,154
I have a wife and family.

219
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:24,493
So what?
You'll get another one.

220
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:28,598
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I can't just...

221
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:31,369
uproot my life like that.

222
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:33,416
Yeah, man.
I mean, me, neither.

223
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:38,129
Who's talking to you?

224
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,427
You need me, man,

225
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,764
'cause I cooked
that scante in your hands.

226
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,993
I'll tell you something, yo.

227
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:56,488
You never tried nothing like it.

228
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:59,416
Stink or no stink,

229
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:00,789
one bump,

230
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,821
you'll be flying high for days.

231
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,929
It's a new product him
and I been working up.

232
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,641
Careful when you hit it.

233
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:14,958
It kicks like a 12-gauge
when it comes on.

234
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:20,329
It's got a secret ingredient.

235
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,258
What secret ingredient?

236
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:26,913
Chili powder.

237
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:35,770
I hate chili powder.

238
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:42,735
This blue magic, this is money.

239
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,378
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

240
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,613
We're going to rewrite
history with this.

241
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,828
All right!

242
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:02,463
Time to clean the <i>menudo</i> out
from between your ears!

243
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,717
No, I need him, Tuco.

244
00:23:06,493 --> 00:23:08,720
I need him very, very badly.

245
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,181
He's my partner.

246
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:15,560
And if he doesn't go,

247
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,065
I don't go.

248
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:22,269
I'll tell you this,
my cousins are driving up here

249
00:23:22,394 --> 00:23:25,686
right now to smuggle us back down,
and they're going to be here by sunset,

250
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:29,714
and you're going to be on that truck,
or you're going to be dead!

251
00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:32,673
And you...

252
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:37,314
You better hope
they got room in the trunk.

253
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,926
Where are you going?

254
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,647
Louis is taking me
to the train station.

255
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:57,442
We'll put these up.

256
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,225
No, no, honey.
No, I'll do it.

257
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,649
He wants to help, let him help.

258
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,093
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

259
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:09,322
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

260
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:13,214
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

261
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:15,696
I got my cell if you need me.

262
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,792
Bye, sweetie.
I'll see you later.

263
00:24:20,963 --> 00:24:22,347
All right. Bye.

264
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:26,713
Actually,

265
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:30,464
I think the very fact they haven't
found him yet...

266
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,914
bodes well.

267
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,264
Well, I mean, if he...

268
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,201
You know.

269
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:41,521
Somebody would've smelled
something by now.

270
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:46,442
There's got to be something, some
detail that we haven't picked up on.

271
00:24:47,495 --> 00:24:49,278
What about the second cell phone?

272
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:51,124
Aw, Jesus.

273
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,742
We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

274
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,204
Okay. What are you talking about?

275
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:06,177
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared,

276
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:09,048
there's no record of it
with the phone company.

277
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,968
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

278
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:14,461
But his phone rang.
I heard it.

279
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,681
Well, all right.
Well, then, if that's the case,

280
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:20,428
he must have a second phone.

281
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:25,792
Why? What sense
would there be in that?

282
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:29,331
All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

283
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,555
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
"secret cell phone" and then drop it.

284
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,269
What does it mean?

285
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:40,132
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

286
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:42,959
It means Walt has a secret.

287
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:46,689
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

288
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:50,603
"Everyone."

289
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:52,608
Skyler, come on.

290
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:56,220
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

291
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,182
Then, let's assume
there'a second cell phone.

292
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:04,604
So, what? Is he having an affair?

293
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,148
Walt? Please.

294
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:12,862
What about the marijuana?

295
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:16,837
He's not on pot anymore.

296
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:18,833
Says who? Him?

297
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:22,408
Chemotherapy and marijuana
go together

298
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:25,217
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

299
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,161
Maybe...

300
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:30,127
he's addicted to the pot,

301
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,702
and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

302
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:36,313
You don't get hooked
on pot like that.

303
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:39,555
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

304
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:44,477
You have to question
this drug dealer person.

305
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,378
He may know something.

306
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,043
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

307
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:58,036
Then grasp.

308
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:10,131
Excuse me. Ma'am?

309
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:14,298
Hi. I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

310
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:16,884
No. I'm afraid not.

311
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:19,829
- Why?
- I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

312
00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:24,273
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

313
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:28,036
He taught your son
chemistry in high school.

314
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:31,378
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

315
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:33,359
That was a long time ago.

316
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,577
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:38,114
It's my understanding that he and Jesse,
they've stayed in touch.

318
00:27:38,864 --> 00:27:39,865
Really?

319
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:46,953
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

320
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:49,302
He really tried to motivate him.

321
00:27:49,427 --> 00:27:52,197
He was one of the few
teachers who cared.

322
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,578
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

323
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:56,791
I'm so sorry to hear
about his illness.

324
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:59,028
Please pass along our best wishes.

325
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:01,856
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

326
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,264
He's missing, actually.

327
00:28:04,103 --> 00:28:05,683
Just kind of walked off or...

328
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:09,304
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around

329
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:11,939
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

330
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,787
That's terrible.

331
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:16,173
Anything we can do to help?

332
00:28:16,718 --> 00:28:19,667
Well, if you could put me
in touch with your son.

333
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,873
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

334
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,504
Jesse's not answering either
phone number I have for him,

335
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,628
and no one seems
to be home at his house.

336
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:31,250
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

337
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:35,188
I don't necessarily. I just...

338
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,127
- Are you with the police?
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

339
00:28:41,215 --> 00:28:43,763
I'm with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

340
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:48,059
Oh, my God.
Is my son in trouble?

341
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:51,103
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

342
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,321
Do I need to get a lawyer?

343
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,302
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this,

344
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:58,569
coming here and asking
questions about my son...

345
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,364
Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you,
I'm not here on official capacity.

346
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,553
I do not care what your son
may or may not have done wrong.

347
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:08,269
I just want to find
my brother-in-law.

348
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:10,240
His wife is worried sick,

349
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:12,668
and she's got a baby on the way.

350
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:16,687
I'm sorry.
I would like to help you,

351
00:29:16,812 --> 00:29:19,351
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

352
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:22,120
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

353
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:26,382
Well, thanks for your time.

354
00:29:31,624 --> 00:29:33,891
If you could tell me one more thing.

355
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:36,237
Is Jesse still driving the, uh,

356
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:39,259
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo,
as far as you know?

357
00:29:39,384 --> 00:29:41,626
If he had spent half as much time

358
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:43,864
and money on his education

359
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:47,567
as he has on that
ridiculous bouncing car...

360
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,732
Lowrider, huh?

361
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,475
Nah, nothing yet. Listen,
do me a solid and check out a...

362
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,830
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo

363
00:29:59,955 --> 00:30:03,210
registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.

364
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:07,535
Specifically? I want to know
if the car's got LoJack.

365
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,463
It's one of those jackoff lowriders.
It's got a good shot that there is.

366
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:15,229
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

367
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:42,706
Chili powder.

368
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:47,297
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

369
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:48,885
Whatever, man.

370
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,223
At least I tried something.

371
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,121
It almost worked, too.

372
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:55,591
How's about you leaving my gun?

373
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,413
First you boost it, then
you leave it in your house.

374
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:00,594
My gun.

375
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,616
How was I supposed to know

376
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:07,682
you were chauffeuring Tuco
to my doorstep?

377
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:10,677
Well, at least he wants you alive.

378
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,696
Hey, I don't get it.

379
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,634
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

380
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,268
I don't know.

381
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,747
I don't know.

382
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,461
Does it really matter?

383
00:31:57,586 --> 00:32:01,508
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant,

384
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:03,995
who does he automatically blame?

385
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:05,258
Us.

386
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:10,261
We need a plan.

387
00:32:12,454 --> 00:32:13,723
Think, think.

388
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,801
Let's just bum-rush him, man.

389
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:18,388
You know, you crack him
over the head with something,

390
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:20,273
and I'll go for his gun.

391
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,862
"Crack him over the head
with something"?

392
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,882
And you got the C-bomb, man.

393
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,230
You're as good
as checked out already.

394
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:38,658
You should be, like,
all sacrificial,

395
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:40,794
jumping on a grenade, yo.

396
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,784
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here,

397
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:49,507
because I'm going
to be dead soon anyway.

398
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:51,259
That's your point?

399
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:23,463
We got to get him to take this.

400
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,483
He don't much like
the taste of chili P.

401
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:28,380
That much has been established.

402
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:31,508
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

403
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:37,945
Eat.

404
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,483
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

405
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,578
Go and sit.

406
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,538
You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

407
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:04,905
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

408
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,088
Take it easy, <i>tio</i>.

409
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,943
I will feed you. I eat first.

410
00:34:48,068 --> 00:34:49,669
That's the deal.

411
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,862
What?

412
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:09,263
I get it, I get it, I get it.

413
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,566
You greedy old bastard.

414
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:15,741
I tell you, Heisenberg...

415
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:18,907
Old people.

416
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,005
You feed them, huh?

417
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,997
You put them in a really
nice crib in the country,

418
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,041
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

419
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:31,149
You better eat every bite of that.

420
00:35:54,882 --> 00:35:56,827
What did you do that for?

421
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,822
God!

422
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,065
Look. Lookit.

423
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:45,953
There's nothing left.

424
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:13,511
What?

425
00:37:13,806 --> 00:37:15,500
What do you want?

426
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,777
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

427
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:28,485
Don't go there.

428
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:43,802
Are you mad-dogging them, <i>tio</i>?

429
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,997
What, you don't like them?

430
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:53,726
One ding. That means "yes."

431
00:37:54,102 --> 00:37:55,606
<i>Tio</i> don't like you.

432
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,439
Why don't you like them, <i>tio</i>?

433
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:07,826
You don't trust them?

434
00:38:14,966 --> 00:38:17,036
Why don't you trust them, <i>tio</i>?

435
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,785
Tuco, come on.
I mean, he's...

436
00:38:21,106 --> 00:38:24,176
There's clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

437
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:39,274
Did they do something to you, <i>tio</i>?

438
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,349
Something that you don't like?

439
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:53,784
What did they do to you?

440
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:56,099
What did you do to my <i>tio</i>?

441
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:57,250
Nothing.

442
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,753
Bullshit! My <i>tio</i> does not lie!

443
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:02,842
I don't know. I swear.
I don't know.

444
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:05,592
Maybe, I did change

445
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,697
the channel on his TV, but...

446
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,118
That's it. While you were cooking,
he was watching one of those...

447
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:15,533
those "telenovels"
with all those ripe honeys on it?

448
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:18,570
He was really into it. I told you
not to change the channel, man!

449
00:39:18,695 --> 00:39:21,646
Dude needs his eye candy. That's it.

450
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:29,866
Is that it, <i>tio</i>?

451
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:32,703
Is that it, <i>tio</i>?

452
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,577
Did they change your <i>mamitas</i>?

453
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,140
What are you telling me, <i>tio</i>?

454
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,014
Are they punking me?

455
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:11,302
No, man.

456
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,536
Come here!

457
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:34,307
Shut up!

458
00:40:48,253 --> 00:40:49,279
Please, no!

459
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,866
Please, no! No, God!
I don't want to die!

460
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:55,619
Tell me what you did, Walter!

461
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,157
Jesus!

462
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,122
I don't want to die!

463
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,001
Tell me what you did!

464
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:10,861
We tried to poison you.

465
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,805
We tried to poison you,

466
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,835
because you're an insane,

467
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,727
degenerate piece of filth,

468
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,854
and you deserve to die.

469
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:07,607
Who's the bitch now?

470
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,895
Let him bleed.

471
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:50,103
The keys!

472
00:42:54,077 --> 00:42:55,307
Oh, my God.

473
00:42:57,538 --> 00:42:58,742
The cousins?

474
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:57,957
What the hell's going on?

475
00:44:09,108 --> 00:44:10,308
Jesse Pinkman.

476
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:13,619
You're a hard man to find.

477
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:23,106
Aw, shit.

478
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:36,836
Easy.

479
00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:41,300
Oh, my God.

480
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,441
Oh, my God.

481
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,002
- Hank.
- Who?

482
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,811
- Hank.
- What?

483
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,193
- Oh, my God.
- What?

484
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,116
- Oh, my God.
- Stay. What are you doing?
