00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,882
WE HAD LOST SOME
VERY GOOD MEN THERE.

00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,656
TOYE AND GUARNERE HAD
LOST THElR LEGS THERE.

00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,625
GUARNERE--
GORDON WAS BADLY HlT.

6
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,996
A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE
WERE KlLLED.

7
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,999
IT WAS A DlFFlCULT
SlTUATlON THERE.

8
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,434
I DON'T KNOW THE
EOACT AMOUNT OF MEN

16
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,927
SO, I DlDN'T
GO LOOK AT HlM.

17
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,662
AFTER BASTOGNE,
WE WENT TO HAGUENAU.

18
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,696
THERE WAS ANOTHER
PUSH THERE.

19
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,265
