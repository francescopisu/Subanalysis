1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,200
In the great Tree of Life,

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,900
one branch of the mammals has a particular fascination for us, for we belong to it.

3
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,480
Primates.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,380
Primate hands provide a firm grip.

5
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,080
And forward facing eyes accurately assess distance.

6
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,180
Both are crucial for a lifestyle that began in the trees.

7
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,390
Intelligence among primates can excel that of all other animals.

8
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,590
Primates can solve difficult problems...

9
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,890
..develop thoughts and ideas...

10
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,390
..and build long-lasting relationships.

11
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,190
But most importantly, primates remember what they learn during their lives.

12
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:02,390
This film reveals how intelligence helps our closest relatives to tackle the many challenges of life.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,200
There are more than 350 primate species on Earth.

14
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,800
Since they first appeared over 65 million years ago,

15
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,100
these clever animals have become adapted to an extraordinary range of habitats.

16
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,000
The Awash region of southern Ethiopia.

17
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,400
A harsh, remote scrubland.

18
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,410
But primates have learned how to make it their home.

19
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,510
Hamadryas baboons are waking up from a night spent high on the cliffs.

20
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:49,110
These monkeys live in groups up to four hundred strong, with no single leader.

21
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:56,810
Theirs is a very complex society, made up of dozens of small harems, each governed by a male.

22
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,910
Every morning they leave the safety of the cliffs to find food.

23
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,320
Top-ranking males lead the way.

24
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:24,220
They can be very severe with their females if there is the slightest misdemeanour.

25
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,220
Despite their individual strength, hamadryas baboons prefer to travel as a troop.

26
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,320
It's safer that way.

27
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,230
On this particular morning, something stops them in their tracks.

28
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,530
Another troop is using these cliffs as a barracks.

29
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,030
More than a thousand baboons can overnight here.

30
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,130
And a rival faction is heading directly their way.

31
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,940
In the chaos of warfare, males settle old scores.

32
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,940
This is also their best chance of stealing females.

33
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,640
When the fighting is over, the harems reform.

34
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,050
Lead males punish any of their females who had dared to stray.

35
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,650
Strict discipline is essential if order is to be maintained.

36
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,050
It's a harsh social system

37
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,350
but it works for hamadryas baboons here on these arid plains.

38
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,460
In other parts of the world, primates have had to organise

39
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,860
their societies in a different way to cope with different challenges.

40
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,160
Mid-winter in the Japanese Alps.

41
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,860
The Kamicoche Valley is the haunt of the most northerly-dwelling monkeys.

42
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,660
To live here you must be able to survive temperatures which plunge to minus 20 centigrade.

43
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,460
The Japanese macaque.

44
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,770
Dense thick layers of fur help to insulate these snow moneys in this testing environment.

45
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,670
But they still feel the cold.

46
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,470
At this time of the year food is scarce.

47
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,270
But macaques are adaptable and clever.

48
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,270
The troop has learnt that this river stays ice-free the year round.

49
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
This female knows it's a good place to gather insect larvae

50
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,880
from under the rocks, using her versatile hands and nimble fingers.

51
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,380
In winter, this troop spends most of its time searching for food.

52
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,780
The same underground forces that prevent this river from freezing

53
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,580
bring great comfort to others.

54
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,380
The Japanese Alps were built by volcanoes.

55
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,280
Many of them are still active.

56
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:44,180
And in a region called Hell's Valley, some snow monkeys have found the perfect winter resort.

57
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,090
A thermal spa,

58
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,790
where the water temperature is a blissful 41 degrees centigrade.

59
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,790
Everyone wants in, but primates being primates,

60
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,890
there are pool-side politics.

61
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,000
This is an exclusive members-only club.

62
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Only the highest-ranking females and infants are allowed in.

63
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,500
Everyone obeys this male, who guards the pool and vets the entrants.

64
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,500
These youngsters, born of the right bloodline, don't know how privileged they are.

65
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,500
Lower ranking individuals are literally left out in the cold.

66
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Japanese macaque society is very divided.

67
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,810
There are those that have.

68
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,710
And those that have not.

69
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,810
And that is a harsh division, because the sixty degrees that separate the steaming water

70
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,310
from the freezing surroundings

71
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,210
can make the difference between life and death.

72
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,510
But by far the majority of primate species

73
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,610
live in warm tropical forests.

74
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Among them are the largest of all.

75
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,520
Gorillas live in stable family groups with just a single leader,

76
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,920
a silverback male.

77
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,420
This one, here in the Congo basin, is the guardian of his family

78
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,620
which includes five females and their infants.

79
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,820
He has the responsibility of protecting them from the dangers

80
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,020
that abound on the forest floor where they feed.

81
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,930
To sustain his huge size, he must consume up to thirty kilos a day.

82
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:48,330
It's mostly plant food, but western gorillas also enjoy a sprinkling of termites.

83
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,130
The youngsters need to eat far less than their father, so they've got time on their hands.

84
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,730
They like to play for the same reasons we do...for fun.

85
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,630
And it helps build long-lasting relationships.

86
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,130
Their protector keeps a watchful eye on them.

87
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,940
But then...

88
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,840
..it's time for his siesta.

89
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,740
Something shatters the peace.

90
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,140
This silverback's territory is one of the best.

91
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,640
But it has borders with at least eight other gorilla groups.

92
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,850
The sound of chest-beating travels more than a mile through the tangled under-storey.

93
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,750
It's a territorial drum-beat.

94
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,950
Everyone must know who is boss around here.

95
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,550
Other smaller primates are rather more secretive.

96
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,250
One of the most unusual is found in Sulawesi, Indonesia.

97
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,860
It lives among the aerial roots of this strangler fig.

98
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,460
Its ancestors were daytime hunters, but they found that there was less

99
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,160
competition if they looked for food in the twilight.

100
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,960
Now they only stir after dark.

101
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,060
Nonetheless there's a lot of insect food around.

102
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,770
The spectral tarsier.

103
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,570
Tarsiers are the only totally carnivorous primates on Earth.

104
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,470
They've hardly changed in 45 million years.

105
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,570
Their huge eyes can see in even the faintest light.

106
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,570
These eye-balls are so wide they can't swivel in their sockets -

107
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,070
tarsiers have to rotate their heads.

108
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,370
Their mobile ears can detect the faintest sounds.

109
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,480
And their powerful legs enable them to jump 40 times their own length.

110
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
The family group fans out to hunt.

111
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,380
Prey is not hard to find.

112
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,080
But the tarsiers must be watchful.

113
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,580
For a primate just five inches tall, life in the forest is full of danger.

114
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,590
- The male sounds the alarm.
- CHIRPING

115
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,290
And everyone retreats.

116
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:02,490
Back in their family tree, the senior male and female send out piercing calls.

117
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
These calls guide any stragglers home,

118
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,700
and there they renew the family bonds.

119
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,400
Good communication is one of the hallmarks of primate society.

120
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,700
Few communicate more musically than lar gibbons

121
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,600
in the forests of Thailand.

122
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,400
Their songs carry for many miles across the canopy,

123
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,310
proclaiming that this piece of forest is theirs.

124
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,910
Most primates have excellent colour vision, and colour too can be used in communication.

125
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,210
Adult Phayre's leaf monkeys might seem rather drab.

126
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,820
But not so their newborn.

127
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,420
Bright orange fur makes the babies very conspicuous,

128
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,420
so the adults can easily keep an eye on them.

129
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,420
Close friends and relatives are eager to help the mother with baby-sitting.

130
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,820
It's a good chance for the younger ones to practice parenting.

131
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,220
As a result, a baby is never left on its own for long.

132
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,920
When it's a few months old and more independent,

133
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,920
it will turn the colour of its mother and blend in with the group.

134
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,130
But until then, it can't be ignored.

135
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:24,030
Smell is of particular importance to the primates that live in Madagascar -

136
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,830
the lemurs.

137
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,930
They have pointed snouts and wet noses.

138
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,130
These are ringtail lemurs.

139
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:56,440
The males have sharp pads on their wrists with which they scratch the trunks of young trees.

140
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:07,440
Glands on their wrists impregnate the cut bark with a pungent smell that acts as a territorial marker.

141
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,640
Females make smelly marks in their own way.

142
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,040
This one's scent carries another signal as well as the territorial one.

143
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,640
It tells males that she's coming in to heat.

144
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,440
But she will only be sexually receptive for 24 hours or less.

145
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,340
So tensions run high among the males.

146
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,850
Amid the commotion, some males sneak off.

147
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:20,150
They have anointed their tails with scent and waft it towards her in an attempt to persuade her to mate.

148
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,950
She's ready...

149
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,850
but fussy.

150
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:41,050
This male adds more of his wrist gland perfume to his tail.

151
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,460
It seems to work, for they leave the party together.

152
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,860
And he wafts his way to victory.

153
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,060
A willingness to mate is a relatively straightforward message.

154
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,560
But primates are capable of much more complex communication.

155
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,470
It starts between a mother and her baby.

156
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,370
The rainforests of Sumatra.

157
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:11,270
This female orang-utan is forty-two years old.

158
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,070
Her third child, a six year old daughter, is still with her.

159
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:26,370
Orangs look after their children for longer than any other primate...

160
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,670
except ourselves.

161
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,270
It will take her nine years to teach her youngster

162
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,770
everything she needs to know about this complex tree-top world.

163
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,680
She must learn how to collect ants and termites.

164
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,080
How to identify at least 200 kinds of edible plants...

165
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,080
and how to avoid the poisonous ones.

166
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,480
And how to judge when fruit, like this durian,

167
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,880
has ripened to perfection.

168
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,680
Her child must be able to judge which branches can carry her weight.

169
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,190
And which insect nests are safe to raid.

170
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,190
Building up a complete guide to the foods of the forest is a long process.

171
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,100
Her lessons, of course, aren't limited to food.

172
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,700
There are other crucial skills she must learn if she is to survive in the tree tops.

173
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,500
Building a secure nest in which to spend the night, for example, takes years of practice.

174
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,300
And this is, of course, a rainforest.

175
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,600
THUNDER RUMBLES

176
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,200
So all orangs must learn how to make a shelter early in their lives.

177
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:33,910
It rains almost every day, so this six year old has already had plenty of practice.

178
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,510
She might live to be fifty years old and if she too becomes a mother,

179
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,110
she'll pass on all this expertise to her own children.

180
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,310
Remembering your lessons is a vital part of primate life.

181
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,510
It's not just learning how to exploit your environment.

182
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,320
Just as important is knowing when to do so.

183
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,320
This is Africa's Cape peninsula.

184
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,720
It's the furthest south that monkeys have managed to settle.

185
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,920
There's a wide range of plant food here, but because the soil is so poor in nutrients,

186
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,920
Chacma baboons find it difficult to get the range of sustenance they need,

187
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,220
however much they eat.

188
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:23,530
So they have had to become quite adventurous in what they will tackle.

189
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,330
The waters around the Cape are among the richest in the world.

190
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:52,530
And the wily baboons have become tidal experts.

191
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,930
If you rely on the tides to expose your food, you have to work to fairly tight schedules.

192
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:37,140
Every two weeks, on the lowest spring tide, there's a chance to collect something really special.

193
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,040
What they've been waiting for is hidden among the fronds of seaweed.

194
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,050
Shark eggs.

195
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,950
Each one is only a tiny mouthful, but there are lots of them

196
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,850
and they're so nutritious it's worth the trouble.

197
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,550
But the baboons can't stay long...

198
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,150
the tide is turning.

199
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,950
So now they switch their attention to the main course of the day... mussels.

200
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:19,460
This delicacy is exposed every day, by every tide.

201
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:30,460
Baboons have powerful jaws and huge canines...

202
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,560
ideal for cracking shells.

203
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,560
Timing is an essential skill if you are to harvest

204
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,060
all the food that becomes available at one time or another around a coast.

205
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,260
Some foods, however, are only available to those who have skilful hands and sharp intelligence.

206
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,470
On the coast of Costa Rica, among the mangroves,

207
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,770
live some of the most intelligent monkeys in the whole of the Americas.

208
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,470
White-faced capuchins.

209
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,470
They too have learnt to work the tides.

210
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,170
They are after clams.

211
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:43,170
But capuchins are quite small and don't have the brawn to open such shellfish.

212
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,170
But they do have the brain,

213
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,270
and they've devised an ingenious way to solve the problem.

214
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,570
They hammer the clams.

215
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,780
They are not trying to crack the shells, all this pounding

216
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,880
and rolling has another purpose, to tire the muscle with which the clam is holding itself shut.

217
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,880
Eventually the clam can hold out no longer,

218
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,580
and the capuchin gets its reward.

219
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,590
Trial and error may have been sufficient to solve this particular problem.

220
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:38,090
But one of their cousins in Brazil has taken things a step further.

221
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:06,900
Brown-tufted capuchins combine manual dexterity with considerable intelligence.

222
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,000
And they have learned to use tools, hammer stones with which to open palm nuts.

223
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,300
Some of the stones are nearly half the weight of the monkey.

224
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,600
Without a tool, opening these nuts would be an impossible task.

225
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,400
Tool-using was a major breakthrough in primate evolution.

226
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:03,610
And nowhere is it more convincingly displayed than here in the forest of Bossou in Guinea, West Africa.

227
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,410
PANTING AND WHOOPING

228
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:48,010
Chimpanzees in this small community of thirteen individuals use tools in a variety of ways.

229
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,220
The most delicate is the way they use a twig or leaf stem

230
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,720
to dip for ants.

231
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,230
Some of their skills are unique to this particular group.

232
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,830
One of these involves stripping a palm leaf frond

233
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:15,230
and using it like a pestle to mash up the nutritious palm heart.

234
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,430
This four-year old is learning fast.

235
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,230
She needs to.

236
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,640
If chimpanzees haven't learned particular skills by the age of 8,

237
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,840
they never seem able to acquire them.

238
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,240
The most impressive skill of all, which involves nimble fingers,

239
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,240
hand-eye coordination and intelligence, is nut cracking.

240
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,640
Chimpanzees have gone a stage further than capuchins.

241
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,540
They have learned how to carefully position the nut on an anvil and to judge how much force to use

242
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,840
in order to crack the shell but not smash the kernel to pieces.

243
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,450
Their use of tools is both efficient and precise.

244
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:55,250
This eleven year old female has an anvil, but can't find a hammer.

245
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:12,750
She approaches a male to see if he will lend her his.

246
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,550
He obliges.

247
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,460
Chimpanzees can show great kindness

248
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,360
and compassion.

249
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
Sharing.

250
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,060
Experimenting.

251
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,660
Empathy.

252
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,560
Planning.

253
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,260
Intelligence.

254
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,860
Teaching, and learning.

255
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:39,570
Behaviour so characteristic of us higher primates.

256
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:53,870
We are the most inventive and innovative of all primates.

257
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:59,270
Just one branch of a large and extended family.

258
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,770
A family which has refined the ability

259
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:08,770
to develop and pass on individual learning to the next generation.

260
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:29,970
A family which is built on strong bonds between mother and baby.

261
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,980
A family with which we share so much.

262
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:30,490
To film the very best primate behaviour,

263
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:35,190
the Life team had to use all their primate ingenuity and adaptability.

264
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:54,590
And in doing so, they discovered an extraordinary affinity with our extended family.

265
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:06,590
Especially with a great ape with who we share almost 99% of our genes,

266
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,090
the Chimpanzee.

267
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:15,090
He was completely asleep just then, so you just, just rocking to the side as if he might just fall off

268
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:21,290
the branch, you could see his lips were twitching like he was in a deep dream, that was really beautiful.

269
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,200
Chimpanzees are our closest relatives.

270
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:44,900
Justine Evans spent almost a month with them in the forest of Guinea to film their use of tools.

271
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,300
The chimps have disappeared off down there,

272
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,700
they're gonna cross over into another area of forest and hopefully start using some tools.

273
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,500
Go and use tools, that's what we're here for.

274
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,900
Chimpanzees have to accept you.

275
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,400
If they don't want to be filmed, they'll simply disappear.

276
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:15,000
Justine needed the expert guidance of Tatyana Humle, a primatologist

277
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:18,610
who's spent more than ten years studying these individuals.

278
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:25,510
So when we see them always keep calm and don't stare straight into the eyes.

279
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,710
Have you ever had problems with them coming right up being aggressive?

280
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:32,110
No, never, never. I mean it's pretty rare, so...

281
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:36,210
I don't know what to expect cos I've never seen them in the wild before so it's a first for me.

282
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:42,610
So just always stay, stay calm and if one of them walks by really close, just ignore them.

283
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,010
One particular young male might throw sticks,

284
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,810
ignore him as well, it's like he's like a kid

285
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,710
and he just wants attention so he'll just keep doing it.

286
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:59,310
We've got to put these face masks on in case we pass on any infectious diseases.

287
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:03,310
Quite a few chimps have died in the past from respiratory diseases

288
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,110
in other study sites, so it's very important.

289
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:21,520
Justine was finding her way with the chimps.

290
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,320
But it would take time.

291
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
It's never easy anticipating their behaviour.

292
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,220
I'm trying to get ready really quickly because we're expecting

293
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,120
some chimps to come down the path straight ahead of me.

294
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,520
It'd be lovely if they'd merge out into this clearing,

295
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,320
cos it's really difficult to see through all this foliage.

296
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,120
Tatyana and her team were invaluable,

297
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,620
they introduced Justine to the chimps' different habits and characters.

298
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:17,730
Soon the natural inquisitiveness of the chimps overcame any worries they might have had of Justine.

299
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:27,730
In fact, they seemed fascinated by her, and the tools of her trade.

300
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:39,030
But it was their use of tools that Justine was here to film.

301
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,230
And this was her first good opportunity.

302
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:52,830
As I filmed them fishing for ants I was amazed by their dexterity.

303
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:59,730
But holding focus in such low light really tested my own coordination to the limit.

304
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,740
Now she's moving away.

305
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,840
She's moving.

306
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,240
It's been all go today, it's not over yet,

307
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,440
if we can get out of here into an open,

308
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,540
more open area we'll actually have enough light to film by

309
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,640
cos the sun's still up, but I don't know.

310
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,440
Although Justine's main goal was to film tool use,

311
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,140
there was another piece of behaviour she really wanted to capture.

312
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:56,540
Buttress root drumming had never been filmed here before but she was always just a bit too late.

313
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:59,540
Back at yet another buttress in the hope that we might

314
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,940
get some sort of buttress drumming, but it's started raining

315
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,350
which is an absolute pain.

316
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,150
It's a waiting game.

317
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:19,050
Just staking out a couple of really big trees that have got very large buttress roots

318
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,650
in the hope that a male will come down and drum on them.

319
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,950
The drumming always happens somewhere else, and apparently,

320
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:30,050
it's usually the males that sort of sneak off to go and do it,

321
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:33,050
it feels like a bit of a long shot at the moment.

322
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,950
I've have to have some patience.

323
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:42,750
The thing about chimps is that, like most primates, you can't always predict

324
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:47,450
what they're going to do, when they're going to do it, or where.

325
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:54,250
You've just got to keep with them.

326
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:02,160
A different type of sound brought Justine back to her main mission.

327
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,360
Nut cracking.

328
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,560
This was the key sequence Justine was here to film.

329
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,860
Filming the chimps using tools made me realise just how close to them we are.

330
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,260
I felt so similar to them.

331
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,370
By the end of our filming trip I was able to recognise

332
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:07,770
most of the individuals in the group and had begun to understand their different personalities.

333
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,870
For me, the most poignant moment of all

334
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:43,470
was when the male the scientist called Clay lent a female his tools.

335
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,280
I know that primates are very social animals

336
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,580
but seeing this act of generosity was something that I'll never forget.

337
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:20,780
Just before we left, the chimpanzees finally put on the display that I'd been hoping for.

338
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:01,190
In the great Tree of Life,
