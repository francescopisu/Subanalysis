1
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:17,092
Our jetcopter has arrived, Raquel.
I'll summon the maid.

2
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:22,901
I'll say bye-bye to Damien first, darling.
How long's he going to be in there?

3
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:27,740
You can't rush him, sweetheart,
he's putting a very important deal.

4
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,361
He's talking to President
Reeves in Washington.

5
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:33,920
President Reeves! Really?

6
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,729
There you are Rodney, where you been?
Damien phoned for you an hour ago.

7
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:48,609
I know, but the state transportation workers
have gone on strike.

8
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:52,257
On strike? I thought Damien
had made strikes illegal.

9
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:59,102
Yes, the police were shooting them as I left.
Damien said he wanted to see me urgently.

10
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,262
I'll take you through.

11
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:08,058
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've heard it all before. 

12
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,019
Bonnet Dedut. 

13
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:15,027
All I'm saying Mr.President ...

14
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,734
Oh, shut up you tart!

15
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:22,668
Listen to me, Keanu. You just sit there
in the White House all day …

16
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,144
…twiddling your thumbs and just
playing at leadership!

17
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:27,164
People are beginning to see through you.

18
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:31,705
What's wrong with going to war with China?
War is good!

19
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,220
What a boy, eh?
Good boy!

20
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,833
Well, of course, millions will be killed.

21
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:41,814
A war without death is like
a salad without water-cress!

22
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:43,860
You worry too much...

23
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,624
I've got a busy night
so make the declaration tomorrow.

24
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:52,905
What's going on here?
I ordered a messanger over an hour ago!

25
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,852
He's here, Damie!
Damie, he's here. Look, there.

26
00:03:58,122 --> 00:04:00,397
Uncle Rodney.

27
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:12,717
I want you in Beijing for the war –
you report back to me.

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,923
- War! I don't wanna go to war!
- War is good.

29
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,457
- I don't wanna go to war!
- What would your Uncle Albert say?

30
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:29,369
- I don't know!
- We'll ask him then, won't we?

31
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:37,209
During the war... During the war.
During the war...

32
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:52,530
- You rang, your Lordship?
- Cassandra! What are you doing here?

33
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:58,474
Damien took over my bank and fired me.
Now I'm the maid.

34
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:05,597
- It's a job, Rodney.
- No, this isn't fair!

35
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,985
- Rodney!
- It's not right, you shouldn't be doing this!

36
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:15,484
Everything was nice
and now you've messed it all up!

37
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,531
I wanna go back to how it used to be!

38
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:32,380
Rodney, wake up you dipstick!

39
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,333
Oh God, it was a dream.

40
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,124
Have you been smoking 
that Rastafarian Old Holborn again?

41
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:47,007
No, no, I just drifted off there for a while.
Oh man, I had the wildest dream!

42
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:52,358
What was it all about? Was it about sunshine
and little birdies going tweet tweet tweet?

43
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,927
Alright, sorry! So what's happening?

44
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:59,381
What's happening?
I'll tell you what's happening.

45
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:07,268
We have bought 150 Latvian radio alarm
clocks that go off whenever they bloody well like. 

46
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:10,974
We also got 200 aerodynamic cycling helmets

47
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:16,276
that turn out to be horse-riders' crash hats
that some git has sprayed red.

48
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:21,089
We've got a box of baseball caps
that even E17 fans wouldn't wear.

49
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,816
And also my home-improvement grant 
has been rejected.

50
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,390
Apart from that,
everything is fine!

51
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,115
Thank God! Everything normal.

52
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,683
Raquel, darling,
there's a letter out here for you.

53
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,703
What's the matter with you anyway, falling asleep 
at quarter to eight in the morning? 

54
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,775
Don't you get enough sleep at home
or what?

55
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,551
You know my situation!

56
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:43,173
It's Cassandra and this baby thing, innit?

57
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:46,065
The hospital's worked out
another schedule for us.

58
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:49,063
I'm at it like a rattlesnake!
It's horrible.

59
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,450
I always thought that was your ambition!

60
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:56,187
Well, some people dream of singing La Traviata
at the Royal Opera House, don't they?

61
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:59,477
It don't mean they wanna sing it
three bloody times a night.

62
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:03,078
No, enought to make your throat sore, 
wouldn't it?

63
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,823
They've put her on a
special diet and all that.

64
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:16,165
The gynecologist, he reckons
it's only a matter of time

65
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,436
but Cass keeps getting all broody...
I've got her a rabbit.

66
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,328
A rabbit, what's that?
Part of her diet, is it?

67
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:28,108
No, a pet rabbit!
Something she can make a fuss over.

68
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,833
I know it was a stupid idea.
I wish I hadn't bothered now...

69
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,389
So the hospital has passed all
the tests and that, have they?

70
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,899
This is personal.
I don't want this being broadcast!

71
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:42,611
Of course not. Who's gonna listen?
I suppose you've had your tubes looked at?

72
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:47,524
Yes! God! Everything's fine
we just can't crack the case...

73
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:52,165
Every day I'm taking specimens down to the clinic
and God knows what else.

74
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:57,007
'Cause t's all got to do with ovum’s 
and... things.

75
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,800
The hospital keeps showing me
this film of inside the human body.

76
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:05,029
Cor, it don't half put you off, Del.

77
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:10,473
Yeah, I should think so. 
Give me Debbie Does Dallas any day of the week. 

78
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:14,033
Anyway, listen, we'll have a spot of
breakfast and then get down the market.

79
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,457
- What do you fancy. Boiled egg?
- No!

80
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:26,351
Can I ask a favour?
Can I have this afternoon off?

81
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,965
Why? She hasn't booked you in
for another seeing to, has she?

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,436
No! We're having a celebrating lunch. 
'Cause it's my birthday.

83
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:44,205
It's your birthday? Oh, ala Bruchette!
It's your birthday, I forgot all about it, didn't I?

84
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,518
Well, since it's your birthday 
in that case Rodney, the answer is no.

85
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:52,899
You wouldn't expect Richard Branson
to want the afternoon off?

86
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,213
Doubt it, he don't even
know it's my birthday.

87
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,304
Not your birthday,
I mean, if it was his birthday!

88
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:05,497
No, because he would be too busy down the 
old financial fast lane. 

89
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:09,073
He wouldn't be going that 
 jollying it up just 'cos it's his birthday.

90
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:10,633
Alright then.

91
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,478
Of course you can have the afternoon off.
It's your birthday!

92
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:20,090
I bet you thought I forgot!

93
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:23,246
There you go, 
there's your cards, birthday boy.

94
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,557
That one's from Damien.

95
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,882
Oh... Bless him.

96
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:35,736
No, don't worry about those for a minute. 
Take a look at that.

97
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:40,154
That is a present from me...
 and Raquel of course.

98
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:50,086
- It's a chunky, gold identity bracelet.
- Yeah, I can see that.

99
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:56,424
It's just like mine Rodney, look at that,
24 carat gold, no old rubbish.

100
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,115
See, it's got your name on it, look.

101
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:06,138
- 'Rooney'?
- No, that says, look, 'Rodney'.

102
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:10,388
No, it says 'Rooney'.
There's an 'O' where the 'D' should be.

103
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:14,950
No, that is a D. It's like copperplate writing. 

104
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,470
- Come on, put it on, put it on.
- Ah, right. 

105
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:26,313
- I don't want you getting all over-emotional on me.
- No, alright then.

106
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,802
- Morning, Rodney.
- Hi, Raquel.

107
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,940
- What's that?
- It's a chunky gold identity bracelet.

108
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:43,606
- 'Rooney'?
- No, that's 'Rodney'.

109
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:49,461
- Looks like 'Rooney.' That's an 'O' isn't it?
- No it's a 'D'. It's copperplate writing.

110
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,941
Well, it looks like 'Rooney' from where I'm standing.
Where d'you get it from?

111
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:55,766
It's your birthday present to me.

112
00:10:56,538 --> 00:11:00,148
Oh! It's your birthday!
Sorry. Happy birthday, Rodney.

113
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,149
Thanks.

114
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:05,052
Del chose the present.
I didn't even know what he'd got you. Where is he?

115
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,750
In the kitchen. He's a bit disappointed actually,

116
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:11,419
the council have just turned down
his application for a home improvement grant.

117
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:13,501
I suppose they didn't have
half a million pounds handy.

118
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,042
What did he want to do then?

119
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:19,984
Who knows! Put an extension on the balcony
and build a double garage, knowing him.

120
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,477
No, au contraire. 

121
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:26,274
I just wanted 5,000 pounds
so I can improve the kitchen units, that's all. 

122
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,316
Well that sounds fair enough.

123
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,449
Oh get real, Rodney. There was no way
he was gonna put new units in. He just wanted the 5 grand.

124
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,699
No, 'cause the council would have checked
to see if you had the work carried out.

125
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:42,865
Cor blimey, all you gotta do is to give 'em an 
'18 months sob story' and they forget all about it.

126
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:46,033
'Cause they're too busy organising carnivals
and things.

127
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:49,468
Anyway, they've turned me down,
I don't want to discuss it,

128
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:52,033
 'cause now it's epidemic, innit? 

129
00:11:53,856 --> 00:11:57,256
Who's the letter from, sweetheart?
- I don't know yet.

130
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:02,948
Look at this! Gits!

131
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:10,373
- Morning, Damien.
- I got a new hat. Dad got it for me. 

132
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,682
Yeah, I know, and it's a cracker and all,
 ain't it son, eh?

133
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,168
My Dad gets me everything...

134
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,534
D'you wanna play war?

135
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:22,105
 No! Bit busy.

136
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:26,970
- Come on Rodney, you've got time for a little battle.
- No. I'm alright, honest.

137
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,885
Alright, you stay there, champ.
I'll get you your cereal.

138
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:35,108
When I'm older will people
still wear baseball caps?

139
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:38,830
When you're older, Damien,
people will wear whatever you tell them to wear.

140
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,343
Oh cool! 

141
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,013
Little git!

142
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,211
I fought for this country, shot and shell,
and how do they treat ya?

143
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,683
That ain't it bloody fair, eh?

144
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:00,729
Oh God, Albert! Your socks look like
the bomb-squads been having a go at 'em!

145
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:04,033
All I need now is that hospital to get you
and Cassandra pregnant,

146
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,062
and I'd have two of the little
sods bouncing things off me head.

147
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,864
Oi! What do you know about me
and Cassandra and the hospital?

148
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,112
Nothing, son, nothing at all...

149
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,843
What's an ovum?

150
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:21,251
I don't believe you... Were you listening
to me and Del's conversation?

151
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:27,465
I wasn't listening, I just heard.
Don't worry, you know me, son, I'm saying nothing.

152
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,611
Squad, attention!

153
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,636
Morning, Albert. Listen, you be careful when you 
collect your pension down at the post office today.

154
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,305
There's a gang of muggers
hanging about this area.

155
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,111
They don't worry me, son.
I boxed for the navy.

156
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:47,486
They use to calle my left hand
'Trotter's Trembler'.

157
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:51,553
I wonder what they
called your right hand.

158
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,826
Rodney, come on, quick.
Let's go.

159
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:59,849
- What's the hurry?
- Come on, just let's go, Rodney.

160
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:03,348
- Would you want me to load the van up?
- No, we haven't got time for that. 

161
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:07,915
 I've got to get the Capri Ghia into tuning up
and I gotta meet a bloke down the market. 

162
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:11,069
And you get youw coat on
and get out of here. Go on!

163
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,947
See you later, sweetheart! 
Bye Unc!

164
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:18,768
- What's he in such a hurry for.
- I don't know.

165
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,120
Oh no, not again!

166
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:35,263
Did I tell you what Councillor Murray
said to me when she gave me this medal?

167
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:41,133
Yes! Trigger, you are boring
the pants off me with this bloody medal!

168
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:49,444
No. She said, 'I thank you on behalf
of the council and the people of Peckham!'

169
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,607
- Morning, Sid. What d'you fancy, Rodders?
- I'll have a cheese roll.

170
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,177
I still find it hard to believe!

171
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:04,683
So do I! Medals for road sweepers!

172
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:09,341
Good God, they'll be giving Del Boy
an award for good taste next!

173
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:13,072
- Morning all.
- Thank God you've arrived!

174
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:15,906
He can bore you two with it now!

175
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:19,344
- What's that then?
- Trigger's got a medal.

176
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:25,427
- Oh yeah. Where'd you find that then, Trig?
- I was awarded it. Look.

177
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:30,019
It's a picture of me receiving my medal
from Councillor Murray.

178
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:32,001
See, that's me.

179
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:38,098
Oh that's you, is it?
I'm glad you cleared that up.

180
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:41,105
Let me have a look at that, Trig, will you?

181
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:46,616
So that's that Councillor Murray, is it?

182
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:51,073
She's the old cow that refused
my application for a council grant.

183
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,899
I've never been so humiliated
in my life.

184
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:57,483
Derek, when you have the time
you must tell me all about it.

185
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:03,306
Hey, has any of your friends down at the masonic lodge
have got influence at the town hall?

186
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:09,550
No. it's just that I've often wondered
what it must be like to apply for a council grant.

187
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:13,860
And the day started out
so well, didn't it?

188
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:18,944
It's Councillor Murray's idea. She's head
of Finance and Facilities at the Town Hall

189
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,523
and she says the local people should be
rewarded for services to the community.

190
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,588
A proud moment
in my family's history.

191
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:29,913
Trigger, you haven't got a family history.

192
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:32,914
You were created
by a chemical spillage

193
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:36,655
…at a germ warfare factory
somewhere off Deptford High Street.

194
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,451
Maybe. But I still feel proud.

195
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,209
So what exactly is the
award for?

196
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:48,821
For saving the council money.
I happened to mention to her one day

197
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:52,244
that I've had the same broom
for the last twenty years.

198
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:58,641
She was very impressed and said
have a medal. 20 years. That's a long time, Dave.

199
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:04,721
- Yeah, I know. It's two decades innit?
- I wouldn't go that far, but it's a long time.

200
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,858
Trig, just a second. 

201
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:15,557
If you've had that broom for 20 years
have you actually swpt any roads with it?

202
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,605
Well of course!
But I look after it well.

203
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:22,759
We have an old saying that's been handed down
by generations of road sweepers:

204
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:27,309
- 'Look after your broom...'
- And your broom will look after you.

205
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:31,383
No Dave. It's just:
'Look after your broom'.

206
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,304
Oh, that old saying!

207
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:40,559
Yeah. And that's what I've done.
I've maintained it for 20 years.

208
00:17:41,848 --> 00:17:49,266
This old broom has had 17 new heads
and 14 new handles in its time.

209
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:57,857
How the hell can it be
the same bloody broom then?

210
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:01,232
There's a picture of it!
What more proof do you need?

211
00:18:03,698 --> 00:18:05,919
This has come
as a bit of a shock to me.

212
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,012
I haven't heard from you for years.

213
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:13,091
Last time we met I got the impression
that I wasn't important in your life any more.

214
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:19,009
Yeah, I understand.
OK, let's meet...

215
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:25,149
No! I’ll come to you...
This weekend? I'm not sure...

216
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,462
Del? I don't know really.
I suppose I'll have to tell him the truth.

217
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:37,427
I'll give you a call... OK...
I know you do...

218
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:41,169
Of course I still love you.

219
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,625
Bye.

220
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:58,075
- Alright, sweetheart?
- Yeah. What you been up to?

221
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:05,504
I've down the market. I met a bloke.
 Done a deal about some electric doughnut makers.

222
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:08,207
While I was down there I bumped into Boycie. 

223
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:13,009
He told me that Mike down the Nag's Head
 is selling tickets for a party on Saturday night.

224
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,659
- You know. Would you like to go?
- This weekend? No, not really.

225
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:24,391
- OK... Any phone calls?
- No...

226
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:30,509
- Del, can we talk?
- Of course we can.

227
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,751
There's something I've got to tell you.
I'd like to sit down.

228
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:40,432
- Go on then.
- I mean both of us.

229
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:57,014
That letter I got this morning.
It was from my Mum and Dad.

230
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:59,191
I've just got off the phone to them.

231
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:04,404
- Ah, was from your mum and...
- You OK?

232
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:10,917
Of course I am, I'm teriffic. 
Oh dear.

233
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,905
I didn't know you had a Mum and Dad.

234
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,523
What I meant was that
you've never mentioned them before.

235
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,490
Years ago we had a big bust up when I told them
I wanted to go into show business.

236
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:26,479
I said I wanted to be a dancer
and act and everything. 

237
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,901
My Dad, he's a bit old fashioned, 
he said some nasty things - you can imagine.

238
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:38,532
So I stormed out, went into digs and 
that was the last contact I had with them - until now.

239
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,151
They got my address from the landlord
at my old flat.

240
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:44,460
They've been phoning for the last couple of weeks
but just kept getting the answer-machine.

241
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:49,785
Yeah, I know darling, but a lot of people get nervous
about leaving messages on answer-machines, don't they?

242
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,502
No, they left lots of messages
but the rotten machine wouldn't record them.

243
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,209
Oh dear!

244
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,790
I don't know 
what's wrong with this machine. 

245
00:20:59,232 --> 00:21:04,071
I reckon that some of the electronic circuitry
needs adjusting, that's all. 

246
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,300
You know, like that!

247
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:13,843
So I phoned 'em. We had a nice chat...
They seemed different - sort of, understanding.

248
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,068
I cried.

249
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:23,401
That's alright.
Come on, sweetheart!

250
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:28,599
My Mum said they'd missed me.
And my dad said he loved me!

251
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:33,250
Oh well, come on.
That is lovely jubbly, innit?

252
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:37,423
- I told them about Damien.
- Yeah.

253
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:42,009
They were pleased. They seemed really
excited they had a grandson.

254
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,055
I told them all about him.
All the little things he does.

255
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:55,596
- D'you tell 'em about me?
- I mentioned you.

256
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:02,955
- D'you tell them what I did?
- No. There wasn't time.

257
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,380
- They just wanted to know about Damie.
- Of course they would. That's alright. 

258
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:12,208
They mentioned going up there at the weekend…
they want to meet him.

259
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:15,823
That'll be nice. Well, we'll pop up there then
shall we?

260
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:20,025
Yeah... The thing is… 

261
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:26,721
Well, see, my Dad's a bit of an old fuddy-duddy
 and he hasn't been well recently...

262
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,695
This bloody thing!

263
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:34,119
And I think meeting you 
might be a bit too much for him.

264
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:35,928
So, I don't want to offend you...

265
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:41,255
That's the last time I buy
anything off that Ronnie Nelson!

266
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,214
Right ten, the weekend!

267
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:47,842
Oh, Mont Blanc! 

268
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:50,935
Darling, no, I can't go on Saturday!

269
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:54,329
'Cause I've gotta to go up to Covent Garden 
and pick up a van load of ober-jeans.

270
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:03,094
And they were really looking forward
to meeting you as well. Never mind.

271
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:07,804
Alright sweetheart, tell you what. 
Why don't you and Damien go and have a nice time.

272
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:14,182
Hey, why don't you take the Capri Ghia, and let 'em see
 that their little girl has done alright for herself.

273
00:23:14,356 --> 00:23:16,378
OK. Thanks, Del.

274
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,603
I do love you.

275
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:24,621
Yeah, I know, well... 
I'm that sort of bloke really, ain't I? 

276
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,280
Anyway. What does your dad do?

277
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:30,492
- He's an antique dealer.
- Is he really?

278
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:33,038
That's interesting, you see, 
because in the garage...

279
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:35,723
I'm not taking anything with me!

280
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:43,127
Alright then, that's fair enough, just a thought.
Now go on, you go darling, build a few bridges.

281
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:47,611
- I'll try. I'll make you a coffee.
- Yeah, that'll be lovely. 

282
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:02,079
- Mum was crying. 
- What's that, champ?

283
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:06,011
- Mum was crying. 
- Was she? Oh, dear, nevermind. 

284
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:11,805
Come and sit here. Women do that, you know.
You'll learn that when you get a bit older. 

285
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:17,052
Anyway. You know where you're going on Saturday?
 Your're gonna go and see your Nan and your Grandad.

286
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:19,426
- Have I got a Nan and Grandad?
- Yes, you have now.

287
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:24,502
- Did you get 'em for me?
- No, they belong to your Mum.

288
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,880
They're gonna make a right fuss of you,
they are.

289
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:32,029
- They'll love you, 'cause they're lovely people. 
- What are they called?

290
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:35,504
What are they called?
I know, they're called... 

291
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,355
Nan and Grandad.

292
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:45,583
- Did you feed Roger?
- Yeah, I chucked a carrot in earlier.

293
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,192
Good.

294
00:24:50,718 --> 00:24:53,430
- Don't worry.
- I'm not.

295
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:57,150
- It's only once tonight.
- Right.

296
00:24:58,174 --> 00:24:59,774
At least I think it is.

297
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:11,433
- Just the once.
- Look at Tuesday.

298
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:16,745
- Happy birthday again.
- Thank you.

299
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:23,522
- Oh leave off, Cass.
- Sorry, Rooney.

300
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:26,896
Del's gotta be the only bloke
who can buy a gold identity bracelet

301
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:29,710
and take it to a dyslexic engraver.

302
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:34,828
- You got lots of nice presents as well.
- Yes, I did.

303
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:39,616
And I spoke to Mummy today and she said,
as a special birthday present to you,

304
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,774
why don't we fly over to the villa next week?

305
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:45,460
 I'm owed some time off 
and Del hasn't given you a holiday since...

306
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:49,984
well, he hasn't given you a holiday!
I thought it might help.

307
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:55,329
- Sangria and warm evenings...
- Yeah, sounds good, don't it?

308
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,731
Hold on.
What about the rabbit?

309
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:01,224
- Couldn't we give it to Del?
- No, he'd eat it!

310
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:05,597
Aren't there any sort of kennels?
You know a place that looks after rabbits.

311
00:26:05,753 --> 00:26:11,762
- Like a cattery but, well a rabbitry.
- A rabbitry? That's a Chinese toilet!

312
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:17,313
- Hang on, can your Mum and Dad could look after it?
- Hardly, they'll be at the villa with us.

313
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,065
They'll be there as well?

314
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:24,647
Where are we supposed to relax 
and  stick to the schedule with your Mum and Dad there?

315
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,717
I've figured it out, Rodney.
We won't do it in front of them!

316
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:37,351
When we want to, you know, relax,
we'll go to our bedroom! What d'you think?

317
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,377
But they'll be in the room next to us!

318
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:46,166
I mean, what about all the panting
and the screaming and all the 'Yes, yes, yes!'

319
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:51,726
- You'll just have to control yourself.
- No, it'll never work.

320
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:55,207
Besides I can't leave Del,
business ain't going too well.

321
00:26:55,232 --> 00:27:00,245
- Oh, come on Rodney.
- I can't Cass, Del needs me here. 

322
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,330
- You go.
- You don't mind?

323
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:08,230
But of course I don't.
A rest'll do you good.

324
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:12,789
 It means we'll have to put our schedule on ice 
for a week. 

325
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:15,009
Well, I'm afraid so. 

326
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:24,615
You both got tickets for
Saturday's party?

327
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:29,177
I can tell you're looking
forward to it!

328
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:34,224
Hey, Boycie! You and Marlene 
fancy something nice to eat?

329
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,525
Yeah, I do as it happens, Mike.

330
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:39,696
Shall we pop down
The Harvester in a minute?

331
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:48,964
I don't get much trade 
but I do have a good laugh! Bloody 'ell.

332
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:53,649
- Here, Trig! Do you fancy a ticket? Tenner each.
- Righto, Mike.

333
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,812
What d'you mean, 'Righto, Mike?'
You don't even know what they're for.

334
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,555
It's bound to tell you
on the ticket, innit?

335
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,056
 I didn't think of that.

336
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:12,150
D'you know Trig? Every year us publicans
we hold a fancy dress ball. Prizes, the lot.

337
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:16,443
This year it's old Harry Malcolm's turn.
He's the guv'nor down at the Crown and Anchor.

338
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:20,655
He's holding the party at his house.
He's got a great barn of place over on the Common.

339
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:25,952
Hey, the first prize is a brand new stereo system 
worth over a thousand pound.

340
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:29,497
Fancy dress! I've only got
my mohair suit and my best jumper.

341
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,186
Perfect!

342
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,415
Did I tell you about my medal?

343
00:28:33,591 --> 00:28:37,507
Yeay. Three times yesterday 
and twice this morning.

344
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,174
- Did I tell you, Marlene?
- Yes, love. You sent us a fax last night.

345
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:49,003
Alright, Mike?

346
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,638
Wotchyer, sweetheart.

347
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:56,300
Stop it! Honestly.
Cassandra get off alright then, did she?

348
00:28:56,335 --> 00:29:01,225
- Yeah, I've just come back from the airport.
- And Raquel's away too, ain't she?

349
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,157
I bet you two'll be out
gallivanting Saturday night.

350
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,419
No, not at all sweetheart.

351
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:09,082
A mug of Bournvita, plate of toast
and Match Of The Day for us Rodders, isn't it, eh?

352
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:10,311
Heaven!

353
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:12,098
That's nice... 

354
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:18,428
- 'Rooney?'
- No, that is 'Rodney'.

355
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:24,698
You see, it's not an O - it looks like an O
but it's not! 'Cause it's copperplate writing. 

356
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:28,117
It's quiet today, innit?

357
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:32,056
Yeah, got more life
in one of his meat pies over there. 

358
00:29:32,285 --> 00:29:37,077
Come on Michael, give us a drink, will ya?
Lager-top for Rodney and I'll have...

359
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:40,242
A Baileys and cherryaide. 

360
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:46,001
Del, d'you fancy something to eat?
How about a nice plate of beef stew?

361
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,709
Go on, I'll have some of that then, 
that'll keep the cold out, won't it?

362
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:51,064
You be careful with the old beef, Del.

363
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:54,036
- Oh shut up, you brass.
- I don't know  what you are worried about.

364
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:57,389
I've been eating British beef all my life.

365
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:07,408
Egg and chips, please, Mike. 

366
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:11,048
- What do you want, Rodney?
- Something that was fresh this morning.

367
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,429
Alright, give him the Daily Mirror, will you?

368
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:21,966
- Alright, Del Boy? Any luck?
- Yeas, loads of it, Denzil, all bad!

369
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:26,268
I bumped into Paddy the Greek.
You remember those 9 carat...

370
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,473
...24 carat gold bracelets I was selling?

371
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:34,953
Well, apparently they've all been
deported along with Ugandan Maurice.

372
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:37,875
Why did you trust him with
all that gold in the first place?

373
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,366
Because he told me he was
an exporter.

374
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:43,885
Yeah, an exporter,
he just got the sack from British Rail.

375
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,204
Life's one long struggle, innit, eh?

376
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:56,125
I feel a bit like that King Farouk
 trying to hold back the tide. 

377
00:30:57,786 --> 00:30:59,393
I've got a kid to think to look after now.

378
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:03,606
- It's Canute.
- Yeah, you can say that again!

379
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:06,637
Hey Del, d'you wanna buy a ticket
for a publican’s ball?

380
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:09,441
Yeah, certainly. 
Which one, left or right?

381
00:31:11,598 --> 00:31:13,037
Your loss.

382
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:20,021
Well, I've got to go, the host is a fellow mason.
And mind you, last year's do was a good laugh.

383
00:31:20,056 --> 00:31:23,135
- I heard it all ended in a big punch up.
- Yes it did.

384
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,466
But during the struggle
Marlene got a whack on the nose.

385
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:29,832
And you did nothing about it, did you?

386
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,592
What could I do?
You threw the first punch.

387
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:34,303
Were you injured?

388
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:38,415
No, fortunately her make-up 
cushioned the blow.

389
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:42,131
I have just remembered! 

390
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,321
I was supposed to take Cassie's specimen
to the clinic this morning!

391
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:50,368
 I've left it in the kitchen on your work top.

392
00:31:50,403 --> 00:31:52,455
That's alright, don't worry, 
you can take it in tomorrow, can't yer?

393
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,585
No you don't understand.
It mustn't be left in direct sunlight.

394
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,479
You've got to find a cool,
dark spot where it won't be disturbed.

395
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:02,482
How about Boycie's pants?

396
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:14,013
Yes, everything's fine, Raquel,
 although there's no food in the fridge. 

397
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,898
No I'm not complaining.
You just have a nice time, gel, alright?

398
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,094
Hold on, I think Del's back.

399
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:25,346
Del Boy - sorry!
Raquel on the phone.

400
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,469
Right, OK.
Tell her I'll take it in the bedroom.

401
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:32,930
He's gonna take it in the bedroom, love. 
See you soon, bye.

402
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:37,132
I suppose your Cassandra
will be there by now.

403
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:42,207
Yeah. She'd have landed about an hour ago. 
Bloody 'Rooney'!

404
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:47,385
I don't know why you wear an ID bracelet.
Men - real men - didn't wear them in my day.

405
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,787
You used to wear them dog-tags
round your neck.

406
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:52,795
That was an ID necklace.
Completely different.

407
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:58,122
To be honest with you, Unc, I don't really wanna wear 
this thing but I don't wanna hurt Del's feelings.

408
00:32:58,157 --> 00:33:02,824
- I understand, boy... During the war.
- Oh, God!

409
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,960
I had a mate who had
exactly the same problem.

410
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,140
His Mum had bought him a
gold watch and he hated it. 

411
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:13,281
- But he didn’t wanna hurt her feelings.
- So what did he do?

412
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:17,738
One night he went round all the pubs
in Portsmouth flashing his gold watch about.

413
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:22,001
On the way back to the ship
he got mugged... Problem solved.

414
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:24,445
That was a good idea, weren't it?

415
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,610
There's a lot of mugging
going on round here, Rodney.

416
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:31,953
Albert, I'm not seriously considering it
 as a viable option! God Almighty!

417
00:33:32,745 --> 00:33:36,762
- I'll just have to tell him.
- Be gentle though.

418
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:45,827
Look, Del, about this thing you
gave me for me birthday.

419
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,129
It's a beauty, innit, eh?

420
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:51,395
Well, yeah but... 
Well, the thing is...

421
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,221
I tell you what. Raquel and Damien 
are having a nice time.

422
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:58,565
They're getting on really well 
with her Mum and Dad.

423
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,753
 Oh, well that's good, innit?

424
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:04,410
You didn't fancy to go
and meet your common-law in-laws then?

425
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:11,158
Well, to be honest Rodney, yes I did,
but Raquel didn't want me to go.

426
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:13,184
What, she told you?

427
00:34:14,995 --> 00:34:23,526
No, she was having a difficult time telling me,
and I made up an excuse to let her off the hook.

428
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:28,301
I think that she thought
I might embarrass her.

429
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:38,362
What d'you mean? That's silly!
How could you possibly embarrass her?

430
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:40,234
Well, that's what I thought!

431
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:45,403
I tell you what.  Did you know that her old man 
is an antiques dealer?

432
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:50,893
I thought I might let him have a look
at the Jacobean cine-camera we got in the garage.

433
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:54,864
I'm sorry, you were saying 
about the bracelet?

434
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:59,025
- No, nothing. I'm well pleased with it.
- Yeah, that's it. 

435
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,016
You'll never forget
your name now, will you?

436
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:07,268
Raquel goes away for a few days 
and this flat becomes a shambles.

437
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:09,945
There's nothing in the fridge, 
the veg is on the turn

438
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,683
and that apple-juice is horrible.

439
00:35:18,354 --> 00:35:21,219
He's a moaning old git,
ain't he, eh?

440
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:33,973
Cassandra's specimen is gone!

441
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,804
 I don't believe him!

442
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,278
What am I gonna tell
Cassandra?

443
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:57,688
You tell her that you spilt it in the van 
when you went round a corner.

444
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,674
- I can't lie to her, Del.
- Alright, tell her uncle Albert drunk it.

445
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:08,556
I can't tell her that, can I?
It's just one thing after another, innit?

446
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:13,253
- Rodney, listen, we've got to get out of here. 
- How d'you mean?

447
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:15,087
Well listen, I've been thinking.

448
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:21,335
Now that Cassandra's away in foreign climes
and Raquel's had it away on her toes to Milton Keynes.

449
00:36:21,518 --> 00:36:25,347
You know what tomorrow is, don't ya?
It's the big party, innit? The publican's ball.

450
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:31,260
So I was thinking, while the mice are away
the cats could go out and play.

451
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:37,544
- It'll be like the old days, Rodders.
- We're not gonna be pulling birds, are we?

452
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:44,718
We never pulled any birds in the old days, Rodders.
What chance have we got now?

453
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:49,971
- Come on, what d'you say?
- Well, it's just a bit of harmless fun, innit?

454
00:36:50,006 --> 00:36:54,366
We'll of course it is! A couple of hours.
You know, a sausage roll and a grin.

455
00:36:55,232 --> 00:37:03,005
I'll tell you what. The first prize 
is only a stereo system worth 1,000 pounds.

456
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,065
- What do they give prizes for?
- For the best fancy dress.

457
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:11,756
Fancy dress! I'm not going
dressed up like some zoom!

458
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:14,957
Come on Rodney, it's only a laugh, innit? 

459
00:37:15,114 --> 00:37:18,936
We'll just pop down the High Street 
and get ourselves a couple of costumes.

460
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:22,845
Rodney, I need your help 
to win this prize.

461
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,363
'Cause you're the one with the GCE's in art.
You got the flare and imagination.

462
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,130
Shall I tell you
what I'm imagining right now?

463
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:35,622
I'm imagining that since you knew
Raquel was going away,

464
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:40,435
you've been planning to go to that party
and try and win that stereo all along.

465
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:44,025
How dare you?

466
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:50,058
If only your mother could hear you now!
Is that what you really think of me?

467
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:55,371
Here I am and my child and my wife
have gone away for what is obviously

468
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,763
a demanding and draining weekend
and all you can think of is 

469
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,421
'That's alright, Del Boy can go out
for a jolly-up'!

470
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:07,956
That's it, is it? That's what you think of Del Boy?
Shallow as a worm's grave.

471
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:17,363
No, I just thought it was...

472
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:22,045
- Well, it just seemed a bit... 
- No, don't!

473
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:28,865
 - I'm bleeding!
- Alright. 

474
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:32,729
I'm sorry, then.

475
00:38:34,772 --> 00:38:38,788
Alright. Your apology is accepted.

476
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:43,084
Hold on, I've just remembered.
This do is an all-ticket affair.

477
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,734
- I know, I got us a couple as we were leaving.
- Oh, stinking...

478
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:55,685
I feel stupid! I don't know how we got
out of the estate without being seen.

479
00:38:55,896 --> 00:38:58,336
Don't worry, we'll be
there in a minute.

480
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:00,892
Yes, but then we've got to
get home dressed like this!

481
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:03,418
Who's gonna see us at five o' clock
in the morning?

482
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,920
Yeah, I suppose so. Five in the morning?
You said we was only going for a couple of hours.

483
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:12,621
Yeah I know, but you get involved,
don't you?

484
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:19,552
- What's happening?
- There must be something wrong.

485
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:24,134
- I wish I was mechanically minded like you.
- Very funny!

486
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:27,631
Alright, I'll open the bonnet,
you go an' have a look at the engine.

487
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,585
Go an' have a look at the...
I'm not gettin out dressed like this!

488
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,721
You have a look, it's your van!

489
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:35,349
You tart, Rodney.

490
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:05,355
- Do you see anything?
- No. It's right dark in here. 

491
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:18,561
What you looking for?

492
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:23,110
Just tryin' to see if there's any petrol
coming through to the carburetor.

493
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:29,999
- You idiot! 
- What's the matter?

494
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:32,764
You'll blow us to kingdom come!

495
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:36,253
Don't be daft! There's no petrol coming through,
is there?

496
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:40,244
Must be some sort of a blockage.
I mean, that's why we've broken down.

497
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:47,238
Will you get back inside that van.

498
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:52,233
I don't want people seeing you
dressed like that, you look like a right wally!

499
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:07,995
What are we gonna do now then, eh?

500
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:10,067
I don't know, Derek!

501
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:15,403
We are sat in the middle of Peckham at 10.30 
dressed up as Batman and Robin!

502
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:20,329
And it was you who chose these costumes!
I wanted to go as The Blues Brothers!

503
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:26,479
We'd have still broken down
and been in this embarrassing situation, wouldn't we?

504
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:32,241
Oh yeah! We'd have been wearing suits and ties,
right couple of zooms we'd have looked.

505
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:38,246
But we'd never have won first prize
as The Blues Brothers!

506
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:41,214
No, but at least we could have walked home!

507
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:46,516
Look, just shut up
and try to think of a way out of this.

508
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,173
Alright, let's just think about it.

509
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:59,573
We phone the RAC.

510
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:03,468
Yes, and we ask to get put through 

511
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:08,949
to the 'Broken Down Whilst Dressed 
As A Couple Of Prats' department.

512
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:14,320
Alright then, the police.

513
00:42:14,473 --> 00:42:17,172
Oh, leave it out, Rodney.
We'd never live it down.

514
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,034
Our lives would be hell! 
We would have to 'hemigrate'.

515
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:25,863
At this particular moment, Del,
that doesn't sound like a bad alternative.

516
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:32,925
The pubs are gonna be chucking out soon.
They'll tear us to shreds.

517
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,601
Know what... Harry's place
is nearer than our place is. 

518
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,776
You know,  we could be there 
in five minutes... if we ran. 

519
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,226
- We'll be seen!
- No we won't. What do you mean 'be seen'.

520
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:49,628
Look, all the streets are empty, ain't they?

521
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:51,361
At the moment!

522
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:56,855
But I guarantee, the second I step out of this van
a thousand people are gonna pour out out the...

523
00:42:58,077 --> 00:43:00,769
out of a place where a thousand people are!

524
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,764
No. Not if we go through the back streets
and the back alleys.

525
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:10,590
'Cause the only people there 
are the winos and the crackheads

526
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:14,486
and let's face it, they see Batman and Robin
every night of the week. 

527
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:21,836
- Five minutes?
- Five minutes, that's all, if we run.

528
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:36,924
- I'm going now Tom.
- I'll see you out.

529
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:41,991
- Goodnight, Councillor Murray.
- Goodnight, Tom.

530
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:03,355
- Sorry, Miss, you seen a policeman round here?
- No, I haven't!

531
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:07,898
- Good! Then giss your money!
- What are you doing? Tom!

532
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,725
Help!

533
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,178
- Someone shut her up!
- Get her briefcase.

534
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,277
Gary!

535
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:24,275
- What's happening?
- I haven't the faintest idea!

536
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,334
Go!

537
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:56,195
- Councillor Murray?
- Yes.

538
00:44:56,352 --> 00:45:00,067
I recognise you from your photograph.
Derek Trotter.

539
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:04,113
You may remember me.
I wrote to you sometime ago about a...

540
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:08,530
Del, let's go!

541
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:13,323
Sorry, I must dash.
Duty calls.

542
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:33,264
 Oh Boycie, let us in, will you?

543
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:40,703
What have you two come as then?

544
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:42,528
Batman and Robin.

545
00:45:43,062 --> 00:45:46,925
Ignore him, Rodney, will you?
Just ignore him. 

546
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:53,249
- Where is everyone?
- Straight through there, Caped Crusader.

547
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:56,070
You ain't gonna win nothing
dressed like that.

548
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,119
Did you see that Rodders? 

549
00:45:58,267 --> 00:46:03,931
We've come as Batman and Robin
and Boycie's come as the Penguin.

550
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:12,268
Oh no, Del Boy, not the Penguin.
More like the Joker.

551
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:17,710
Kenny. Mike from the Nag's Head.

552
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:22,725
Listen, I was really cut-up yesterday 
when I heard about your Dad. Your husband.

553
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:26,174
Still, at least he didn't suffer.

554
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:28,874
No. He had a good innings and...

555
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:32,759
he'd have been well chuffed to see all his family 
and friends turn up for his wake like this.

556
00:46:41,906 --> 00:46:46,038
Derek. Harry died yesterday.

557
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:49,265
Harry... Harry die...?

558
00:46:55,595 --> 00:47:00,856
Why didn't you tell us that out there 
instead of letting us come in here like that?

559
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:04,099
Yeah. We were going da na na na na 
and everything.

560
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:09,652
It completely slipped my mind.
Strange what grief can do.

561
00:47:15,217 --> 00:47:19,264
Del. I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Kenny, Harry's son.

562
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,033
Yes, of course I remember you.

563
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,244
I phoned round everyone
to tell 'em the party was off.

564
00:47:26,404 --> 00:47:28,825
I must have left four or five messages 
on your answer machine.

565
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,669
Obviously you didn't get 'em.

566
00:47:30,704 --> 00:47:33,424
No, the machine’s playing up a bit.

567
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:36,956
I'm gonna throw that bloody machine away 
when we get home.

568
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:41,338
- Kenny, look, I am really sorry about this.
- Don't be silly.

569
00:47:41,557 --> 00:47:44,554
The old man's most probably up there now
having a bloody good laugh at you all.

570
00:47:45,122 --> 00:47:51,272
- You'll stay, won't you?
- Oh yeah, of course we're gonna stay.

571
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:55,905
- Go and grab yourself a drink and something to eat.
- Alright, cheers.

572
00:48:09,476 --> 00:48:11,498
A beer here, Denz.

573
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:15,294
Didn't you know Harry had died?

574
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:23,822
Of course we knew Harry had died!
That's why we came dressed as Batman and Thingy!

575
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:25,923
- Robin.
- Yes.

576
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:32,928
- I suppose the prize-giving's off now then, is it?
-I love him. Bloody love him.

577
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:40,690
Alright Del, Dave. 
Bit of a choker old Harry popping off like that, innit?

578
00:48:40,725 --> 00:48:44,649
Yeah. We didn't even know
the fancy dress party had been cancelled.

579
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:46,101
Me neither.

580
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:51,296
You mean, that's your costume?

581
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:58,907
Yeah, I come as a chauffer.
I feel a bit stupid now.

582
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:03,464
Come to mention it, you do stand out a bit.

583
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,955
I'm gonna cheer up the widow. 

584
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:12,647
I don't think you and Del
would have won first prize.

585
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,492
- No?
- No.

586
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,481
You're alright,
but Del don't look nothing like Tonto.

587
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:27,766
Aerodynamic designed cycling helmets.

588
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:34,059
As worn by Chris Boardman and his cousin Stan.
 Look at that, beautiful.

589
00:49:34,226 --> 00:49:37,577
OK then, what else we got here.
I tell you what we've got, look at this.

590
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:42,725
Baseball caps!
Straight from LA, as worn by MC Hammer.

591
00:49:44,456 --> 00:49:46,715
Here you are madam,
buy one for you kid for Christmas.

592
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:49,744
They'll look lovely in his stocking,
I tell you that. No? 

593
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:53,842
Right, what else have we got.
Oh, yes, what have we got here! Look at this!

594
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:57,364
We've got the unisex baseball caps.
Look at that.

595
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:02,587
There you are, buy one for your son, 
buy one for your daughter! Well done!

596
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:08,183
- Del! 
- Yeah! What's up?

597
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:09,938
Have a look. 

598
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:13,371
- Give us your bag!
- Oi! What's your game?

599
00:50:15,335 --> 00:50:17,277
Rodney, get after him! Go on!

600
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,309
Are you alright?
You alright, darling?

601
00:50:24,623 --> 00:50:30,556
Little buggers have nicked me handbag, son.
My bloody arse is hurting as well.

602
00:50:31,601 --> 00:50:36,306
You just take it easy, will ya? Just take it easy.
Someone call an ambulance for her, will ya?

603
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:38,039
Also, call the police.

604
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:39,999
Hey, you! Oi!

605
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:47,819
Whoops-a-daisy.

606
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:52,192
We read and we hear about
so-called have-a-go-heroes,

607
00:52:52,227 --> 00:52:55,188
but we very rarely have the honour
of meeting one.

608
00:52:55,223 --> 00:53:00,598
Well, I'm proud to say that here, in Peckham,
we have our very own have-ago-hero.

609
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:08,581
And so it's my great honour and privilege
to present this medal for bravery to Derek Trotter.

610
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,707
That's Batman!

611
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:27,139
- Mr Trotter, could I have a couple of pictures?
- Mange-tout, mange-tout. 

612
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:29,715
How come you got a medal?
I did all the running.

613
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:33,037
Yes I know, but you were running
away from him!

614
00:53:38,026 --> 00:53:43,636
I was not running away from him actually.
I was just luring him.

615
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:47,678
Well you weren't half luring him fast then!
You shot past me like Linford Christie.

616
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:52,780
Minus that poodle that he keeps 
down his shorts, of course.

617
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,151
Could you mind out of
the way please, sir...

618
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:59,925
Yes, could you mind out of the way, please, Rodney
You're casting a shadow on the hero.

619
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:08,844
Why didn't you get a medal, Rodney?

620
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,979
No, they offered me one
but I said I wanted to remain anonymous.

621
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:27,847
Mr Trotter. Councillor Murray.
We met, the night you were dressed as Batman.

622
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,417
Oh yes, of course. 

623
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,740
- I've never been so frightened in my life.
- It was only a costume.

624
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:40,595
No, I mean terrified
of that awful gang of muggers.

625
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:41,986
Oh, I see, yes. 

626
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:45,087
- Still, they're behind bars now, thanks to you.
- Oh, don't mention it.

627
00:54:45,264 --> 00:54:48,160
If ever there's anything I can do for you,
please don't hesitate to call.

628
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:51,030
Well, thank you very much indeed.
Thank you.

629
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:52,906
Councillor Murray.

630
00:54:55,374 --> 00:55:00,560
As a matter of fact there is a little something
that you might be able to help me out with. 

631
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:05,166
- Do you think we could have a little chat?
- Of course. Come this way.

632
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:07,830
Cushty!

633
00:55:10,187 --> 00:55:13,041
We're gonna have to cut this one out 
for the family album.

634
00:55:13,196 --> 00:55:15,218
A Trotter's never won a medal before.

635
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:18,485
Well, Albert's won three of four dozen.

636
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:22,735
Why'd they use the word 'man'?
They could have mentioned Rodney.

637
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:28,181
- I mean, why didn't they say 'men'?
- Yeah, Rodney was there as well.

638
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:30,183
They do mention him,
here you are.

639
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:38,304
'Mr Trotter was aided in the capture
of the muggers by his younger brother, Rooney.'

640
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:41,108
You see, it's bloody Rooney!

641
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:46,519
Come on then, ladies and gentlemen,
 charge your glasses.

642
00:55:46,554 --> 00:55:52,131
Because I have got something to say,
on this auspicious occasion.

643
00:55:52,337 --> 00:55:58,619
And that is, not only am I the only Trotter
 to win a medal... without getting wet.

644
00:55:59,175 --> 00:56:01,996
But this is a double celebration.

645
00:56:02,397 --> 00:56:04,882
- You told them!
- No, I never! I swear!

646
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:07,360
- How d'you lot find out?
- Find out what?

647
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:09,879
- You mean you don't know?
- No. 

648
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:15,437
Well, in that case, let me just say that if,
in the near future,

649
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:19,997
anybody wants to buy Cassandra and I
some Mothercare vouchers,

650
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,535
they will come in bloody handy!

651
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:29,092
- Yes my son, we have scored!
- And it was a beauty!

652
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:36,347
It's coming home, it's coming home,
it's coming, football's coming home!

653
00:56:38,488 --> 00:56:40,130
Well done my son!

654
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:44,938
I'm pleased for you, son.
I know you've been through hell to get there.

655
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:52,567
 How about that then, eh? 
A little cousin for Damien to play with.

656
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:57,587
Wait a minute. You said this was
a double celebration

657
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:01,405
before you found out about Cassandra
being pregnant. So what else are we celebrating?

658
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,032
That's right.Then it's a treble celebration.

659
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:09,906
'Cause you know I was turned down 
for my home improvement grant by the council.

660
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,465
Well, they have changed their minds
and send me a cheque for 5,000 pounds.

661
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,067
- They gave you 5,000 pounds?
- Yes, what can't speak can't lie. 

662
00:57:20,028 --> 00:57:22,659
Signed by Councillor Murray.

663
00:57:23,713 --> 00:57:29,130
- It's not a bad old world is it, bruv?
- It's getting better all the time, Del.

664
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:31,902
Lovely jubbly.

665
