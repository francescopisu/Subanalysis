1
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:55,653
Yes, so we're definitely rehearsing tonight?
Eight o'clock down the hall!

2
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:02,378
Right, will the rest of the group be
there? Oh great man!

3
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,376
Oi Ringo!

4
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,175
I hope that all my huffing and
puffing ain't interrupting you!

5
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:10,068
Eh? No! It's no sweat man!

6
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,142
Well it's certainly not coming
from you, you lazy little git!

7
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:17,174
Charlie I've gotta go. Look,
I'll see you later on, alright.

8
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:25,136
- Rehearsing with the group tonight!
- Group! You're a drummer who's got no drums!

9
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:27,211
No - well, it's early days yet!

10
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:30,582
I don't know why you waste
your time with that bunch of wallies for.

11
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,845
They're not a bunch of wallies!
Anyway, you haven't heard us play yet.

12
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,100
I don't need to! I mean, look
who yer lead singer is, Mental Mickey!

13
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,783
Oi, there's nothing wrong with
Mickey Maguire!

14
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:44,882
Nothing wrong! He bit a
bloke's ear off once, that's all.

15
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,251
Not all of it!

16
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:55,990
Well, before you become deeply
involved in any musical argument with Mental Mickey,

17
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,552
make sure you're wearing a bullet-proof balaclava!
Let's get this stuff in the van.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,266
What we bought anyway?

19
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,252
Well, it's obvious innit,
sausages! Talking dolls, innit.

20
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:20,940
I mean what sort of stock is it? Bankrupt, fire damaged,
water damaged, soiled or just plain hooky?

21
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:24,152
It's none of them Rodney!
These are near-perfects!

22
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:28,064
- Near-perfects! So what's wrong with 'em?
- Nothing.

23
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,578
Well, if there's nothing wrong
with 'em why aren't they called 'perfects'?

24
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:36,799
It's just a bit of legal jargon used by the insurance
company to save on paperwork that's all.

25
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:38,454
Don't worry about it.

26
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:43,629
That's easy for you to say, but I'm the one who has to go
down the Arndale Centre and flog these things,

27
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:47,285
I mean, look at the aggro I had at
Christmas with them cricket bats!

28
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,046
'Each one personally autographed by Viv Richards!'

29
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:54,927
And each one was personally
autographed by Viv Richards!

30
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,526
Alright, it wasn't the Viv
Richards!

31
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:05,775
No, it was Davey Richards' eldest sister!
I had nothing but comebacks on that!

32
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:14,996
No, you'll be alright with these things. I mean have a
look, take a look, can you see anything wrong with 'em?

33
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:19,806
No, it looks alright!

34
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:27,855
Alright! This is Taiwan's
finest Rodney! This is quality par excellence this gear!

35
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,397
We'll pick the rest of 'em up
after dinner. G'on, jump in the van.

36
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,017
What's up Doc?

37
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,307
- What?
- I thought you said something!

38
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,718
Oh! You know, I reckon this
group of mine could go places.

39
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,450
And the sooner the better if
you ask me.

40
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,923
We're styling ourselves on
Frankie Goes to Hollywood!

41
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:04,795
You dozy little twonk Rodney. 
You bang again on the roof of my van like that 

42
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,328
and it won't be Frankie Goes to Hollywood,

43
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:08,559
it'll be Rodney goes to hospital.

44
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:15,905
- Bloody hell Del, I said I'm sorry, didn't I?
- You will be if I get a headache.

45
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:34,863
'The wind is blowing, the snow
is snowing...'

46
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:40,455
- Oi, get your thieving hands off!
- I weren’t feeling all that well, Del.

47
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,073
You'll feel even worse if I
catch you at my Courvoisier again.

48
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,390
What's all the big hurry then?

49
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:51,127
I've just heard a very interesting
bit of news down the pub.

50
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:57,716
Er, listen have you ever heard of the Shamrock Club,
over at Deptford? The Paddies' Moulin Rouge!

51
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,707
That place? I've read about it
in the local paper!

52
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:12,344
Well, their resident band the Dublin Bay Stormers had a bit
of a ruck last weekend and they're all banged up on remand!

53
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:13,509
So?

54
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:17,923
So - what is it next Sunday?
It's St Patrick's night innit!

55
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,598
Their biggest earner of the year and the
Shamrock Club ain't got a band! But I have!

56
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,345
You don't mean young Rodney
and that bunch of wallies?

57
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,457
They can't do all that Mother
Macree stuff!

58
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:34,909
Listen, you don't know Rodney
that well.

59
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:39,618
He's a very talented little lad, they'll
love him!

60
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,780
They'll tear him limb from
limb.

61
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,402
No they won't. The worst he'll
get is a red nose!

62
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:47,356
- Still, it's got nothing to do with me!
- No, that's right!

63
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,548
- I'll keep my opinions to myself!
- Good.

64
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:54,020
- It don't seem right though!
I mean it's not fair!

65
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:57,848
Nor's Frank Bruno's arse but
he don't keep on about it!

66
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,266
Hello, Shamrock Club? Could I
speak to Liam please? Yeah, Derek Trotter.

67
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:24,689
It's Del Boy. How are you pal? Triffic, er listen,
I just heard the tragic news about the Stormers!

68
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,485
Oh, the bloody laws in this country,
diabolical ain't they, oh yeah.

69
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,886
How are you fixed for a
band on Paddies night?

70
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:37,613
Well this is it, I mean, where do
you find a good band these days?

71
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:43,251
There's a lot of cowboys about!

72
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:48,340
What's what noise? Oh that?
Well, that's what I'm phoning you about you see.

73
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:53,650
I'm down here at the community hall and there's a group of
youngsters on the stage rehearsing...

74
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:04,970
Keep it down will you lads? I'm on the blower,
er...hold on Liam, I'll close the door.

75
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:24,309
There we are now, we can hear ourselves speak!
Do what? Yes they sound a lot like the Bachelors!

76
00:07:26,138 --> 00:07:27,767
In fact that's who they model themselves after...

77
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:32,035
Well, there's some good news 
and there's some bad news here Liam.

78
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:36,940
The bad news is they're expensive!
It's 300 sovs I'm afraid.

79
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:42,669
But the good news is they're free
on St Paddy's night! Yes alright.

80
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,503
- He wants to think about it.
- That shouldn't take long should it?

81
00:07:47,973 --> 00:07:52,265
No, no, no, Liam you carry on old son, you take
all the time in the world. I've got plenty of time.

82
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,589
Oi, close the door will yer!

83
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:09,437
Well you won't go far wrong with these boys, no, no.
You know it makes sense.

84
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:15,532
There is one thing...they, not me,
they, you understand insist on cash in advance!

85
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:20,400
Alright, I'll tell you what
old son, I'll pop down in about an hour.

86
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:21,835
Alright, pal.

87
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:44,847
The family used to tell stories about you and yer 'business
activities'! I never believed 'em up until now!

88
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,645
- Get in, get out and don't look back, that's my motto!
- I can't wait to tell young Rodney the good news!

89
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:56,135
Er, listen you keep quiet. This is gonna be a...
it's a surprise!

90
00:08:56,409 --> 00:09:00,030
Oh, it's nothing to do with me
Del! I just hope I don't let it slip out!

91
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:03,811
No that would be very unfortunate wouldn't it?

92
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:09,515
Oh, I tell you what, would
you like a nice large brandy in there Uncle Albert.

93
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:18,786
That's nice of you son, thank you! Might as well leave the
bottle here, save me having to keep on getting up!

94
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,427
Have a nice evening - you
blackmailing old bark!

95
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:51,223
- Come on Rodney! Give us some cymbals.
- Cymbals?

96
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:07,280
Oi, oi, oi, what's he doing here?

97
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,792
I just come down to listen to
you lads. Don't mind do you?

98
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,046
You just come down on the wind
up didn't yer?

99
00:10:16,422 --> 00:10:20,423
Au contraire Rodney.
Au contraire! In fact I'm very impressed.

100
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:24,007
He sounds in very good voice, 
does young Mental Mickey.

101
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:26,024
I don't like people calling me that!

102
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:29,412
I'm so sorry, I'd better put my hands
on me ear-lobes!

103
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,942
Why don't you piss off down
the pub Trotter?

104
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:41,186
Oi, oi, watch it. This is our community hall. Anyone's
entitled to walk in here! Come on then, let's hear you!

105
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:46,361
- Yeah, come on. He's not gonna put us off!
- Yeah, right! One, two, three...

106
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:50,859
- Oi, oi, Rodney I do the one, two, three, fours!
- Sorry Mickey, forgot!

107
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:55,271
One, two, three, four...

108
00:10:56,272 --> 00:11:00,613
Hold on, hold on, where d'you
learn to count, Rampton?

109
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,024
I ain't never been to Rampton. Who started them
rumours about me being in Rampton?

110
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,760
- Alright Mick, take it easy !
- I've never been to Rampton!

111
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,928
I've been to Broadmoor, once
or twice, but that's not the point.

112
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:20,024
- Carry on.
- One, two, three...

113
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:24,215
Oi, I told you once Rodney, I'm not gonna
tell you again son. I do the one, two, three, four.

114
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,581
- Hold up, hold up.
- What is it now??

115
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,474
Well I am very surprised!

116
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:53,744
I came down here expecting you bunch of wallies,

117
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:59,958
 to sound like a cat being doctored
without anesthetic! But you're good!

118
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:11,148
You're very good! Alright you're not quite up to the
standard of Spanner Ballet or Duram Duram!

119
00:12:12,061 --> 00:12:17,570
There's something about your music that I like!
It's well it's got something!

120
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,166
I only hope it ain't catching!

121
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:28,236
If this is all a build-up, some very funny joke, will you
just tell us all now and stop wasting everyone's time!

122
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:32,811
It's no joke Rodney, I mean
it! I'm very impressed, very!

123
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:41,730
Bravo, bravo! Of course, you realise that you're gonna flop
like a jelly on a wet mattress, don't you?

124
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,732
Oh yeah, why are we gonna flop?

125
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:48,195
Because you're undisciplined! You ain't going to
go nowhere till you get yer act together!

126
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:53,822
Yeah? Well my mate's cousin's works for a record company
and he reckons he could get us a contract!

127
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:59,386
And my mate's a doorman down at Chelsea,
but he can't get me a bloody game can he?

128
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:05,777
Na, you're still rough around the edges.
I mean, why don't you take a butcher's at yerselves.

129
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:10,019
You look like something the cat
dragged in - then dragged out again!

130
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,320
Trotter, shut it, we like looking like this.
We're Marxist Trotskyite anarchists!

131
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:20,859
- Yeah!
- Are we?

132
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:26,655
- So why do you want to be superstars then?
- 'Cos we wanna be rich Marxist Trotskyite anarchists!

133
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:29,498
Well, not too rich!

134
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:33,559
No, just a little bit rich!
Money ain't everything!

135
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,915
No, but it certainly takes the
sting out of being poor though don't it?

136
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:44,652
Strikes me you need someone to steer you in the
right direction you know. Look after yer interest.

137
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:51,415
What you need is a manager! 
No hold on, hold on! Don't look at me...

138
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:56,298
Cause the bloke who becomes your manager, 
he's gotta buy you new equipment.

139
00:13:56,482 --> 00:14:03,591
New drums, new guitars new set of speakers!
Cost an arm and a leg!

140
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:10,918
- I thought you said we were good!
- You are good! You're natural, you've got raw talent!

141
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:20,969
Oi, Trotter you don't wanna put your money
where yer mouth is though, don't you?

142
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:23,088
You think I'm not the kind who
would back me instinct?

143
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,178
You know me. He who dares wins!

144
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,159
But, well, the fact of the matter is,
the funds are a bit tight at the moment.

145
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,778
You're enough a wallie Trotter.

146
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:35,079
Yeah yeah! We've heard it
before.

147
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:43,819
Alright! You win! I will be your manager!
I'll get you bookings, you see if I don't!

148
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,318
- What about the instruments?
- I'll get that as well!

149
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:51,634
Don't listen to him! We'll probably end up
with the chuck-aways from some  Boy Scouts' band!

150
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:57,588
All yer instruments and equipment'll be brand new!
Write down what you want, I'll get it for you!

151
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:05,073
I'm gonna make an investment in you lads. This time next
year we're gonna be millionaires! I can see it now.

152
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:12,277
Albert Hall, Carnegie Hall, the Hollywood
Bowl! The revolutionary new sound: Pop Protest!

153
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:16,592
You don't know any of the Bachelor
numbers, do you?

154
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:25,643
It doesn't matter! Well, you carry on rehearsing!
'Cos I'll get this show on the road.

155
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:31,234
Come on then - let's hear ya,
your manager has spoken!

156
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:36,803
- Yeah right! Here we go then, one, two, three...
- I do the one, two, three, four!

157
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,316
- Put down  the table Pat!

158
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,422
What about Mental Mickey?

159
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,242
He's happy enough!

160
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,903
Let's make sure I've got all
the details.

161
00:16:54,678 --> 00:17:01,961
The stolen items consist of two guitars,
two speakers, and a set of drums.

162
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:13,876
- Here’s one of your sticks, it's a bit oily.
- Cheers! D'you reckon you'll catch 'em?

163
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,277
Shouldn't have too much
trouble!

164
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:20,796
We'll just go around the clubs till we find a rock
'n' roll band with a one-armed drummer.

165
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,333
I need you don't I! I mean I
really need you.

166
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:31,771
- What's all this other stuff doing here?
- Er - we collect things!

167
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,371
Funny sort of things to collect ain't
they?

168
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:45,483
Yeah well, er, everyone's
gotta have a hobby ain't they!

169
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,083
Extrerminate, exterminate!

170
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:53,640
Good afternoon Officer, can I
be of any assistance?

171
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:59,341
They've had the drums, guitars, everything!
I locked that door last night Del, I swear to you I locked it.

172
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:03,626
- Alright Rodney, alright. Nevermind, not to worry.
- What d'you mean not to worry?

173
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:05,523
All our equipment's been nicked!

174
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,257
Well, that's not quite true!

175
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:11,147
Er Rodney, would you like to nip outside to make sure
I switched the engine off on the van?

176
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,912
Oh! Well you see, actually these
items haven't been stolen Officer, 

177
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,425
A van came round early this
morning and took them back to the shop!

178
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:26,649
You see I know the owner of the shop. and he let me have them
on what is called sale-or-return basis!

179
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:31,613
I see. Do you enjoy wasting police time, eh?

180
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,425
Hold on, I didn't know we had
'em sale or return!!

181
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,112
- It's my fault, I didn't tell him! I'm sorry.
- Right! About all this other stuff here...

182
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,393
Excuse me Officer, but when I came around just now 

183
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,323
I saw a couple of kids trying to remove
 the front wheels on your Panda car!

184
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:52,544
- They what?? I might be back to see you!
- I can't wait!

185
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,531
What do you think you're playing at,
inviting the bloody Old Bill round here?

186
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,700
What am I playing at??

187
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:03,091
You told me you'd bought that equipment
and all the time you had it on sale or return.

188
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,602
You just set us up didn't you?

189
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:13,356
We've earned 300 sovs, right, and we didn't
acyually pay out for any equipment! Brilliant innit!

190
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,036
Brilliant? Del we nearly had
our heads smashed in!

191
00:19:18,185 --> 00:19:21,675
I didn't wanna play the Shamrock Club!
None of us wanted to play the Shamrock Club!

192
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:29,262
But we played it Del because you said it was
our first step on the road to stardom! We believed you!

193
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,063
Well you must be bigger
plonkers than you look!

194
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,201
You didn't honestly believe all that rubbish
that you and them wallies

195
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:42,307
were destined for the Albert Hall, 
Carnegie Hall ?

196
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,957
The only hall you were destined for,
is sod all, that's what!

197
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:50,177
But as it happened you made 150 quid 

198
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:52,588
so think yourself lucky, 
and anyway you can still carry on with the group.

199
00:19:53,329 --> 00:20:03,162
No I can't. We had an artistical disagreement!
Look what that Mickey tried to do to my ear!

200
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:07,579
The vicious little git! Now I'm gonna sort him out.
What was the row about?

201
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:09,687
They accused you of setting us up!

202
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,117
They said you'd only done it for a one off earner and to
get rid of the suits you've had in here since 1975!

203
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:18,554
The way some people's minds work!

204
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:24,320
What do you mean? They were right!! But I defended you!
I mean, stood there and defended you!

205
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:31,774
And d'you know why? 'Cos you're my brother - and
I don't like to hear people rubbishing you!! That's why.

206
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,557
- Still works does it?

207
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:45,833
It was only a pipe-dream Rodney!

208
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:49,330
At least I had a dream Del -
it's more than I've got now.

209
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:54,796
Come on Rodders, you didn't really think you
were gonna go nowhere did you?

210
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:57,720
I mean just takea look at them
other three!

211
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:02,621
They had about five and half brain cells between them,
and one of them was on the blink! I tell ya.

212
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:09,473
That show business lark -
they're all Stoke-on-Trent aren't they.

213
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,057
You have to watch yer old deaf
and dumb in that game Rodney!

214
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:24,855
Look, why do you always try and
stop me in everything I do?

215
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:26,338
Who, me?

216
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:29,416
You always sticking yer
oar in and mess things up for me!

217
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:32,890
- Sometimes I get the feeling that you're scared!
- Scared, me scared? Scared of what?

218
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:38,907
Scared of me becoming a success! You're terrified
that one day I might just make it - on my own!

219
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:43,645
That is like a knife in my
heart that Rodney!

220
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:48,908
There is nothing that I would like more than to
see you become someone!

221
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:58,235
Have a nice Capri Ghia and all
that! I remember what Mum said on her deathbed.

222
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:07,172
She said to me, 'Del,' she said, 'Please give
little Rodney all the encouragement that you can!

223
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:17,032
- Never Del, never hold him back!'
- She didn't 'alf say a lot on her deathbed.

224
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:22,624
- What?
- Whatever the subject is…

225
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,346
Mum had something to say about it
on her deathbed!

226
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,023
She must have spent her final few hours in
this mortal realm doing nothing but rabbiting!

227
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,936
You are walking a bleedin'
tightrope here Rodney!

228
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,157
No hang on. Right, remember last week
we were having a row

229
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,364
about whose turn it was to go
down the chippy, yeah?

230
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:46,074
And you claimed that Mum said on her
deathbed, 'Send Rodney for the fish!'

231
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:54,232
Yeah, well, I'd had a few hadn't I? 

232
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:00,016
You tried something
and it didn't work. 

233
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:06,281
Nevermind, look. 
You've got 150 beer vouchers!

234
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,282
Come on, cheer up!

235
00:23:14,068 --> 00:23:16,928
- We've got to go down the market this afternoon!
- Triffic!

236
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:22,998
Oh, come on now Rodney,
listen, it ain't all bad news!

237
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:28,604
On one hand you've
just had your hopes and dreams dashed!

238
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:34,085
On the other hand, I've got a van
load of hooky Maltesers! Come on let's go...

239
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,355
Alright Monk, I'll come straight with you, look, 
I've had these dolls for about a week

240
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:47,699
and I haven't sold one yet! If you take a
chance I'll take a loss, I can't be fairer than that!

241
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:53,721
Would I lie to you? Alright,
I'll see you around Monk!

242
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:13,434
At number 26. Four guys from South London. This is
Boys Will Be Boys from A Bunch of Wallies!

243
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:26,479
Maybe old Trig could knock some out down the council
depot. Oh shut up. Bloody noise, I can't think!

244
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:51,255
I don't believe it! It's
that bunch of wallies!!

245
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:54,031
What do they think they're doing??
They're on Top of the Pops!!

246
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:11,392
You know that old bird who works down the laundromat,
the one who's after...What's wrong?

247
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:15,970
Nothing Rodders! Alright fine.
Wanna cigar?

248
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,575
Sorry, you was saying,
what was you saying?

249
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:28,863
I wound her up, right, I said that Uncle Albert wants
to take her to  the old folks', beano on Thursday.

250
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:32,649
- Took her right in it!
- I like it!

251
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:43,113
- Are you sure everything's alright?
- It's triffic Rodders, couldn't be better mate!

252
00:25:44,936 --> 00:25:47,956
- Hey, Top of the Pops in on!
- Yeah, but the telly's broke!

253
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:52,372
- I'll watch it on the black and white one then!
- That's broke as well!

254
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:56,557
Well it's got to be the fuse in the socket!

255
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:04,971
No, I tried that! They're both broke!
I'll have to get a firm in - naus innit, eh?

256
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:09,128
Oh well, I might as well
give Albert the good news! 

257
00:26:09,587 --> 00:26:12,034
Go on. He's in his room.

258
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,642
Uncle Albert.

259
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:18,366
Hello son, you alright?

260
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,785
He'll go bloody divvy when he finds out!

261
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:27,252
You wanna act yer age you interfering little...
Can't you have a word with him Del?

262
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:32,667
He's only come in there to annoy
me! I don't wanna go on no old folks' beano!

263
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:37,663
Well don't go then, don't go!
Listen, I'm off out - don't mention it to Rodney!

264
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,826
I doubt if he'd wanna go with you anyway,
he's watching Top of the Pops on the portable.

265
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,252
They're in the charts.

266
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:58,179
So they're in the charts.
Marque de Fabrique, as they say.

267
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:03,441
They could go to number one!
They could have a smash hit on their hands.

268
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:06,999
Alright, so you have a smash hit on your hands.

269
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,271
You might not have another one
for the rest of your life!

270
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:15,023
I always said they could make
it, and you convinced me they couldn't.

271
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:18,500
That's always been your trouble Rodney,
you're too easily swayed!

272
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:28,742
- And what about me, eh? I was their manager!
- I'm gonna stick this right up your jacksy!

273
00:27:33,908 --> 00:27:38,347
