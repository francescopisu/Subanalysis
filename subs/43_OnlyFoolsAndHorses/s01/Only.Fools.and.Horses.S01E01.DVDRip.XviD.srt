1
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:52,176
That Sidney Potter's a good actor, ain't he Rodney?
He was marvellous in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.

2
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:56,787
Yeah, knockout Grandad. Sidney Potter?

3
00:00:57,217 --> 00:01:01,080
Yeah, you know him, always
plays the black fella.

4
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:03,969
It's Sidney Poitier.

5
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:05,503
Sidney Potter!

6
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,306
Look, it's Poitier.

7
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:08,405
It's Potter.

8
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:10,861
It's bloody Poitier I'm telling you.

9
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,189
And I'm telling you it's bloody Potter.

10
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:14,778
Are you two at it again, are you?

11
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:18,752
Del, how do you pronounce that fella's name
on the telly? Sidney Poitier or Sidney Potter?

12
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,661
Personally I'd pronounce it
Harry Belafonte, but you two please yourselves

13
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:27,087
You daft old sod, it was Harry
Belafonte all along.

14
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:34,506
Well I wondered why Sidney Potter kept
bursting into song...I don't like Harry Belafonte.

15
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:41,716
S'il vous plait, s'il vous plait, what an enigma. I get
better looking every day. I can't wait for tomorrow.

16
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,642
Oh, do you know, I think I'm
suffering from something incurable

17
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:53,737
Still, never mind, eh! Oi, come
on Rodney, shake leg, we've got a meeting at 12.

18
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:54,848
What are you doing?

19
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:56,009
Our accounts.

20
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,603
You keeping accounts now?

21
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,268
Well there you are Grandad,

22
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:05,354
a lot of people told me I was a right dipstick
to make my brother partner in the business,

23
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:08,898
but this only goes
to prove how bloody right they were.

24
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:14,260
You dozy little twonk Rodney,
this is prima facie evidence ain't it, eh?

25
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:16,756
The tax man gets hold of
that he'll put us away for three years.

26
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,262
Don't worry, if the tax man
comes I'll eat it.

27
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,788
This is the only way I can keep a check on
you, Del.

28
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,349
I'm sure you're cheating me in some way
- I just can't figure out how.

29
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:28,749
Cheating you! Cheating you!
What's that rumbling noise?

30
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:30,280
I didn't hear anything.

31
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,299
No, it's alright, it's Mum
turning in her grave.

32
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:36,879
Don't start that again, Del -
it's obvious you're stitching me up.

33
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:39,907
Look at you, you have
three or four changes of clothes a day.

34
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:44,390
Me - I've got one suit come from an Almost
New Shop. It gets embarrassing sometimes.

35
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:48,975
Oh I embarrass you do I? You've
got room to talk.

36
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,792
You have been nothing but an embarrassment to
me from the moment you was born.

37
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:57,166
You couldn't be like any other brother could you, eh,
and come along a couple of years later after me.

38
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,100
Oh no, not you,
you had to wait 13 years.

39
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:05,731
So while all the other Mods were having punch-ups down
at Southend and going to the Who concerts,

40
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,624
I was at home baby-sitting!

41
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:16,275
I could never get your oystermilk stains out
of me Ben Shermans - I used to find rusks in me Hush Puppies.

42
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,029
Del, I couldn't help it when I
was born.

43
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,954
Oh there you go, there you are,
you see it's any excuse with you innit, eh?

44
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,384
What d'you think bout poor old Mum then,
eh? Do you know that she was 39 when she fell for you?

45
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:31,014
For the first three months of the
pregnancy you were treated as an ulcer.

46
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:37,243
And to this day I
sometimes think the original diagnosis was correct.

47
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:45,418
Look eh, come on, what sort of
bloke do you think I am? Cheat me own brother?

48
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:52,459
Come on Rodney I told you before haven't I, it's everything
between you and I split straight down the middle, 60-40.

49
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:56,924
Yeah, well explain this to me
then Del.

50
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,235
How do you manage to
pay for the light, gas and rent in this place, eh?

51
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,226
I mean, take last week. We went to the auction right, we
bought a gross of disposable lighters, a space invaders game,

52
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:10,615
two facial saunas, five
water-damaged sleeping bags, and a moon-roof for a Peugeot.

53
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:14,395
Right. Then we swopped the
lot for a van-load of one-legged turkeys.

54
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,651
They was not one-legged turkeys.
They was damaged turkeys.

55
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:19,732
How many legs did they have
Del?

56
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:22,111
I'm in no mood for trick
questions

57
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,639
Anyway you haven't put down the
VAT.

58
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:25,939
We don't pay VAT.

59
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:29,583
I know but we collect it, though, don't we eh?
Alright Rodney, alright.

60
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:34,123
Look, so we don't pay VAT - we don't pay income tax
or national insurance.

61
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,810
On the other hand, we don't claim dole money,
social security, supplementary benefit do we, eh, eh?

62
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:45,137
The Government don't give
us nothing, so we don't give the Government nothing.

63
00:04:45,769 --> 00:04:47,331
Right.
What you complaining about?

64
00:04:47,773 --> 00:04:50,609
Look, I'm 23, I'd like to
think I had some sort of a career.

65
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:53,819
You're self un-employed, that's a
career, innit?

66
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:58,505
What, selling hankies from a suitcase in Oxford Street? I
want something better than that Del.

67
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:03,481
Alright, alright, in future you
can do Regent Street. Come on.

68
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:05,475
Cheers.

69
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:08,728
And it's Poitier.

70
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:09,661
Potter.

71
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:11,003
It's Poitier.

72
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,348
Hello Del.

73
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:17,418
Hello darling, how are you,
alright?

74
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,852
- Fine thanks.
- Good.

75
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:25,408
Do you realise we've always had
something missing in our lives.

76
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,540
First we was motherless, then
we were fatherless

77
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,689
and now we're flogging one-legged
turkeys from a three-wheeled van.

78
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:32,404
Little acorns.

79
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:33,993
What, you got one of them
missing as well Del?

80
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,511
No. Marks and Spencers started
off with a barrow

81
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:37,758
At least they had four wheels

82
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,517
Stop going on about that van
will you.

83
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:40,652
Morning, Del Boy.

84
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:45,095
Bonjour, Joycie. Two half pints
of your finest low-carbohydrate beer, thank you.

85
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:46,906
D'you want it in glasses?

86
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,924
Yes please, otherwise it
dribbles through yer fingers!

87
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:53,294
I meant do you want it in
glasses or jugs?

88
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:59,082
As long as it is served by your fair hands Joycie, we'd
drink it out of Evonne Goolagong's old tennis boots.

89
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:05,792
Look at that...Charm like laser
beams, eh Rodney. Knocks 'em bandy.

90
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:09,647
Yeah, it's your ready wit and
three-wheeled van that blows their minds Del.

91
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:14,865
Yeah, I suppose I am full of the old bel esprit, really
ain't I? Actually I quite like old Joycie.

92
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:20,142
I mean, fair play, she's a bit of an old dog,
but there again you know I quite like old dogs.

93
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,161
I mean you know where you are with
'em, don't you, eh?

94
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:27,179
They never ask you if you still respect 'em in the morning
and they'll always lend you a nicker for petrol!

95
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:33,435
You know. I like this life though. Don't you Rodders,
eh, ducking and diving, wheeling and dealing!

96
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:35,702
You know
it's exciting ain't it, unpredictable.

97
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,869
You know in this game you can go out in
the morning with 50 pence in your pocket...

98
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:41,552
And come home at night skint

99
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:42,836
Exactly. Yeah.

100
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,296
I'm thinking about getting a
job Del!

101
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:54,186
Eh, what chance have you got of getting a job? Do leave it
out, have you heard that, you heard that Joycie?

102
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,276
He's only
thinking of getting a job, ain't he, eh?

103
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:57,526
A job eh!

104
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:01,993
I've got GCE's and I took a
year's course at the art college in Basingstoke.

105
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:06,154
Yes, I know you took a year's course, but you got expelled
after three weeks didn't you, eh?

106
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:09,053
The Board of Governors
were doing their annual inspection

107
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,961
and found you camped in your little room
with the biggest reefer this side of Marrakesh.

108
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,371
Zonked out on your bed with some
Chinese tart!

109
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,987
She was a Chinese tart

110
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:18,957
Well, Chinese - Japanese, it's
all the same to me.

111
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:22,744
Alright, alright, supposing you go for
a job, and you go for the interview, eh?

112
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,710
What you going to say to the manager? You're
going to say, 'Oh yes sir,

113
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,564
I've got qualifications and
experience, sir yeah.

114
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:31,936
I've got two GCEs, an 18 month suspended
sentence and I know a good joint when I puff one.'

115
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:42,795
No, your feet won't touch bruv! No, no, I'm afraid not
Rodney, at the ripe old age of 23, you are a social leper.

116
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:51,898
Society has placed you in the darkest corner
of its deepest cellar to grow moss and be forgotten about!

117
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:59,410
Still never mind, eh? Viva la France as they sy in
Rome. No need to get depressed.

118
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:05,467
Oh, me depressed? No, of course not Del. I'm on top of the
world, I feel like a born again eunuch.

119
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,710
I think I'll apply for
a mail-order course with EXIT!

120
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,815
That's a good idea Rodney, never
say die.

121
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:17,208
How are you? Alright. Terrific.

122
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:20,195
Oh, there he is, oi Trigger!
Here, you know my brother don't you, eh?

123
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,517
Yeah, course I do, how you
going Dave?

124
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:26,905
Sorry I'm late Del Boy, I had to pop round me
sister's to arrange an alibi for next Thursday.

125
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:28,903
What?

126
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:33,100
Why d'they call him Trigger?
Does he carry a gun?

127
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,001
No, it's cos he looks like an
'orse!

128
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:42,541
Listen, me and the Trigger have got some business
to discuss, like, you know what I mean.

129
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:45,474
Okay, so you get the
drinks and meet us back here, over by the table, alright?

130
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,959
Oh arr, sir. Anything you say,
sir, borrow me daughter, sir?

131
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:59,154
No, no, very clever kid you know my brother. Yeah, got two
GCEs, one in Maths, one in Art.

132
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,191
You wanna see him when he
writes a letter. Some of the words he uses.

133
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,110
What long ones?

134
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,881
Well they're like that, you
know some of 'em. Anyway, what you selling?

135
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:08,546
This!

136
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,909
I've got 25 of them all told,
the others are in the car.

137
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:14,250
I thought I won't wrap it up,
parcels attract attention these days,

138
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,951
best to carry it
openly then it don't look conspicuous!

139
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,994
Oh yeah, yeah, that's good
thinking - that Trigg. Yeah, very good thinking.

140
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:26,938
Goes so well with your sling-back
wellington boots and your off-the-shoulder donkey jacket.

141
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,580
You look like an
executive hod-carrier!

142
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:35,264
Let's have a look anyway. Oi,
Rodders, what d'you think of this, infra-dig, innit eh?

143
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:37,427
It's plastic.

144
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:46,829
Plastic? It's Old English
vinyl! With combination locks, yeah dinky little handle

145
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:50,114
I dunno we might be able to put
some of 'em round the old squash clubs, eh?

146
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:53,821
We shouldn't have anything to do with them Del.
The police are probably looking for them right now.

147
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,050
Tell us the truth, are the
police looking for these things, Trig?

148
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:00,539
No they're not Del, and that's
the truth

149
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,438
Why are you hiding it under
the table, then?

150
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:05,423
'Cos you never know when
they're gonna start looking for 'em, do you?

151
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,585
Leave 'em, Del. Leave 'em.

152
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:12,007
Oi, we're partners, at least
respect my opinion.

153
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,635
Alright, alright Rodney, I'll
respect your opinion!

154
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:16,405
How much...

155
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,385
To you, Del Boy, 17 pounds
each!

156
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:24,568
You know what happened to the
real Trigger, don't you? Roy Rogers had him stuffed!

157
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,273
Alright then - 14

158
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:32,041
14, leave it out. Five.

159
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:33,589
12.

160
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,282
- Six.
- Ten.

161
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:36,482
- Nine.
- Eight.

162
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:37,957
Done!

163
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,434
That's the way to do business
Dave.

164
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:48,011
Right, okay Trig, let's work
that out. That's eight times 25 equals, 175, okay?

165
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,425
200.

166
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,823
What? No, no - Rodney, no, no,
no. The calculator says 175, alright.

167
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:55,452
Yeah, but he's got GCEs in
Maths and Art!

168
00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:01,898
So what does that prove, he can paint by numbers.
Look Trig, I mean this is a calculator innit, eh?

169
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:05,982
You know what I mean look - calculator says
175, you can't argue with a calculator can you, you know

170
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:07,556
Give it here.

171
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:11,863
25 times eight equals - 200!

172
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:18,781
Oh yeah! Look at that. I must
have got my finger stuck on the button, yeah.

173
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,970
Pianist's fingers, Del.

174
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:24,937
Yeah! Yeah, you wanna look after
them Rodney, they break very easily.

175
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:37,766
You've gotta see 'em to believe 'em Spiros. Yeah. Ah, I dunno
hang on a minute, oi Grandad, where were they made?

176
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,606
It don't say...There's some
Chinese writing on 'em though.

177
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,987
No, no, no it didn't actually give the maker's name
Spiros, but then again the best ones never do, do they?

178
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,314
You know what I mean. Yeah.

179
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:52,409
How's it going?

180
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:53,792
That's about the 15th.

181
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,899
- Briefcase he's sold?
- Phone call he's made.

182
00:11:56,332 --> 00:12:00,498
Yeah, yeah, well I'd get in while the going's good if I was
you Spiros, I've only got 25 left!

183
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,351
This is a cheeseburger! I
asked for an Emperor-burger.

184
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,094
I couldn't afford an Emperor-
burger.

185
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,715
He got me a cheeseburger.

186
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:16,129
I asked him for an Emperor-
burger, and he brings me back a cheeseburger!

187
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,115
Yes, yes, hang on a minute
Spiros. Will you just hang on.

188
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:19,518
Look, what's he on about now?

189
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:23,518
He asked me to get him an Emperor burger,
but I couldn't afford it so I got him a cheeseburger!

190
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:27,531
Bloody Emperor-burgers and cheese-burgers! I'm trying to
do a deal here. Now shut up will you!

191
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,560
No, no, not you Spiros, no, no me old mate. Alright,
how many of these briefcases can I put you down for?

192
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:39,826
Ah, none! Right thanks,
great - yeah, alright, see you around

193
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:43,890
I told you the best thing to
do with them cases didn't I! Chuck 'em in the river!

194
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,673
Chuck 'em in the river! Chuck
em in the river! That's our profit you're talking about.

195
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,989
What do you think this is - a
ationalised industry?

196
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,113
He knows I hate cheese!

197
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,881
Will you stop going on about
hat rotten cheeseburger, will you!

198
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,439
Ah, Dougie Sadler, he owns the
stationers in the High Street, he's our boy Rodders!

199
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,478
I don't know why he bothers!

200
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:08,235
He's a tryer ain't he! Your
Dad always said that one day Del Boy would reach the top!

201
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:12,640
There again he used to say
Millwall would win the cup!

202
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:23,853
Hello Dougie? Del Boy! How's your luck pal? Good! Family?
Soooper! Dougie look, I'm phoning about some briefcases!

203
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:29,933
Yeah? Go on, what a choker!

204
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,888
25 of 'em nicked from his shop
last week!!

205
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:35,719
Oh God!

206
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,527
No, no, no I'm not trying...Not
no sell any no, no, no.

207
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:44,027
No I wanted to buy some, you see,
yeah I've got this, er, contact on the stock exchange. Yeah.

208
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,060
Em, by the way Dougie, old pal, what were you
selling them for? What d'you mean they were rejects?

209
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:54,160
Oh beautiful! We've bought a
consignment of rejects!

210
00:13:55,151 --> 00:14:02,121
What. what was wrong with them? Oh I see, yeah,
yeah, I mean who'd be daft enough to nick them eh?

211
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:06,858
Yeah,
who'd be stupid enough to buy hem? Yeah I know.

212
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:14,860
I'll pop own and see you next week when you get
some more in.Bye bye Doug. See you around.

213
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:19,524
God struth.

214
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,525
Alright, so what's wrong with hem?

215
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,254
Open one!

216
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:26,490
What's the combination?

217
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,773
No sod knows, that's why
hey're rejects!

218
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,564
There's meant to be a bit of
paper with them, giving you the combination?

219
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:39,851
Yes, there is, it's inside the
briefcase innit. Cock-up at the factory.

220
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:47,519
Nice going Del Boy! You have bought 25 executive briefcases
that can only be opened by professional safe crackers!

221
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:50,339
This makes the one-legged
turkey deal look shrewd!

222
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,543
Alright, Rodney that's he way I'm made innit eh? You
know, crash in and to to hell with the consequences.

223
00:14:56,873 --> 00:15:00,773
He who
dares wins! The French have a word for people like me.

224
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:07,057
Yeah, the English have got a couple of good 'uns an' all! I
told you all along not to touch them didn't I?

225
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:09,687
Yeah alright, alright, well
it's got nothing to do with you has it!

226
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:19,239
But we're partners! Ain't we? Oh I see, the truth's coming
out now. Well come on Del let's have it out in the open!

227
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,522
Then how do you see our respective
roles in this 'partnership'?

228
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:29,678
I see it as a combination of my business acumen, contacts
and money, and your ability to drive a three-wheeled van!

229
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:32,616
Badly! Or did you see yourself
in a different role?

230
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:39,543
Well, yes I did! With my qualifications I saw myself in
the capacity of a financial adviser!

231
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:46,169
A financial adviser? Bonjour
Trieste, you are beautiful, you are Rodney!

232
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:52,820
Today I'd just about clinched a deal to buy
these briefcases for 175 pounds,

233
00:15:53,349 --> 00:16:00,318
when my financial adviser stuck his
nose in and advised me to pay 200 pounds. Right!

234
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:06,699
And having paid the 200 pounds my financial adviser then
advised me to chuck the bleedin' lot in the river!

235
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:11,763
Now with financial advisers like that
who needs a bleeding recession!

236
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:19,969
What kind of financial adviser goes out to buy an Emperor-
burger and comes back with a cheeseburger?

237
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,883
Will you stop going on about
that ruddy cheeseburger!

238
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:24,593
Eat it, will you!

239
00:16:25,763 --> 00:16:30,504
Get off him. It's against the law to force-feed a senior
citizen with a cheeseburger and you know he hates 'em!!

240
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:32,141
Well what did you buy it for
him for?

241
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:35,700
It's all I could afford!! You
make my life a misery, you do.

242
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:40,817
Here, oi, just a moment! What
was the last remark about me making your life a misery?

243
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:47,148
Yeah well, you do Del with your
over-bearing, over-protective manner!

244
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:12,717
Let me remind you Rodney that you were a six-year old little
nipper when God smiled on Mum and made her die!

245
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:17,762
Two months after that Dad packed his bags
and left us to fend for ourselves.

246
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:23,614
It was me that kept
us together, nothing to do with Grandad!

247
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:27,532
He was an out- of-work, lamp-fitter waiting
for gas to make a comeback!

248
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:37,176
I grafted 19 to 20 hours a day to put groceries on that table
- alright, it wasn't always double legal -

249
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,547
but you ate the
finest food that was going!

250
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:46,144
All you ever gave me was TV dinners and convenience foods!
If it wasn't frozen or dehydrated we didn't eat it.

251
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:49,713
If you had been in charge of
the last supper it would have been a take-away!

252
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:57,501
Well anything was better than
the salmonella and chips that Grandad used to knock up!

253
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:08,584
Del, look, don't get me wrong
- Im, I'm grateful.

254
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:16,025
I don't want your gratitude, ungrateful little git! I don't
know what is the matter with you Rodney.

255
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:19,067
Sometimes I
hesitate to tell people that you're my brother!

256
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,353
Well, I always say I'm your
social worker!

257
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:26,343
Do you mind telling me exactly
what it is that has made your life a misery?

258
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:33,322
Well, you've always treated me like a child! I was the only sixth
former in my grammer school who wore short trousers!

259
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, well, I got 'em cheap
didn't I?

260
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:42,262
But I was 15, Del. I was growing hairs and things! My
legs looked like Italian footballers!

261
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:49,089
And you'd never let me do anything on my own,
would you? You even had to help me with my GCE studies!

262
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,850
You passed in two subjects.

263
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:57,057
I failed in the other eight Del. I mean you embarrass me,
that's why I never bring women home!

264
00:18:57,327 --> 00:19:00,692
Oh you know some women do you?
Cor, that's a turn up for the book!

265
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:05,661
The only bird I've ever heard you mention was old
Shanghai Lil from the art college in Basingstoke.

266
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:09,126
Even then you had to drug her
before you could get your leg over!

267
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:11,486
No I didn't.

268
00:19:11,742 --> 00:19:13,978
What, you didn't drug her or
didn't get your leg over?

269
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:21,114
You're suffocating me Del! I'm getting out of this house! I'm
going to prove to you I can survive on my own!

270
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,615
I'm going to the pub!

271
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:25,238
What to prove you can survive
on your own?

272
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:29,812
No, to get legless! I don't
need you no more Del, I don't need you for nothing!!

273
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,416
I was just, I was just wondering...

274
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:01,389
I think he's very much like
you Grandad!

275
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:04,275
What, dignified in defeat?

276
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:06,877
No, a ponce!

277
00:20:10,247 --> 00:20:16,100
No, no, I'm sure these can't be the ones they're looking for.
No, no, I wouldn't do that to a mate, now would I, eh?

278
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:21,060
No, don't you say nothing to 'em
you Wally! I mean you can't trust the Old Bill can you!

279
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:28,645
I mean, look at that time when they planted six gas
cookers in my bedroom! Yeah, alright, don't worry, okay.

280
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:33,280
I'll see you around! Rodney?

281
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:36,639
Where was you first thing this
morning?

282
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,631
I was out tryin' to sell these
things

283
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,275
Did you call Rodney?

284
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:44,465
No, I thought I'd let him lie
in and sleep his hangover off. Is he still in bed?

285
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,557
No, he's gone!

286
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:47,894
Gone?

287
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,376
Packed his ruck-sack and had it
away on his toes!

288
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,830
What do you mean gone? Where's
he gone?

289
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,433
Hong Kong.

290
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:56,892
Hong Kong? What do you mean Hong Kong?

291
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:59,666
Hong Kong. It's in China.

292
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:03,394
I know where Hong Kong is! What
I want to know is what's Rodney doing there?

293
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:07,433
He said he was gonna hitch-hike
there to see that bird from the art college.

294
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:11,387
Who? Shanghai Lil? But she's in Basingstoke, so what's
Master mind doing on the road to Hong Kong?

295
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:17,151
No, that's where she is now.
She got deported after the drugs trial.

296
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,381
Here, just a minute. What did you do, say or cook for him
that was so awful it forced him to leave?

297
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:28,922
It weren't me. It was that row
last night. He's gone to prove himself

298
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:37,944
Prove himself, no it's just one of Rodney's little games,
that's all. He'd never reach Hong Kong.

299
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:40,021
He has trouble finding Clapham.

300
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:43,137
- He seemed determined.
- Well didn't you do anything?

301
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:46,842
Well yeah, I made him some
sandwiches.

302
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:56,036
And he took them? Blimey, this is worse than I thought! No,
wait a minute, he ain't got no money!

303
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:01,737
He took his post office book
with him. Can't you go and search for him?

304
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:06,278
He's been gone about seven hours,
the farthest he could have got is France.

305
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,721
Oh that's alright, we've got him
cornered then, ain't we, eh!

306
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:10,845
Ring up Interpol!

307
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,599
Interpol? Interpol? I'd get
more joy out of Interflora...

308
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:19,301
But he might be in danger. You
could explain to them what Rodney's like.

309
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:28,971
I'm sorry, I don't know the French for pranny! Hong Kong!! I
mean...Hong Kong! Why didn't he tell me where he was going.

310
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:32,336
He could have taken these
bleedin' things back with him!

311
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:21,168
A2 F2. Enter, illegal move. A2,
B2. Enter, illegal move.

312
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,483
This thing still ain't working
properly.

313
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:29,998
That's because you're playing draughts on it. It's a talking
chess game, you can't play draughts on a talking chess game.

314
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:31,708
Why not?

315
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:35,011
Because you're supposed to play
chess on it, that's why it's called a talking chess game.

316
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,182
You've already blown the micro-
chip twice trying to huff the rook and what 'ave yer!

317
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:43,043
It's supposed to have an
electronic brain?

318
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:46,547
It has got an electronic brain,
but it didn't know it was gonna have the misfortune

319
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:50,806
to fall into the hands of a soppy old
duffer who wants to play draughts on it, did it?

320
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:56,332
But I can't play chess! Why
don't they invent a talking draughts game?

321
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,691
Because if they did you'd most
probably want to play bloody ludo on it...

322
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:16,472
Rodney's back Del...Look,
he's here. You hungry Rodney?

323
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:18,978
Starving. I haven't eaten for
two days.

324
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,818
Shall I cook you something?

325
00:25:21,015 --> 00:25:23,390
No, no, no, no!! A cup of tea,
perhaps!

326
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:33,597
- Old place don't change much.
- No, same as ever!

327
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,059
It's really good to be back Del!

328
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:52,320
Don't you think you're over doing the prodigal's
return a bit. You've only been gone six days.

329
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:56,311
Well, it might seem like six
days to you Del, but to me it seemed like more...

330
00:25:56,516 --> 00:26:02,055
A week? I take it you didn't
reach Hong Kong! How far d'you get?

331
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:06,915
- South of France...St Tropez.
- St Tropez, oh very mal de mer!

332
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:08,687
Problem.

333
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,146
- 85 in the shade.
- What were the birds like?

334
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:14,060
Mostly French...

335
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:20,514
I met one English girl
there, Veronica, her father's a millionaire tax exile.

336
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:24,079
- Tax exile is he?
- Illegal move.

337
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,820
Had a boat had he? You know
parked out in the bay?

338
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:33,272
A yacht anchored off-shore. They invited me
over for dinner one night! I didn't go though.

339
00:26:34,062 --> 00:26:36,393
Still had some of Grandad's
sandwiches left did ya?

340
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:45,685
No, that night I packed my bags and headed home...
I was homesick you see...I missed......that!

341
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:50,097
You must be joking. The only
people who ever missed that was the ruddy Luftwaffe!

342
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:57,857
It may not be much to you Del, but to me it's got a raw and
savage beauty. You forget that I've got artist's eyes Del.

343
00:26:58,102 --> 00:27:03,749
Yes, you've got pianist's fingers...Italian footballer's
legs. You ever thought of applying for a disability allowance?

344
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:07,113
I know you'll never understand what I mean Del,

345
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:12,079
but you've got to suffer paradise before
you can realise what you left behind.

346
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,383
Your home, your family...

347
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:15,573
Your passport...

348
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:23,857
Your passport...My passport!! You knew didn't you? You let
me go through all that and all the time you knew!

349
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,091
Where did you find it?

350
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:31,691
Top of your wardrobe! We were expecting a visit from the local
gendarmes and I thought I'd better check out

351
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:37,531
just in case you'd left any of that exotic
tobacco lying about. No, I knew it was just a moody Rodney.

352
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,037
I told Grandad it was
just one of Rodney's little games.

353
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:43,663
It must be wonderful to be you
Del, to always be right!

354
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:48,681
I know. It gets a bit embarrassing at times.
I'll tell you another thing shall I Rodney?

355
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:52,182
You said that I would never
get rid of them briefcases!

356
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:53,962
And you did, didn't you Del?

357
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:57,888
Yes I did! I chucked the bleedin'
lot in the river!

358
00:27:59,482 --> 00:28:02,031
No. You threw 'em all in the
river?

359
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:11,090
Yep, every last one of them! They floated - that was a bit
unforeseen. Probably rounding Tilbury about now.

360
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:17,339
200 quid down the Swanee eh -
well, in this case the Thames!

361
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,255
St Tropez! How far did you
really get?

362
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:30,454
The Shangri La doss house Stoke
Newington! I shared a room with some cholera cultures!

363
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:32,862
Your move.

364
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,289
Well, what do you fancy, shall
we go down the pub and act stupid,

365
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,260
or shall we sail across to Veronica's dad's
yacht for tiffin?

366
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,941
No, best not to go to the yacht,
we might bump into those bloody briefcases half-way.

367
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:07,785
