1
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:57,839
- Well, this is it.
- This is what?

2
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:59,147
This is what I bought this
morning.

3
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,375
- What?
- This.

4
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,155
The land?

5
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:14,019
No you plonker. This pile of bricks, only cost me 100
nicker, nice one, eh?

6
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:21,145
Oh shrewd move Del, yeah, I mean people
are panic-buying bricks nowadays ain't they...

7
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:24,988
Who the hell's gonna buy a
pile of old bricks off us?

8
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:32,061
Well, butcher or chemist. Who d'you think's going
to buy the bricks, builders ain't they.

9
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:36,462
Over 200 per cent profit here and all in the readies.

10
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:46,365
Come here...They've just demolished a factory here that
used to make prefabricated structures, right.

11
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:51,103
Chalets, bungalows, greenhouses, you know,
garden sheds, that sort of thing.

12
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:56,296
So I thought - using my noddle - that we'd make
enough out of the bricks alone,

13
00:01:56,531 --> 00:02:01,793
but you never know what's underneath do you, eh?
Decent lengths of timber, bits of metal, you know,

14
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:08,201
few gross of them roofing tiles.
Come and see what I found.

15
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,369
Get yer feelers on that.

16
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:33,344
Here, that's lead Del, that's
pure lead.

17
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:41,332
There's about another 30 boxes
underneath. I estimate three ton altogether.

18
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:47,458
Three ton? What's that at
today's prices? That's that's about 1000 pounds innit?

19
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:55,565
Am I brilliant or am I brilliant? Let's get some of
it in the van, we can do it in three shifts, come on.

20
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,224
- Is it ours Del?
- Of course it's ours.

21
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,356
- Legally Del?
- Don't split hairs with me Rodney. Come on.

22
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,254
Oh that's the lot Del Boy.

23
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:27,712
No, no, no, no, Grandad not there.
No, no, we've got three tons of it here.

24
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:33,265
You see you've got to spread it out over a wide area,
otherwise we'll be having tea with Mrs Obooko downstairs!

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,311
Right, I hope this humping and sweating
is not disturbing you Royal Highness!

26
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:42,298
No, no, don't you mind me,
carry on.

27
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,129
Oh thanks a...Here, look at this Grandad, you've been
carrying this one upside down, this is the way.

28
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,169
You are a lazy little bark.

29
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:58,590
And what's that you're reading, eh?
It's another dirty book I suppose, is it?

30
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:03,906
Honestly you've got a mind like a brown paper envelope.
I'll have a look at that when you're finished.

31
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,029
It's some paperwork I found in one of them boxes...
D'you know what we've got here?

32
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:11,189
Yeah, I know what we’ve got here. We've got three ton of
lovely lead, that's what we've got here.

33
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:16,344
No, no, it's more than that... That factory was producing
prefabricated structures right?

34
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:21,561
Bungalows, garden sheds, that sort of stuff. Well, this
is one of their experimental lines -

35
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,518
it's a do-it-yourself
nuclear fall-out shelter!

36
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:30,711
Nuclear fall-out shelter, you
are a wally.

37
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:37,126
No, it is. Honest. Look, here's the brochure. Here's the plans
shows you how to build it.

38
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:46,041
He's right an' all. This is a nuclear fall-out shelter. This
is probably worth more than we thought.

39
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,970
You can't sell it.

40
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,078
You don't want to put money on it do you?
What do you suggest we do with it? Build it?

41
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:54,151
- Yeah!
- Leave it out Rodney!

42
00:04:54,652 --> 00:05:00,668
Do you realise how close we came to World War Three over
Cuba, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Poland?

43
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:05,060
I mean, it only takes one little rumble in the middle
East then missiles are gonna start flying!

44
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,720
And what have we got, eh, in this country to
combat the might of the Soviet Union?

45
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,296
Three jump-jets and a
strongly worded letter to the Russian Ambassador!

46
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:17,191
No, no, no, you don't know what we've got
up our sleeves, us Brits Rodney.

47
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:21,812
Do you know Rodney that we've got a device
that can track the movements of any Russian nuclear submarine?

48
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,503
They can't keep track on ours.

49
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:26,257
- We've only got one.
- Have we?

50
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:27,880
Yeah I think so.

51
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:32,022
Well anyway, they don't know where it is...
I sometimes wonder whether we do!

52
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,085
I bet your life we don't. You see this country is just not
prepared for war,

53
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:40,144
I mean, nobody knows what we're
supposed to do in the event.

54
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,934
Yes, of course we do.

55
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,011
Alright then, what would you
do if you heard the four minute warning?

56
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:50,013
Well, what's it sound like the
first?

57
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:54,090
Well, that's it, no one knows.
Maybe they're gonna ring church bells,

58
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:58,472
or bang tom-toms or send every ice-cream van
out in the country to play its jingle.

59
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:04,248
Your guess is as good as mine innit? Do you realise
the great powers have got underground salvos

60
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:12,962
primed with enough nuclear weapons to destroy this planet
30 times over. I'm talking about neutron bombs, Del,

61
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:19,143
multi-warheads - chemicals that  attack your central nervous
system, and leave you writhing in agony like a worm in bleach.

62
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:26,393
Bit like after a curry you mean? No, no, it's alright
Rodney, don't worry, forget about it.

63
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:32,455
Look we've got 1000 pounds here. Just think what we
could o with 1000 pounds. Eat, drink and be merry...

64
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:39,682
For tomorrow we die!! Oh come on Del, this is a Godsend.
Look if we build this thing we're gonna be safe, ain't we.

65
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:44,329
Everything's here, the inner walls, the outer walls,
the air tube, the filter system, everything!!

66
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:47,679
Oh come on Del. Oh sorry.

67
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:54,097
Alright soppy, just suppose,
just suppose, that we do build this thing, right.

68
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,377
Where we gonna
put it?

69
00:06:55,617 --> 00:07:01,265
Well, you always fancied a little weekend place. Why don't
we find a spot in the New Forest?

70
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:07,753
And how are we gonna get from Peckham to the New Forest
in four minutes, you old div?

71
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:12,563
Grandad's allotment? That's only a couple of miles up the
road, we could do that in four minutes.

72
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:15,724
Yeah, on a Sunday, with a
following wind, maybe.

73
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,513
Well let's give it a go, eh? We'll have a dummy run and time
ourselves. I'll get the stopwatch.

74
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:25,574
What - what you, look, I mean, what's the point eh?
Alright, so say you can do it in four minutes,

75
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:30,713
what is it going to prove. Knowing them Russian rats
they'll probably declare war in the middle of the rush hour.

76
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,595
- Where's grandad?
- I don't know.

77
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,762
Grandad, come on, hurry up you
stupid old git.

78
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:01,012
Never mind your fag, get in.
Three minutes and counting.

79
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:03,083
Yes, alright Rodney.

80
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,736
The missiles are just going
over Sweden!

81
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,413
They're bloody fast aren't they, they only left Siberia
20 seconds ago.

82
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:28,255
Two minutes 15 seconds and counting Del. The missiles are
over the sea and approaching Middlesbrough.

83
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:29,850
Yes, yes, alright Rodney.

84
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:31,652
Put yer foot down Del Boy!

85
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,702
I can't Grandad.
Look, I'm going to the main road, ain't I?

86
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:39,496
What's it like your side
Rodney?

87
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,653
Alright after this red one.

88
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:45,547
No!!

89
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:48,680
- Bloody hell...
- I meant that red one!

90
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,086
You tit Rodney.

91
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,470
- Come on Del, they're just going over Luton.
- Sod Luton.

92
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,341
One minute 35 and counting.

93
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,392
Oh Gordon Bennett.

94
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:34,210
Switch the...Wayne...the siren ...switch it off!

95
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,606
He's young, enthusiastic...
Well, how are you then Del Boy?

96
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:51,315
- Not too bad Eric. How's yourself?
- Can't complain...How are you then Grandad?

97
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:53,460
Alright Eric boy.

98
00:09:55,153 --> 00:10:00,776
Now what's all that about? 60 miles an hour in a built-up
area. You just herd the four- minute warning or something...

99
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,729
Well as it happens, Eric...

100
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:05,074
- Where's yer tax disc? Fell off did it?
- In the post.

101
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:08,901
Well, why haven't you got a little sign on your windscreen
saying 'Tax in Post'?

102
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,681
We did have - it fell off.

103
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,781
- You been at those funny fags again, Rodney?
- No I haven't.

104
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,315
Good, 'cos Wayne here's looking for his first nick...
Talking of that Del Boy, you might be able to help me.

105
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:25,733
I'm on the look-out for some stolen summer-wear,
short- sleeved shirts and blouses,

106
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,822
men's and women's slacks,
swimming trunks, bikinis.

107
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:30,908
You after promotion Eric?

108
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:35,108
No, me and me wife are off to Corfu next month,
gotta look the part ain't yer?

109
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,305
Well if I hear of anything
I'll let you know.

110
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:43,520
Good luck. I'll see you around.
And oi, take it easy will you...
.

111
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:51,147
Stop playing with that siren
will you Wayne, you'll end up breaking it!

112
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:58,741
- Here, how are we doing for time?
- We died 45 seconds ago.

113
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:02,793
Terrific. We're never gonna do
this run in four minutes.

114
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,088
Oh, it don't matter, it's not
the end of the world is it.

115
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,591
I thought that's exactly what
it was.

116
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,264
All we got to think about is a
place closer to home.

117
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,739
I've been thinking.

118
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,390
Oh my God, you haven't got an
aspirin you can give him have you Rodney?

119
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:18,074
No listen. I may have found us
just the spot.

120
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:23,338
Is that door shut tight Del?

121
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:29,363
Yes, don't worry Rodney, no radiation can get in here!
Here, what's this pipe!

122
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:38,554
Oi, don't do that Del, it's fragile. Del, Del, don't do it.
Del, this is our air-filter, our life line,

123
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:44,368
our umbilical cord and one thing you must never
do with an umbilical cord is bash it about with a hammer!

124
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:50,263
I see, so this is our only source of oxygen is it, eh?
What happens if a pigeon decides to nest

125
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,791
in the other end, we're all dead I suppose,
are we?

126
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,248
Statistics prove that pigeons
rarely nest in the middle of nuclear wars!

127
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,576
- We're not in the middle of a nuclear war.
- We're practicing for one!

128
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,600
Yeah, well, do the bloody
pigeons know that?

129
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,831
Look, a pigeon will not nest
in our air tube...Have faith in me please.

130
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:08,143
How can you have faith in him, eh, Del Boy?

131
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:12,910
I brings me telly in here then he finds out the signals
can't get through the lead!

132
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:17,134
I've said I'm sorry ain't I Grandad. There's some pages
missing out of this brochure,

133
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:21,789
and you can't expect me to know everything can yer?
Anyway, that's why we're having this weekend's practice

134
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:24,072
so we can iron out
all the little wrinkles.

135
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,291
Yeah, well I'll tell you one thing
we've got to iron out.

136
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:34,136
And that is this has got to be back on that building site
first thing Monday morning otherwise them Paddies'll go mad.

137
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,442
You, you are a wally, you
really are!

138
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:51,290
You don't have to stay here Del!

139
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:56,776
I do have to stay and I'll tell you why I have to stay here.
I've got a grand's worth of lead tied up in this shelter

140
00:12:57,124 --> 00:13:00,739
and I'm not gonna leave it in your hands.
Knowing you two, you'd probably lose it!

141
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:08,068
Just think what I could do with a grand, eh?
Fly to America on Concorde.

142
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:17,486
I could buy myself one of them flash Rolex watches.
Have me adenoids taken out privately.

143
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:22,831
Yeah, but how many people can boast they have their own
private nuclear fall-out shelter?

144
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:29,581
Yes, that's true, knowing your bloody luck there won't even
be a bloody war...Here that's what we ought to do you know,

145
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:34,317
we ought to drop a bomb on all them Russian cities,
you see and declare war on them.

146
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,822
And what we say is that the declaration
for war got held up in the post

147
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,831
due to a communist-inspired strike at
a sorting office.

148
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:46,195
Yeah, that's typical of a
ruthless little mercenary like you innit?

149
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:50,804
What d'you mean ruthless mercenary? I'm not a ruthless
mercenary. Who is it goes round at every Christmas

150
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,818
making sure all the old people
have got enough to eat and drink?

151
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:59,526
Yeah, and who is it, during the Brixton riots, drove down in
the van selling paving stones to the rioters?

152
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:06,781
I mean, what did you think they were going to do with them?
All run off home and start building patios.

153
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:15,199
Mine is not to reason why,
mine is but to sell and buy! No, anyway.

154
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:19,746
Anyway I know a lot of them youngsters down in
Brixton and their trouble and frustration.

155
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:24,657
Yes, you see, modern society has denied them
their birthright of a war!

156
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:28,264
Oh I don't believe you! You
saying war's our birthright?

157
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:37,753
Oh yes, yes it is. For century after century you see every
generation of British youth has been guaranteed a decent war!

158
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:43,890
Well that's sort of, you know, raw, 'Over the top chaps, you
know, try that one on for size Fritz'

159
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:50,095
I mean that sort of courage is obsolete. Because the next war's
gonna be fought by computer programmers...

160
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:56,077
See, that's what's frustrating the modern youth! You can see them
any day down the amusement arcade, you know,

161
00:14:56,413 --> 00:15:04,150
they're doing their national service on the space invaders.
Yeah but that sort of, of real war that I'm talking about,

162
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:12,147
you know Errol Flynn leading the gallant 600 into the
Valley of Death. John Mills marooned in a dinghy,

163
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:22,323
it's Kenneth More refusing to let a little thing
like no legs get him down. It's a glorious war that!

164
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,928
- Don't talk like a berk Del!
- Do what?

165
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:29,197
What do you know about it anyway? The only war you've ever
fought is the inch war!

166
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,013
Ah no, I've seen all the films
ain't I.

167
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:38,462
Ah tomato sauce and stuntmen... I'm talking about the real
thing. I remember when I was a little nipper

168
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:45,554
and I saw the soldiers marching off to
battle. Oh yes, it was a glorious sight alright!

169
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,800
Yeah I bet all them spears and
chariots must have stirred the blood mustn't they?

170
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,756
- Just hear him out will you!
- Alright, alright.

171
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:58,478
My brother George was at Passchendale. Nigh on half a
million Allied troops died there,

172
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:06,493
all for five miles of mud! I was at King's Cross station
when his regiment came home after the armistice.

173
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:17,336
Most of them was carried off the train. I saw men with limbs
missing, blind men - men who couldn't breathe properly

174
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:23,515
'cos their lungs had been shot to bits by mustard gas!
While the nation celebrated

175
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:29,039
they was hidden away in big grey buildings,
far from the public gaze.

176
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:35,679
I mean, courage  like that could put you right off
your victory dinner couldn't it?

177
00:16:37,654 --> 00:16:45,203
They promised us homes fit for
heroes, they give us heroes fit for homes!

178
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:51,701
I'd never wear a British
uniform - on principle!

179
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,329
What principle?

180
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:57,804
Well on the principle that the
Russians might shoot at it!

181
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:08,207
The politicians, and the military men used to
con you see. They had little lads, youngsters believing

182
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:12,854
that their country really did need them! D'you know,
they used to have little lads of 14

183
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:18,059
pretending they was 18 just so
they could fight for their king and country!

184
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:20,244
What, and they accepted the
little sprogs?

185
00:17:20,513 --> 00:17:25,194
More often than not...My brother
George lied about his age!

186
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,483
Pretended he was 18?

187
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,927
No, he was 18, he pretended he was 14,

188
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,844
they saw through it though.
I think it was the moustache.

189
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:41,952
- Oh yeah 'cos 14-year-olds they don't...
- Bloody hell...

190
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,791
Oi, oi, what are you doing?

191
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:56,456
I think there's a pigeon trying to nest in our air tube.
Think I've frightened it away, now don't worry!

192
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,191
The battery's
getting a bit low an' all.

193
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,566
Here, these batteries you've
got here. How long do they last?

194
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:17,800
About 12 hours each!

195
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:24,881
12 hours? Cor, we been 'ere 12 hours, only another 36 to go.
Don't time fly when you're having fun...

196
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:34,641
Here, here Oppenheimer, listen if the bomb was to drop round
here, how long would we have to stay inside this thing here?

197
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:40,979
Well, it depends upon the degree of the contamination in
the air outside. 'Cos we're very vulnerable position here

198
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:49,441
being close to the dock. But I would say roughly - give or
take a week or two - about... two years!

199
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:53,631
- Two years?
- Yeah, give or take a week or two!

200
00:18:53,988 --> 00:19:01,567
If you think I'm staying in a lead-lined nissan hut with you
and Grandad and a chemical khazi you've got another think coming.

201
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:05,905
Yeah, but if we leave the shelter within two years we'd
die of radiation poisoning!

202
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:10,230
And if we stay inside the shelter for two years we'll
die of bloody lead poisoning.

203
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,548
He's right Rodney. The rescue team will whip us straight
round the nearest scrap metal yard!

204
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:21,131
Yeah, that's another point, that's a point. Listen, oi!
These batteries are supposed to purify the air right,

205
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:25,938
they last 12 hours, right?
Okay how many of them are we gonna need?

206
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:29,157
Come on Einstein, you're the one with the GCE in Maths!

207
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:34,985
Well, it's two a day, seven
days a week two sevens are 14.

208
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,551
See that Grandad - two sevens
are 14. Just like that, no hesitation.

209
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:44,265
Shut up will yer! So that's 14
times 52...

210
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:51,941
- Twice!
- I know! So that works out at about 1450-odd.

211
00:19:53,754 --> 00:20:02,374
Well, that's not too bad, I thought we were gonna need a
lot! What we're gonna need is 1450-odd heavy duty batteries,

212
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:07,525
about five ton of canned food,
30,000 gallons of fresh drinking water,

213
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,631
and a three and 'arf acre warehouse
to store it all in!

214
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:15,653
Well I did say we'd have to
iron out a few little wrinkles, didn't I?

215
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:21,162
Few little wrinkles? A few little wrinkles? We've got
more wrinkles than a elephant's got in his bleedin' trunk!

216
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:29,150
All in all, and taking every thing in consideration Rodney,
I think I would rather be outside and go instantly with the bomb!

217
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:36,074
Instantly eh? And what makes you so sure it'd ne instant eh Del?
Them bombs contain Strontium 90 not Nescafe!

218
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:41,556
You see the bomb explodes bout a mile above the city right,
causing a radioactive rain to fall.

219
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:46,497
Now this radiation then penetrates the pores of the
skin causing violent sores and diseases.

220
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:49,090
Um, best not to wear anything
decent then eh?

221
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:55,671
Will you be serious for one minute. Look, it's here once
the radiation is in the blood stream

222
00:20:55,865 --> 00:21:02,490
it begins to attack your metabolism. You'll become subject
to drastic biological changes, that's metamorphosis!

223
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:11,024
Yeah anyway, your shape and form will alter radically as
the mutation takes effect!

224
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:17,820
Don't sound too promising do it Del Boy, I mean you have a
job to get a suit off the peg now don't yer!

225
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:25,371
Alright, alright, you can laugh, but I'm telling you,
this city would be inhabited by roaming mobs of mutants!

226
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:31,838
Vacant eyed sub-humans dragging their knuckles through the
litter and debris that was once civilization.

227
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:37,162
Sounds a bit like Stamford Bridge after a bad result...
Look if this is true Rodney

228
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,744
what the hell are we doing
trying to survive?

229
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:45,876
Well, it's our duty ain't it, I mean when we step out of here
we're gonna be intact, perfect.

230
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:54,696
Yeah, well I mean you know, the human race will be
looking to people like us to replenish the species,

231
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:58,349
we'll be like two new Adams going
forth to multiply.

232
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:05,605
Yeah! And you, you dirty little ram, will be out there
multiplying quicker than a pocket calculator!

233
00:22:06,564 --> 00:22:12,287
I see it all now, he's practically praying
for the end of civilization just so he can get out there

234
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,275
and put it about a bit! What time do you
make it Rodney?

235
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:18,019
Ten past 12.

236
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,713
Oh yeah, I make it that too. C'mon then Grandad it's
bedtime, come on.

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,411
Well, as the saying goes, if my species needs me I will not
be found wanting.

238
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,513
Yeah, anyway that's one thing
to look forward to innit Grandad, eh?

239
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:35,558
You know, come the end of the war me and Rodney
are gonna make a foursome with a couple of mutants!

240
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:41,936
I'll have one with three lug 'oles and the eye
underneath her arm, 'cos I don't fancy yours much!

241
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:44,361
It won't be like that!!!

242
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,053
You bet your sweet bippy it won't! It won't make any
difference to you anyway,

243
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:53,356
you go out with mutants in peacetime! I mean look at
that thing you took out on Thursday!

244
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:57,921
Cor, stroll on, I was so embarrassed I had to
tell my mates you were taking it to market!

245
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,821
I did try and warn you it was
a bit ragged!

246
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:06,144
Bit ragged! You liar! You said
to me it looked like the one out of Abba!

247
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:13,548
Yes, I meant the one with the beard, anyway we won't be the
only ones to survive the holocaust intact, will we?

248
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:17,828
I mean I'm thinking of the various institutions -
public schools, that sort of thing.

249
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,715
I mean you bet your life
Rodney’s got a shelter.

250
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:29,294
Eh Del? A thousand nubile girls - in a shelter...in
school uniform!

251
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:34,156
You sicko!

252
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:39,086
No, no, don't misunderstand me. I mean the school uniforms
are of no importance whatsoever.

253
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:40,669
I don't know why I mentioned
them.

254
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:44,305
No, no, it's probably because you're a twisted perverted
corrupted, warped little pervo!

255
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:49,745
Well, yeah, that might have something to do with it!
It's in the line of duty Del!

256
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:52,853
They're perfect specimens.
They're intelligent.

257
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:55,394
Course they're intelligent,
they're still at bloody school ain't they?

258
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:02,401
They're fit - all that hockey!
You might fancy the headmistress!

259
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,495
Oh thank you very much.

260
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:10,191
Well, I think it's definitely
worth bearing in mind. In an emergency.

261
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,245
- Yeah alright, well, goodnight Rodney.
- Goodnight Del.

262
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:26,270
- Night Grandad.
- Goodnight Rodney.

263
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:30,653
- Night John Boy.
- Shut up.

264
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:52,835
- War is hell!!
- What?

265
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:58,962
- War is hell! Alan Ladd said that.
- Did he really? Go to sleep.

266
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:07,200
- Or was it Audie Murphy?
- I dunno, I'm tired.

267
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:11,813
It must have been one of 'em!

268
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:15,684
Well perhaps they both bloody
said it! Now go to sleep will you.

269
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:20,446
No, that was Rock Hudson!

270
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:24,360
For crying out loud, will you two go to sleep.

271
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:40,197
Rodney...Here Rodney
don't keep yer eyes closed - I'm talking to you!

272
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:41,741
What?

273
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:46,621
I've just been thinking. Might not be a bad idea to survive
the next war after all!

274
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,920
Why? You got something up yer
sleeve Del?

275
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:51,952
No, no, just a little idea that's been running round in
me old brain box, that's all.

276
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:59,926
What's the point? All the animals will be dead. Won't be
able to grow nothing 'cos all the earth'll be contaminated!

277
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,609
Where we gonna get something
to eat?

278
00:26:04,336 --> 00:26:12,220
Bound to be  little Paki shop open somewhere! But we won't
be the only ones to survive will we?

279
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:15,897
I was just thinking
about all them girls down at that Roedean School.

280
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:21,732
No, no, no, no, nothing like that, nothing like that. I was
just thinking you see, most of those girls down there,

281
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,832
they are daughters of the noblesses!

282
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,069
The what Del?

283
00:26:27,263 --> 00:26:33,141
The noblesse, the noblesses.
It's French for nobility ain't it eh?

284
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,547
Oh sorry - I was miles off.

285
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,902
Well you see, down there you don't know who's who, do you?
I mean you could meet a scruffy 17-year-old

286
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:48,491
in a sweaty hockey shirt and muddy plimsoles,
and you could be talking to the 459th in line

287
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:55,811
for the throne! But after the old Russians have dropped 20
thousand nuclear bombs on us that scruffy 17-year-old

288
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,082
could turn out to be the first in line for the throne.
So, you see, if I got on my bike,

289
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:09,075
nip down there a bit sharpish like, did me Adams act -
splash of Brut, you know, took her out for a steak meal -

290
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:18,341
loads of charm - I could end up being the King!
On the other hand a bit of mutation,

291
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:25,916
a touch of Strontium 90, I could end up being the
Queen. But either way, either way,

292
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:29,517
see it wouldn't matter because the taxman wouldn't be
able to get at me, would he, eh?

293
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:36,362
Because I would be the head of State. And what with
you out there multiplying all over the place,

294
00:27:36,802 --> 00:27:39,167
I shouldn't be short of a few subjects,
should I, eh?

295
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,204
We, we could go for our
holidays in Mustique.

296
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,549
- What? What?
- Grandad could be the Queen Mother!

297
00:27:54,627 --> 00:28:05,587
Yeah, we'll dye his hat pink... yeah, yeah. No even if that
didn't happen and I can't honestly see how I could fail.

298
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:13,249
You see if the entire civilization was wiped out
we'd all be equal wouldn't we,

299
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,061
'cos none of us would have
nothing, right.

300
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:19,322
- Right!
- Except us Rodney!

301
00:28:21,164 --> 00:28:23,185
Well what would we have Del?

302
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:29,099
A grands worth of lead eh...
pretty shrewd, eh Rodney?

303
00:28:29,444 --> 00:28:32,041
Yeah, that's a real mindbender
Del, that!

304
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:40,934
No, no, we'll be alright. We'll survive Rodney,
d'you know why? Because we're survivors that's why.

305
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,083
When did the alarm bells start ringing and the missiles start
firing, and all the people are rushing about

306
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:55,988
like mad mice trying to find somewhere to hide,
we'll be tucked up in our own little nuclear shelter.

307
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:05,537
The end of the world could be just the break we're
looking for! Oh we're pretty shrewd Rodney.

308
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:13,951
If they started dropping the bomb on us right now
we'd be as safe as houses brother, safe as houses!

309
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:25,527
