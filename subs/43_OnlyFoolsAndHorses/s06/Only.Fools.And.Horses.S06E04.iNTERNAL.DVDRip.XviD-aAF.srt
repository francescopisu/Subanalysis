1
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,174
I love this one. 'Marble Arch at Dawn,
by Rodney Trotter, aged 14 and a half.' Oh!

2
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:11,833
What's this bit?
Did you paint something out?

3
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,986
Yeah, the Eiffel Tower.

4
00:01:14,327 --> 00:01:18,242
The Eiffel Tower? Behind Marble arch?
Is that meant to signify something?

5
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:24,108
Yes. It signifies that originally it was the Arc de Triomphe,
but no one could spell the Arc de Triomphe.

6
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:28,574
So I thought-I know, I'll stick a double-decker bus
going past and say it's Marble Arch.

7
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,755
And it worked. In fact my art teacher said
in my school report he thought it was a master-piece.

8
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,725
So how does it feel to be
in the company of a genius?

9
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,266
If I ever find out I'll drop
you a line!

10
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,336
Are you going to pour that
or paint it?

11
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:54,262
Rodney, I know I'm going to make myself look very stupid,
but does this baked bean label mean anything?

12
00:01:56,165 --> 00:02:01,929
Yes, it does! It means Del's been putting
all his competition stuff in my portfolio again!

13
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:03,172
What competition?

14
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:08,007
Oh it's his latest line, innit?
He's going in for any competition he can get his hands on.

15
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:12,462
We've had spot the ball, spot the mistake,
spot the dog, everything!

16
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:20,046
Oh look at this lot! Spaghetti 'oop labels,
crisp packets, Maltesers wrappers!

17
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,318
I didn't think Del was the type
to go in for competitions.

18
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:27,093
Oh yeah. At the moment he's on the verge
of winning a brand-new Ford Sierra,

19
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:31,006
a free manicure for a year
and a night out with Maria Whittaker.

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,104
Where is Del?

21
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:35,697
Oh, both he and Albert have
got dates this evening.

22
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:39,843
Del's seeing some bird called Petula.
He chatted her up at a boot sale.

23
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,593
And who's Albert going out
with?

24
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:46,235
Ah, some old dear called Elsie Partridge.
He met her at bingo. She's a widow I think.

25
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,594
She's got 11 children!

26
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,310
Eleven kids!

27
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:53,796
Then her husband got fed up and died.

28
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,723
- D'you like smoked salmon?
- Love it.

29
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,021
Good, 'cos they’re smoked salmon sandwiches.

30
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,861
D'you want vinegar?

31
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,909
Did you put a plug on the microwave, Rodney?

32
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:31,915
Did you hear something then?

33
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:33,723
It sounded like your uncle.

34
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:40,439
- Is our microwave 650 watts or 550 watts?
- I thought you had a date with Elsie Partridge.

35
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:44,312
- I have. She'll be here in a minute.
- Hold on! I thought you was taking her out!

36
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:47,589
And I thought you were taking the girl
wossname out! How are you love, alright?

37
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,017
Yes, fine, thank you.

38
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,973
I'm not spoiling my evening
for you, Rodney.

39
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:56,520
It's all arranged, I've got a beef risotto for the microwave
and a nice bottle of wine in the fridge.

40
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,815
- Sorry about this.
- It's OK. It's the way it goes.

41
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:14,578
I know! I could drop Albert a few quid then maybe
after dinner he'll take Elsie Partridge down to bingo eh?

42
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,096
Then we could be alone.

43
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:34,942
Oh look at the stare he's left this place in!
You wait 'til I get my hands on that little plonker!

44
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,991
What are you two doing here?
Are you sitting there waiting for your case to come up?

45
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:45,031
We've been sitting here
discussing art, that's all.

46
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,677
Oh isn't it funny that every time he discusses
art with someone, their buttons come undone.

47
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:57,610
Right, Rodney, here's the keys to the van.
You can take Cassandra out now.

48
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:01,596
- We're not going out!
- We could go out for a while.

49
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:06,970
- No, that's alright Cassandra. We're staying put!
- Rodney, could I have a board meeting?

50
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,274
Look Petula is coming round.

51
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,115
Well, Cassandra is already here!
We are having a cultural evening.

52
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,348
Yes, I know, but Petula's
bringing all her gear.

53
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:27,291
Derek, I don't car if she is bringing her gear!
We are staying put!

54
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,724
But I'm giving her a yuppy salad, ain't I?

55
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,367
I went out first thing this morning
and bought her smoked salmon and everything!

56
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:39,353
I don't care what you've bou...
Alright, we'll go out, then!

57
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:41,195
Good boy! You know it makes sense.

58
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,993
Where's my bottle of wine?

59
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:47,127
Cor blimey! Captain Birdseye’s
here and all!

60
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:50,698
I thought you're supposed to be going out
with the old woman who lived in the shoe!

61
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:53,673
I am. She'll be here for
dinner in a minute.

62
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,921
Din... She's not coming round
here too, is she?

63
00:05:56,327 --> 00:06:00,519
Oh will, that's handsome that, isn't it?
You might as well stay in, Rodney. We'll have a party!

64
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,188
T'riffic!

65
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,852
Sorry, I didn't realise!

66
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:10,111
So he's been showing you his
etchings, has he?

67
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:13,611
- Yeah, I think he's good.
- Yeah, he's alright, I suppose.

68
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:18,710
You see, I like a bit more realism in my art.
That's always let you down, Rodney, you see.

69
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,647
What are you talking about?

70
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:23,656
- That's realistic, innit?
- Yeah, and it's full!

71
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:28,371
- I said I'm sorry.
- Yeah, but, I mean, look at all the other stuff here.

72
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:35,539
I mean, take a look at this one for example.
'Marble arch at Dawn.' what a cock-up that turned out to be.

73
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:38,571
Rodney's art teacher liked it.
He said he thought it was a masterpiece!

74
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,529
No, he didn't! He said he
thought it was a mantlepiece!

75
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,011
It's alright for you to laugh.
He nicked my bottle of wine.

76
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,403
Stop moaning about your
bottle of wine, you old git.

77
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:58,187
Anyway, Rodney didn't mean to 'af-inch it.
Look, he's in love. You know we've got to learn...

78
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:03,070
We've got to learn
to be a bit more understanding, you see.

79
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:07,010
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
It was only a cheap bottle of wine anyway.

80
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:14,919
Exactly. Now then...Ere, that dipstick's only had
my smoked salmon away an' all, ain't he, eh?

81
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:17,210
I'll get my hands on him!

82
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:20,756
Don't have a go at him in front of Cassandra.
You'll just embarrass the boy.

83
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:25,058
Perhaps you're right. I'll wait 'til she's gone,
then I'll kick him up the jacksy!

84
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,446
Any letters for me this morning?

85
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:30,596
No, just a couple of bills.
Nothing from them dopey competitions of yours.

86
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,864
You won't be calling 'em
dopey when I win, will you?

87
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:38,601
How can you win? You don't post your entry
'til a couple of days before the closing date.

88
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:41,824
No, because that ensures that my entry
will get to the top of the pile!

89
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,288
You know, you've gotta think about these things,
haven't yer?

90
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,533
There's a competition on the
back of them cornflakes.

91
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:52,217
You can't win the raffle if you
don't buy a ticket.

92
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:55,781
Listen, I'm expecting Monkey Harris
to come round in the morning.

93
00:07:55,816 --> 00:08:01,009
He's expecting a load of them Italian shirts from Malaya
the end of the month. Tell him I'm not interested.

94
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,330
But you are?

95
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:06,322
I know that. But don't let him know that.
Otherwise he'll expect a fair price, won't he, eh?

96
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,711
I'll get it.

97
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,759
What's that, another competition?

98
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,885
- Yeah. Don't worry, I'll win this one.
- What have you got to do?

99
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,225
I dunno yet.

100
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:21,038
Oi, it's Albert's old bird.

101
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:26,701
Uncle, your date is ere.
What an old dragon!

102
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,709
You saucy git, that's Petula!

103
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:03,287
- Right, there you go, love.
- Thanks.

104
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:12,348
Oh sorry, Cass, I've sort of...
lost me appetite a bit.

105
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:17,306
- Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing. I was just sitting here thinking about us.

106
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:22,828
- And it's put you off your food! Thanks, Rodney.
- No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

107
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,729
- We're pretty close, wouldn't you say?
- Sorry.

108
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,980
I didn't mean it like that.
I mean, we get on really well.

109
00:09:36,362 --> 00:09:41,998
- We have our moments.
- Well, it's them moments that's worrying me.

110
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:47,353
You see, I've got a bit of a dilemma.
I think maybe I ought to discuss it.

111
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:54,736
- Fire away.
- Well, look, we're both responsible, mature adults.

112
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:55,952
Yeah.

113
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,792
Oh that's it, forget it!

114
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:08,898
Bloody fair, eh? A young feller like Rodney
stops off to have dinner with a bird …

115
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:13,506
- …and leaves the carrying to an old chap like me.
- They've got no respect these days.

116
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,838
- They've got no respect these days.
- You fought in a war, didn't you?

117
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:19,781
I fought in a war, didn't I?

118
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:24,048
I fought so that kids like Rodney could have freedom.
And what do they do with their freedom?

119
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,672
- Anything they bloody like!
- Anything they bloody like!

120
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,767
Unpack that box and put some of them
shirts in the suitcase, will you?

121
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:33,678
- Oi, is that for me?
- No, it's addressed to Rodney.

122
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:40,634
Oh well, same thing. Let's see what he's been
gettin' through the post. Now then...

123
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:44,262
'Dear Rodney Trotter, thank you for your contribution
to bla bla... We are pleased to tell you...

124
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,109
Well, stone me!

125
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:50,204
- What's wrong?
- Well, d'you remember that competition I sent off?

126
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,218
- You've sent off hundreds of 'em!
- The Mega Cornflakes competition.

127
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,366
Yeah. What about it?

128
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:58,456
Well, what they wanted you to do,
you had to draw or paint a world-famous land-mark, right?

129
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:03,710
Well, world-famous landmarks are not my speciality;
I'm more of a portrait man meself.

130
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:09,428
So, just for a laugh, I sent off the old 'Marble Arch at Dawn'
in Rodney's name, and guess what?

131
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:12,955
- He's only won!
- You're pulling my leg!

132
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,133
No, no, look, straight up!
Have a butcher's at that, look.

133
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:21,366
They're giving away ten top prizes of a week's holiday
in the Mediterranean and Rodney's copped for one!

134
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,358
I always said that was a good painting, didn't I?

135
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:26,294
I mean, it's the realism, you see,
that's always been Rodney's strength.

136
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:30,542
I'm well pleased for the boy.
He's never won anything in his life.

137
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:37,120
No, only a couple of 'Ugly Bird' contests when he was younger.
And look where they're sending him - Mallorca!

138
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:45,951
'A luxury suite in a five-star hotel, a la carte menu
and a week's spending money for the winners and their guests.'

139
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:50,458
Their guests! Their guests!
Of course it's always been a holiday for two, innit?

140
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:54,858
I could do with a break!
Of yes, a bit of sunshine'll set me up a treat.

141
00:11:54,893 --> 00:11:57,791
- That's strange!
- What is?

142
00:11:58,011 --> 00:12:01,480
- Have you read page two?
- Well no, not yet.

143
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:09,898
- Well, I think you'd better.
- Oh no! I don't believe these wallies!

144
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:15,215
You know me, son, I never interfere.
But I think it's only right to tell the boy.

145
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,239
Yes, what we have here, Uncle,
is a case of je ne sais pas pourquoi.

146
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:24,269
- What's that mean?
- Well, roughly translated it means…

147
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:29,459
'He who sticks his nose into a beehive
will get more than a nostril full of honey!'

148
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:32,596
- Do I make myself clear?
- I'm saying nothing, son.

149
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,265
Cushty.

150
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:39,966
- I suppose I'd be better be getting off.
- What are you and Del up to today?

151
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:45,714
He's picking up a gross of Italian shirts off Monkey Harris
and I'm down the market selling kiddies' dolls.

152
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:49,299
- I won't always be doing this.
- Doing what?

153
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:56,051
Well, selling crap down markets. I'll get my diploma
in computer science soon. Then things will change.

154
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,714
You don't have to prove anything to me,
you know Rodney?

155
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:01,463
Well, you've got a good job
in a bank, ain't yer?

156
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:06,597
Your dad's a successful businessman and me,
well, I'm an apprentice fly-pitcher!

157
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:12,612
I mean, let's be fair, Cass, a girl like you,
she could marry some really rich good-looking bloke.

158
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,857
If I was to meet a handsome, wealthy young man
and he asked me to marry him, d'you know what I'd say?

159
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:18,778
What?

160
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:23,381
I'd say, "Ciao, Rodney!" And you wouldn't see me
through the tinted windows on his Porsche.

161
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:34,359
- But until that time I'm happy to drag along with you.
- So you're not just saying that?

162
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,084
No, honestly.

163
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,533
And there's me fretting, eh?

164
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:45,390
I've been going out with you longer
than I went out with any of my other boyfriends.

165
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:48,605
- And do you know why?
- 'Cos they all packed you in?

166
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:59,197
- Right! And because I love you.
- Oh! Well, I love you too, Cass.

167
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,627
What a load of old cobblers!

168
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:08,867
- It makes you wanna throw up!
- Why do you always come to this pub?

169
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,692
It's the atmosphere, I suppose.

170
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:15,037
- Rodders!
- Yeah, on me way now, Del.

171
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:18,161
Michael, a bottle of your
best champagne please!

172
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:28,914
Have I got news for you, bruv.
You, Rodney Trotter, have only won a competition!

173
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,499
- Alright, what is it, a wind-up?
- No, no, this is God's-honest.

174
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,552
Look, there it is, in black and white.
What can't speak can't lie! Look at that, look at that!

175
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:44,412
I don't believe this is
happening to me! Bloody 'ell!

176
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,895
- Oh sorry!
- That's alright. Where's the other page?

177
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:53,100
- Well, it says: 'please turn to page two'.
- Ah, yes, that's alright, no... I've left that at the flat.

178
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:57,225
- It's not a mistake?
- No, it's all pukka and above all I just phoned them up!

179
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,382
They're expecting to see you
in Mallorca!

180
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,416
They wanna take publicity photographs
and everything.

181
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,237
You're gonna be on the back
of millions of cornflake packets!

182
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:07,408
- Am I?
- Yeah, you and the 9 other winners, yeah.

183
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:13,199
A Mediterranean holiday, eh?
I've never won anything before in my life, have I?

184
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:16,570
No, apart from them 'Ugly Bird' comp...
No, he's never won anything in his life.

185
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:21,586
You clever old thing!
I didn't even know you'd been in for a competition.

186
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:28,336
Well, no, it was...
Del, I never went in for this competition!

187
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,515
No, no, I did it for you.
It was a painting competition, you see,

188
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,974
so I sent of the old 'Marble Arch at Dawn',
and it's come up trumps!

189
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:38,037
What did the other page say?

190
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:41,492
It's all that sightseeing
and excursions and all that sort of thing.

191
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,860
'Ere listen, I'll get the champers, alright?

192
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,979
A holiday in Mallorca, eh?

193
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,220
Will you miss me?

194
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:57,375
Bound to. But I expect I'll find something to
replace the excitement of your presence - you know,

195
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,720
- …knitting, something like that.
- Can you get a week off work?

196
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:03,247
- Yeah, I'm owed some holidays.
- Right! What about your parents?

197
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,340
I thought it was only a
holiday for two.

198
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:10,073
You know what I mean. How are they gonna feel
about you coming on holiday with me?

199
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:19,020
- Rodney, my parents like you, they trust you.
- Do they? I'm not sure I like that.

200
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,121
Here we go. There we go.

201
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:25,321
I'll tell you what, Rodders, we'll be having champagne
for breakfast every morning when we get to Mallorca.

202
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:30,594
And all down to Larkin.
I'll tell you what. I just can't wait to get there.

203
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,284
Er... well, thing is, Del.

204
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:36,959
Come on, drink up, 'ere come
one. Cheers! Celebrate!

205
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:41,669
Cheers. It's just that, you now, this holiday is for two,
and I... I was thinking...

206
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:45,439
No, no, no. It's not for two!
It's for three. For nothing!

207
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,958
- Three?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:48,993 --> 00:16:49,843
You sure?

209
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:55,044
'Course I'm sure. I read it...it was on the second
page that I tre...I left in the flat.

210
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:57,710
Three's a funny number, innit?

211
00:16:57,745 --> 00:17:00,791
Oh yeah, three's very funny.
Always has me in stitches, this three.

212
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,350
What I mean is, these things are usually
done in twos, ain't they?

213
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:07,752
I mean, you see it on the telly, don't you

214
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:13,727
Bob's Full House, The Price Is Right and all that
game - a holiday for two! So why's this one for three?

215
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:16,926
I don't know. You get on the blower
to the Cornflakes people, ask them!

216
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,858
Maybe it's 'cos it's Mega Flakes. You know?
They do everything bigger.

217
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:23,906
There you are, see, she's cracked it.
I'll tell you what this means, Rodney.

218
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,887
It means that Cassandra can come with us, eh?

219
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,538
- Yeah, hadn't thought of that.
- Thank you. Love to.

220
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:34,763
Yeah well, what is it eh?
Just - what three weeks to the off?

221
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:43,213
Just enough time to get us some new clothes.
You get your bikini-line sorted out, and then we're off!

222
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:48,136
- Lovely Jubbly!
- Yeah great! Three people?

223
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:52,466
Yes, three, Rodney, just three, three.
Just don't keep on about it, alright?

224
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:55,315
- Excuse me.
- Oh right.

225
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:02,117
- Look. I'll see you later, OK? Take care.
- I'm just going to the ladies.

226
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,117
Sorry! I thought you was going...

227
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,234
You wally!

228
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:26,024
Shut up. Look, I’m glad she's gone,
I want to have a little chat with ya, you know?

229
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:31,719
- I've got a bit of a problem. Well, it's more of a worry.
- What? Is it about the holiday?

230
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:36,126
Well, yeah, sort of.
Holiday's heightened my concern, you know?

231
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,532
Made the problem a little
more urgent sort of thing.

232
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,758
- What is it, then Rodders?
- Well, it's...

233
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:56,298
- What, Ford Escorts?
- Eh? No...

234
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:13,320
Oh I see bruv. You don't have to worry;
they're not really that size in real life.

235
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:23,086
I know that! God... I know they're not that...
bloody 'ell!

236
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:29,557
What I mean is, me and Cassy,
are getting closer all the time, you know?

237
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:34,831
- Well, I mean, we haven't done nothing yet.
- No? I thought you was on the firm with it.

238
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,133
No, no, no, it's nothing like that.

239
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:42,284
But you, wee you know let's face it, with the best
of intentions these things can get beyond our control.

240
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:49,520
- Yeah. It's way beyond mine bruv.
- Exactly. So I feel that in this day and age…

241
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:55,075
…what with what's happening in the world,
it is every responsible adult's duty to, well...

242
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:59,106
- Go equipped?
- Well yeah, if you like.

243
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:03,889
Yeah, well, no... that's very wise and mature of you,
Rodders, that is. So what's the problem?

244
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:10,306
- Well I... I keep going to buy 'em...
- Yeah, go on...

245
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:14,527
Well, there's a sort of stigma
attached to 'em.

246
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:21,145
No, that's just a piece of silver foil.
You chuck that away.

247
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,804
I don't know why I ever
involved you in this.

248
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:37,346
I mean, well... in this day of AIDS and all
the warnings on the telly and in the press and all that,

249
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,930
people are still embarrassed to go and buy 'em.

250
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:44,159
I mean, me, I seem to think that it's
only seedy little blokes do it.

251
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:47,776
Will you get 'em for me?

252
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,834
On your bike! Get 'em yourself!

253
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:58,994
Come on. I mean, I keep going to get them
but every time I go into the shop

254
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:03,681
it's either a lady serving me or me bottle goes!
Look at this.

255
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:08,585
This morning I bought four combs,
a tub of Vick and a film for a Kodak Instamatic!

256
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:12,015
Yeah, but they sell them
everywhere these days.

257
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:18,530
You can get 'em in the... in the butcher's, the bike shop,
in Patel's Multimart - they're by the phonecard counter.

258
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:22,538
They even had a machine in here
you could get 'em in once.

259
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,831
You know, except it got jammed with a Drachma.

260
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:28,853
Does Cassandra know about this,
have you discussed it with her?

261
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:32,660
Well, of course I haven't! What d'you think I...?
She's coming back!

262
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:37,519
Alright? Want some more
champagne?

263
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:40,162
No, I've got to get back to work in a minute.
I'll stick with the fruit juice.

264
00:21:40,197 --> 00:21:42,520
I'll get you some,
I'll get you one.

265
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:50,372
Cass. What I was saying earlier
about our blossoming relationship.

266
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:57,454
- What about it?
- Well, when one is in a situation like ours - one...

267
00:21:57,489 --> 00:22:03,435
- Or in our case, two.
- Or in our case two. Should be careful.

268
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:08,468
- Careful of what?
- That we don't become three!

269
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,961
Oh! I see what you mean!

270
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,965
Yeah... I do hope you don't think
I'm being a bit presuming.

271
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,233
I just thought, well, we are going
on holiday together and, you know,

272
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:25,101
in that atmosphere of sunshine and freedom and,
well, sharing the same hotel suite,

273
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:32,513
our relationship could - well, who knows? –
ascend to a more physical plane.

274
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:37,988
- Yes, I suppose so.
- Yeah?

275
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,635
Well, who knows what might happen?
You haven't been discussing this with Del, have you?

276
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,839
- Well... no, course I haven't, no. What d'you think I am?
- Good.

277
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,008
Oi, Rodders! You're in luck.
Mike's had a new machine fitted in the gents.

278
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,931
I'll get you some change, Rodney.

279
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:25,149
Alright. Well.
Where are they then?

280
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,981
- Well the courier said, meet at the desk.
- There it is.

281
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:32,558
Right! Pour the sangria, Jose,
we have arrived!

282
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:34,838
Just a minute, hang on.

283
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:43,348
Listen, just before you go and check in…
this prize ain't quite as straight-forward as it seems.

284
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:44,982
Rodney did win, didn't he?

285
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:48,768
Oh yes, yes, yes. Oh yeah, well,
it's all pukka and above board and all that.

286
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,121
I mean, we're here, ain't we?
We've got all the tickets and everything, yeah.

287
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,369
So what's the problem?

288
00:23:53,404 --> 00:23:55,422
- That's strange, you know.
- What?

289
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:59,116
Well, I noticed it on the plane
but it didn't sort of register.

290
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:03,057
They're all mums and dads.
They've all brought their kids with 'em.

291
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:04,935
What's strange about that?

292
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:09,213
Well, except for me, right,
all the winners are parents.

293
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:14,101
No, it's not the parents that are the winners,
Rodney. It's the kids.

294
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:16,449
What do you mean?

295
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:23,700
Well, Rodney's painting won first prize
– in an under-15-year-old category.

296
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,415
- Say it again!
- So they think Rodney's 15?

297
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:36,021
- Is that right?
- No. They think you're 14.

298
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:40,458
Fourteen? They think I'm 14?

299
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:44,219
Why didn't you tell me this
back in England?

300
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:48,083
Well, I thought it might cast
a little cloud over the holiday.

301
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:53,581
Look, Rodney, I sent your painting off in good faith.
I mean, I didn't know there were lots of categories.

302
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:58,163
But it was you - not me - you were the one
that wrote on it 'Rodney Trotter, aged 14 and a half.

303
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:03,489
So the organizers must have put you in the kid's category.
So it's your fault that you wrote on it.

304
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:09,301
But how was I to know that in 12 years' time
you were going to enter it for a cornflakes competition?

305
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:14,703
Well, how was I supposed to know that you'd win, eh?
'Ere, it doesn't matter.

306
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,871
Now, come on, come on,
you're gonna waltz through it.

307
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,713
Waltz through it! How the
'ell am I gonna pass for 14?

308
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:24,478
- Will you stop doing that, Cassandra?
- Sorry.

309
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,597
Act your age.

310
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,235
This is your fault. I'm gonna
break your bloody neck!

311
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:37,153
Just look, just look over there look.
Some of those lads, look, they're over six foot tall.

312
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:41,593
15- and 16-year-olds,
they look much older these days than they used to.

313
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:44,514
And you've got the added advantage
of your boyish good looks.

314
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,784
That's why there was three tickets, innit?
One each for Mummy and Daddy and one for the sprog.

315
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:54,071
Well, you can't expect 13- and 14-year-olds
to go abroad on their own, can you?

316
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:57,956
And what exactly is your role
in all this?

317
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:04,769
Well, when the cornflakes people phoned up
they said that you had to be accompanied by your parents.

318
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:11,458
So I said - and I don't know why I did it,
I must have been flustered at the time…

319
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:18,169
- I said that I was your dad.
- My dad! Did you hear that, Cassandra?

320
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:23,463
And who the hell am
I supposed to be? His mum?

321
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:26,328
God, please tell me this is
a bad dream!

322
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,311
Pretend, Cassandra,
you're only pretending aren't ya?

323
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:33,439
I mean you don't have to check behind his ears
or pick him up from school, or nothing like that, have ya?

324
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:37,036
- I think we should go and tell them the truth
- Just a minute, dopey, just a minute!

325
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,718
We're here, now, aren't we?

326
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:42,079
If we all keep schtum
we can have a lovely free holiday.

327
00:26:42,114 --> 00:26:45,469
But if they find out we're lying
they'll chuck us out the hotel.

328
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:48,966
And if they find out we're telling them the truth,
they'll chuck us out of the hotel.

329
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,354
Now return flights are not for another week,
so what we gonna do?

330
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:54,465
They'll probably stick us
in one of those Spanish half-way homes.

331
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:58,509
Del, at some point
they are gonna realise I am not 14.

332
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:01,066
Yeah, but we'll be back in
the hotel by then, won't we?

333
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:05,627
There'll be nobody there to ask questions?
Come on, we're on holiday, eh?

334
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:09,183
Well, whatever else it turns
out to be, it's an experience.

335
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:12,998
Good girl, good girl, that's right.
You know it makes sense, don't yer?

336
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:17,392
That's it now come on, then, come on,
let's get over there and check in, come on.

337
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:22,104
- Don't forget to act a bit mumsy, alright?
- What d'you mean, mumsy?

338
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:25,063
I don't know,
just a bit mumsy. Come on.

339
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:29,501
We'll be leaving in about
five minutes, OK?

340
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:33,091
It's only a half-hour journey to the hotel,
so we should be there in plenty of time for lunch.

341
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:37,194
- Sorry, the Trotter family.
- Oh, Mr Trotter, good. We've been waiting for you.

342
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:41,212
Alan Perkins. Pleased to meet you both.
Right, here are your rosettes...

343
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:47,295
Mrs Trotter, Mr Trotter,
and this one's for young Rod...

344
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,617
He's a big lad, isn't he?

345
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:56,209
Yes, his late mother was a very tall woman.
Six foot three.

346
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:57,592
- Really?
- Oh yes.

347
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:01,148
Extraordinary. Oh well,
here's your badge, Rodney.

348
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:04,056
You are now a life member of
the Groovy Gang.

349
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:09,238
- The what?
- The Groovy Gang.

350
00:28:09,452 --> 00:28:12,683
It's just an idea we came up with
to help the kids feel really part of it.

351
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:18,153
Every time one of the organizers says,
'Are you having fun?' all you kids shout, 'Groovy'.

352
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,995
Well, don't worry, don't worry.
He'll soon get the hang of it.

353
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:30,703
- Yes, fine. Well, we'll be off in a moment.
- Yes thank you.

354
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:33,628
I don't believe this is
happening to me!

355
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:40,589
We'll be on the coach in a minute, be at the hotel
in half an hour and then you're free to do what you want.

356
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:42,614
Nice, and easy bruv, nice and easy.

357
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:47,908
- OK! All the members of the Groovy Gang over here.
- Oh no!

358
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:54,828
We're all going to the hotel on the Fun Bus.
Not with all the old fogies.

359
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:57,625
Old fogies! That's sauce, eh?

360
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:02,011
- You're enjoying this, ain't yer?
- I'm just playing along with them.

361
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:06,016
Mums and dads, if you'd like to follow me,
the coach is just outside.

362
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:08,911
We've laid on a little welcoming reception
back at the hotel.

363
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,322
I'm sure that none of you would object
to a glass or three of sangria.

364
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:17,336
That's lovely, Alan. Go on, then,
Rodney, go on, off you go.

365
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:21,084
You're going with the Groovy Gang!

366
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:23,274
I don't want to be with the
sodding Groovy Gang!

367
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,230
- Come on, Rodney, don't let us down now!
- They're looking over here.

368
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:34,537
- I'm still waiting for a... Rodney Trotter.
- Over here, sweetheart! Here he is.

369
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,732
Come on, Rodney don't be...

370
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:39,142
Hurry up, Rodney!

371
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,513
- I'm not going.
- Is he not a good mixer?

372
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,668
A good mixer?
He's like a Kenwood Chef when he gets going.

373
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,478
Come on, Rodney don't be shy.
You'll soon make friends.

374
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:55,156
We're all gong out for a jumbo hamburger
and double French fries.

375
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,216
- That's his favourite.
- Don't get any ketchup down your shirt.

376
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,581
Et tu, Cassandra?

377
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:05,996
We'll see you back at the
hotel, then, Rodders, alright?

378
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,057
Come on then,
come on darling.

379
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:11,198
Don't push your luck, Derek.

380
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,396
- Do you like Bros?
- No.

381
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:31,728
- All together, are you having fun?
- Groovy!

382
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,556
That's better. Let's go.

383
00:30:33,636 --> 00:30:37,818
"Here we go, here we go,
here we go..."

384
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:03,676
Alright?

385
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:10,875
It's really nice here. I've just been down to reception
I've bought us some Spanish state lottery tickets.

386
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:15,634
I filled one in for you and everything.
I bought some for you and some for Rodney...

387
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,776
...and there's some for me.
I'll put yours here, there you go.

388
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:22,325
Never know your luck eh?
We're on a winning roll, ain't we?

389
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:24,371
Tell that to poor Rodney.

390
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:28,241
Oh look, don't keep going on about it.
You're gonna spoil the holiday, you are!

391
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:32,108
Listen, have you had a look round?
What's here? Oh that's very nice.

392
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:35,749
That must be Rodney's room.
It's got a picture of Prince on the wall.

393
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:39,363
If that's Rodney's room,
where am I supposed to sleep?

394
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,954
Well I thought that you and Rodney...
No, maybe not.

395
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,936
I'll sleep in there.
You and Rodney can have the honey-moon bed.

396
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,772
Alright, alright, anything you say,
sweetheart, anything you say.

397
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:54,390
I just thought it might be a bit
strange when the old maid comes in.

398
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:57,043
You know, see me and old Rodney
tucked up on the king-size.

399
00:31:57,721 --> 00:32:01,586
It would look even stranger if she found Rodney
sleeping with his step-mother!

400
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:06,854
I never thought of that.
I'd better go and cancel breakfast in bed.

401
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,157
Do you want me to take that picture
of Prince down off the wall?

402
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:13,498
Just leave it, Derek.
You've done enough for Rodney and I as it is.

403
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:18,341
Oh look, I thought the cornflakes people
would leave us alone to enjoy our holiday.

404
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:22,087
I didn't know they were going to conscript
Rodney into the Groovy Gang.

405
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:23,690
I mean, why would they do that?

406
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:28,704
Mr Perkins explained it to us. It's so the youngsters
won't get bored and parents can have a rest.

407
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,724
I won't see him all week, will I?

408
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,437
Yes, of course you will. He's
bound to get a spot of leave.

409
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:41,782
Look, there he is! There they all go now.
Hey, Rodney, don't go mad!

410
00:32:43,766 --> 00:32:45,772
They just went down over that hill there.

411
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:49,353
- That was quick, wasn't it?
- They were on skateboards.

412
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:54,000
Rodney was the leader, he was right out in front.
Leader of the pack.

413
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,776
Oh my God!

414
00:32:57,728 --> 00:32:59,738
- May I come in?
- Yes, come in.

415
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,629
Hello, Mrs Trotter.

416
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:06,471
- Good afternoon, Carmen.
- Is Rodney here?

417
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:11,028
- No, he's not here at the moment.
- Oh he's still out enjoying himself.

418
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:15,706
Well, it's just to let him know
about the junior disco on Wednesday night.

419
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:19,184
But I'll come back later and see him then.
Bye for now.

420
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,801
- Did you hear that?
- Rodney likes a little dance.

421
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,676
- It's a junior disco.
- Well, alright, we'll say he's ill.

422
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:31,056
- Oh what, more lies?
- No, that'll be the truth!

423
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:34,045
When we tell him,
he's bound to be a bit Tom and Dick.

424
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:38,944
Listen, I'm gonna have a wash then we go down
and get something to eat, alright?

425
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:40,822
But what about Rodney?

426
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:43,801
Oh that's alright. We'll pick
him up down there somewhere.

427
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:48,607
- Yes, just look for the nearest sandpit.
- Vey funny.

428
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:10,155
- What have you been doing?
- I've been skateboarding, Cassandra.

429
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:12,393
Oh I see.

430
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,763
- Where's Del?
- He's having a wash.

431
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,248
- Derek?
- Is that you, Rodders?

432
00:34:25,283 --> 00:34:30,736
Yes, I'm back. Could you come out, please.
I'd like a word with you.

433
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:32,753
Won't be long, bruv.

434
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:37,488
- No, could you come out now?
- No, I've got me pants off, Rodney!

435
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,083
- Well, it's quite urgent, Del.
- Alright. Give us five minutes, I'll be with you.

436
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:47,082
- Sorry about the bad language, Cassandra.
- What bad language?

437
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:50,488
Get out here now, you dipstick!
I'm going to kill you!

438
00:34:52,908 --> 00:34:55,641
- What's up with you?
- I'll tell you what's up with me...

439
00:34:55,676 --> 00:35:01,485
Thanks to you I am now a 26-year-old man
who just came second in a skateboard derby!

440
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:05,722
Second? You were in the lead
when I saw you!

441
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:12,332
- I fell off!
- I told you not to go mad.

442
00:35:14,343 --> 00:35:19,432
I also have a 13-year-old Bros fan
called Trudie who's got the hots for me.

443
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:25,114
And tomorrow I start the first of three
cycling proficiency lessons and I'm gonna kill you!

444
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,915
- Calm down, Rodney! You're acting like a big kid.
- Git!

445
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:32,960
I'm not coming out 'til
you've simmered down a bit.

446
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:41,048
Well, I'll wait. I don't care if it takes all bloody week.
I'm gonna get you, Derek Trotter, I'm gonna get you!

447
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:51,584
- Have you seen the view?
- No!

448
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:08,214
- Would you like a drink?
- Strychnine, please.

449
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,190
Ice and lemon?

450
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:22,213
- That's where I come off. Poxy lizard!
- Shall I clean it up for you?

451
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:25,226
- No.
- It could turn septic.

452
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,867
Good.

453
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:35,465
- Is that Trudie waving at you?
- Yeah.

454
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,102
- You calmed down yet?
- Git!

455
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,659
Veinites, alright veinites.

456
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:07,803
Rodney, do you think if I knew this was
gonna happen that I would allow us to come over here?

457
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:09,827
Well, of course you would!

458
00:37:09,862 --> 00:37:13,581
'Cos you don't give a toss about anybody else
as long as you're having a good time.

459
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:21,451
Oh, that hurts, Rodney! No, that hurts!
That's like a knife going right through my heart, that.

460
00:37:21,664 --> 00:37:24,130
I may be many things but I'm not selfish.

461
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,311
Cheers, darling, thank you
very much.

462
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:31,940
Anyway, they probably fixed up all the
entertainments today to make you feel at home.

463
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:38,059
- Most probably the rest of the week is your own.
- Oh no. I was given the full itinerary.

464
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:43,846
Tomorrow after my cycling lesson,
we're off to the splash 'n' slide.

465
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:47,332
Then Wednesday in the morning
we're going go-karting.

466
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:50,850
Then in the afternoon
we have a ping-pong championship.

467
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:57,355
Then on Thursday me and the rest of the
Groovy Gang are out all day painting Palma Cathedral.

468
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:04,030
- What, in matt or vinyl?
- You're enjoying every bloody minute of this, ain't you?

469
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:08,035
No, I'm not, I'm not. I'm just trying
to lighten the atmosphere.

470
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,006
Honestly if you keep up this mood
you're going to ruin this holiday for us.

471
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,122
- Listen to me, you git.
- Arguing's not going to help!

472
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,895
That was you, innit? I bet you told him
about the junior disco, didn't ya?

473
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,680
- Junior disco?
- I didn't say a word.

474
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:24,153
I ain't going to a junior disco!

475
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:28,910
It's alright, Rodney, it's alright, you don't have to.
Me and your stepmum have sorted it all out.

476
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:30,669
We're gonna say you've got gutache!

477
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,557
- Oh no, don't say I'm ill!
- Why not?

478
00:38:32,592 --> 00:38:35,245
They've got a great fat nurse
to look after us!

479
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:38,798
But you like a bit of uniform,
don't you eh?

480
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:44,331
Yeah, but you want to see her.
She'd have to go on a diet to get into the Roly-Polys!

481
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:53,076
God, what a choice eh? I can either have all day
with Trudie in me earhole going on about Matt and Luke

482
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:55,999
or I can have a belly-rub
by Sister George!

483
00:38:56,034 --> 00:39:00,280
- Tricky one, bruv!
- You are enjoying this, ain't you?

484
00:39:00,315 --> 00:39:02,294
No, I'm not!

485
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:05,191
You're deliberately saying
things to annoy Rodney, aren't you?

486
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:11,208
Alright, I won't say another word! I'm just
gonna go out and have a walk around the town, alright?

487
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:23,810
- I didn't know you liked uniforms...
- No, no, it's just him mucking about.

488
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:31,136
- Is Rodney back yet?
- Come in. I'll give him a shout.

489
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:34,463
Rodney, the Arkela is here!

490
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:49,693
We just thought we'd take the opportunity
to check your passports.

491
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,004
What d'you want to check
our passports for?

492
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:54,714
It's simply Spanish regulations.

493
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:56,625
Immigration laws. I'm sure
you understand.

494
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,684
Do you know where our passports are, dear?

495
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:00,797
Oh yes. I'll just get them.

496
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,548
- My date of birth's on my passport.
- It's alright, don't worry, I doctored it.

497
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:10,747
Oh thank... You've done what?

498
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:14,520
It's alright it was only written in biro so I altered
the last two numbers

499
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:17,194
to make it look as though you were
born in 1975. Right?

500
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,243
- I don't believe...
- Here they are.

501
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:43,816
Well, everything seems to be
in order. Sorry to have bothered you.

502
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:48,490
Rodney, don't forget
about the junior disco on Wednesday night.

503
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:54,185
We start at 7:30. It's great fun.
We have break-dancing and spot prizes.

504
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,735
Smashing.

505
00:41:08,955 --> 00:41:11,616
Listen, I reckon we ought to keep
our heads down for a while, alright?

506
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,221
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll order some room service for us.

507
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:19,400
I mean, we're alright now,
ain't we?

508
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:27,288
Why don't you go out for a little while? You know you
look like you could do with a bit of fresh air.

509
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,358
I do feel,
a bit claustrophobic!

510
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:41,732
Well... I'll leave you two
alone, then, shall I?

511
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:52,345
Oh, Rodney?

512
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,487
They're in my flight bag!

513
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:13,548
Listen, you two better go.
I'll see you later, alright?

514
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,288
Alright?

515
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:27,432
No! I thought Rodney and I
would be spending a romantic week together.

516
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,812
That's charming, isn't it?
He'll lose Brownie points for that one.

517
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:42,951
Still seems to be enjoying himself, don't he?

518
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:46,779
Rodney's not enjoying himself!
Last night he cried.

519
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,411
Why do you think he's carrying on
with this pretence, eh?

520
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:53,314
Certainly ain't doing it for me, 'cos if me and
Rodders had been ere on our own

521
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:56,058
we'd have been out on that street
ten minutes after landing!

522
00:42:57,072 --> 00:42:58,938
He's only doing this for you, sweetheart.

523
00:42:58,973 --> 00:43:00,177
Really?

524
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:04,859
Would I lie to you? He only wants
to see you having a good time.

525
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:08,601
He wants to see you enjoying the sunshine.
He's only trying to make you happy.

526
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:12,980
So the least you can do is put on a smile,
and show that his sacrifices have not been in vain.

527
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,371
I didn't realize.

528
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:18,772
Well there you are. Didn't want to tell you but,
you know, you forced me hand.

529
00:43:19,841 --> 00:43:21,174
Oh, here he is.

530
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,335
I'll be back in a minute!

531
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,790
Having fun?

532
00:43:28,825 --> 00:43:32,820
Groovy! Ah, you didn't get
me a drink then?

533
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:34,433
Well, not to worry, I'll
get my own.

534
00:43:34,468 --> 00:43:36,066
Don't get stroppy
about it.

535
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,577
Can I have a large Bacardi
and coke, please?

536
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:41,637
And an orange cordial with
ice and a straw, please.

537
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:47,031
Del, I'm gonna tell them the truth. I don't care
if they do chuck us on the street, I just don't care.

538
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:50,580
That's alright. Go on, go on.
You just think of number 1.

539
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:55,569
What about that poor one, eh?
She's having the time of her life on this holiday.

540
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:59,895
- You are not talking about Cassandra?
- Yes, we are. She just told me.

541
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:05,928
But last night she told me she hated it!
She said she'd rather be self-catering in Beirut!

542
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:11,223
She's only doing that for you. 'Cos she thinks you got
the 'ump because you had to go

543
00:44:11,258 --> 00:44:14,657
into these ping-pong
championships and hamburger-eating contests.

544
00:44:14,692 --> 00:44:19,560
She's only backing you up. But secretly
she's really enjoying herself.

545
00:44:20,062 --> 00:44:21,911
Go on, you go and ask her.

546
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:23,351
I didn't know that.

547
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:26,451
No, well I didn't want to tell you but,
you know, you forced it out of me.

548
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,201
You come and ask her then.

549
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,902
So, you enjoying yourself?

550
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:42,911
Yeah, I'm having a great time. You?

551
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:51,834
Yeah, cosmic. I wish we were staying here
for a fortnight. You enjoying yourself, Del?

552
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:54,336
Not bad I suppose.

553
00:44:56,183 --> 00:45:01,505
I'll be with you in a minute sweetheart!
Promised to take them two girls to a nightclub.

554
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:05,786
I may be back late.

555
00:45:09,161 --> 00:45:13,504
Rodney. It's the finals
of the break-dancing championship.

556
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:16,441
- God!
- D'you fancy watching?

557
00:45:16,476 --> 00:45:19,263
Watching? I'm in it!

558
00:45:28,063 --> 00:45:32,507
John! Juan. Can I have a pina
colada with ice and Alka Seltzer?

559
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,664
- Where have you been?
- Sorry, dear. I have been out all night.

560
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,593
You know you said we was on a
winning roll?

561
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:43,004
- It weren't a roll, my son, it was a bloody avalanche!
- I'm not with you Rodney.

562
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,204
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

563
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,658
- What are you going on about Rodders?
- We've won.

564
00:45:46,669 --> 00:45:48,361
- What, the break-dancing contest?
- No!

565
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:50,374
You know those Spanish lottery tickets
you bought?

566
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:51,741
We've won!

567
00:45:51,776 --> 00:45:54,055
- You're winding me up!
- No, No, look.

568
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:59,203
Carmen gave us this paper to swat the flies with. Cassy
did Spanish at school and she noticed the result. Look.

569
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,876
- Bloody hell!
- It's a million pesetas, Derek!

570
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:08,452
A million? You know what this
means, don't you Rodney?

571
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:10,959
We're millionaires!
What have I always said over the years?

572
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:11,881
You've always said it!

573
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:14,782
- Yes, this time next year...
- We'll be millionaires!

574
00:46:14,817 --> 00:46:16,397
But it's only a million
pesetas.

575
00:46:16,432 --> 00:46:17,559
Only!

576
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:21,879
I don't care if it's pesetas, potatoes or
Hungarian luncheon vouchers! We're rich!

577
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:25,636
"If I was a rich man..."

578
00:46:30,866 --> 00:46:34,364
- Hold on, hold on! Ah, we're in Spain!
- I know.

579
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:36,614
- Yeah, but we're foreigners!
- So?

580
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:41,392
Well, there might be some, some Spanish law saying
foreigners can't pick up Spanish kitties!

581
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:44,004
Then why did the man sell you
the tickets if he knew you couldn't win?

582
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,237
Maybe 'cause he wanted to make more commission,
didn't he?

583
00:46:46,272 --> 00:46:49,149
Oh no! Come on, Del, not even
you would...

584
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:51,445
My God, they've got a rule!

585
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:53,036
I just know they've got a rule!

586
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,029
Oh, there you are! I've
been looking for you everywhere!

587
00:46:55,064 --> 00:46:57,756
I've just heard the
marvelous news. Congratulations!

588
00:46:58,808 --> 00:47:01,721
Just do us a favour. You just have to
double-check that for us, will ya?

589
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:05,803
No doubt this is the winning ticket.

590
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,500
If you like I'll ring the regional office of the lottery
organizers and stake your claim.

591
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,419
We were worried
because we were foreigners, you see.

592
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,321
How do you mean?

593
00:47:13,356 --> 00:47:15,959
Is there a rule that
says non-nationals aren't allowed to win the lottery?

594
00:47:15,994 --> 00:47:19,050
I don't believe so. We sell
tickets here in reception to guests from all over Europe.

595
00:47:19,085 --> 00:47:20,466
Can you check the rules for us?

596
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:23,665
They're on the back there somewhere.
They're all written in Spanish or something!

597
00:47:26,029 --> 00:47:28,856
It says, "Non-citizens of Spain must
present their passport

598
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:33,056
and any necessary visa documentation with their
winning ticket when making a claim".

599
00:47:33,091 --> 00:47:35,048
You've just won a
million pesetas!

600
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:41,387
Oh dear!

601
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,830
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

602
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:47,211
What's the matter, Alan?

603
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,901
I don't quite know how to break the news.

604
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:52,495
I'm afraid you can't claim a penny
of this money, Mr Trotter.

605
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:55,483
Hold on, we've got the winning ticket!

606
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,386
We've checked these numbers
a hundred times!

607
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:59,118
Yeah, you just double-checked it yourself,
haven't ya?

608
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:01,764
Yes, the numbers are correct.
It is the winning ticket, alright.

609
00:48:01,883 --> 00:48:03,821
The problem is it's got Rodney's name on it.

610
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:08,452
You see, under Spanish law
nobody under the age of 18 is allowed to gamble.

611
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:16,323
- But he is over 18. Here!
- I've seen his passport...

612
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:19,107
... it states quite clearly
he was born in 1974!

613
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:23,141
No, no. I can prove it.

614
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:26,258
Cause I got my student card on me,
it's got my date of birth on it!

615
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,687
- And it's got an official stamp on it!
- Yeah!

616
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:35,955
Look, listen, right!
Rodney Trotter, born 2nd of November 1974.

617
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,560
It's only money bruv, innit?

618
00:48:45,174 --> 00:48:47,649
God, look at the time,
do you remember, I just gotta go...

619
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:49,787
- No come here!
- I just gotta...

620
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:00,048
