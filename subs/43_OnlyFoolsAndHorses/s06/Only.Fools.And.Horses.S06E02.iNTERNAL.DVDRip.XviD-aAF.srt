1
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,795
This machine is gonna change
our lives.

2
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:46,819
Good.

3
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,642
This is top-of-the-range hitech.

4
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:50,792
You can see that by all them
lights.

5
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,389
I don't know how
we've managed so long without one.

6
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,960
Nor do I...What is it?

7
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,918
What...what is it? It's a
videotape recorder.

8
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:02,767
It's got a little computer and
everything.

9
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:06,333
When you go on your holidays this thing
will record all the programs for you.

10
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,437
- Amazing.
- Nothing but the best.

11
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:13,157
How does it know you're on
holiday?

12
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:21,080
You send it a postcard, don't ya?
You programme its little computer, you daft old...

13
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:24,000
No luck, eh?

14
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,734
That's alright uncle,
I'll get the hang of it.

15
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,672
When it comes to technological things
normally I'm a natural

16
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:32,697
I just got to get used to all its...er...its
functions and its modes.

17
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:35,869
I thought the bloke you
bought it from said an idiot could work it.

18
00:01:36,614 --> 00:01:39,205
Yes! Yes that's right.

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,705
Rodney! Come on, shake a
leg, it's gone six o'clock.

20
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,635
Yes, alright. Keep the noise
down, will you?

21
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:48,753
Cor blimey, look at the state of that.

22
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:51,452
I've seen blokes crawl out of potholes
looking smarter than that.

23
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:54,970
You got in late last night,
son. Out with that little bird of yours?

24
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:56,642
What's her
name - Cassandra?

25
00:01:56,677 --> 00:02:01,472
That's right. Cassandra and I
went to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.

26
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:04,419
Yeah? That takes me back.

27
00:02:04,454 --> 00:02:06,998
I used to go up there whenever
I was on home leave.

28
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,866
I saw some of the best there,
Rodney.

29
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:12,596
Here, here, you ever heard of
John Barbirolli?

30
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,058
Yes, course I have.

31
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,811
Sir John was one of the greats.

32
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:17,866
Yeah, Barbra and Ollie were
pretty good an' all.

33
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:25,085
I saw 'em all, Rodney. Adrian Boult,
Sir Malcom Sargent – wonderful times...

34
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,763
- Who'd you see?
- Eric Clapton.

35
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:34,340
Eric Clapton? He's a new one
on me. Del Boy's got a new video recorder.

36
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:39,381
Yeah, there was a very
interesting article in the paper the other day.

37
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,794
Did you know that Taiwan is the only country in the world
that don't have any rubbish dumps;

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,524
they just send it all
to him.

39
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:51,920
Oi, oi, oi. That's enough of that. This is none of yer
Taiwan junk. This was made in Formosa!

40
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,396
But Formosa is...

41
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:59,570
Albert, please don't confuse
the issue!

42
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:00,917
Is what?

43
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:05,471
Is one of the world's leading
manufacturers of audio/visual equipment.

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,092
- And video recorders!
- And video recorders.

45
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,062
D'you want some breakfast, Del?

46
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,380
No thanks Albert. Breakfast
is for wimps.

47
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,579
- Rodney?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

48
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:25,934
Well, you know where I was last night while
you was up at the Albert Hall, headbanging?

49
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:28,338
I was having a drink with the managing
director

50
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:31,504
of the Advanced Electronics Research and
Development Centre!

51
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,900
Didn't that used to be
Ron's Cash and Carry?

52
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:36,094
Yeah, yeah, that's right,
but he changed the name.

53
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,660
That bloke's come on a
bundle in the last few years.

54
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,975
That man is at the
front of new technological frontiers.

55
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,777
He's got a Queen's Award
for industry plaque.

56
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:48,008
I know. I was there when
you sold it to him.

57
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,546
Exactly! You and I, we both
know it's a snide one but the punters don't!

58
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,035
They're impressed by the image.

59
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,788
And that's what today's modern
business world is all about - image.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,487
You see, the right appearance can fool the
customer, right?

61
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,581
Now, take me for instance.
I'm a perfect example.

62
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,187
But you look exactly what
you are.

63
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,660
Well, thank you very much.
It's only 'cos I've got the right image.

64
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:17,791
No, I mean, it's the little things, you know,
it's like me aluminium briefcase there,

65
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,768
me Mercedes key-ring, me Filofax.

66
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:23,062
When people see these things they
know exactly what I am.

67
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,748
It is a bit of a givaway,
innit?

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,071
Better than a Mason's handshake, bruv!
It's like me jewellery.

69
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:33,554
Now a half-sovereign ring can say a lot
about a bloke.

70
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:36,499
Combined with a medallion, it
speaks volumes.

71
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:39,561
Now we're talking
the same language aren't we eh?

72
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:43,790
Just a minute.
Albert, stay there, just stand there.

73
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,147
As you see him standing there, what is
the first thing that comes to your mind?

74
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,049
Why have I got bloody
cornflakes again?

75
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:56,496
It's 'cos I can't get any
food in that fridge.

76
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,931
It's full up with tomatoes he
bought last week!

77
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,377
Alright, alright, I'm gonna
get rid of them today, aren't I?

78
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,831
No, I'm talking image-wise,
aren't I?

79
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:07,066
When I see him standing there
what this says to me, it says...

80
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:10,744
here is a man who has
worked hard all his life for an honest crust.

81
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,019
Here is a man of strong
principles, here is a man you can trust.

82
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:20,837
You see what I'm saying - you see how
easy it is to fool people, eh?

83
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,344
All you've got to do is have the right image.

84
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,174
Are you saying I've got to
get an image?

85
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:28,723
No, what I'm saying is you've
got to get rid of one! Take a look at me...

86
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:32,509
You see, I wear a trendy trenchcoat,
Gordon Gekko braces –

87
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:35,923
you wear a lumberjack's coat and
Gordon Bennett boots.

88
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:39,118
My image says: 'I'm going right
to the top, flat out!'

89
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,283
Your image says: 'I'm going back
to bed 'cos I'm shagged out!'

90
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:46,656
You've got to learn to be dynamic, Rodney.
You must be dynamic you see?

91
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:49,573
Yeah, alright.

92
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,670
I was a bit dynamic last
night over at Ron's Cash...

93
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:55,267
over the Advanced Electronics
Research and Development Centre.

94
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,285
I was where the big business opportunities
occur and I was in a position to snap 'em up.

95
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,570
And what exactly did you snap
up?

96
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:04,185
That video recorder.

97
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,528
Financial Times index
must have gone through the roof!

98
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:14,504
No, I didn't just buy one - I bought 50 of 'em, rest of
them are in the garage.

99
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,068
Guess how much I paid.
Only 50 quid each.

100
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:20,530
But that's two and a half grand!
Where'd you get two and a half grand from?

101
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:22,894
I didn't. I got 'em on the
knock, you know, buy now, pay later.

102
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,567
When I sell 'em
Ronnie Nelson'll get his money.

103
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,161
But 50 quid each!

104
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,678
They've got to be hooky!

105
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,680
They are not hooky.

106
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:31,614
No, the reason why they're so cheap is

107
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,998
because they come from a consignment into which
the manufacturers

108
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:37,774
put in the wrong
operating instructions.

109
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,365
Oh great! So how are you gonna
operate a video recorder

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,241
with the instructions for a
sandwich toaster?

111
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,273
- I'm not - you are.

112
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:53,495
Well, you're the one who's taking a
diploma course in computer science - again!

113
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,466
Yes, that's right, so programming
a silly little thing like that

114
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,482
ought to be a doddle
for someone of your talents.

115
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:02,426
Yes, alright, I'll do it for
you.

116
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,888
Ah good boy, good boy. You
know it makes sense.

117
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:08,393
Listen, I want you to record a
programme for me on ITV called City News.

118
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,096
It's all about mega-powered business,
Wall Street, big bangs and all that.

119
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:13,856
You on it?

120
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:19,623
You know, I think a surgical
collar will suit you.

121
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,993
Talking about suits, I want
you to wear yours today.

122
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:26,682
I want you to look really snappy for the punters,
you know, with-it. We've got a high-profile image.

123
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,548
High profile? The only
thing we've got that's high is this flat!

124
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,013
Listen, I'm gonna make a very important
private phone call,

125
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:37,176
I want you two to take them tomatoes
down there and put them in the van?

126
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:41,811
Oh, by the way, don't forget the
rest, alright?
.

127
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,877
There you go Denzil. There's your stew.
That's a pound.

128
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,827
Cheers. I'll get you on the
way back.

129
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:03,489
Boeuf bourguignonne?
That's two pounds fifty sir.

130
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:06,374
Oh that's super.

131
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,211
Bon appetite.

132
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,738
So how's life treating you
then, Denz?

133
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:15,288
The same as Paxo treats a
turkey!

134
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,356
Bad as that, eh?

135
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,796
Well, whatever happened to 'good news' eh?
Has it been privatised or what?

136
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:24,360
Here, I heard you'd started your own
haulage company - Transworld Express.

137
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:26,348
Any time,
any load, anywhere.

138
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,870
That's right, but I've only
got a Transit.

139
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,107
A transit! So why all the
big, world wide slogans?

140
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:35,707
Well, I wanted to call it the
Peckham Courier Service.

141
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:40,293
Parcels, small boxes, that
sort of thing. Then I bumped into Del.

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,698
Oh don't tell me. Image,
yeah?

143
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:49,214
Yes. He said, 'There is no place in the
modern business world for small thinkers;

144
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,644
you have gotta be big, brave
and brazen', he said.

145
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,018
Why'd you listen to him?

146
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:59,293
Well, I keep telling myself I  shouldn't take no notice
of him but Del insists! Does he still drink in here?

147
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,003
Yeah, occasionally.

148
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,262
But since the yuppies gentrified
Peckham

149
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:07,781
he's been hanging round the wine bars and
bistros. Of course, one by one they're barring him.

150
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:10,201
Well, they're bound to,
aren't they?

151
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:13,000
See them over there? They
only come in here to avoid him.

152
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,533
I saw Rodney this morning. He
was wearing a suit.

153
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:21,226
Someone must have died! There
ain't much good news around, is there?

154
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:24,780
Denzil, my 'ole mate!

155
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:26,918
I was just off Del!

156
00:09:26,953 --> 00:09:28,533
No, not until I've bought you
a drink, you're not.

157
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,226
Here pina colada for me, please,
Michael; same again for Denzil.

158
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,923
I've told you before, you ought to clean
your pipes out, looks terrible.

159
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:38,765
Listen Michael, listen to me. I've
just come back from Folkstone.

160
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,297
I've got 25, six-kilo boxes of fresh Jersey tomatoes,
straight off the ferry, still got the dew on 'em.

161
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:47,947
2.50 a box, what do you say? Do your
salads up a treat.

162
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,544
What, 2.50 a box?

163
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,512
Go on then, Del, I'll have
one.

164
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,755
I put three boxes aside for
you. Rodney's on his way down with 'em.

165
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,092
Come and sit down over there. Tell me what
you've been up to.

166
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:02,750
Chloe, Adrian, how nice to
see you again.

167
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,707
Oh God, it's him.

168
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:08,458
Hello.

169
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:14,092
They're my sort of people.

170
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,060
You mean the bistro kids?

171
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:19,184
Ah yeah. I was  in the wine bar the other night
with Adrian

172
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,644
debating the Trust House Forte/Cunard
merger.

173
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:27,441
Oh yeah, that's the sort of thing I like these
days, you know Denzil, the cut and thrust,

174
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,431
to and fro of an honest, well-honed
argument.

175
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:33,944
I regret it now, but I ended up clumping him.

176
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,992
Still, it's all over,
we're still friends, ain't we?

177
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,101
Perrier water under the
bridge eh?

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,471
Just look at me!
I'm supposed to be going out in this tonight.

179
00:10:58,316 --> 00:10:59,984
Well you've ruined it,
haven't yer?

180
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:03,692
This is your fault! It's all
so I could present an image.

181
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:09,550
Well, I am presenting an image, I'm presenting the
image of someone who's covered in tomato stains.

182
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:13,476
That'll come off! Mike, give
him something to mop that up with, will ya?

183
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,001
How about a slice of bread?

184
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,790
I need him, don't I? I bloody
need him!

185
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,232
That was a nice suit this
morning, Rodney.

186
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,813
Yeah, I know it was. Gawd
knows how I'm gonna get it clean for tonight!

187
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:31,617
I'll probably have to cancel my date with
Cassandra and that'll ruin my evening

188
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:34,194
and she might meet a geezer who isn't
covered in tomato juice

189
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,424
and that'll ruin my life and
it's all your fault!

190
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,020
Oh shut up and sit down, you
big old brass!

191
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,932
Tell Rodney about your luck.
That should cheer him up.

192
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,826
'Ere, what's that? No luck,
me old mate?

193
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,998
Oh no, Del, lots of luck -
and all bad!

194
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:49,333
Last Friday
was mine and Corinne's anniversary.

195
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,079
Oh my Gawd!

196
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:53,195
No, Del, that's not the bad
luck.

197
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,954
See a while back I got this
contract with this plastics factory over Deptford.

198
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:02,396
They make garden furniture,
camping equipment, toys, the lot.

199
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,911
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

200
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:06,429
Carry on.

201
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:11,117
Yeah, well Friday afternoon I
got this urgent call from the factory

202
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:14,152
to go to a shop in
High Wycombe and pick up 50 dolls.

203
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:18,243
They were being returned, faulty stock. But
it's my anniversary - isn't it? –

204
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:20,503
and I've promised to
take Corinne out for the evening.

205
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:24,000
By the time I have got through all the rush-hour
traffic it's half-past six

206
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,084
and I've still got all the
dolls on board - so what do I do?

207
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,678
Take 'em back to the
factory like I'm supposed to and let Corinne down,

208
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:34,244
or leave 'em on the truck until
Monday and hope no one twigs?

209
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,941
Oh well, it's obvious, innit?
You let Corinne down.

210
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:45,411
No. How can the return of
faulty dolls be urgent?

211
00:12:45,446 --> 00:12:47,397
I'd have left 'em on me truck
'til Monday.

212
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,973
That's exactly what I did.
And what happens?

213
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:54,012
The factory went up in flames.
Exploded, by all accounts.

214
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,549
Normally I can carry on
working for them because they've got other depots,

215
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:01,149
but tomorrow morning I have
got to hand in this unsigned docket

216
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:05,259
which proves I collected the
dolls but also proves that I didn't deliver them.

217
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:09,528
When the governors find out they
are either gonna think that I have become unreliable

218
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:11,969
or, worse still, that I am
on the thieve!

219
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,675
Yeah, it's a problem, innit
Denzil?

220
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:20,715
It's no problem. Are you two
gonna be plonkers for the rest of your lives?

221
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,659
This is no problem at all, this
is a gift from the gods!

222
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:33,274
-  Give us that here now.
- What are you doing, Del?

223
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,164
I'm getting you out of
schtuck and into the money, right?

224
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:42,570
Right now, listen, I've signed that docket and
put on Friday's date.

225
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,557
They never bother
to check these things.

226
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:50,380
Now, as far as anyone's concerned all them dolls
went up in flames with the rest of the factory.

227
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,172
Them dolls on the back of your truck no
longer exist.

228
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:59,096
This means that the owners will get more
insurance money,

229
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,360
you get an empty truck plus a hundred
nicker bunce.

230
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:07,753
Me and the Tomato Kid here
we get 50 dolls to flog down the market

231
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:11,393
and the great British
public have another bargain of a lifetime!

232
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,540
Everyone's a
winner! Petit dejeuner!

233
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:21,052
Alright? I am now going to  empty your van into ours Denzil.
Thank you very much.

234
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:25,036
See you later. Ciao, Chloe, Adrian.
Tee tee Michael.

235
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:33,745
How much d'you pay for 'em?

236
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:37,101
Two quid each. If we can
knock 'em out for a tenner a go,

237
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:40,950
that's four hundred quid profit, eh?
Lovely Jubbly!

238
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,302
You've just bought 50 dolls
that have got something wrong with 'em.

239
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,800
There's nothing wrong
with those dolls Rodney,

240
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,655
you know what these
quality-control geezers are like.

241
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,683
They see one little scratch on 'em and they
stamp 'em 'Reject!'

242
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,858
What about them dolls you
were selling at Christmas?

243
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:57,463
There was nothing wrong with
them dolls, was there?

244
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:59,347
You laid 'em back like in your
arms like that,

245
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,921
they closed their little eyes and they
looked exactly as if they was asleep.

246
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:04,322
Yeah, and we had to try 'n'
keep 'em closed, didn't we?

247
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:06,799
'Cos when you opened 'em
they was boss-eyed!

248
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:12,716
Yeah, well, they had put the
eyes in the wrong way round,

249
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,951
I grant ya, that's why they
were such a bargain.

250
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:20,364
Anyway the kids didn't notice, did they?
All except that little one who had nightmares

251
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:23,609
and I always said there was something wrong
with her to start with.

252
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:28,083
Anyway, these are probably top of the range,
Barbie or Sindy dolls or something like that.

253
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:36,089
Del, these dolls ain't called Barbie or Sindy. These
dolls are called Lusty Linda and Erotic Estelle.

254
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:41,914
You can't have dolls with
names like that!

255
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,180
You can if you go to the right
shops!

256
00:15:56,566 --> 00:16:03,404
Bloody hell, what have we got
ourselves into here?

257
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,373
Well, this is your fault,
innit? You never stop to ask questions, do ya?

258
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:10,904
You just go crashing in and to hell with
the consequences!

259
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,398
That is because I've got a
high profile.

260
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,943
Yeah, high profile and low
forehead!

261
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,840
They're big for little dolls,
ain't they?

262
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:25,203
No, Unc. They ain't ordinary
dolls. You get them advertised in...

263
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:27,442
...magazines!

264
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,795
Where's that Radio Times?

265
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,452
Albert,
have a day off, will yer?

266
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:39,225
I mean seedy magazines, for
kinky, sleazy little men.

267
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,085
- You're pulling my leg.
- Oh am I?

268
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,966
You have a look at this then!

269
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:52,859
- He's right an' all Del!
- I know he is right.

270
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:58,319
Blimey, look at this lot in here.
We've got more colours in here than jelly babies!

271
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:06,474
I tell you Dell, we're gonna have
to get rid of them a bit lively.

272
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,904
Yes I know,
you're right and all!

273
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,174
Look at the prices they sell
for - 60 pounds each.

274
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:16,392
On the other hand let's not
be too hasty, eh Rodney?

275
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:17,863
Oi, come on, Del!

276
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:21,766
No, you were the one who was having a go at me
just now for making quick decisions, weren't ya?

277
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:25,359
Albert, let me
just have a look at that magazine there.

278
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:28,035
Don't give 'em to me!

279
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,014
Del, we can't sell these!

280
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,757
Rodney, Rodney, look at this.

281
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,520
These things, they sell for
60 quid each, don't they?

282
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:42,150
And these ones are selfinflating deluxe models,
for the more discerning weirdo.

283
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:46,116
Or maybe they're specially
made for bronchial perverts.

284
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,817
Rodney, if we could sell
these for just say 30 quid each, we'd make what?

285
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:54,426
1400 quid profit.
Just think of that.

286
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,934
1400 lovely smackarooneys split right
down the middle between you and me.

287
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:04,011
That means by this time tomorrow you could
have 600 quid of your own on your hip.

288
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,904
- And I know who'll buy 'em off us and all.
- Who?

289
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:09,690
- Dirty Barry.
- Who's Dirty Barry?

290
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:15,588
Well, he runs a little, um, 'personal' shop down the
Walworth Road and he'll take the whole lot of us.

291
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:18,073
And what happens if Cassandra
finds out?

292
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:19,994
Why, does she want one?

293
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:24,771
You know what I mean! She
won't wanna see me again, will she?

294
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,445
Well, how is she gonna find
out?

295
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,937
You stand a fair chance of getting caught if you go
walking round the streets in broad daylight with 'em!

296
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,036
Well we won't, will we?

297
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,466
We'll go down there tonight with
'em, he stays open 'til about eight o'clock.

298
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:36,776
Just get 'em out of here as
quick as you can.

299
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,783
I don't like the idea of sharing my
home with these evil little things

300
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,593
that'll bring nothing
but bad luck.

301
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:45,562
Now you know how me and
Rodney felt the day you moved in!

302
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,175
I don't want nothing to do
with them.

303
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,711
Look, we're traders,
aren't we? All we're doing is trading!

304
00:18:52,746 --> 00:18:54,838
This is just a one-off deal, that's all.

305
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:59,139
I mean, people make a living out of this sorta thing,
it's big business an' all, innit?

306
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:01,001
I mean, you read about it in
the Sunday papers, don't ya?

307
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:04,921
All those MPs and vicars all
going off to them vice dens up in Soho

308
00:19:04,956 --> 00:19:11,186
to get whipped and beaten up and they pay
200 quid, you know, for the privilege an' all.

309
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,450
And, blimey, they wanna walk
round this estate one night,

310
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,673
they'd get it done free and
on the national health.

311
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:19,327
Yeah, but them sort of people
are sick!

312
00:19:19,362 --> 00:19:21,883
Yes, I know! But they're
still human beings!

313
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,692
I mean, if some weirdo wants to get it
going with 'arf a pound of latex and a lump of oxygen,

314
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,584
well that's his business.

315
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:33,535
As far as I'm concerned he can have a meaningful
relationship with a...with a barrage balloon.

316
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,938
As long as it's in the
privacy of his own hanger?

317
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:39,998
Exactly. Now, listen, I'm gonna give
Dirty Barry a bell

318
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,584
and tell him that we're gonna be over there
later on tonight.

319
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:45,154
Rodney, tell me the truth.

320
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:49,128
You couldn't honestly go out
and sell them horrible dolls, could ya?

321
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,419
To be honest with you, Unc,
no I couldn't!

322
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,066
Barry - Del Boy.

323
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,265
But I know a man who can.

324
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:06,134
- That's £5.54.
- Cheers.

325
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,999
It's almost ready. I fetch
for you.

326
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,878
Good evening. Police in South London
have warned the public

327
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,186
to be on the lookout for 50
life-size inflatable dolls

328
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:21,263
which went missing from a
factory in Deptford over the weekend.

329
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:24,654
A police spokesman
today said that, due to a technical error,

330
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,552
the dolls have been loaded with gases

331
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:30,331
which include the highly
explosive and volatile gas, propane.

332
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:31,971
Dear God!

333
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:34,413
...The factory which manufactures them was
burnt to the ground on Saturday night

334
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:38,534
and experts suspect the fire may
have been caused by the presence of propane.

335
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:44,355
The theft came to light when security men noticed a
forged signature on a delivery docket.

336
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,935
Police have warned that the dolls are
potentially lethal,

337
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,355
particularly when exposed to heat,
and have appealed for their immediate return.

338
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,424
Your food is ready.

339
00:20:57,111 --> 00:21:00,018
Usually they take the food
and run off without paying!

340
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,182
This guy's got it all
wrong!

341
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:16,400
I don't believe it! That's the last time
I trust you with anything, Rodney!

342
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:19,365
Look, I've already told you.
There is something wrong with that machine.

343
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,193
I asked him to set this to
record a programme on ITV called City News.

344
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:27,614
What have I got? Open University on
BBC2!

345
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:31,417
So instead of keeping my fingers on the
everchanging pulse of the stock market,

346
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:36,198
I am watching Christopher dopey Wren on
how he built St Paul's Cathedral!

347
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,492
I think it's interesting.

348
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:38,470
Yeah, you would.

349
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,388
You were most probably around when he
applied for planning permission!

350
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:44,875
It's nippy in ere, innit? Is it alright if I turn the
thermostat up?

351
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,990
You sure it's not too technical for you?

352
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:54,840
Oh you dipstick, Rodney, now
look what you've done?

353
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:55,984
Me?

354
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:57,801
I thought Rodney knew about
videos.

355
00:21:57,836 --> 00:22:01,311
Yeah, Emmanuelle In Bangkok
and that's about it.

356
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,226
I programmed that computer to
record the programme you wanted.

357
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:09,798
Now it's not my fault if it decided to record
something else, is it? That machine is...

358
00:22:12,118 --> 00:22:13,556
...up the wall!

359
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,692
You're tryna blind me with
science now, ain't you?

360
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,866
Personally I think these computers
are more trouble than they're worth.

361
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,334
How'd you figure that out?

362
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,955
There was a film on earlier
all about computers.

363
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,258
You're joking? Oh I wish I'd
recorded it.

364
00:22:26,293 --> 00:22:29,648
Oh hang around, Rodney, you
most probably have.

365
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,127
It was called War Games.

366
00:22:31,162 --> 00:22:34,227
It was all about this soppy kid
who messes around with computers.

367
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:39,873
Then one day he broke into the computer that
controls the American nuclear defence system.

368
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,720
He almost got us into
World War Three!

369
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:44,739
No chance of that happening
with Rodney, is there?

370
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:48,251
World War Three!
This plonker can't even get us into channel three!

371
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,772
Have you read the
instructions to your video recorder?

372
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,596
No, I haven't actually read them.

373
00:22:56,946 --> 00:22:59,060
Well, why don't you do that
small thing Derek?

374
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,071
I think you'll find it very
interesting.

375
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:05,399
Because we have instructions in German,
Spanish, French and Italian

376
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:10,428
and not one single word in English!
And that's why your machine don't work.

377
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:13,505
It was made strictly for sale in
Europe!

378
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,805
But we're in Europe now, we're
in  the Common Market, aren't we?

379
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:20,379
Yes, I know that, but we've got a different
electrical system to the rest of Europe

380
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:22,437
and that's why your machine
is on the blink.

381
00:23:22,472 --> 00:23:24,322
Its components are burning out.

382
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:29,513
It is what's technically known as 'knackered!'
Ronnie Nelson's tucked you up.

383
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:35,501
I don't believe it! Well, that's
all I need, innit?

384
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,452
You won't be able to sell the
others now, Del.

385
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:40,635
Too late, Unc. I sold 'em all
this afternoon!

386
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,179
You sold 'em?

387
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,374
70... er... 60 quid each.

388
00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:46,204
- You'll have to give the money back!
- Why?

389
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,071
Because they don't work!

390
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:51,946
What'd you expect for
60 quid! I mean, I've been tucked up.

391
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,463
I'm just passing it on, that's all.
That's bussiness!

392
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:57,179
Don't worry about it,
everything is gonna be cushty.

393
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,201
You are something else, you
are!

394
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:01,952
You're too picky, Rodney,
that's your problem.

395
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:18,238
What was that funny sound?

396
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:23,509
I don't know. What you looking
at me for?

397
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:28,173
Well, most funny sounds in
this flat tend to emanate from your vicinity.

398
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,734
Well I didn't do it!

399
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:43,269
What is that funny noise?

400
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:09,946
What's happening, what's
happening, Rodney?

401
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:11,106
How the hell should I know?

402
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:12,433
You're the one with the GCEs!

403
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:13,842
It's come alive, that's what's
happened!

404
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:16,059
Come alive! What'd you think
this is. Pinocchio?

405
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:20,854
I've seen this happen before! Years ago,
I was in Jamaica and I saw a voodoo ceremony.

406
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:25,763
This witch-doctor ran his hands over a dead cat
and it come back to life!

407
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:29,645
Yeah? I wish he lived round here;
he could have a look at my video!

408
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:33,991
Just take it easy, alright?

409
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:45,062
That's you, that is, talking
about Jamaica, look!

410
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:47,013
I don't understand it.

411
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:50,139
I thought you were supposed to pull a string
or press a button or something to inflate 'em!

412
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,712
So did I...

413
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:01,272
They're right
next to the hot-air duct.

414
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,426
Well, that must have caused it.

415
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,257
They must have a little canister of gas
inside 'em and the heat set 'em off.

416
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:09,986
Why d'you go and stick 'em
next to the hot-air duct for?

417
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:11,726
I didn't know the heat would do that!

418
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:14,361
Anyway, you're the one
that switched the thermostat up!

419
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:16,310
Well, I didn't know it was gonna
do that either!

420
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:21,895
Yes, alright, alright you two,
now just pack it in, for Gawd's sake, will ya?

421
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:25,585
What will our guests think?

422
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,948
They're ugly looking mares, ain't they?

423
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,719
Seen you with worse.

424
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,415
Rodney, you're gonna op an
unfortunate one in a minute.

425
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,047
Listen, we can't stand here
arguing.

426
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:42,918
We've gotta do something before the
rest of the black and white minstrels pop up!

427
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,834
How?

428
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,871
Well, they're bound to have a
little valve in 'em somewhere.

429
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:51,360
Yeah, that's right.

430
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,508
Go on, make your way in Rodney.

431
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:58,214
I'm not looking for it!! It
could be anywhere!

432
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,105
And I ain't looking for it
either. Could be illegal.

433
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,171
What're you talking about, illegal!
They can't phone for the police can they?

434
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,712
Do it yourself, Del Boy.

435
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:34,992
There it is, right on the back
there. Just going to stick...

436
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:39,256
Go on Rodney, have a go at that then.
Use one of these coctail sticks.

437
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,500
- Does Cassandra let you do that?
- Shut up.

438
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,713
Nothing's happening.

439
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:55,882
Nah, same here.

440
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,429
Maybe they're dodgy valves!

441
00:27:57,464 --> 00:27:59,998
We used to get it on the
rubber dinghies in the navy.

442
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,305
Oh yeah, how can you tell?

443
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,334
Well, once they're up they
won't come down.

444
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:07,735
Well, you remember what Denzil said?
They were faulty, weren't they?

445
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:12,083
He was taking them back to the factory. It must
have been the valves that were faulty!

446
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,542
Well, how we gonna let 'em
down?

447
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,889
How should I know?

448
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:17,456
Can't you stick pins in 'em?

449
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:19,816
You're back to your voodoo
again, aren't you?

450
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:23,607
We've got 60 quid in profit tied up in
these two.

451
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:27,766
Oh look what's 60 notes, eh?
Come on, let's just burst 'em!

452
00:28:28,014 --> 00:28:31,053
Rodney, Rodney, don't you
dare do that. Give me that here.

453
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:34,489
Cor, dear, your mother would turn
somersaults in her grave

454
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:36,546
if she could see you doing that.

455
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,926
She did not bring us
up to throw good money away,

456
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:40,730
just 'cos we've got
a little problem!

457
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:44,429
We'll find a way in which we can
get 'em down to Dirty Barry's.

458
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:47,469
And how are you gonna explain
the fact that they are fully inflated?

459
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:48,830
Well, I'll just say they're
samples.

460
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:52,401
I'll say we blew 'em up so we could see 'em in
all their natural beauty!

461
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:56,763
We'll chuck 'em in the back
of the van. They'll be out of sight then!

462
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:00,157
But how you gonna get 'em out
of this flat, down the stairs,

463
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:02,778
through the main doors, right across
the forecourt

464
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:05,613
to where the van's parked
without anyone seeing you?

465
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:08,104
He always has to spoil everything,
don't he?

466
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:09,700
He's got a point, though,
ain't he?

467
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:13,278
I mean, there's thousands of people on this
estate. Someone's bound to see you.

468
00:29:13,313 --> 00:29:15,534
Alright, alright. I'll think of a way.

469
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,321
The first thing we've
gotta do is to get these into another room.

470
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:21,767
I mean, if that bloke from the council turns
up to talk to us about buying this flat,

471
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:25,485
Gawd knows what he'd think
if he sees Pepsi and Shirley here...

472
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,397
Albert, put these in Rodney's
room.

473
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,898
What? No way! I've already got a wardrobe full
of Mum's old clothes in my room.

474
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,787
Them two would just about take the
biscuit!

475
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:34,898
Who's gonna see 'em?

476
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:38,289
Well, in case I bring
Cassandra back. Put 'em in your room.

477
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:41,686
No, case I bring a bird back.
Put 'em in Albert's room.

478
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:43,374
Case I bring...

479
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,810
Oh alright, put 'em in my room.

480
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,260
I've gotta go and meet
Cassandra. I'll see you later.

481
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:55,107
Oi, Rodney! Just make sure you don't do anything
that might cause embarassment to our family.

482
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:01,708
Del, I don't think I could do anything that would
cause embarrassment to our family.

483
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:08,104
Good boy, good boy. Mum'd
be proud of you. Mum!

484
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:15,426
That's it Rodney, I think I've just worked out a way
how we can get these down to Dirty Barry's!

485
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:19,542
Oh no!

486
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:29,181
These tomatoes are a bit
manky, ain't they, Mike?

487
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:33,010
Still, they make your beer
taste better.

488
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:36,659
I'll have you know they were
fresh Jersey tomatoes!

489
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:38,054
Oh yeah, when?

490
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:40,262
Why do you come in this pub,
Trig?

491
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:42,183
For the company.

492
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:46,712
Trigger doesn't have many
friends or opportunities for social outlet.

493
00:30:47,156 --> 00:30:50,930
Every weekend he goes down to the park
and throws bread to the ducks.

494
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:53,282
To him it's a dinner party.

495
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,511
So during the week he has a straight choice between
sitting in the cemetery or sitting in this pub.

496
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,970
Unfortunately, the cemetery
closes at six.

497
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:05,614
What is the matter with
everyone today?

498
00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:09,739
Trigger's done nothing but moan,
you've got a face like a constipated rat –

499
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:13,767
at least when Del Boy comes in he
cracks a joke and has a laugh!

500
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:20,159
It's due to the activities of the aforementioned Del
Boy that I have a face like a constipated rat!

501
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:23,325
Derek popped in to see me
this afternoon.

502
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,661
How is he?

503
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:28,338
A lot richer than before he
popped in to see me this afternoon!

504
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:32,461
He sold me some video recorders, £70 each.
I snapped 'em up.

505
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:35,547
70 nicker each! What they
fall off, the back of a lorry?

506
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:38,879
If they did, they were going
round a bend in Dusseldorf!

507
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:41,003
How d'you mean?

508
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,244
I have just discovered that
these machines only work on the continental current.

509
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,385
To make them work on the
British system

510
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,537
would take a transformer the size of a
suitcase and an electrician of such genius

511
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:55,454
that I'd have to go head-hunting at Cape
Canaveral!

512
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,107
Seventy nicker each?

513
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,154
Those video recorders -
seventy nicker each?

514
00:32:02,418 --> 00:32:04,641
- Yeah.
- I'll have one.

515
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,729
No, no, Trig. See they only work on a continental...
alright, I'll drop one round.

516
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,421
Cheers, Boycie.

517
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:16,963
Mike, Mike!

518
00:32:16,998 --> 00:32:19,438
Hang on, hang on. I've only
got one pair of hands.

519
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:20,909
Have you seen Del Boy?

520
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:22,352
No, no. He ain't been in tonight.

521
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,504
Oh bloody hell! I've gotta do something really quick!
Is your phone working?

522
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:28,035
Is the phone working?

523
00:32:29,211 --> 00:32:30,937
Look, we had a spot of bother
the other week.

524
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:32,980
They tore the wires out.
But what's all the panic?

525
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:35,669
I sold Del some dolls -
inflatable dolls.

526
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:37,743
Inflatable dolls?

527
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:41,806
He didn't know they were inflatable!
I never knew they were inflatable!

528
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:46,257
I picked 'em up from a place called
Playthings - I thought it was a toy shop!

529
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:49,557
Well, apparently the police are looking for
them, they're dangerous!

530
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:54,027
They've been fitted with the wrong gas cylinders.
They're full of something called propane.

531
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,640
Propane?
Here, that's explosive innit?

532
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,786
Very! Del's got 50 little
time-bombs on his hands.

533
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:03,684
If them things get hot
they are gonna have to redo the A to Z!

534
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,842
I'll pop around his flat. I'll see you later.

535
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,807
That's bad news, innit?

536
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:16,648
- Terrible!
- That's tragic!

537
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:35,542
Hurry up then. It's all clear.

538
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:43,368
Well, what a very peasant evening.

539
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,915
I'm gonna kill you!

540
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,124
Get the van, Albert.

541
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:54,373
It'll be alright as long as
we don't draw attention to ourselves.

542
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,079
Look!

543
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:09,953
Hurry up, Albert!

544
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,484
It's locked!

545
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:17,112
Cor blimey! You got the keys,
Rodney??

546
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:20,683
Yeah, here y'are. Hurry up.

547
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:22,493
Drive the van back over here, Unc.

548
00:34:22,751 --> 00:34:23,988
But I'm not insured.

549
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,300
Well, don't have a crash then!

550
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:32,179
What if the police patrol sees us?

551
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:34,178
It's alright, these dolls
ain't hooky.

552
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm thinking more of a public indecency charge!
How you gonna explain this in court?

553
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:43,325
I shall tell the truth,
Rodney. I shall say,

554
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,786
Yes, your honour, the other evening
my brother and I

555
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:49,445
decided to go out for a drink with two
life-size inflatable dolls

556
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,821
which were wearing my late
mother's clothing.

557
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:54,867
Can't put you in prison for that,
Rodney, can they?

558
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:59,386
No, they'd chuck us in Broadmoor.
The Norman Bates wing, most probably.

559
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,829
Hold up.

560
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:04,315
- Good evening, Derek.
- Good evening, Clayton.

561
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:08,131
- Good evening, Rodney.
- Evening, Mr Cooper.

562
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:11,602
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening.

563
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:27,191
Right, that's me finished with
'em, OK?

564
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:30,165
Here, just a minute.
Ain't you coming down Dirty Barry's with us?

565
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,833
No, I ain't. I've got a date
with Cassandra.

566
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:36,225
Look I had a date with that
Simone sort from the cut-price butcher's

567
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,814
and she had a bag of liver for us.
I've knocked her on the head.

568
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:42,681
Business comes first.

569
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:44,588
Well, I'm not knocking
Cassandra on the head.

570
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:48,336
Look, you bought 'em, he blew 'em
up, so it's YP Derek!

571
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:50,906
- YP?
- Your problem!

572
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:57,804
You dipstick! Come on, Albert,
get in the van.

573
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,502
Why have I gotta come in with
ya?

574
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,757
I need you to help me carry
'em into Dirty Barry's.

575
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,015
Don't keep worrying. We're in
the van now. No one can see 'em.

576
00:36:10,297 --> 00:36:11,666
I hope you're right.

577
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:14,959
Trust me. Have I ever put you
wrong before?

578
00:36:39,804 --> 00:36:42,017
You are a liar, Rodney!

579
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:46,472
Oh Cassandra, that hurts me!
I have never told an untruth in my life.

580
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:49,576
I happen to come
from an extremely honest family.

581
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:51,757
You told me you lived in a
great big house.

582
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,907
Well, I do live in a great
big house!

583
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:58,783
Nelson Mandela House - it's got about 70
flats in it. You can't get much bigger than that!

584
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:01,045
I drove you home to where you
claimed to live

585
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,737
and it most certainly was not a council
estate! It was a mansion.

586
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,844
I mean there was a brand-new
Mercedes in the front

587
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:10,098
and most probably an Olympic sized
swimming pool at the back.

588
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:14,831
The people that owned the house came to
the window and you had the gall to wave at them!

589
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,465
Yes, I remember.

590
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:22,377
And I swore to myself that night that never again
would I go out without my contact lenses!

591
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,163
Oh shut up!

592
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:28,292
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

593
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:37,121
Well, you know when I saw your house,
it looked so nice I decided to sprawns a bit.

594
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:38,848
You must have known I'd find out.

595
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:42,752
No. I didn't think I'd ever
see you again.

596
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:43,965
Why?

597
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:52,164
Dunno, just didn't! I wanted to see you again
but did you want to see me again?

598
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:54,339
- Yes, I did.
- Why?

599
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:57,192
Because I thought you lived
in a great big house and had a Mercedes!

600
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:00,195
Why did you want to see me
again?

601
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:04,363
Well, I wanted to see what you looked like once
I had my contact lenses in.

602
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,000
And?

603
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,263
Well, it's come as a great
disappointment, Cassandra. I'm sorry.

604
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:14,611
Don't apologize. It happens
all the time.

605
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,421
I meet a guy, we get on well, he
regains his sight - end of story.

606
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:20,448
It's a tough world.

607
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,897
I'd like to meet your brother.

608
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:29,186
Why?

609
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,033
It's just the things you've
told me about him.

610
00:38:31,068 --> 00:38:32,780
He seems like an interesting
kind of person.

611
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:39,195
Yes, Del can sometimes be interesting.
But most of the time he's just baffling!

612
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:51,245
Will you take that thing off.
You look like Little Red Riding Hood!

613
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:53,731
I don't want anyone round
here recognizing me!

614
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,902
Who the hell's gonna recognize you, eh?

615
00:38:55,937 --> 00:39:00,489
You might not believe it, but during the war
I was quite a celebrity round these parts.

616
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,111
It was 'cos of all the medals
I won for bravery under fire.

617
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:07,573
The only acts of bravery you
ever performed were under water!

618
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:11,244
Say someone saw us holding
these things.

619
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:16,392
They might ring the press and they'd have a
field day what with me being an old war hero!

620
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:19,993
They'd call me one of those silly Fleet
Street nicknames.

621
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:24,166
They'd callme 'The Old Man of the PVC'
or something like that!

622
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:26,139
Will you stop moaning?

623
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,601
- Who's there?
- Barry, it's me, Del Boy.

624
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,221
Hold on.

625
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,066
He's security-conscious,
ain't he?

626
00:39:40,084 --> 00:39:42,031
No, he's just moving some of his stock.

627
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:47,368
Come in.

628
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,426
Who's the monk?

629
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:01,587
No, no, that's my Uncle
Albert. He's alright, he's harmless.

630
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:05,755
- So what's occurring? You buying or selling?
- Selling.

631
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,878
Yeah? What?

632
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:10,552
What d'yer mean "what?"
These things, of course!

633
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:12,912
What d'yer think I'm doing,
giving 'em a guided tour?

634
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,445
Here, they're not the dolls
the police are looking for, are they?

635
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,575
- Police?
- No. These come from up north.

636
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,482
There's a shop I know that went
out of business.

637
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,619
And I thought I'll get these for my mate,
Dir...er...Barry.

638
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:27,795
Went out of business, did he?
Yeah, it's happening everywhere, Del.

639
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,703
The bottom's fallen out of this game.

640
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:33,022
Listen, Barry - now you're a businessman,
you know a bargain when you see one.

641
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,137
Now these are the finest
quality, top of the range.

642
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:40,326
They normally retail around the 70 quid mark.
I'm selling 'em for 30 quid each.

643
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:43,655
Yeah, you're right, Del. They are cheap.
Someone's gonna get a bargain.

644
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,432
No, no, not someone, Barry,
not someone: you!

645
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:50,071
No can do, Del. See, I had a
visit from the council yesterday.

646
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:52,473
They've revoked me
licence. Closed me down.

647
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:56,673
- Where am I gonna get rid of them then?
- Nowhere local, they're closing us all down!

648
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,064
- We're selling our stock, not buying!
- What about Soho?

649
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,309
You won't have any joy there,
mate. Their stockrooms are full.

650
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:05,658
We sold 'em all our
gear this morning.

651
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:10,302
Nah I tell you, Maggie Thatcher's
ruined this business.

652
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:13,564
At last someone's got
something good to say about her!

653
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:20,442
He's an old sailor. He's still got a bit of
depth charge lodged in his brain.

654
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,519
Come on, Brother Albert.

655
00:41:30,452 --> 00:41:32,228
Just my luck, innit?

656
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:35,606
If I could have bought them dolls
a couple of days ago I could have outed 'em.

657
00:41:36,346 --> 00:41:40,081
Instead of that, Dirty Barry and his
mates have flooded the market.

658
00:41:40,313 --> 00:41:46,579
And as they've got rid of their stock I'm lumbered
here with Polythene Pam and Vinyl Vera.

659
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:49,186
Get off, I've got a headache!

660
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:51,178
That's God's punishment, that is!

661
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:54,031
Will you stop going on about
God and voodoo and all that?

662
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,035
You'll be shaking bones and
waving shrunken heads about next.

663
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:07,708
Oh, I know, I know what to do.
We'll hang on to 'em 'til the market picks up.

664
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,201
I mean, it's only like the stock exchange, innit,

665
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:14,535
you know, up and down, supply
and demand, constantly fluctuating.

666
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:18,061
We'll hang on to 'em and wait for the big bang!

667
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,404
- Goodnight, sir, madam. Thank you.

668
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:30,841
Can I give you a lift home?

669
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:34,282
Oh, no thank you. My mum warned
me about girls like you.

670
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:38,944
The lift home's all very well but you'll expect
a lot more than a good night kiss, won't you?

671
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:41,251
And I'm not that sort of boy.

672
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:43,117
And I thought you were a cert!

673
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:46,626
Look, I promise I won't try and
unbutton your shirt or take your string vest off.

674
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,785
Nah it's alright.

675
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,590
If you give me a lift home you've got to go
all round the one-way system, haven't ya?

676
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:54,272
I'll take a short
cut through the market.

677
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:56,466
If you're sure. You be careful,
though.

678
00:42:56,501 --> 00:43:00,171
Oh, look, the baddies don't
frighten me. I'm street-wise aren't I?

679
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:01,415
Good!

680
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,623
And watch out for unexploded
inflatable dolls.

681
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:09,732
Didn't you see it on the news
tonight?

682
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,895
No, our telly's on the blink.
Why, what did they say?

683
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,271
You know like those creepy
blow-up dolls you can buy?

684
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:16,566
Yeah, well I've heard about
them.

685
00:43:16,816 --> 00:43:18,613
There's a factory in Deptford
that makes them

686
00:43:18,648 --> 00:43:20,461
and apparently a whole batch of them
has gone missing

687
00:43:20,496 --> 00:43:23,231
that were accidentally filled with an
explosive gas.

688
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:27,794
- We shouldn't laugh!
- No, we shouldn't!

689
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:30,041
They could prove potentially
dangerous!

690
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:32,383
Look, Cassandra, I've gotta go.
I don't feel very well!

691
00:43:33,092 --> 00:43:34,462
What's wrong with you?

692
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:36,078
Anything the matter, sir?

693
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,069
It's alright, I just feel a bit sick.

694
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:42,034
- Look, I'll phone you, OK?
- Yes!

695
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:50,134
That's the third complaint tonight.
Where did we get those tomatoes from?

696
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:54,237
You better not be having me
on, Rodney!

697
00:43:54,272 --> 00:43:55,853
I'm not Del, honest!

698
00:43:56,889 --> 00:43:58,966
I'll whack you straight in
the mouth if you're pulling my leg!

699
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:16,284
Explosive gas! I've never
heard of anything so daft!

700
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,837
Shut up and keep spraying!

701
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:46,632
Throw them over here.

702
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:59,215
Just dropping them off.

703
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:06,155
Thought you said you heard a
soosing sound?

704
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:10,147
I did. They was making a funny noise,
like something was gonna happen!

705
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,286
The only thing that's happened so far
is poor old Mum's clothing's got all dirty!

706
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,840
I shall have to take
it all down the dry-cleaners now!

707
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,791
Del, them dolls are dangerous!
They've been on the news, everywhere!

708
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:28,760
How d'you know it was them
dolls that they were talking about?

709
00:45:28,795 --> 00:45:31,042
I know, right, I just know!

710
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:38,446
Well, the only thing that I know is
I've got 60 quid laying out over there

711
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,654
and we're hanging about here
like a couple of spare ones at a wedding.

712
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:47,249
Oh, some on, I've had
enough of this, come on!

713
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,104
See?

714
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:13,926
I told 'em not to have the
mutton vindaloo!

715
00:46:23,745 --> 00:46:25,705
Blimey, that could have happened
anywhere, Rodders!

716
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,002
I know! We only just got
rid of them in time! We was well lucky.

717
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:36,851
No, it's not luck, Rodney.
It's Mum.

718
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:38,301
Mum?

719
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:44,126
Yeah, she's up there
somewhere watching over us.

720
00:46:45,008 --> 00:46:46,919
Oh, yeah.

721
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:52,803
The old April going is it?
