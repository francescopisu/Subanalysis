1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,760
# Stick a pony in me pocket

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,760
# I'll fetch the suitcase from the van

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,840
# 'Cause if you want the best 'uns
But you don't ask questions

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,360
# Then, brother, I'm your man

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,120
# Just where it all comes from is a mystery

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,160
# It's like the changing of the seasons
And the tides of the sea

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
# But here's the one that's driving me berserk:

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,520
# Why do only fools and horses work? #

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,920
(DEL): Michael... Mike.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,200
- What is it now?
- (DEL): Here...

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,760
This is your lucky night. How's that
for a portable computer? Look at that!

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,600
It's got 64K, UHF output,
it's got a megabyte disk drive.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,280
It's got ROM, RAM, it's got them
red and green lights, everything.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,320
- What do I want with a computer?
- What does he want with a computer?

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,360
- Everyone's got a computer these days!
- Have you got one?

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,800
- Have I got one?!
- He's got 25.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,160
I have... Thank you, Rodney,
thank you very much! Listen!

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,240
This particular model normally retails
at 399 pounds of the realm.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm giving it to you for 150,
and I'm gonna throw in a free joystick.

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,200
This thing, it processes all your data.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,240
- What exactly does that mean?
- What does that mean?!

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,840
What do you mean... Are you dim? It's...

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,480
Tell him what it means, Rodney.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
He did a course in this
and came top of the class. Tell him!

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,240
It's...

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,720
In layman's terms, right...

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,560
You can record all your business deals on it.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,240
I spend half my life
trying to hide my business deals.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,080
The last thing I need
is to record them on a floppy bloody disk!

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm not interested. Why don't you ask Trigger?

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,680
Trigger? With a computer? Do me a favour,
he's still struggling with light switches.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,720
No, Del.

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,200
Try that, Albert.

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,080
Last time I tasted something like that
was in Egypt.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,880
- Was it the local brew?
- No, I fell in the Nile.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,920
Mike, I ordered beer.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,880
Don't be funny with me, Trig. I'll tell you
this much: I've had certificates for my beer.

38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,040
I've had a few days off work with it an' all.

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,360
Blimey! I don't know... These bloody computers!

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
- I bought thirty of them and only sold five.
- That's not too bad.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,240
Not too bad?! I've had them a year and a half.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,280
Our sales campaign suffered badly
when a local officer of fair trading

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,640
announced to the press that they don't work.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,920
They do work, Rodney!
They just need a bit of fiddling about with.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,520
- They don't work properly.
- Do you know about this sort of thing, Dave?

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,600
Yes, I do. Recently I took a computer
course at the adult education centre.

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
- And failed.
- I did not fail.

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,000
- You passed?
- I didn't strictly pass either.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,240
The man in charge said, not in so many words,
that I should concentrate more

50
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,600
on the theoretical side
rather than the actual keyboard area.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,840
What he actually said was,
"Keep your bloody hands off my machine!"

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Thank you for being so encouraging.
If I pass the course and get my diploma,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,760
I might be able to get a real job
as a real company employee,

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,160
instead of hanging around with
the deadly duo, you and that suitcase.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,800
- Just watch it!
- Do you know what he had me doing today?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,120
This is an infra-red massager
that cures rheumatics and all of that.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,480
He's had me hobbling through the market
like I've got bad lumbago, right?

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,560
Then "Healing-Hands" Trotter
spots me and cures me

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,680
in front of all the punters!

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,320
He used to be a cowboy.
Now he's a medicine man.

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,960
Shut up, you tart! You're just narked
'cause you had a hole in your vest.

62
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
Anyway, I can't hang about here.

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,480
Do you remember that chop suey
house we decorated by the station?

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,240
It's gone bust and they're auctioning
all their gear tonight. I'll sniff around.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
- See you later.
- All right.

66
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,840
- My God!
- Mr Trotter!

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,040
Mr Jahan, what a pleasant surprise!
What brings you in?

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,640
That computer you sold me last month
is still not working.

69
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,960
There must be some simple explanation.
Let's sit down and discuss it over a drink.

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
- What can I get you?
- Something non-alcoholic.

71
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,600
Non-alcoholic.
Michael, a pint of your best bitter, please.

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,920
I have a business to run, Mr Trotter.

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,680
I
bought the computer at your suggestion
to streamline my business.

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
So far your computer has managed
to destroy my accounts,

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,480
my stock records, and set fire to my curtains.

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,440
You must be pressing the wrong button, Mr Jahan.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,480
We are talking outer-limit hi-tech here.

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,480
That computer was used
in the American space shuttle.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
But it blew up!

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,080
I don't mean it was the same computer.

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,200
Although that would explain
why it isn't working too well.

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,000
Just trust me. Give it a bit of time.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,840
I guarantee you - in a few days' time,
you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
I'll give it one week then I'll be back to see you.

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,320
That's the spirit, Mr Jahan!
You know it makes sense.

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Thank you, Michael. I'll see you later.

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,200
Anyway, I thought that fella working
for you was a bit of a computer boffin.

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
Oh, he has resigned.
Said the work did not agree with him.

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,360
Half of them, they don't know
they're born these days, do they?

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,240
I placed ads in the local paper
and at the job centre but all to no avail.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
It's not a difficult job, and I pay good wages.

92
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,880
Yeah, that's gonna be difficult for you.
You're looking for a young man

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,400
- with drive and enthusiasm.
- No, not really.

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,240
A couple of GCEs
wouldn't go amiss, would they?

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,000
There's no necessity for all this.
I'm looking for someone who can walk.

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
That's what I mean, you're talking top-notch!

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,160
Most people with that calibre
have gone off with the brain drain.

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,200
No, it's gonna be a difficult one. Now, Mr Jahan...

99
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,320
Wait a minute. Pot-pourri, pot-pourri!

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,160
Of course!
This must be your lucky night, Mr Jahan.

101
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,760
I may have the very person you're looking for.

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,800
- Really? Who?
- Only my younger brother.

103
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,400
He's enthusiastic
and he's got GCEs in maths and art.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,920
Since he came back from Cambridge,
he's been dealing in the commodities market.

105
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,040
All the head-hunters have been after him,
from the Bank of England down to ICI.

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,320
But he fancies something a bit more local.

107
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,800
- Can he walk?
- Yeah, he dashes about all over the place.

108
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,160
- Can he discuss it with me?
- No, I will.

109
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,840
- How much are you offering?
- A hundred.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,280
Del's got something going over there.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,520
That means somebody's gonna suffer.

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,960
Talking of suffering, my niece
is getting married next Saturday.

113
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,400
You remember little Lisa, don't you?
She came up last year.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,280
She was the one who arranged
for Del Boy to have a go on a hang-glider.

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Oh, yeah!

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,080
I liked her.

117
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
She's invited you all
to Hampshire for the wedding.

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,760
That's very nice of her.
You tell her I'll be delighted.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,080
You two are coming. Del has accepted for you.

120
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,360
He's accep... He's something else, isn't he?

121
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,680
I thought Lisa was getting married last year.

122
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,240
Yes, she was. And then she found out that...

123
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,920
..she wasn't.

124
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
What?

125
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,640
Got a pencil and a bit of paper, Mike?

126
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,480
Yeah... Now she's found out she is again.

127
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,120
It should be good, though. A day
by the coast and a nice drink afterwards.

128
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,120
Talking of drinks, I'll get these in.

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Rodney, this must be your lucky night.

130
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,400
- I've only been and got you a job.
- I don't want it.

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,120
What do you mean?!
You just said you'd like to get a job.

132
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,400
Not from him.
I've had some of his little jobs in the past.

133
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
I'm here to tell you he's no Brook Street Bureau.

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
That's charming, ain't it? That is charming!

135
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,400
That is all the thanks I get
after all the work and effort I've done!

136
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,400
Well... Anyway, it wasn't just a job,
it was a career move.

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,320
- I haven't got a career.
- But you'd have had one and had it moving.

138
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,800
And we'd have had some wages coming
into the flat. We're boracic at the moment.

139
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,200
Yeah, some of your novel money-saving
devices are in evidence again.

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,040
- What's this job, then?
- You're not interested,

141
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,920
so it's purely epidemic, ain't it?

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,920
What sort of job was it, Del?

143
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,120
He would have been
a trainee computer programmer...

144
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,920
..eventually.

145
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
And it was mentioned
that the successful candidate would,

146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,680
with endeavour, attain executive status.

147
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,240
Well, I thought it was gonna be
humping boxes around, stuff like that.

148
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,080
I didn't know I was gonna be a trainee executive.

149
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,720
He mentioned your c.v. How about that?
A nice little Citroen.

150
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
I think he might have been
referring to my curriculum vitae.

151
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,600
That's no problem.
There's no heavy lifting involved.

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, he'd have to start at the bottom, though.

153
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,240
Yeah, of course. Doing what?

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,920
It's sort of delivering, yeah, basically.
Just to start with.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
And it's 90 quid cash in hand;
no tax, no nonsense.

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,560
If I'm working cash in hand,
I'm not a real employee.

157
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,600
You will be, 'cause that's
only temporary! What do you say?

158
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,880
Where would I be working?

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,640
You know that big new office block
down in Wilmot Road,

160
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,960
with the smoked glass and the lairy cars?

161
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,320
Where the young birds
come out of at lunch-time?

162
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
- That's the one.
- Yeah, I know it.

163
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,960
Well, right opposite it is an alley.

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,960
- An alley?
- Yes.

165
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
Between the undertaker's
and the Light of Nepal restaurant.

166
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,400
So you go down that alley and you find a yard.
Pop your head in there on Monday,

167
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,560
and ask for a Mr Jahan.
He will give you your duties and uniform.

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,080
Good Lord! Is that the time?
I'm going to the Chinky's. See you later.

169
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,840
(DEL): Hey, Mike, thanks for the drinks.

170
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,640
Why would a trainee computer
programmer need a uniform?

171
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,760
Don't know.

172
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I don't know what you're laughing at.
Don't you see what this means?

173
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,680
You've just been promoted to the geezer
in the market with the bad back.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,720
- Congratulations, Lisa.
- Thanks.

175
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,960
And to you, Andrew. My very best wishes
for many years of happiness.

176
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,360
Who knows, in a year or two, we could be back
celebrating the christening of your first-born.

177
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,240
Actually, my mother
wants to have a word with you about that.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,280
Oh... I see.

179
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,320
Excuse me. Vicar!

180
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,000
- Vic!
- Mr Trotter, how nice!

181
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,160
- Thank you once again for your lift.
- Bain-marie, it was the least that I can do.

182
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,880
Sorry it was a bit bumpy,
but we didn't have far to go.

183
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,040
That reminds me, the computer I told
you about, I left it for you in your vestry.

184
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,080
- You left it in my vestry?!
- It's all right.

185
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,520
I had to get you in the back of the van, right?

186
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,800
Listen... just in case the old bishop asks,

187
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,240
it normally retails at 399
but you can have it at 150.

188
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,200
- And a pony off for cash.
- Pony?

189
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,360
All right, then, 30 quid.
Can't say fairer than that.

190
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll let you have it on two weeks' approval.
If I can't trust you, who can I trust?

191
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I mean, ask and it shall be given,
that is my motto.

192
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Would I... Excuse me.
Darling, you're one of the bridesmaids, aren't you?

193
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,240
- Thanks, Rodney.
- What are you doing here on your own?

194
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,240
I was just reminiscing.
This used to be my old stamping ground.

195
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,920
Portsmouth is just a couple of miles up the road.

196
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,960
- Bet you had some laughs round here.
- Not half!

197
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,360
The warning used to go out:
"Lock up your daughters, Trotter's back".

198
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
Congratulations, darling.
You remember Mike, don't you?

199
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,600
He's the water-diviner from the Nag's Head.

200
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,280
Of course I do. Hello, Mike.
It's lovely to see you again.

201
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,760
- This is Andy, my husband.
- Congratulations, son.

202
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,400
You'll never regret what you did today.
I should know, I've been married 18 years.

203
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,480
Thanks a lot. Is your wife here?

204
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,520
No, we broke up back in '73.

205
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,480
Finally, the skipper said, "I know...

206
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,160
"We'll try to hide in one of the fiords..."

207
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
I think I may have heard this story before.

208
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
- Did you sink?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,040
I've heard it.

210
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,040
- Why do you bother to listen to him?
- I don't know.

211
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,760
A moment of weakness, I suppose.

212
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,360
- It's all a bit up-market here, ain't it, Del?
- I was surprised to see you here.

213
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,040
I am at home in any walk of life.
How are you, sweetheart?

214
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,760
I don't believe it! Would you behave yourselves!

215
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,440
We're only a hyphen or two away
from a society wedding,

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,680
and you're behaving like
you're on a charabanc trip to the lights.

217
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,920
Shut up, you snobby git!

218
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,920
I'm merely trying to conduct myself
with a little decorum.

219
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, dear. I assume this bundle's from you.

220
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,520
That is our present, yes.

221
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,800
Good God, it looks as though
the bomb squad has had a go at it.

222
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,080
What have you bought the unlucky couple?

223
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
A 13-piece dinner service.

224
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,960
We bought them a dinner service as well.

225
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,400
I shouldn't worry, Marlene.
There'll be no comparison.

226
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,480
We got ours from Royal Doulton. They've probably
got theirs from Dalton's Weekly.

227
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,920
He's good, ain't he?
He's got more front than Southend.

228
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,680
But it is a lovely dinner service, Del.

229
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,160
It's got a hand-painted pattern

230
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,360
depicting the changing seasons
of the English countryside.

231
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,520
He's probably given them that old crockery
he bought at the Chinese auction.

232
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,360
How dare you? What sort of bloke
do you think I am?

233
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
I wouldn't put it past you.

234
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Come along, Marlene, shall we circulate?

235
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,480
Bloody hell, Boycie, we've already been around
more times than a break-dancer.

236
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,560
Del, did our dinner service
come from the bankrupt Chinky's?

237
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,240
No, it did not, I swear on my life.

238
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,840
Those plates had an awful lot
of pandas and pagodas on them.

239
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,320
It did come from the Chinese take-away.

240
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,960
We've been really strapped for money recently.

241
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,880
Anyway, I thought they looked
like rather nice pagodas, myself.

242
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,760
No, they ain't.
They look more like a prisoner-of-war camp.

243
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,080
How's it gonna make us look?

244
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,240
Boycie and Marlene's service
depicts the changing seasons.

245
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,440
Ours contains scenes from Tenko.

246
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,840
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

247
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,720
Hang about a minute. Here, hold this.

248
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,000
It's all right...

249
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh, dear...

250
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,320
He who dares wins. Cheers.

(DISCO MUSIC)

252
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,040
- Aunt Reen, do you want a drink?
- I'll have a port and lemon.

253
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,160
Better make it a small one,

254
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,000
'cause I've had orders from Lisa
not to get Oliver Twist in front of his family.

255
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,400
I don't know who she thinks they are.
Big hats and no drawers, most of 'em.

256
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,040
Here's a face from the past.

257
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Albert Trotter? I don't believe it.

258
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,200
Hello, Reeny girl, how are you going?

259
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
- I thought you went down with the Lusitania.
- Fiver says he did.

260
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,600
They tried but they couldn't get me.
How long have you been living out this way?

261
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,040
I moved from Peckham in 1965.
I couldn't stand that estate any longer.

262
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,880
It's nice and peaceful out here, and I don't
have to save up to get to the seaside.

263
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,720
- You must be retired now.
- I'm living with the family, Joannie's kids.

264
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,200
- Del Boy's not here, is he?
- He's in there having a dance.

265
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,800
He'll be out soon -
he ain't had a drink for four minutes!

266
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,360
- Little Rodney's here as well.
- Oh, no!

267
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,120
Rodney's here? Oh, the little love!

268
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,880
That's him there.

269
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,160
The last time I saw you, you were in your pram.

270
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,200
Who the bloody hell is this woman?

271
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,160
I'm Rodney.

272
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,320
You're little Rodney? Oh, ain't you got big!

273
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,600
You don't remember me, do you, darling?

274
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,920
- No.
- This is Trigger's Aunt Reeny.

275
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,280
She used to be your mum's best friend.

276
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,880
Oh, yeah, me and Joannie, the terrible twins.

277
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
Do you remember when your mum had
that cleaning job down at the town hall?

278
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,160
No.

279
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,320
I used to look after you while she was at work,

280
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,440
bath you and everything.

281
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,920
Remember when I took you
shopping that day in Woolworth's?

282
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,560
No.

283
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,080
As I was pushing you around,
you were picking things off the counter

284
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,920
and I didn't know. But when I got you home
and took you out of the pram,

285
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,240
I found three bottles of scent, a packet
of Weights and a Helen Shapiro record.

286
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,120
So, next day I took you up Selfridge's.

287
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,120
I reckon the rumours were right.
Joannie was never one hundred per cent sure,

288
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,440
but you can see the likeness, can't you?

289
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,440
Do you fancy a dance? I can still
cut a rug with the best of 'em.

290
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,040
Keep your hands to yourself, though.

291
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,560
See you later, love.

292
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,440
- What was all that about?
- God knows.

293
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,240
I remember her from years ago.
She's never been the full ten bob.

294
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,760
Oi, that's my auntie you're talking about.

295
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,200
It must be a family trait, then.

(DISCO MUSIC)

297
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,240
Albert, don't go in there.

298
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,360
Marlene's pulling all the
blokes' shirt-tails out.

299
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,160
No...! Aunt Reeny...?
It ain't Reeny Turpin?

300
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,840
- Remember me, do you?
- Remember you?

301
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,840
Remember you?
I'm still having nightmares about you.

302
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,120
- How are you, sweetheart? Keeping well?
- Smashing, Del.

303
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,360
- You're looking very prosperous.
- Well, you know...

304
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,760
- Life's been pretty good to us, ain't it?
- Yeah, non-stop Mardi Gras.

305
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,240
You look really great. Let's sit down.
I'm cream crackered after that dance.

306
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,520
She used to be a right little raver
in her younger days.

307
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,680
They reckon that, during the war,
she had more Yanks than Eisenhower.

308
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,200
I heard that the Normandy landings
started from her scullery.

309
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,480
- Who are you talking about?
- Trigger's auntie.

310
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,200
When was the last time I saw you?

311
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,360
I moved from Peckham in 1965,
so that's nearly 23 years.

312
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,920
- God!
- You promised to come and see me.

313
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,520
Yeah, well...

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,880
I've been tied up with business and whatever.

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,600
He seems a nice kid, young Rodney.

316
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,680
Yeah. Do you know, he's got a diamond
where other blokes have a heart?

317
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,600
He's a clever kid - he's got GCEs, everything.

318
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,600
Well, he's had you behind him to guide him, Del.

319
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,640
He wouldn't be in this position today
if it hadn't been for you.

320
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,400
I tried to do my best for him.
Kept my promise to Mum.

321
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,680
She'd have been so proud of you two boys.

322
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,400
I reckon that's why I moved down here.

323
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,360
The old place changed when your mum went.

324
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,040
I lost the best friend I ever had.

325
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,360
She was a lovely lady, wasn't she?

326
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,840
If things had worked out a bit better,
you and Rodney could have been millionaires.

327
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,960
Yeah!

328
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,360
I remember visiting her in the hospital

329
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,800
and her saying to me,
"If only I knew where he'd hidden it,

330
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,160
"my boys would be set for life".

331
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,480
- Hidden what?
- The gold.

332
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Gold...? What gold?

333
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,880
- His gold.
- His, he? Who's he?

334
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,040
- Freddy the Frog.
- Who's Freddy the Frog?

335
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,160
- Your mum never told you?
- No.

336
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, me and my mouth. Forget I said anything, Del.

337
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,560
Forget it? How can I forget it?
Come on, you've got to tell me now.

338
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,240
Come on, otherwise I'll find out somewhere else.

339
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,080
It all happened a long time ago.

340
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,000
She met him in about 1959.

341
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,680
- Met who?
- Freddy Robdal.

342
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,600
- Who's Freddy Robdal?
- That was Freddy the Frog's real name.

343
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,360
He was a villain from Rotherhythe.

344
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:51,600
Not a nasty one - no guns or violence.
He was a gentleman thief.

345
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,080
He was a bit of a dandy. He loved French wine
and paintings and what have you.

346
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,120
He had a little holiday chalet down this way.

347
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,480
They reckon when the police broke in,

348
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,720
the walls was covered
in Monets and other originals.

349
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,840
- What has this got to do with my mum?
- Well...

350
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,880
She sort of befriended him.

351
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,720
Yes, she was a very friendly lady.
I mean, she'd help anyone out.

352
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,080
Yes... she used to help Freddy the Frog.

353
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,120
Anyway... one day in August 1963,

354
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,520
Freddy and a little gang

355
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,840
broke into the vaults of a bank up in the City.

356
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,080
They got away with over a quarter
of a million pounds in gold bullion.

357
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,400
The rest of the gang got caught,
but Freddy and the gold got away.

358
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
Well, a short time afterwards,

359
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,840
Freddy, while still on the run,

360
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,880
was tragically killed in a freak accident.

361
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,760
And when they opened his will,
he'd left everything he owned to your mum.

362
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,320
You mean the Monets and all the originals?

363
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,080
No, they had to be returned to the original owners.

364
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,520
The same went for the gold. Except, of course...

365
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,920
that nobody knew
where Freddy had hidden it.

366
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,720
Then your mum left
all her worldly possessions to you,

367
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,120
including the lost gold.

368
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:55,120
So, if that gold was worth a quarter
of a million in 1963,

369
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,520
it must be worth... a million now, or maybe two.

370
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,960
- And it's mine.
- Yours and Rodney's.

371
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,000
It's the same thing.

372
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,080
- I'm a millionaire.
- I know.

373
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,080
Bloody shame no one knows where it's hidden.

374
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah, it is a bit of a choker, ain't it?

375
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,320
I'll get us a refill.

376
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,880
Rodney, I know you may find this hard to believe,

377
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,160
and it may even come as a bit of a shock to you...

378
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,320
We are millionaires.

379
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,000
Good, perhaps we can take
that magnet off the electricity meter.

380
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,760
(DEL TRYING TO SELL MASSAGERS
TO THE CROWD)

381
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,920
Listen to me. Remember in the past
when you had trouble with your Cilla?

382
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,640
The old Cilla Black? What did you do?
You used to stagger down to the quack's.

383
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,960
And you'd pay £2.50
for a prescription, and go to the chemist,

384
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,440
and he'd give you a three-bob tube of Algipan.
Thank goodness those days are over.

385
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,800
They're over
thanks to this revolutionary new device,

386
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,560
the Inframax deep penetration massager.

387
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,080
You two girls, you're miles off. I'm warning you!

388
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,080
This is an osteopedic device
which emits infra-red rays

389
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,640
that penetrate deep into the muscles,
soothing the pain away,

390
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,280
giving you permanent and instant relief.

391
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Seriously, listen to me,
how much would you expect to pay

392
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,640
if you went on Harley Street? How much
do you expect to pay for that? Don't touch it!

393
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,720
You'd expect to pay 70 to 80 pounds
for one of these. Absolutely straight.

394
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,320
But thanks to free enterprise and
a mate of mine who does some smuggling...

395
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,040
..I can let you have
one of these for a mere 15 pounds.

396
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,000
What do you mean? I'll let you have this
for what I paid for it, 14 pounds.

397
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,880
Come on, it's 14... snatch it off me!

398
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,160
You won't get... Would you move on, sir?
I'm trying to do some business here.

399
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,720
- Sure.
- All right!

400
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,560
Listen, I don't care whether you've got
earache, neckache, backache,

401
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,880
or even any other sort of ache.

402
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,960
- This little device will cure it.
- Try it on him, then.

403
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,440
- Do what?
- Try it on the old fellow.

404
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,480
No, I don't want
to do my batteries up.

405
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,440
Anyway, that's probably not backache.
That's body language.

406
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,880
I think he's trying
to tell you something.

407
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,880
No, it's rheumatics, son.
I've suffered with it for years.

408
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,160
- Try your massager on him.
- (CROWD): Yeah.

409
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,680
All right... All right, I will.

410
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,720
That soppy little thing
won't do me no good.

411
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,240
My back has been under experts.
Confounded the medical world, my back has.

412
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,800
Well, let me try. It can't do any harm.

413
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,680
Give me a try, come on, slip your coat off.

414
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,880
That's it... I see you're a naval war hero, sir.

415
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,600
40 years before the mast
fighting for King and Country.

416
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,640
I don't believe it! Groan, old git!

417
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,280
- Groan, groan!
- God, my back!

418
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,760
That's it. Remember, no sudden movements.

419
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,360
Not until I've applied the healing rays
of the Inframax deep penetration massager.

420
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,120
Here we go! Here it is. Can you feel that, sir?

421
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:42,440
Do you feel the relaxing warmth soothing
the pain and tension away in the lumbar region?

422
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,080
Yeah, it's very therapeutic.
I've never had this done to me before.

423
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,800
Coming from an old sailor,
that is saying something, ain't it?

424
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,160
This is lovely.
My back feels better already.

425
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,720
- There you are.
- Look, I can stand straight.

426
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,040
I haven't been able
to stand up for years.

427
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,320
I don't believe him!
What is he doing to me?

428
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,920
- He's just a stooge.
- He's part of the act.

429
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,360
No, he ain't... No!

430
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,400
- We've never met before, have we?
- No, Del. We haven't.

431
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,320
Come here!

432
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,720
You told me to get better
in front of the crowd.

433
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,720
I know. I didn't ask you to do
the third act from Singing in the Rain!

434
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,000
You came round the corner
looking like Old Father Time.

435
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,360
One rub of my massager
and you turned into Wayne Sleep.

436
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm not used to all this market spieling.
Why not get Rodney to do it?

437
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,680
Because he starts his new job today.
He can't be in two places at the same time.

438
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,440
Clear all this lot up, will you?

439
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,680
It ain't bloody fair. I fought
a war for the younger generation.

440
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,280
Yeah? What side were you on?

441
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,040
- Del Boy, Albert.
- Trig.

442
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,600
- Good wedding, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was mustard.

443
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,080
Lisa and Andy were double pleased with
that dinner service. It must have cost a fortune.

444
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,720
That's all right, Trig.
Anything for the young couple.

445
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,000
- Here comes money.
- Did you see his crappy present?

446
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,920
No, I didn't catch that, no.

447
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,040
A load of cheap old plates, the kind
you get in a bad Chinese restaurant.

448
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,240
That's typical of him, ain't it?
That's why he's so rich, from being so tight.

449
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,760
Yeah, he is tight.

450
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,600
He's the sort of bloke that buys
a tin of baked beans on Tuesday

451
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,320
so he can have a bubble bath on Wednesday.

452
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,240
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Boycie.

453
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,960
Another fine day in Gotham City?

454
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, Trigger, the wedding seemed
to go off well, all things considered.

455
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,720
Yeah, it was all right.

456
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,600
Did Lisa and what's-his-name
find time to look at my present?

457
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,800
Yeah, they looked at it.
Not for long, though.

458
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,960
- What about his little gift?
- They put it straight in their display cabinet.

459
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,280
Peasants!

460
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,200
Talking of the wedding,
there's something I wanted to ask you two.

461
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,080
Think back to the early '60s.
Do you remember Freddy the Frog?

462
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,480
Freddy the Frog?
No, it don't ring a bell.

463
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,440
I remember Torchy the Battery Boy.

464
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,800
What about Twizzle?

465
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,440
I don't believe you two!
I just don't believe you!

466
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,280
Hang on. Hats off!

467
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,640
(BOYCIE): Your minicab's arrived,
Albert.

468
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,440
Boycie!

469
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,040
Is that Dave?

470
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,200
Yeah.

471
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,040
You git! You rotten git!

472
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,160
You never told me
my new job was a chief mourner.

473
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,600
Rodney, show some respect!

474
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,200
- What's he doing?
- Just you wait, Del! Just you wait.

475
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,760
(DUST-CART HONKS)

476
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,000
Why are you taking us down here? It's No Entry.

477
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:06,080
Yeah, sorry, Mr Jahan.
I was talking to my brother... Sorry.

478
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,680
Um... Could you just back up
a little bit, please?

479
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,360
Would you mind
backing up a little bit, please?

480
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,440
What's the trouble?
(IGNITION FAILS)

481
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,920
I can't stand it any more. What a plonker!

482
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,120
Excuse me!

483
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,000
Yes, I'm finding this rather upsetting, too.

484
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,400
- Do you know the bloke in the hearse?
- No, I know the bloke in the Cortina.

485
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,880
I sold it to him last week.

486
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,320
(RODNEY): You're a liar.
(DEL): I swear to you,

487
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,840
(DEL): I did not know what your duties
would be. Mr Jahan never told me.

488
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,680
(RODNEY): Did not know, my arse.!

489
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,680
(RODNEY): You set me up to get money.
(DEL): Yeah, every little helps, Rodney.

490
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,520
Anyway, I thought that black suit
looked really good on you.

491
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,840
No, it didn't. I saw a reflection of myself
in a window. I looked like a wand.

492
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,320
You told me I'd be
a trainee computer programmer.

493
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,520
And are you not
programming his computer?

494
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,320
Yes, I am programming his computer.
I'm also an apprentice pallbearer,

495
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,640
a fully-fledged chief mourner,
and I have to go and get the sandwiches!

496
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,960
As long as you've got job satisfaction.
That's the main thing.

497
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, I've not got job satisfaction.
Matter of fact, I'm thinking of resigning.

498
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,160
You'd better hurry up
before he sacks you.

499
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,200
That big traffic jam was not my fault.
Name one person who blamed me.

500
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,440
- Mr Jahan did.
- The grieving relatives did.

501
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,520
The Flying Eye did.

502
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,320
It wasn't my fault the differential
on the Cortina seized up.

503
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,320
I called for the RAC and they called
for a tow-truck, but it couldn't get through.

504
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,440
- Why?
- Because of the big traffic jam.

505
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,920
- Anyway, it went off all right in the end.
- Yeah, in the end.

506
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,200
You could have started a trend.
Floodlit funerals could be all the rage.

507
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,800
(DEL LAUGHS)

508
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,080
I don't want to talk more about it.
I've got more important things on my mind.

509
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,920
We're not getting back to Freddy
the bleeding Frog again, are we?

510
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,480
Yes, we are!

511
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,240
There's a million quid's worth of gold
out there, and it's mine... ours.

512
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,440
You are something else, you are.

513
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,320
A drunken old woman spins you some
cock-and-bull story, and you fall for it.

514
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,000
Listen! Just because Reeny was a
good-time girl who liked the occasional tizer,

515
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,640
that was all right,
she was never a liar.

516
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,720
Anyway, I've been out to see
a few faces this afternoon.

517
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,000
I've got some information: they have
confirmed it, all right, about the robbery,

518
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,200
the gold bullion
never being found, the lot.

519
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,640
How can you be sure
it hasn't been found?

520
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
Over the past few years,
every policeman

521
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
and underworld figure in the country
must have been looking for that gold.

522
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,600
And what would they
have done with it?

523
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,080
They'd either put it through a fence,
which meant it becomes public knowledge,

524
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,280
or they smelt it down themselves,
right?

525
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,320
If they do that, that amount of gold
coming onto the market causes ripples.

526
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,240
The sort of ripples that would be
remembered for a long time.

527
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,280
- What if the police found it?
- I'm talking about the police.

528
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,240
The chaps never found it either.
I had a chat with the Driscoll brothers.

529
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,360
- You went and saw the Driscoll brothers?
- What are they like?

530
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,000
They're smashing blokes. It's like bumping
into the two Ronnies, Biggs and Kray.

531
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,080
And they never sussed out
why you were asking questions?

532
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,840
No! You know
what they're like, don't you?

533
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,320
A couple of years ago, some guru reckoned
the world would end within a month.

534
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,400
And Danny Driscoll
bet a grand that it would.

535
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,080
And he's the brains of the outfit.

536
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,200
The only trouble was, I kept on
having to refer to Freddy the Frog.

537
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,480
I couldn't remember his real surname.
It was Robson or something like that.

538
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,880
- Robdal.
- Robdal, that's what it was.

539
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,520
I was trying to think of that all afternoon.

540
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,240
Just a minute! Did you know him?

541
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,760
Yeah, vaguely.

542
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,960
Well, why didn't you say?

543
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,160
First time I met him, he was just a kid,
18, 19 - different age group from me.

544
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,480
And over the years
I used to bump into him every so often.

545
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,680
Usually in one
of the pubs down the docks.

546
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,120
He was a very likeable bloke,
very generous.

547
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,640
He was very tall and handsome.

548
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,880
Everybody liked him, especially the women.
They used to fall over themselves for him.

549
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,480
Yes, yes.
What about the gold bullion?

550
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,720
- He robbed a bank in the City.
- We know all that, don't we?

551
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,080
What happened after the robbery?

552
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,880
About a week after, Freddy and
an explosives expert called Jelly Kelly

553
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,840
broke into a post office...
in Plumstead, that's right.

554
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,640
And then, apparently, they'd wired
the explosives, everything going well

555
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:35,040
when, nobody knew why,
Freddy the Frog sat on the detonator.

556
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,400
They found him up on the roof...

557
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,520
of a building across the road.

558
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,200
All right. What happened
to the other mush, Kelly the Jelly?

559
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,800
He was holding the nitroglycerine
when Freddy sat down.

560
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,880
So he didn't survive, either.

561
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,920
Well, if he did,
he'd be no good in a Mexican wave.

562
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,280
I don't know.
It's the same story wherever I go.

563
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,880
Freddy the Frog took the secret with him.

564
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,480
- Maybe he shipped the gold abroad.
- No, there wouldn't have been time.

565
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,280
It was only a week between him doing
the job and hitting the snooze button.

566
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,520
There's another thing that's confusing me.

567
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,480
If that Freddy was going out
with a married woman on this estate,

568
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,800
why did he leave
all his money to our mum?

569
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,800
It's a mystery, ain't it?

570
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,360
I'll make some tea.

571
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,600
There's another thing.
I was talking to one of them Driscoll heavies,

572
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,120
and he reckons that Freddy
had a son by that woman.

573
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,840
That's just a rumour, Del. I'd take no notice.

574
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,680
No. If it was true, that boy would
be in his mid-twenties by now.

575
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,760
Still, he don't know who his dad was,
so he can't make a claim on the fortune, can he?

576
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,400
Look at this, Rod. There you are!

577
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,120
Look, we're millionaires, and we're getting
threatening letters from the milkman.

578
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,640
This Freddy the Frog.
Did he have any hobbies or pastimes?

579
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,080
Hobbies or pastimes? We're looking for his gold,
not his bloody tennis rackets.

580
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,560
I just thought the more we found out about him,
the more we know how his mind works.

581
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,640
Yeah, all right,
good thinking, Rodney.

582
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,480
He was a bit of an artist,
wasn't he, Albert?

583
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah, a good artist.

584
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,880
They reckon if he hadn't been a tea-leaf,
he could have made a very good forger.

585
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,120
Well, that got us a lot closer.
Problem solved! That's it!

586
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,280
I'll go to bed,
and say good night to you two.

587
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,640
(DEL): Good night.
(RODNEY): Good night.

588
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,040
- Albert...
- They're rumours, Rodney.

589
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,640
That's all, rumours.

590
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,280
Good night, son.

591
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,840
(DEL): Rodney, don't forget you've got to be
down the morgue by half nine.

592
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,960
We'll just finish this and we'll pop down
the market and do a bit with the massagers.

593
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,360
And this time, when I've finished
operating on you, no tap-dancing!

594
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,840
Straighten up slowly,
like it's a miracle.

595
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,320
- Del, got it!
- What's that about?

596
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,440
Don't know.
Looks like "Peace in our time".

597
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,000
What is that all about? Sit down!

598
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,800
This morning, Mr Jahan asked me to transfer
all his old files on to computer.

599
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,280
- My computer?
- Yeah, read that.

600
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,880
- No, it's a summons, isn't it?
- No.

601
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,320
It's one of Mr Jahan's
order forms from July 1963.

602
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Look who ordered one coffin to be
specially made - one Frederick Robdal.

603
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,760
But it was ordered five weeks before the robbery
and six weeks before he blew himself up.

604
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,560
- Don't you see what it means?
- He had a premonition.

605
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,680
You berk!

606
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:31,840
No, wait a minute. Look! This casket
was ordered by Mr Frederick Robdal,

607
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,760
but it was made
for a Mr Alfred Broderick.

608
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,920
- Who's Alfred Broderick?
- No, look at the two names closely.

609
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,000
It's an anagram.

610
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,640
Yeah, I can see that, but who was he?

611
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,240
No...! Bloody hell!

612
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,480
- Look, if you transpose all the letters...
- Transpose?

613
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,000
If you mix up all the letters
from Frederick Robdal,

614
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,920
it becomes Alfred Broderick.

615
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,000
In other words, Broderick never existed.
He's just one of Freddy's aliases.

616
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,480
He's right an' all!

617
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,880
So what you're saying is that... he put...

618
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,200
- The bullion...
- Into the coffin.

619
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,840
And then got the Co-op to hide it,
or in this case Mr Jahan.

620
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,600
That's right. It was all legal and above-board.
It was probably paraded through them streets.

621
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,760
I'll bet he even got the Old Bill
to hold up the traffic for it.

622
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,600
And then it was buried with all the usual honours.

623
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,920
All Freddy had to do was bide
his time and then come back for it.

624
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,560
You two seem to be forgetting something.
You're not talking about the family pet.

625
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,840
If what you're suggesting is right, he'd
have needed permission from the authorities.

626
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,080
He'd have needed official documentation,
and lots and lots of it.

627
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,040
So where does he get all that?

628
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,280
You always have to spoil things.

629
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:04,000
No, wait a minute!
I think I've cracked it.

630
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,280
Listen! Way back in the early '60s
when you were just a nipper,

631
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,360
Mum got herself a job
down at the town hall as a secretary.

632
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,560
- Secretary?
- Yes.

633
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,120
One of her duties was hoovering out
the registrar's department.

634
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,400
It means she could get her hands
on all the documents he needed

635
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,880
and mark them with the official stamp.

636
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,520
God, of course!

637
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,440
Rodney, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to help me with embalming.

638
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,240
Sorry, Mr Jahan, I took an early lunch.

639
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,080
All right, Mr Jahan. Come and sit down
for a minute. I'd like to have a chat with you.

640
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,760
Rodney found this in your files.

641
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,480
- This is confidential material!
- I know. It shows how keen he is.

642
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,640
He's bringing his homework
to lunch with him.

643
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,120
Do you remember this man,
Mr Frederick Robdal?

644
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,480
Yes, I remember him very well,
a most charming man.

645
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,240
My father had just bought the business.
Mr Robdal was one of our first clients.

646
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,280
Another reason it sticks out in my mind is because
he ordered an extra large casket to be made.

647
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,680
And I expect his mate, Mr Broderick,
was an extra large chap, was he?

648
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,040
- I don't know. We didn't handle the funeral.
- What?

649
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,880
We simply supplied the casket.
Mr Robdal came and took it in a van one night.

650
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,520
You mean it was a take-away?

651
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Mr Robdal told us it was to be a private
affair. We didn't question his decision.

652
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,200
We didn't want to intrude upon his grief,
and we needed the business.

653
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,120
Wait a minute... Does that mean
that you don't know where it's buried?

654
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,960
As I said, I don't know. It was a private affair.
I must go now.

655
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,760
- How long will you be? We have a lot of work.
- I'll come soon.

656
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,000
- That's the end of that.
- You'll never find it now.

657
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,680
- Yes, we will.
- The gold has been missing for 24 years.

658
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,600
And the last thing anyone saw of Freddy
was on a radar screen. What chance have we?

659
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,440
Listen to me! He would have
buried it somewhere local.

660
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,800
He would have stuck to an area that he knew well.
This is what we'll do:

661
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
I'll go to the flower man in the market
to get some tulips on sale or return,

662
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,360
and you'll go and visit every graveyard
and cemetery in the district,

663
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,800
and read every name
on every headstone.

664
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,840
And when you leave, leave a flower
as if you're one of the relatives.

665
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,280
- But there's thousands of them.
- All right, say you come from a big family.

666
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,480
I want you to do the same in your travels.
It's a bit like a busman's holiday for you.

667
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,760
In the meantime,
I'll check the records at the town hall,

668
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,680
stonemasons, churches, that sort of thing.

669
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,120
Don't worry, brother, we'll find it!

670
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,200
Del, I don't want to be the prophet of doom,
but I feel we're wasting our time.

671
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Time that could be spent more productively
in earning some money and paying bills.

672
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,680
We owe two months' rent,
we drink tea with no milk in it,

673
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,760
and the electricity board keeps calling
to see why their meter is running backwards.

674
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,920
There's food in the cupboard, isn't there?

675
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,920
Yeah, thanks to my pension
and Rodney's wages.

676
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,720
It wouldn't be a bad idea
for you to drive down to Hampshire

677
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,240
and pick up
that computer money off the vicar.

678
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,000
Leave it out! That gold
must be here hidden somewhere.

679
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,160
It can't have disappeared.
This is Peckham, not the Bermuda Triangle.

680
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,640
And as for me going all the way
down to Hampshire to pick up 120 quid,

681
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:48,560
that's like admitting defeat, a sign that I've
given up hope of ever finding my birthright.

682
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,960
That is not my style.

683
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:57,480
When Del Trotter says he's going to
do something, Del Trotter does it!

684
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,680
You see what I mean, Mr Trotter!
I've tried everything and it simply refuses to work.

685
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,760
- Has it received a whack of any kind?
- No, I assure you!

686
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,560
There you are,
that's all it needed.

687
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,080
Yes... Of course. I'm not
technically-minded like you.

688
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,800
Some of these hi-tech advancements,
they need a bit of encouragement.

689
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,400
Well, if you just give me my money,
I'll bid you farewell.

690
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,800
- I'm afraid I shan't be needing the computer.
- What?

691
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,960
As I said at the wedding, I couldn't honestly
see what part a computer could play

692
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,720
in the daily running
of a small parish such as this.

693
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,600
And my words have been borne out.

694
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,760
I know, but if it had been working properly,
you would have seen the benefits.

695
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm terribly sorry, and I'm grateful to you
for giving me it for two weeks on approval,

696
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,160
but I simply have no need of it.

697
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,600
Well... I can't take it back now.

698
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,720
- It's been used.
- Of course, you told me to use it!

699
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,720
I know, but you've taken it out
of the protective wrapping.

700
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,240
And look at that,
it's had a whack there, look!

701
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,920
- But you just did that.
- Yes, I know that.

702
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,680
But I'm not a technician, am I?
I'm merely a salesman, that's all.

703
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,840
What am I going to tell my guv'nor?
I'm going to have to go to him and say

704
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,680
that you took it out of the protective
wrapping, you messed about with it,

705
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,360
you let an unqualified wally repair it,
and now you want to elbow it.

706
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,480
No, I'm sorry. Look, that machine was
in perfect condition when I loaned it to you.

707
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,280
Look at it now, look.
It's second-hand, isn't it?

708
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,040
- But...
- All right, as you are a man of the cloth.

709
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,520
And seeing that you're the one who naused it up,
I'll tell you what I'm going to do:

710
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,160
I'll let you have that
for the second-hand price.

711
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,720
- Give me 100 notes and we'll say no more.
- I don't want the computer.

712
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,040
But this computer is the top of the range.
This is the Silver Cloud of computers.

713
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,120
There are thousands of people pouring out
of London into the new houses in your parish.

714
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,560
Your flock is increasing. You'll need
one of these to keep a check on them all.

715
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:07,560
I wish that were true. Unfortunately, few people
seem to require the services of my church.

716
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,520
It seems a pity to me that there aren't
more like our mutual friend, Mr Robdal.

717
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,040
- What?
- I do apologise.

718
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,560
I couldn't help overhearing you and
Mrs Turpin discussing Mr Robdal at the wedding.

719
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,680
- You mean you knew Freddy the Frog?
- I'm sorry?

720
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,320
I mean, you knew Frederick Robdal?

721
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,400
Many years ago,
when I came to St Mary's first.

722
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,960
He had a holiday home
a few miles from here.

723
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,800
He used to look in
if he was down this way.

724
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,160
A charming and very generous man.
He donated the stained-glass windows.

725
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,080
In fact, he loved this church so much,
his parents are buried here.

726
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,040
Well, that's nice.
Did you ever meet his friend, Mr Broderick?

727
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,560
- Alfred Broderick?
- That's him.

728
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,800
Well, yes. Not to say "meet" in the conventional
sense. I had the duty of laying him to rest.

729
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,680
He must have been rather a large man.
It took eight of us to carry him from the hearse.

730
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,280
Yeah, well, he was an anagram.

731
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,680
Could you tell me
where you buried it? Buried him...

732
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,920
- I'd like to pay my last respects.
- It'll be here in the records.

733
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,560
He must have been
very close to Mr Robdal.

734
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,760
I've never forgotten the way
that he kept patting the coffin.

735
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,960
- Contained his grief behind a smile.
- Yeah, we were all a bit choked.

736
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,360
Yes, here we are.

737
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,640
Now, about the computer...

738
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,760
Don't worry about that. Give it to the jumble sale.
It's only rubbish.

739
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,480
- What do you put in that thing?
- It's me own recipe.

740
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,720
Dutch tobacco, Navy Shag,
and a spoonful of rum to keep it moist.

741
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,920
Smell the salt, Rodney?

742
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,400
- You put condiments in it as well?
- I'm talking about the ozone in the air.

743
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,400
It takes me back.

744
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,840
Funny how a smell
can start the mind turning.

745
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,720
Not to mention the stomach.

746
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,640
Rodney, I know where it's buried.

747
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,920
What?

748
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,160
- You mean here?
- Here.

749
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,040
Come on! Albert, bring that shovel.

750
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,440
Del, you cannot dig up a grave
in broad daylight.

751
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,920
I know there's nothing actually in it
except for gold bullion,

752
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,960
but if anyone saw us doing it,
they might not understand.

753
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,040
Come over here. Over here!

754
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,120
This is it. This is where he buried it.

755
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,960
- Where?
- There.

756
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:11,480
(RODNEY): A burial at sea? Why?

757
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,440
How did he ever hope
to get the gold back?

758
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,720
There are one or two things
that our dear uncle forgot to inform us of.

759
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,920
Like he told us that he met Freddy,
but he didn't say where and how.

760
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,280
I met him when he was doing
his national service in the navy.

761
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,800
Yes, he was a sailor!
He also omitted to tell us

762
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,280
how he got the nickname
"Freddy the Frog".

763
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,920
We assumed it was because
of his love of all things French.

764
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,920
No, it was 'cause he was a frogman.

765
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,280
Yes, it was because he was a frogman.

766
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,280
I know that now. I've just got
the full S.P. off the vicar.

767
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,400
Why didn't you tell us?

768
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,000
You know me.
I never talk about my days at sea.

769
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,760
We knew that Freddy had a chalet
down here at the coast.

770
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,600
If we'd also known he was
an ex-sailor and a deep sea diver,

771
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,440
we may have been able
to put two and two together.

772
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,040
Yes, and you might
have saved us a fortnight

773
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,040
of creeping round every cemetery
and churchyard in South London.

774
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,480
If you knew it was buried at sea,
why did you ask me to bring this shovel?

775
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,000
So I can whack you
on the bloody head with it!

776
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,640
Take it easy!

777
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,320
He gives me the hump, Rodney.
He gives me the right steaming hump.

778
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,360
It was beautiful,
it was really beautiful.

779
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,040
He got all the authentic paperwork,
a pukka ceremony, kosher vicar.

780
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,000
He even got two off-duty policemen
to help him carry the coffin to the boat.

781
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,640
All he had to do
was wait for the dust to settle

782
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,960
and come back with the frogman gear
to dive and get it.

783
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,720
He must have known these waters well.
He'd probably been diving them for years.

784
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,200
It's out there, Rodney.
It's out there, our legacy!

785
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,080
Nothing you can do about it now, Del.

786
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,520
I'm not leaving it there.
"The sea shall not have it."

787
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,640
I shall bring it to the surface.
We can do it.

788
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,400
I have faith in you, Rodney!

789
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,760
How do... Me? What do you mean
you've got faith in me?

790
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,680
Listen, I can get you
all the flippers and the goggles.

791
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,800
You're the only one
in the family who can swim.

792
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,240
All I ever got
was a 50-yard certificate at school.

793
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,080
You only need to swim 50 yards...
down!

794
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,240
On your bike!

795
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,120
Where are you gonna start searching?
You've got 500 square miles of ocean.

796
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,280
It took them 70 years
to find the Titanic,

797
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,480
so what chance have we got
with an outsize coffin?

798
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:00,320
We've got to do something.
He who dares wins.

799
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,280
There's a million quid's worth
of gold out there, Rodney.

800
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,000
Our gold. We can't
just say bongjoor to it.

801
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,920
- Do I look like him?
- It was just a rumour, son.

802
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,640
- Do I look like him?
- A bit.

803
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,160
I always felt as if I was a bit different
from the rest of the family.

804
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,480
- A bit of a cuckoo.
- Just a rumour.

805
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:43,440
Freddy the Frog. Killed himself
by sitting on someone else's detonator.

806
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,160
What a plonker!

807
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Come on.
Let's talk about it over a pint.

808
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,400
(DEL): Yeah, I expect you're right, bruv.

809
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,560
But in the words of General MacArthur:
"I will be back soon".

810
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,240
I'm not leaving our birthright down there
in Davey Smith's locker, no way.

811
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,720
I tell you, Rodders, this time
next year, we will be millionaires.

812
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,360
# We've got some half-price cracked ice
and miles and miles of carpet tiles

813
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,360
# TVs, deep freeze and David Bowie LPs

814
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,400
# Ball games, gold chains,
what's-their-names and at a push

815
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,480
# Trevor Francis track suits
from a mush in Shepherds Bush

816
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,240
# Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush

817
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,240
# No income tax, no VAT

818
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,360
# No money back, no guarantee

819
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,520
# Black or white, rich or poor,

820
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,960
# We'll cut prices at a stroke

821
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,240
# God bless Hooky Street,

822
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,280
# Viva Hooky Street

823
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,240
# Long live Hooky Street

824
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,280
# C'est magnifique, Hooky Street

825
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,720
# Magnifique, Hooky Street

826
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,160
# Hooky Street #
