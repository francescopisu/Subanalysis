1
00:00:49,752 --> 00:00:53,286
- 29 pounds and forty 48.
- Sorry?

2
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:59,630
- 29 pounds and forty 48.
- Did you sue 'em?

3
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:01,472
- Who?
- The charm school.

4
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:11,922
Miserable little cow!

5
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:16,757
Yeah, right, we won't come here again. In future we'll
take our custom down to Patel's Multi-Mart.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,734
They might be a bit dearer but at least
they smile when they take yer money...

7
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,942
Rodney, what's is the matter with you?

8
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:28,563
It's him innit! Whacked me straight
in the shins with that shopping trolley.

9
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:31,414
I couldn't help it!
That trolley had a mind of its own.

10
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:35,517
Oh, what are you saying,
it was intellectually superior to you, is that it?

11
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:40,108
- Don't get sarky Rodney, it don't become yer!
- Well, a broken leg don't become...

12
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,916
Alright you two, tuck it in, will ya.

13
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:48,582
Excuse me, one moment Gentlemen.
Tom Clark, Topbuy Superstores.

14
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,372
I wonder if I could
have five minutes of your time please?

15
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:53,899
Certainly Tom. Why what's up then?

16
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,096
If you'd like to accompany me
to the manager's office I'll explain there.

17
00:01:57,295 --> 00:01:59,168
Here, just a minute - what is
your g...? 

18
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,924
Oh yes.

19
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:12,141
- Can I help you with any of the shopping?
- Oh thanks a lot. Lead on MacDougal!

20
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:26,488
But Valerie...darling, listen to me for
a moment! Why do you want to buy a brand-new car?

21
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:28,012
Alright ta.

22
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,516
Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you back there, but I'm
trying to give up smoking you see...

23
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,149
That's alright son, forget it.
Er, I wonder which one of us it is?

24
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:36,166
What d'you mean?

25
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:39,168
Well, there can only be one
millionth customer can't there!

26
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,647
Yeah, well it's got to be me
innit, 'cos I paid for it all didn't I?

27
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:45,712
- Yeah, but I gave you my housekeeping!
- And I gave you half my pension!

28
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:49,684
- Alright, alright, don't go on about it!
- Del, we'll share the money fairly!

29
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,803
- Alright, leave it to me, Rodney.
- No, we'll share it fairly!

30
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:59,652
Look I can't talk now, somebody's come into the office!
No, I'm not quite sure what time I'll be home darling.

31
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,388
You're not cooking anything special are you?
Entrecote Rioja...

32
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,278
Yes, my favourite! I'll give you
a call just before I leave. Bye.

33
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,074
- The wife!
- Whose?

34
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:16,976
Well Tom. So, what's it all about?

35
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,304
I stopped these gentlemen as
they were leaving the store sir,

36
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:22,536
because I have reason to believe they have some
stolen items in their possession!

37
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,986
- Dear, dear, dear!
- Stolen items??

38
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,305
- What are you on about??
- We paid for these groceries!!

39
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,175
That's right, twenty nine
pounds and forty eight pence.

40
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:35,453
- Ask the girl at the checkout!
- They came quietly sir, usually a sign of guilt!

41
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:38,154
Of course we did, because we
thought we'd won the prize didn't we?

42
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,544
- Alright Tom leave it with me ...and well done.
- Thank you sir.

43
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:50,659
Come on, come on, let's go,
let's go.

44
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:54,597
Gentlemen, if I press this button, security will be
waiting for you outside the door.

45
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,771
And it might appear to the magistrate that you
were trying to evade arrest!

46
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,684
Now wait a minute. Look, we paid for all these goods –
and we've got a bill to prove it!

47
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,683
- Ah yes, and we've got a bill to prove it!
- Show him the bill Rodney!

48
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,757
- What?
- The bill!

49
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:12,660
- I ain't got it!
- Well of course you must. One of you must have!

50
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:16,026
- Don't look at me I never even saw it!
- Yes you did, because I paid for it, don't you remember...

51
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,348
She took it out the till.
Actually we haven't got the bill!

52
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:20,867
What a shame.

53
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:25,297
Gentlemen, there are two ways of
handling this unfortunate situation.

54
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:30,064
One; we can remain here in the office
and discuss it like civilized people, or two;

55
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:37,074
I can call the police! Why don't you talk it over
amongst yourselves while I carry on with this.

56
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,045
There must be some way of
proving we paid for all this!

57
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,243
There most probably is Albert, but what happens
if the Old Bill starts asking questions

58
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:50,000
- …about all my gear and Rodney's watch??
- Yeah I s'pose you're right.

59
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,666
You mean my watch is
knocked off?

60
00:04:57,072 --> 00:05:00,481
Listen, it's alright, it's not up to us
to prove our innocence, right.

61
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:01,874
It's up to them to prove our guilt.

62
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,733
So, all we've got to do is say
nothing at all. Right. Just keep schtum!

63
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:07,936
We'll be out of here in ten minutes flat,
alright.

64
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,891
Hello there, how are you?
I'm very well thank you.

65
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,672
Lovely weather for this time of
year, isn't it? Yes it is, yes.

66
00:05:31,574 --> 00:05:33,973
'Some enchanted evening.'

67
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:47,788
Allow me. That's very reasonable isn't it?
I think I'll have two.

68
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,383
You take care now.

69
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:30,623
- Mr Clarke!
- It's alright Sheila, I've seen him, leave it to me.

70
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:45,986
- 20 Rothmans and a box of matches, please love.
- That's one pound forty six please.

71
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:49,098
Put it on my account! You
take care now.

72
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:52,442
You come back here with that stuff!

73
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:58,374
Alright son, this is the end
of your fun and games!

74
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,156
What have I done?? Oh no?

75
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,355
Don't tell me, I haven't
paid for these have I?

76
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:07,681
Haven't paid for? Get back
in there, you're nicked!

77
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,641
No, no, I have this problem
you se, memory blanks!

78
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,228
Get in there!

79
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:17,887
Listen to me man. The other
day I went into Woolworths.

80
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:20,388
When I got home I had a pair of binoculars,

81
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:26,160
12 packets of Strepsils and a roof rack
for a Cortina and I didn't know!!

82
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,614
Yes, tell that to the manager,
you're going up to the office.

83
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:31,906
Please man. I'll go away for
this. Look, I've only just come out!

84
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:34,361
You should have thought of that before-hand!
Come on, up to the office.

85
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:38,081
Please man, don't take me up to
the office. Give me a break will yer??

86
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,692
I'll give you a break if
you keep on! Come on.

87
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,006
Look, please don't take me
up to the office!

88
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:56,432
That's a very nasty habit you got there you know.
You can lose your teeth doing that.

89
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,206
How would you know that?

90
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,295
'Cos I'm gonna run my fist right
down your throat if you don't pack it in!!

91
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,921
Well Rodney, he's giving me
the right hump he really is.

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,942
Don't take me to the office!

93
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,058
Here's another one for you.

94
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,994
- Open up the safe!
- Alright son, now take it easy!

95
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,602
Who are they?

96
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:22,775
Er, they, they're here on
suspicion of shoplifting.

97
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:24,269
Move.

98
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,032
Ain't I seen you somewhere
before?

99
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,185
No, no, no. I ain't been anywhere before,
have I Rodney, eh?

100
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,897
No, no. He's stays at home
all the time.

101
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,494
- Go on, open up the safe.
- Yes, of course!

102
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:50,233
- I'm a right villain I am! A real hard nut!
- Yes triffic! Yes.

103
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:54,766
- Hey, what's with the hands in the air?
- Well you've got a gun in your other hand, haven't you noticed?

104
00:08:55,031 --> 00:09:00,013
Come on, let's not be formal, put 'em down.
D'you know the secret of my success?

105
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:09,310
Planning! No detail is left unturned, no stone unchecked.
I plan everything down to the last second!

106
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:13,853
Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry
but I can't open the safe!

107
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:15,432
What's he say to me??

108
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,079
Come on now, don't be a prat sir!
Open the safe for the nice man.

109
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:23,409
I can't open it, the combination won't work!
What's the time?

110
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,200
- It's about twenty past five.
- No, it's quarter past six.

111
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:34,287
Bloody watch, it's always going wrong! Me mum only
bought it for me a month ago down the market!

112
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:42,237
I didn't realise it was that late!
I won't be able to open the safe.

113
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:46,129
You see, it's fitted with a time-lock
which comes into operation at 6 o' clock.

114
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:47,208
Is this true??

115
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,687
Yeah, I'm sorry son, you're
15 minutes late!

116
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:54,749
Bloody watch!! So when does
it switch off?

117
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,047
Tomorrow at 8am!

118
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,880
Oh great! Well thank you very much!
So what am I supposed to do now?

119
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,439
Can't you come back first
thing in the morning?

120
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:12,253
No I can't - I have got
other things to do you know!

121
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,879
Oh well, I suppose there's
nothing else for it!

122
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,292
We'll have to wait!

123
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,330
Wait? What are you talking about.
Well that's 14 hours!!

124
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:34,914
Look, I don't wanna stay in here any more than what you
do! But have you any idea how much is in that safe?

125
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,686
- About sixty grand!
- You're kidding.

126
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:44,263
I'm afraid not, Friday is our
busiest day.

127
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:56,727
See planning! Let's all settle down now.
It's only 14 hours, it'll soon go. Sit down!!

128
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:06,507
And I had a date tonight too, with that croupier bird
from the 1-11 Club.

129
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:11,589
Charming sort. She's well spoken,
cordon blue cook and does the business!

130
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,678
It could be months before
I have another crack at her!

131
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,431
Yeah, I am well choked for you, ain't I.

132
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:36,512
Got any cigars on you?

133
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,693
No, no, I smoked me last one
about an hour ago.

134
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:42,223
Anyway this'll help you to pack it
up, won't it, eh?

135
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,859
Oh yeah, a gun at yer head's
just the sort of incentive you need innit!

136
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:55,268
He ain't gonna hurt no one! He's just a kid tryin' to
get some money. He's more frightened than us.

137
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,393
 Aah bless him!

138
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:05,799
Are you still there son?

139
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,933
Yeah, what d'you want?

140
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,574
Just wondering about if we can have some lights on. You
know, see what we was up to, know what I mean.

141
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:18,692
- But passers-by might see the light!
- No, no, not if you pull the blinds, right?

142
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:26,000
- Okay, I want you to do exactly as I say.
- Anything you say son, you're the boss.

143
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:29,531
I want you to switch that light on 
then pull them blinds down.

144
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:35,534
No, no, hang on. What you want to do is
pull down the blind then switch on the light!

145
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:40,863
Oh yeah, thanks. Right,
I want you to pull them blinds then...

146
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:43,112
Yes, yeah I think I've got it!

147
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,614
D'you know what the police
have nicknamed me?

148
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:01,165
I've got a shrewd idea, but
no, go on!

149
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:04,013
I'm known as The Shadow!

150
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:10,569
Because I'm fast and fleeting,
I come and I go and no-one knows!

151
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,548
Come and go do you? It's gonna take you
14 bleedin' hours to come and go in here!

152
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:17,852
I've known epidemics come
and go quicker than you!

153
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,658
I didn't know that safe was
on a time lock.

154
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,886
No, I'm a man of mystery me! A master
of disguises - the man with the thousand faces!

155
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:30,262
Do you remember the Scarlet
Pimpernel?

156
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,107
That weren't you was it?

157
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:38,134
No, but I'm like him!

158
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:45,735
They seek him here, they seek him
there, those policemen seek him everywhere.

159
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,778
Is he in Heaven, or is he in Hell,
that damned elusive Sh-a-dow!

160
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:01,036
It's very good, very very good there.

161
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,944
So the police are looking
for The Shadow then, are they?

162
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:05,645
They'll never catch him!

163
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,480
No, no, but I Hank
Marvin's had a few tugs though!

164
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,747
- What's that??
- It's the phone.

165
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:17,192
I know it's the phone! 
I ain't stupid! I mean who is it??

166
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,370
Well it's a little difficult
to tell at this stage!

167
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,002
You'd better let him answer
it son, it might be his wife.

168
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,566
Oh yeah, she's got entrecote rioja.

169
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:33,723
Oh I'm sorry to hear that!
Well go'n then, find out how she is.

170
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,505
Yes! Peterson?

171
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,727
It's security, they're about
to shut up...

172
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,879
Yes, you can switch the alarm
system on.

173
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:44,768
Oi, oi, oi, I'm the Head of
Security!

174
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,638
You can switch the alarm
system on, yes!

175
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:52,285
There you are you see,
everything's alright now.

176
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:56,469
Yeah? You don't mind if I
double-check do ya?

177
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:02,649
He's becoming more nervous and agitated!
They're the danger signs in a situation like this!

178
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:08,488
I've told you, he'll be alright, he'll be good as
gold as long as we don't upset him! He's just a kid.

179
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:13,479
That's what makes him
dangerous! A nervous kid, hair trigger!

180
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:18,340
- Put 'em together...
- You're a cheerful old bark ain't yer?

181
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:23,034
One of us has got to create a distraction!

182
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:26,721
So that the other two can grapple with
him and disarm him!

183
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:28,393
What are you whispering about?

184
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,376
It's alright son, nothing,
alright, alright, no problem.

185
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,633
Do you mind if I stand up a
bit and walk around?

186
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:37,672
- Why?
- I've got a bit of cramp in me leg.

187
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:42,227
Go on then. No sudden
movements though!

188
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,592
Sudden movements, him!?

189
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:48,649
The closest he gets to a sudden movements
when he wipes the cobwebs off his head!

190
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,955
That's better!

191
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,325
You got any tobacco on you?

192
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,252
- What's that noise?
- Weren't me!

193
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:12,714
- It's the staff arriving.
- What time d'you open?

194
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,782
8.30.

195
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:19,839
We've been here 13 an 'alf hours!
Don't time fly when you're in good company.

196
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:22,676
Only 'alf hour to go and
it'll all be over.

197
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,502
The old Shadow's looking
pretty knackered ain't he, eh?

198
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:32,631
With proper training you can condition your body to do
without sleep. I learnt that out in Kenya.

199
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,194
What, you got a branch out
there then?

200
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:38,463
No, no! When I was younger I
did a bit of traveling.

201
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:41,139
I ended up doing five years
with the Kenyan Police Force.

202
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:43,645
I was out there during the
trouble with the Mau Mau.

203
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,459
He's too young to know what
that means.

204
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:48,538
He most probably thinks the Mau Mau
is the African Post Office!

205
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,063
We did modern history at
school, didn't we, mouthy?

206
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:55,621
Judging by all them ribbons
you must have seen a bit of action Albert?

207
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:58,678
Yeah. I was in the Navy,
Royal and Merchant.

208
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:04,168
I've seen things that would make
yer teeth itch! But I never talk about them

209
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:12,079
Sharks! Don't talk to me about sharks! I've seen 'em
50 foot long! Monsters they were!

210
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:15,331
Yeah, he thinks that Jaws was
a stickleback!

211
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,436
What the bloody hell d'you
think you're playing at???

212
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,684
- Rodney...
- Rodney - come back here and sit down son!

213
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:27,217
Don't do anything rash son,
it ain't worth it!

214
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:29,174
For God's sake there's only
30 minutes to go!!

215
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:54,489
You plonker!!

216
00:18:56,355 --> 00:19:00,251
- What you doing??
- Nothing! I just fancied a fag that's all!

217
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,010
Well why didn't you ask me?
There's  no need to steal!

218
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:08,683
No, sorry!

219
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:12,268
- What was that??
- It's the staff arriving.

220
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,975
They start early don't they?
Quarter past four!

221
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,791
It's half past seven!

222
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:25,227
Bloody watch! So, only 'alf
an hour to go!

223
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:29,550
It's sad really. We might never meet again.

224
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,444
We could always hold a
reunion next year, if you like.

225
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,557
I remember who you are now!

226
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:41,669
No, no. It's alright son - you can have a full rebate,
no problems, alright.

227
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:46,684
You're er...oh what is it?
No, don't tell me! Tel.

228
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,417
Del Trotter! Right?
Don't you recognise me?

229
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,365
Well you're a master of
disguise ain't yer!

230
00:19:56,205 --> 00:20:00,380
D'you remember Roseanna
Gilbey? West Indian lady, lives down Cutler Road...

231
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:05,202
Years ago you used to come round
on the weekly and that, selling shoes Del.

232
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:12,045
- Yes I remember, and that was you??
- Don't you remember her little boy?

233
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:18,831
- No, no. You're not little...Lennox!
- That's right! It's me - Lennox Gilbey!

234
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:23,029
Lennox Gilbey. I don't
believe it! Stone me.

235
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:28,219
Last time I saw you, you was about
that high! Cor dear, doesn't time fly, eh?

236
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:34,314
- So what you doing with yourself now?
- Oh well, I'm on the dole Del.

237
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:35,894
Oh yeah, how's your mum?

238
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,497
She's alright, suffers from
her feet a bit, but...

239
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:42,862
Yeah, well, but she would.
Wait a minute, hang about. I remember your mum.

240
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,670
I remember - very straight lady,
proud, church goer and all that!

241
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:50,061
Yeah, she won't know nothing
about this Del.

242
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:54,096
Oh no. So how you gonna
explain say sixty thousand pounds then, eh?

243
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:56,567
Christmas bonus from the Job
Centre?

244
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:00,416
Listen Lennox, there are millions of people out
there in the same boat as you!

245
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:01,995
But they don't go round
robbing everyone!

246
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,257
Look I haven't had a job
right in six years!

247
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:07,849
- Well nor has Rodney!
- I've got no future!

248
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:09,937
Nor has Rodney!

249
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:13,276
Look I haven't done a day's
work since I left school Del.

250
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,161
It's a tough old world Lennox,

251
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:21,031
Tough world but it doesn't give you the right to
go round pointing guns at people!

252
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:22,984
That thing's gonna put you in
prison!

253
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,831
No, I'm too shrewd!

254
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,224
Oh shrewd, you? Shrewd are
you? Very shrewd.

255
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,356
An hour ago you were The
Shadow right, man of mystery.

256
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,212
Now we know your name, your
address and your mum's shoe size!

257
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,682
Come on Lennox, give it up now before it's too late, eh?
That gun doesn't suit you!

258
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:44,575
In 20 minutes Del I'll be rich!

259
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:48,589
And in 30 minutes you're
gonna be banged up! I'll tell you what shall I?

260
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:54,177
Just review the situation for a second.
All the staff have arrived, right.

261
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:57,918
They're starting to work out there. And you’ve
gotta walk through 'em, haven't ya?

262
00:21:58,374 --> 00:22:03,665
They're all out there - shelf-packers, the porters,
the cleaners, the security people.

263
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,677
The shop doesn't open till half past eight, right.

264
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,827
In order for you to get out, you've gotta go up, ask
one of them to get the keys to let you out!

265
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:17,358
Before you can say 'police sniper' there'll be more
lead flying about than a fight in a scrap yard!

266
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,070
You'd never reach your getaway car.

267
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:24,572
Get-away car! I knew there
was something...

268
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:30,910
Here look Del, I didn't wanna go
through with this, alright. I just got...

269
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:32,371
I just got a bit desperate!

270
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,684
It's alright, it's alright.
I know son, I know alright.

271
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:37,197
And the police didn't really
nickname me The Shadow!

272
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:41,616
I'm not known by the police!
I've never done anything like this before!

273
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:44,781
Look, now listen to me,
listen,

274
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:50,875
Come on, you give it up before it's too late!
 I'll tell you what I'll do,

275
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:54,480
I'll come down the court with ya,
and speak for ya.

276
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:58,471
- You said it would be easy!!
- Shut up you fool!!

277
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:03,750
- I've been set up for this Del!
- You? You and Lennox?

278
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,567
He said I'd just walk out
with the money!

279
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:07,913
And you could have if you'd
been here at five o’clock as arranged!!

280
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,416
That's it, innit. Of course -
it's been worrying me all night this has.

281
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:15,208
I mean to say, how did Lennox know so
much about this place?

282
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:18,587
How did he know there was all that money
here in the safe, and where it was?

283
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:21,585
You must believe me, I didn't
do it purely for the money!

284
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,186
What d'you do it for then?

285
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:28,908
...Well alright, I did it for the money!
But it was simply to pay off my debts!

286
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,687
You see I have a wife whose hobby is
spending!

287
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:39,512
Twelve thousand pounds for a solarium,
fifteen thousand pounds for a swimming pool

288
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:45,664
and now she's got the estimates on a
marble-tiled gazebo! God, we only live in a semi!

289
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:50,545
Couldn't you seek professional
help?

290
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,700
- You mean a psychiatrist?
- No, I mean a hit-man.

291
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:57,834
No, I couldn't afford it!
This seemed the only way out.

292
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,686
But how did you two ever
meet?

293
00:24:00,185 --> 00:24:02,999
I mean, I can't imagine Lennox
at the young Tories ball,

294
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:05,987
and well you wouldn't go down a bomb
at the Ram Jam Club, would yer?

295
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,725
Lennox came here last year
looking for a job.

296
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,945
Then we bumped into each
other a couple of months ago in court.

297
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:15,635
I'd been summonsed for failure to maintain
the repayments on a hire purchase agreement

298
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:18,373
that had been signed by my wife, the fat
greedy cow.

299
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:21,781
I was there on an attempted
wounding case.

300
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:24,383
Oh, I weren't the accused Del, I
was the victim!

301
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,534
Anyway, me and Mr Peterson got chatting
and the whole thing started from there.

302
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,409
Did he supply you with the
gun?

303
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:34,447
He did!

304
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:42,962
Chamboussiz nouvelle. Cor
dear, would you Adam and Eve it, eh?

305
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:45,782
Dixon of Kuala
Lumpur is involved!

306
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:49,628
Yeah that's right, the three
of us planned it.

307
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,088
But I want you to know I did it purely
for the money!

308
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:53,123
I bet you did.

309
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:56,985
I retire in a couple of months' time and you should
have seen the crummy pension this firm was offering me!

310
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,804
I was gonna get less than
Duncan Goodhew's barber!

311
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:03,443
We needed Tom in with us
for his police experience.

312
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:06,221
He told us what to do, how to
make the robbery look genuine.

313
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:08,553
So where did we fit into all this?

314
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,630
Well, it would have looked a
bit dodgy wouldn't it,

315
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:14,798
if the only witnesses to a 60 grand robbery were
the store manager and the head of security!

316
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,002
No, what we wanted
was some independent witnesses!

317
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:27,860
Oh. I see, so that is why you pulled us in?
14 hours just to provide you with an alibi?

318
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:32,414
Cor, well I'll...just a
minute - give me that here!

319
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:35,619
- Look, where did you get this?
- Out of out toy department.

320
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,428
Yeah - I wondered how long
Taiwan had been making Lugers!

321
00:25:40,928 --> 00:25:44,082
So what happens now? Are you
going to the police?

322
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:48,947
Na! I'm gonna phone 'em
instead.

323
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:55,167
It's alright, don't panic, don't panic, just winding you
up! You are a wally Lennox!

324
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,416
Sorry Del!

325
00:25:57,603 --> 00:26:04,037
What is your mum gonna say,
eh? Anyway there's no real harm done right?

326
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:09,618
No one got hurt, nothing has been nicked!
Now listen to me Lennox, you're after a job right?

327
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:12,022
I've been after one since I
left school, Del.

328
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:14,826
Well I know where there's
one going. And I'm well in with the governor!

329
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,771
- You're kidding??
- No.

330
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:18,179
You reckon you could swing it
for me?

331
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,028
I think so, mind you the job
does not become available until...

332
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:25,048
- When d'you retire Tom?
- What, him work here - in security??

333
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:26,822
Can you think of anyone
better?

334
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,986
He'll know exactly who to
keep his eye on!

335
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:34,334
That's right, tell me - what
would you prefer, young Lennox or Old Bill?

336
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,245
Welcome to the firm Lennox!

337
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,464
I'll sort you out a uniform,
show you yer duties!

338
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:43,531
That's it Rodney. Come on
Albert, come on, we're going.

339
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:46,182
We're leaving. Let's get out of here! Oh dear.

340
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:49,013
This lot's gonna have to go straight
in the fridge when we get home.

341
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,706
Here are Lennox, save you
buying a truncheon, won't it, eh?

342
00:26:57,738 --> 00:27:00,248
Oh, by the way Mr Peterson, I'm coming back
to your shop this afternoon.

343
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:00,983
Why?

344
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:05,639
'Cos I've got this funny feeling that I am gonna be
your millionth customer! What do you think?

345
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,308
I have exactly the same feeling!

346
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:14,664
You know it makes sense don't
ya? Bonjour.

347
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:20,871
