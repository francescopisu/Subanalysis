1
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,435
Here we are. Guess where we're
going at the weekend?

2
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:01,502
No. Give us a clue.

3
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,645
Alright Rodders, if you insist.

4
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:08,076
Eerrgh, you pig, you. Geddit
away.

5
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:10,001
How's that rice going down,
alright?

6
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,480
Geddit out.

7
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:13,813
Where are we going then Del?

8
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,645
We're going skiing.

9
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:18,610
Where d'you think we're going you soppy
old...We're going fishing aren't we?

10
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:20,638
Well, I know that. I mean
where?

11
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:23,303
Oh. I see what you mean, we're
going to a place called Tregower.

12
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:24,248
Where's that?

13
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,915
- Cornwall.
- Cornwall?

14
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,049
Why are we going all the way
down there?

15
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:30,160
Because that's where Boycie's
weekend cottage is.

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,583
I had dinner with him lat night at
Mario's 

17
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:35,475
and he happened to mention he'd got this
weekend cottage and it was free and so Bob's yer uncle.

18
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:37,695
- How much rent he charging you?
- Nothing.

19
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:39,862
He's letting us have it for
free?

20
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:41,054
Yeah, all for gratis.

21
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:43,520
Come on, Del, there's gotta be
something behind this.

22
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,908
'Cos Boycie would scalp you if
dandruff had a going rate.

23
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:52,572
You're becoming so cynical Rodney.
He's just doing a mate a favour isn't he, eh?

24
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,952
Wait a minute. You met him in Mario's?

25
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:57,209
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

26
00:01:57,376 --> 00:02:00,657
Grandad come on, look, clear all this fishing gear
will you 'cos I want to pop out.

27
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:04,123
- Mario's is a fish restaurant.
- Is it? Yeah, see you later.

28
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:06,273
Bit of a coincidence Del, innit,

29
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:09,932
you meeting him in a fish restaurant
and the next thing we're all going fishing.

30
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:14,743
He's like Elliot bleedin' Ness
at times ain't he, eh?

31
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:17,988
Alright Rodney, I was gonna tell you
when we got down there

32
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:19,501
- you know - as a sort of surprise like.
- Oh yeah!

33
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,397
Yeah, yeah, as a surprise, yeah.

34
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:26,622
Well, this cottage happens to near one
of the finest salmon fishing streams in England.

35
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:31,298
Now Mario has agreed to pay us ten pounds
for every fish that we bring back.

36
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:34,208
Now Boycie and I are going to
halve it, that's a fiver each.

37
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,811
So let's say that we - we do what, 60 fish,
that will be 300 sovs in our pocket.

38
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:47,812
We split it three ways that means you and Grandad
get fifty pounds each, a weekend's fishing and free digs.

39
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:48,969
Now, what d'you
reckon to that?

40
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:50,396
I reckon it's illegal.

41
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,272
You hurt me sometimes Rodney.

42
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:57,508
You really do, you don't even let me finish before you go
jumping to your nasty little delusions.

43
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:01,458
It's lucky you ain't a judge Rodney –
you'd hang 'em before they'd finished the oath.

44
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:04,729
Alright. Alright. I'm sorry.
I just thought.

45
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,483
Yeah, I know exactly what you
thought.

46
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:10,427
So we've got permission have
we?

47
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:16,182
Well, we will have. We see the gamekeeper
when we get down there and pay him 25 quid.

48
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,171
What and he gives us a fishing
permit?

49
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,365
No - he shows us the hole in
the fence.

50
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:22,289
I knew it.

51
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:25,221
- It's called business.
- It's called stealing.

52
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,370
- No it ain't Rodney.
- Listen to your Grandad.

53
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:29,564
It's called poaching.

54
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,719
And what do we know about
that, eh?

55
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,023
Del, he can't even poach an
egg!

56
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:42,127
Rodney, it'll be a doddle.
This stream's jam-packed with salmon.

57
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:43,838
We just put our hooks
in and whip 'em out.

58
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,630
Del - it is illegal, it is
immoral, it is unethical.

59
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:52,098
Alright, me and Grandad'll go
on our own, and split the profits between us.

60
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,938
Now I didn't say I wouldn't
come, did I?

61
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:11,000
'Gone poaching, ba ba ba ba,
left a sign upon the door. Gone poaching, ba ba.'

62
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:15,994
You keep on Rodney and you're
gonna get a smack right in the ear'ole.

63
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,152
Oi, oi, oi, what' all this
about?

64
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,943
Ooh my Gawd, it's the Old Bill!

65
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,246
Someone's doubled you up about
them salmon.

66
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,894
Ssh. Look, just let me do the
talking.

67
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:48,436
Good evening Officer. Now, if it's about the tax disc I can
assure you that the new one is in the post.

68
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:53,166
It's nothing to do with your road fund licence sir.
Down for a bit of fishing are we?

69
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,651
No, no, no, no, nothing like
that, no.

70
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:59,859
Then why have you got three
fishing rods tied to yer roof rack?

71
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:08,654
No, no, 'cos you remember we
said we might do a little bit of fishing.

72
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:12,233
Yeah, that's right, yeah, yeah, might do –
you know - just a little bit - tiddlers.

73
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:14,247
No salmon though.

74
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,529
I see. You haven't given anyone a lift
in the last halfhour or so have you sir?

75
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:27,346
No. Look, what is all this
about anyway?

76
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,541
We've just had word that a
patient’s escaped from the local hospital.

77
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:34,916
Escaped? What you got out
here, national health stalags?

78
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:40,975
It's no ordinary hospital sir.
It's an institute for the criminally insane.

79
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,430
See, this storm's brought a few power
cables down, blacked out the entire area.

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,280
It even put the institute's security system
out of action.

81
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:55,052
So this patient took his chance
and made of across the moors.

82
00:05:56,586 --> 00:06:01,260
He's out there somewhere now. For all
I know he could be watching us.

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,597
What was he in there for anyway?

84
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:10,748
Ten years ago this very night,
he killed a party of weekend fishermen.

85
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:15,682
You may have seen it on the TV?
They called him the Axe Murderer.

86
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,923
No, no, no, I must have been
out that night.

87
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,398
You good people be very careful.

88
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:27,960
Don't pick up any hitch-hikers, don't stop for
anyone, no matter what the circumstances.

89
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:32,727
And, if you see or hear anything suspicious,
phone the police immediately.

90
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:36,043
Your lives may depend on it.

91
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,857
Right gentlemen - have a nice
weekend won't you?

92
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:50,127
Yeah, well, come on. Full ahead
both Rodney.

93
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,733
- We ain't going on are we?
- Yeah, course we are.

94
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:57,256
Del, there is a crazed axe
murderer out there somewhere.

95
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:02,710
I know that Rodders, but you seem to be forgetting
that we're on a 300 quid earner.

96
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:10,792
Don't worry, we'll be locked up safe and sound
in Boycie's cottage. Anyway there's three of us...

97
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,073
There's me and you...

98
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,292
Don't worry, I'll look after you!

99
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,340
Right, get this stuff out of
here, come on.

100
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,288
Alright. Grandad.

101
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:19,284
I wish you'd shut up Rodney,
you're making me nervous.

102
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:23,590
Look, I didn't say I saw
'someone' did I? Just that I saw 'something'.

103
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:25,804
Yeah, alright don't worry, get
them lanterns going will you Rodney.

104
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:27,798
Why, what's wrong with the
lights?

105
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:30,445
- No electric is there.
- Someone's been tampering with it.

106
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,733
No, look, the storm has blown
the power cables down remember?

107
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,365
- The whole area's blacked out innit?
- Oh yeah!

108
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,173
Yeah, I'll just see if I can find some candles
in this cupboard over here...

109
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:50,964
- What are you doing?
- I'm phoning the law!

110
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,808
You're doing what? What are
you trying to do to me?

111
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:57,688
Cor, look, we're down here doing a
bit of 'fishing',

112
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:01,630
the last thing we need is the local
Polizia sniffing round our keep-nets.

113
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:05,231
Look, that copper said that if
we see or hear anything suspicious

114
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:08,814
phone the police immediately –
our lives could depend on it.

115
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,111
Alright then, who have you
seen Hawkeye?

116
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:16,565
I saw a - well, a movement in
the trees.

117
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:19,716
A movement? Of course you're
gonna see movement in the trees

118
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,693
there's a ruddy
typhoid blowing out there.

119
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,564
Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry.

120
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:29,372
It's alright, come on, pull
yourself together, alright.

121
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:30,731
That's it.

122
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,227
It's a typhoon.

123
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,662
Good idea Rodney, put the
kettle on, we'll have a nice cup of tea.

124
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,210
Del, there's only an electric
kettle out there.

125
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:52,034
Well, use a saucepan then.

126
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:56,911
No, there ain't none.

127
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,117
Gordon Bennett. Look, come out
of my way, look, I'll do it.

128
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,124
Here, look - have a look in that sideboard,
see if Boycie's left any scotch will you.

129
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,841
If he hasn't we'll have to drink mine!

130
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:16,891
Here you are Rodney. See what
I mean, there ain't no ghosts or ghouls out here!

131
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:26,288
Del Boy, come in here quick.
Rodney's found something!

132
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,634
Has he? What?

133
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:36,121
Monopoly! Oh, now we are all doomed!

134
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,857
Not the monopoly!

135
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:44,312
Well, it's only a chopper.

136
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,022
- It's an axe!
- Same thing.

137
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:53,077
No, Del. The police ain't
looking for an escaped chopper murderer.

138
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:59,228
Let - just a minute - let me
ask you two something. Where are we?

139
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:00,842
We're in schtuck!

140
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:04,067
No! We're in the country, aren’t we?

141
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:08,432
And country people have these things hanging about.
It's part and parcel of their lives.

142
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:12,666
Alright, let me ask you something.
Where do you think that escaped bloke is right now?

143
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,506
- Probably out there on them moors.
- In this weather?

144
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:17,067
Well, he's mad ain't he?

145
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:20,952
He might be mad, he'd have to
be bloody stupid to be out in the moors.

146
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:28,227
Exactly. I reckon he'd have holed up somewhere.
Found himself an empty place. Like this!

147
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,304
Yeah, but this place ain't
empty, is it?

148
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:32,607
It was before we arrived, Del.

149
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,142
What d'you reckon, alright
then, he's up there having a kip?

150
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,743
Well, he could be up there.

151
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:44,829
Well I shouldn't let it worry you Grandad, 'cos the three
bears have probably eaten him by now.

152
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,869
I mean, what is this
fairy story that you're giving me?

153
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,564
What's the matter with you
two? You been sniffing the bostik or something?

154
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:55,804
Alright then, well, why don't you go up
the wooden hill to Bedfordshire and check it out?

155
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,945
I don't have to.

156
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:07,043
Look, I mean, listen, would any selfrespecting
axe murderer pop upstairs for 40 winks

157
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,210
and leave his chopper in the
sideboard?

158
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:13,704
He might have a spare one.

159
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:16,359
He's got a kit of 'em now has
he?

160
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:19,268
I suppose he's got a
little caddie that carries 'em round for him.

161
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:24,332
And another thing. If the man of the
moment is upstairs having alie-in,

162
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:28,114
who was that you saw out there in the trees?
His brother?

163
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:33,695
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- He can't be in to places at once.

164
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:38,502
No, of course not. Oh, he's
most probably half-way to London by now.

165
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,182
Yeah, of course he is. He's most probably looking
for an empty place up there.

166
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:43,378
Hope he don't find our flat!

167
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:48,825
Will you hut up? Will you just
stop all this nonsense?

168
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:54,644
Now look, are we all agreed that
we are safe and sound?

169
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:56,268
Well, well yeah.

170
00:12:56,464 --> 00:13:01,764
Right. Right. Now can you
just, like, relax a bit now, you know. Alright?

171
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:08,728
Here you are. Now, I wonder where the
toilet is?

172
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:12,036
It's outside, I saw it as we
come in.

173
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:13,268
Right!

174
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:22,153
I think I'll leave it till morning.

175
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:30,961
Ah - Park lane. I think that's
one of my properties Rodney.

176
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:33,800
Course it is - you own everything on the board.

177
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,138
No I don't, no I don't. Look,
you've got Coventry Street.

178
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:39,268
Grandad's got the Waterworks and all that.

179
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:43,343
Ah, yeah, Park Lane, with one hotel, two
thousand please.

180
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:49,678
Two - hold on. According to
this it only fifteen hundred!

181
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,155
Yes, I know, but I've put you
in the penthouse suite haven't I?

182
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:55,833
I don't want the penthouse
suite do I!

183
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:58,728
There you go, fifteen hundred
 - that's all you're getting!

184
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:00,033
He's like a big kid ain't he?

185
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,222
Yeah, well, I give up on him,
Grandad.

186
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,613
It's your go, Grandfather...

187
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:11,362
Ah, Piccadilly. Right that's mine and I've got
an hotel, so that's twelve hundred pounds!

188
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,050
Twelve hundred quid for a
hotel next to a smelly old waterworks?

189
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,224
What?

190
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:21,936
All them sewers. I'd rather sleep in the car
or look for a bed and breakfast.

191
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:28,778
No - no you don't understand.
Bless his little...Look, it's in the rules.

192
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:34,982
Twelve hundred pounds - it's
scandalous. I ain't a tourist you know.

193
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,529
Del, can you have a word with him?

194
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,055
Well, I think he's got a point,
Rodney.

195
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:45,605
I mean, I don't know what possessed you to build a
hotel next to the sewage farm in the first place.

196
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:49,957
I mean, let's face it, your gaff's never going
to get into the Michelin Guide is it?

197
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:53,622
But the point of the...

198
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,033
Stupid bloody game!

199
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,308
Oh that's charming that is
innit, eh?

200
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,422
- Just because you're losing.
- Oh shuddup.

201
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,170
You wanna learn to grow up a
bit my son.

202
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,124
I didn't wanna play this
stupid bloody game in the first place.

203
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:11,871
Yeah, alright. Grandad, I
think there's an hotel underneath your chair.

204
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:15,910
If there's any money down there it's
mine, alright.

205
00:15:17,785 --> 00:15:20,391
There's the car...any more money down there?

206
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,272
Don't you speak to me Rodney,
I'm finished with yer.

207
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,102
Del, there is a man at the
window.

208
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,948
You what?

209
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:51,026
There is a man at the window.

210
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:54,041
He ain't got a bucket and a
shammy leather has he?

211
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:00,444
I'm being serious, Del. There
is somebody at the window!

212
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:12,776
Alright Roddy - alright. Relax,
just take it easy alright? I'll take a look.

213
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,699
There's no one out there,
Rodney, Look. There's no one out there.

214
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:34,428
He was there, Del, I swear to
you. My face was inches from that glass.

215
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:35,823
What did he look like?

216
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:40,480
Horrible. He had these evil
eyes and this grotesque evil face.

217
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:43,533
Maybe it was a reflection!

218
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:49,466
That was no reflection Del, I swear to God...
What d'yer mean 'a reflection'?

219
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:53,860
No, no, what I mean is that your imagination
sometimes play games with you, you know.

220
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:56,632
It tricks you into believing that you saw
something that isn't really there.

221
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,122
Del, I saw the rain running down his forehead,
I saw the blood vessels in the whites of his eyes.

222
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:04,737
I saw the hairs
coming out of his nostrils.

223
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:08,549
It might have been the shadows
in the trees, Rodney.

224
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,525
Is anyone there?

225
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,973
I think there's someone at the
door!

226
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,167
No, no, it's most probably
just the shadows.

227
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,703
Shadows? Well until they start
singing Summer Holiday we'll expect the worst.

228
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,437
Who's there?

229
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,535
Oh good evening. My name's Robson,
I'm chief of security at the institution.

230
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:37,184
Oh thank Gawd for that!

231
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:39,075
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

232
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:41,122
He's chief of security at the
hospital.

233
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,051
Says who?

234
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:46,224
Well he, just his minute...oh yeah!

235
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:54,033
He could be anyone couldn't
he? You get ready!

236
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:01,476
- Well?
- Well what?

237
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,392
- Is that him?
- Who?

238
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:06,828
The face at the window.

239
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:10,045
- I don't know, I didn't look!
- You wally!

240
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,746
You never said what you was
gonna do.

241
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:12,725
Is everything alright?

242
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,511
Yeah... I won't keep you a
minute Chief.

243
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:17,824
Now do it - do it gain and
this time take a good look.

244
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:21,276
- Alright.
- Alright ready.

245
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:22,811
Good evening.

246
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,377
- Well?
- No, it's not him.

247
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,442
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive. That is definitely not him.

248
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:30,994
Alright.

249
00:18:32,993 --> 00:18:34,221
Do come in, Chief.

250
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:37,356
Thank you. Appauling weather.

251
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:41,734
Yes, sorry about leaving you standing out there
but you can't be too sure can you - you know.

252
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,005
We thought you might
be a double-glazing salesman!

253
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,320
What? Oh yes.

254
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:46,803
Well, if you'd like to see
some identification

255
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:50,442
there's everything there from my
driving licence to my blood donor's card.

256
00:18:50,593 --> 00:18:56,277
Oh no, no, that's alright, alright. Rodney, fix the Chief
a drink will you? So, you haven't caught him then yet?

257
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:59,865
Unfortunately no.
We've extended the search up to this area now.

258
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:05,071
We've the entire police forces of three counties
out looking for him. I was passing, saw a light.

259
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,996
What exactly are you gentlemen
doing here?

260
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,064
Oh, we're on a fishing trip.

261
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,426
I don't suppose you've seen
anything?

262
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:19,063
Well other than the face at
the window, nothing.

263
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:20,782
Face at the window?

264
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:24,002
Yeah, well, Rodney here
reckoned he saw a face at the window.

265
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,582
I don't know whether
to believe him or not.

266
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:29,351
Oh I saw him Del, I was only
sort of like three inches away from him.

267
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:30,944
Could you describe him for me?

268
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:33,893
Yeah, of course I could. He
was about 50.

269
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,279
He had this gaunt, hungry expression and
his eyes were like wild animal's.

270
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:43,344
- And hairs out of his nostrils!
- Yeah, and there was all that!

271
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:46,714
You're quite certain it wasn't
a reflection?

272
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,699
Look, it was not a reflection!

273
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:54,202
I'm sorry, but at times like
these people's imagination run amok.

274
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:59,380
Why, we've had 200 sightings this evening alone.
What was the colour of his hair?

275
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:06,503
- On his head!
- Oh, er, grey.

276
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,783
Sounds like my man. When
exactly did this happen?

277
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,879
Well just now. A minute or so
before you arrived.

278
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:14,750
So he must have seen me.

279
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,697
D'you reckon he's still out
there then?

280
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,813
Oh no, he'd be long gone by
now.

281
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,911
It's the uniform you see
- he's terrified of people in authority.

282
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:26,756
Well, after ten
years in an institution who wouldn't be?

283
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,463
Yeah, well, I feel sorry for
the poor little cock.

284
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,291
Chief, do you mind if I ask you
something?

285
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:35,349
What's that?

286
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,743
Well is it safe for me to go
to the khazi? I mean it's outside.

287
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:42,807
Oh you're perfectly safe.
He'll be a long way away by now.

288
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,535
Oh good! Right, that's alright
then.

289
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,650
Well go on then Del, there's
nothing to be frightened of now.

290
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,922
I know, you don't have to go
out here, do you?

291
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,182
You heard what the Chief said.
Go on, there's no need to worry.

292
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,405
Yeah, well, alright.

293
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:13,882
He's such a worrier.

294
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,482
You weren't frightened at all?

295
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:39,159
Me? Na. No 'cos you see, in the past
I have done work for the mentally disturbed.

296
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,798
He went out selling flags one
Saturday.

297
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:48,389
Well yeah, but, er, I can
actually sympathise with this guy's problems.

298
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,421
Sympathise? But he's a psycho.

299
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:55,485
Have you any idea what a
'psycho', as you so eloquently put it, is?

300
00:21:55,732 --> 00:22:00,191
Course I have. He's a geezer
that dresses up in his mother's clothes.

301
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:36,438
Bloody hell's bells. Rodney, Grandad,
come out here quick, bring some rope.

302
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:44,118
Yeah, so then, right, I grabbed the axe out of his hand
and I cracked him good and hard on the jaw,

303
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:45,629
so obviously he went down right.

304
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:49,407
Then I tied him up good and tight
and we bundled him into the back of the van.

305
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:52,024
Good work lad. You say you
captured him single handed?

306
00:22:52,200 --> 00:23:01,336
Yeah. Well, no, Del, my brother,
back at the cottage he helped a bit.

307
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,558
You're too modest, Rodney.

308
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:05,834
Well, there could be a medal
in this.

309
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,382
Well.

310
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:11,699
Right, get ready lads, this
one could be a handful.

311
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:18,170
Is this some kind of joke?

312
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:20,257
What d'you mean?

313
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:22,084
This is no escaped lunatic.

314
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,884
This is Tome Witton, the gamekeeper.

315
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:26,917
And you shouldn't have gagged him like that,
he suffers from asthma.

316
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:34,440
Now hold on a minute - the Chief of Security
from the Institution itself said it was him.

317
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:36,123
What Chief of Security?

318
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:41,926
What's his name? Robson. I mean, you can ask him
yourself, he's back at the cottage with Del.

319
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,362
Chief Robson is not at the
cottage - he's at the hospital.

320
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:51,598
The escaped man hit him on the head then stole
his uniform and his identity papers.

321
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:55,744
Well, I still reckon we should
have gone with 'em.

322
00:23:55,928 --> 00:23:58,568
No. It was imperative that I
made out my report immediately.

323
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:03,145
And after all I needed you here with me,
you were the one who recaptured him.

324
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,975
Well, yeah, I suppose, yeah.

325
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:08,580
Hey, what do you say we have
a nice little drink to celebrate, eh?

326
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:13,248
The old weather's clearing up
nicely. Look at that, it's a full moon.

327
00:24:19,717 --> 00:24:20,993
There you go, Chief...

328
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:28,214
Excuse me. Yes, hello. Hello
...Rodders, did you get there all right...

329
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:39,653
He's what??

330
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:52,644
You alright? The Chief's
just standing there, you know, examining his axe...

331
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:59,382
Yeah, alright then. You'll
hurry back won't you? Alright goodbye.

332
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:07,823
Just phoned up to tell us he
got here alright.

333
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:12,539
- Good. Do you like fish?
- What?

334
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,486
Do you like fish??

335
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,857
Oh yeah, yeah, little bit of
salt an' vinegar, they're lovely.

336
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:25,075
I only like living fish. Fish that swim in the rivers and
the seas. I don't like people that kill them.

337
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:27,838
No, no, no, don't like that
sort myself either.

338
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,770
But I saw fishing rods on your van.

339
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:32,609
No, no, no, they didn't belong
to me, they belong to my brother and Grandad.

340
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:35,859
I mean, I keep telling them. I beg
'em not to hurt the poor little fishies.

341
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,726
I mean, I only come down here for the
fresh air.

342
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,231
Do you like snooker?

343
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,732
- Snooker?
- Yes.

344
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:53,164
- Do you?
- Oh yes.

345
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:54,873
So do I. It's triffic innit?

346
00:25:56,005 --> 00:26:00,418
- Shall we play a game?
- Of snooker?

347
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:01,939
Yes.

348
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:05,089
Yeah, yeah, alright. I'll tell
you what.

349
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:07,949
I'll jut pop out to the shed
at the bottom of the garden

350
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,793
'cos I think I remember seeing
a snooker table in there.

351
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:17,462
No need, we'll use this one
here.

352
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:24,791
What you mean this one here,
you mean?

353
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:25,955
Yes.

354
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah, yeah okay.

355
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,243
Is that a police helicopter?

356
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:35,846
No, you're alight.

357
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:37,754
It's Barratts!!

358
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:48,923
Good. You can break.

359
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:58,297
Um, I tell you what, why don't
I put that somewhere safe?

360
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:02,507
Because you won't be able to hold yer cue
properly with that in your hand, will you?

361
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:11,071
No, I suppose you're right.

362
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:14,365
Yeah, course I am. You know it
makes sense.

363
00:27:18,592 --> 00:27:20,666
Which cue would you like?

364
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:33,861
I'll have this one.

365
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:35,953
Good, this is my favourite.

366
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:40,432
Yeah, you can see it's a good
'un, can't you?

367
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:44,498
I'm not very good at snooker.
I always lose.

368
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,515
I've got a feeling you're
gonna win this one.

369
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,561
I hope not. I don't like winning. My father used to
force me to win at everything I did.

370
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:58,522
But people challenge winners. You become
vulnerable, you feel open to attack.

371
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,157
- Do you know the feeling?
- Yeah, yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

372
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:07,793
But losers are anonymous. No
one wants to challenge a loser.

373
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:14,521
There's something comforting in defeat.
I really like losing.

374
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:23,286
Do you? Well, what do you say
we make this game a little more interesting?

375
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:26,239
Shall we
play for a tenner a frame?

376
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,999
Alright.

377
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:32,800
Got a feeling that this weekend
is not going to be a total loss after all.

378
00:28:33,356 --> 00:28:34,695
- Sorry?
- Nothing.

379
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:37,593
Got the chalk? Thanks.

380
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:50,264
