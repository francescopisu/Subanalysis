1
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:46,652
- I don't believe it! When did this arrive?
- This morning.

2
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:48,337
Well, why didn't you let
me know sooner?

3
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:50,801
I couldn't get in touch with yer.
You've been out all morning.

4
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:52,940
I thought you
might have popped home for elevenses.

5
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:56,316
I've told you before, Unc?
Elevenses is for wimps.

6
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,531
I'm out there on that yuppy tightrope,
nerves on red alert.

7
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,113
A beta-blocker and a
dream, that's me.

8
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:08,074
I eat on the move, mobile phone in
one hand, a Pot Noodle in the other.

9
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,979
I tried to get you on your
mobile phone.

10
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,905
That's why Del ended up
with an earful of noodles.

11
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:16,076
Oh look, the boy from the
blackstuff's woken up!

12
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,018
Look, just 'cos I'm out of
work, there's no need to rub it in!

13
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:23,087
For all you know my recent misfortunes
could herald a watershed in my life

14
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:24,927
and I could go
on to greater things.

15
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:30,052
Oh yes! You've broken up
with your wife, walked out on your lovely home,

16
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:34,086
you resigned from a highly
paid job and pulled the chain on your career.

17
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:36,942
That's just the
springboard you need for the future, innit?

18
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:38,745
Something'll turn up.

19
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:44,645
That's what General Custer said! And something did
turn up! Another load of bloody Indians!

20
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:47,410
You should be giving Rodney
some encouragement.

21
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,720
I'm worried about him,
ain't I?

22
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:55,049
A few months ago, there he was
cash on the hip and a glowing future.

23
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:59,821
Now he's skint and the only thing about him
that's glowing is his liver!

24
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:02,783
What happened to that golden handshake
he got from the printing firm?

25
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:09,947
He kissed that all up against the wall, didn't he?
Blew it on Cuba libres and lairy suits.

26
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:12,105
I don't believe this git!

27
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:17,213
He has the audacity to sit here moralising with
me whilst holding a letter from the magistrates' court

28
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,438
saying his case has
been brought forward!

29
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,030
Everyone goes to court once in their life.

30
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:26,410
Once?
They've given you yer own parking space!

31
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:28,577
Don't change the
subject, Rodney!

32
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:34,092
I think what Del's trying to say is: for the last
month or so you've been living back at the flat.

33
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:37,783
In the past that was alright,
but now Raquel is pregnant.

34
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,461
Notices and all, innit?
See that lump? That's my embryo.

35
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:55,862
You see Rodney? See what I mean?
In a couple of months time, there'll be no space in the flat.

36
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:57,608
She's gonna be that big, is she?

37
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:02,661
What I mean is, we need that room of yours
for nursery.

38
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:05,753
So this is an ideal time for you to go
out and find yer own bachelor pad.

39
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:08,041
He's waiting for the
council to offer him something.

40
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:12,131
Oh, yeah? Well, we can have
a combined party then, can't we, eh?

41
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,148
Rodney's house-warming and
my son's 21st!

42
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,308
For your information, Derek, the council phoned
this morning with an offer of accommodation.

43
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:21,282
No! Really?

44
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:23,370
It's true, Del. I was
there when he got the call.

45
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:25,219
Well, that's terrific news.
Well done, bruv.

46
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:30,323
- They've offered me an LDA.
- An LDA! Well, that can't be bad, can it?

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,096
I'm viewing it this afternoon.

48
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,634
If you want any furniture...

49
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,418
Young Towser's doing a very nice
line in quality reject three-piece suites.

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,005
Could come in handy...
Del, can I ask you something?

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,992
- Of course you can.
- What's an LDA?

52
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:50,425
I don't know.

53
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,167
It's an abbreviation
for something.

54
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:56,586
I know it's an abbreviation
for something! But what?

55
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:02,458
L- D-A. Maybe it stands for
Luxury Detached Abode?

56
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:07,066
Yes! It could do.
I doubt it, but it could do, yeah.

57
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,308
Listen, I'll get us some more drinks,
alright?

58
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:12,574
Not for me. I'd better go home and change.
I'm meeting the council mush in an hour.

59
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,632
Good luck, bruv.

60
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,875
- Mike, be nice of you...
- Hang on a minute, Del.

61
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,961
- So you thought of a name yet?
- No! It's too early for that.

62
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,565
It's best to sort it out early.
Saves rows later.

63
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:37,975
- OK, Mike, could you give us...
- Hang on a minute, Del.

64
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:43,184
- So how's this gonna affect your career then?
- What career?

65
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,976
I thought you was an
actress and a singer and all that.

66
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:52,156
Yeah. Well, I think in my condition I'll put my
career on hold for a while. Like 15 years or so.

67
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:55,469
That reminds me. You know
the Down By The Riverside Club?

68
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,528
Yes. I'm thinking of going down there in a minute
and get a drink! Mike, when you're ready!

69
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:02,249
I've only got one pair of
hands, mate!

70
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:06,743
I remember the night my wife came home and she
told me she was two months pregnant.

71
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:10,717
- I was a cocktail waiter at the time.
- Ah! It's a moment you'll never forget.

72
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:15,083
That's right. I remember it especially, 'cos I'd just
come home from three months on a cruise ship.

73
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,278
Oh! Sorry.

74
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,601
Oh no, it was a nice
cruise. Do you wanna see the snaps?

75
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,319
A mate of mine from the
council's depot's singing there tonight.

76
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:25,861
What?

77
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,031
At the Down By The Riverside Club.
Tony Angelino.

78
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:35,003
- Who?
- Tony Angelino. That's his stage name.

79
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:42,265
Sounds terrific that, Trig. A few drinks, scampi
in a basket and the singing road-sweeper. Cushty.

80
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,100
He's not a road-sweeper!
He's on the dust.

81
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:48,049
Oh well!
That's the difference, innit? Sorry!

82
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:51,140
He sung there once before,
about six years ago.

83
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:53,050
Really?
He's back by popular demand then, is he?

84
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:59,222
Yeah. He's got a terrific voice. He's gonna be a big
star one day. Fancy coming down there tonight?

85
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:04,447
- What you hoping for then Del?
- The same again when you're ready - if I can get my order in!

86
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:09,699
- I'm talking about the baby.
- Oh. Why don't you say so, that is different.

87
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:10,986
It's gotta be a boy, ain't he?

88
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:14,412
- How do you know? It might be a girl.
- No, no. I know it's gonna be a boy.

89
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:17,930
Don't you forget, you can hold
a very nice wedding reception up above here.

90
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,149
Come on, let's sit down over there
sweetheart.

91
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,112
Have you told any of your
family about it?

92
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:28,516
- I've written to my parents.
- I was thinking more about your husband.

93
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:34,536
My solicitor's still trying
to trace his whereabouts.

94
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:37,363
We've been apart now for
seven years so divorce'll be no problem.

95
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:41,409
Well, when that comes
through we'll get hitched.

96
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:45,072
- Sorry?
- We'll tie the knot.

97
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,290
But I might not want to
marry you.

98
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,719
What do you mean, you might
not wanna marry me? Come on, don't be silly.

99
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:53,826
I'm not being silly! You
haven't even asked me.

100
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:57,851
I know that! Well you're...
You're in the old... you know.

101
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:00,746
Where I come from action speaks
louder than words.

102
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,509
Would you keep me in the
style that I've become accustomed to?

103
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:07,041
- Of course I would.
- Well, there's no way I'm marrying you then!

104
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,623
Come on Raquel!
We'll have a blinding future together.

105
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,405
Are we?

106
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,776
I can see it now. Everything's
beginning to slot into place.

107
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,763
I've got pots and plans
bubbling away.

108
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:23,502
I've got a meeting in half
an hour's with an old mate of mine

109
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,932
he runs one of these
dinner and dance clubs, you know.

110
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:30,403
I think he wants to buy them 300 packets
of crisps I've got in the garage.

111
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:42,869
He's playing our song... badly.
Everything is going well.

112
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:46,904
Gonna have a lovely future.
This time next year I'm gonna be a millionaire.

113
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:53,069
- Alright then, I accept.
- Good girl! You know it makes sense.

114
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:59,610
Maybe tomorrow we could go
out and buy an engagement ring?

115
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,981
No, I can't tomorrow, darling.
I'm in court.

116
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,338
How is it going, pal?

117
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,695
Talk about Marley's ghost!
Del Boy! You're looking prosperous.

118
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,392
Yeah, can't complain.
Well, I do, but no one listens.

119
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,475
I've heard good things about you, Del.
You're making your mark in the parish.

120
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,839
I'm pleased for you.
I like to hear about people doing well.

121
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:38,885
Last time I saw you,
you was really struggling.

122
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:42,700
You was driving round in some shitty
little three-wheeled van.

123
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:51,075
Those were the days, eh? Actually
I still got that three-wheeled van.

124
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,270
Nostalgia.
I use it just for bussiness.

125
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,912
What's yer main motor, now Delboy?
Some sort of sports coupe, is it?

126
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:05,050
Yeah, something like that.
How long ago was it since we last met? 5-6 years?

127
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:06,320
That long, is it?

128
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:11,174
- Just after we had that little misunderstanding.
- I don't remember that.

129
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,691
Yes you do. You said I'd done
you out of 500 quid.

130
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,716
Well, you did, didn't you?

131
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:22,568
No, no. I told you at the time.
It was just a misunderstanding.

132
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:27,264
Yeah, well. We'll best let
sleeping dogs lie, ain't we Del?

133
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:31,147
Yeah, that's it.
It's all in the past, innit, eh?

134
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:37,245
Well, I must say,
this is a very very nice place.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,915
Yeah, it's doing some
business as well.

136
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,774
Cushty! Very pleased to hear it.

137
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,150
Anyway! What d'you wanna talk to me about?
You left a message for me on my answer-machine.

138
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,739
- I thought it was your uncle.
- Same thing.

139
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,228
That's good.
I could do a bit of this.

140
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:00,771
Got a bit of a problem, Del.

141
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:06,636
Tomorrow night the club's been booked
for a birthday party. Cabaret, all the exes.

142
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:10,328
I had a young singing duo booked in,
but they've let me down at the last minute.

143
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:12,868
I've phoned round all the
agents.

144
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:15,012
That's what I've been
offered so far.

145
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:21,045
Looks alright to me.

146
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,629
No good to me Del. I need a singer.
Someone who knows what they're doing.

147
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,758
Now I heard recently that you was
living with some bird

148
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:30,575
who used to do a bit of
nightclub singing.

149
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:35,361
Raquel? Yeah, she used to do some singing.
Mind you, she packed it in ages ago.

150
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,220
Would she fancy coming out
of retirement for one night?

151
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:40,106
No, she can't Eric.
She's three months pregnant.

152
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,955
It's hardly hod-carrying, Del.
She only gotta sing four or five songs.

153
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:49,099
She was telling me about this terrible nervous
tension she suffers from before she goes on stage.

154
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:50,813
I couldn't put her
through that.

155
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:54,940
It's a shame, Del. I've got a contract here
waiting to be signed by someone.

156
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:58,842
I'm sorry, I'd liked
to have helped you pal, but...

157
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:03,767
Raquel's given the business up. It's her life.
I can't go interfering with her wishes.

158
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:09,623
I'd have made it worth her while.
600 quid for one night's work ain't to be sneezed at.

159
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:12,589
She'll need a backing group!

160
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:16,232
What d'you mean you
promised him?

161
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:18,600
What could I do, sweetheart?
It's a mate in trouble.

162
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,466
I don't care who it is, Del!
I'm not doing it!

163
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,646
- Look, I gave him your word.
- Well, you had no right to!

164
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:25,608
But it's 300 quid, Raquel!

165
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,967
I don't care how much it is, Derek!
I'm not doing it!

166
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,582
Raquel,
Eric's in dead lumber.

167
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:37,532
He's gone through all the agents,
he even showed me the list he was offered.

168
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:45,598
He was offered 12 strippers, 18 blue comedians,
a speciality dog act and Lionel Blair.

169
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,022
So what's wrong with that?

170
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:51,726
Nothing's wrong with that, sweetheart.
It's just that Eric wants you!

171
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:54,115
But she's three months pregnant.

172
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,262
I know that, but I'm not asking her to do any belly-dancing,
or annything like that, am I?

173
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:02,361
Just to sing a couple of songs,
that's all.

174
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:05,908
Anyway, it doesn't notice, does it?
Turn round for us, sweetheart.

175
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:10,671
There you are, you see? Look at that.
You've got a lovely figure and a beautiful voice.

176
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,117
And that is a gift, and that should be shared
with the world.

177
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:18,215
Or a bunch of drunks in the Starlite Rooms!
Del, I've never sung in a real nightclub before!

178
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,713
Yes you have. What about that poster you showed us
when you was top of the bill

179
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,896
with Otis Redding at the Talk of the Town,
London.

180
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:28,840
It was Laurie London
at the Talk of the Town, Reading.

181
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,649
Well, same thing, innit?

182
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:40,703
No, it is not! That was the one and only time I've
ever appeared alone on stage. It was a nightmare.

183
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:44,222
I forgot the words, I forgot the tune,
it was just a nightmare!

184
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,640
People actually cheered when they
announced last orders.

185
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:50,819
The only other time I've been
on stage has been in a double act.

186
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:54,104
I was with the magician, the Great
Ramondo. I was in that duo, Double Cream.

187
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,449
See, I don't mind that. There's someone
there to support you.

188
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,943
- Someone there to share the blame.
- Well, I'll get someone to sing along with ya!

189
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,295
It's not as simple as that!

190
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:06,047
You've got to get to know each other,
rehearse,

191
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:09,595
find out whether we can harmonise
and whether we're even compatible.

192
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,645
- We'll do all that and all!
- When's the show?

193
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,323
- Tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night? It's impossible!

194
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:20,792
Look Raquel, I've got the contract,
I've signed it. Look, there you are.

195
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:25,170
Guaranteeing I will supply the cabaret.
Thet is document. It's legal and binding.

196
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:28,441
The Trotter International
Star Agency!

197
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:30,916
Yeah, that's me. I've diversified.

198
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:34,338
Why did you sign a contract
before you'd even spoken to me?

199
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:39,919
Because I never thought that you
would let me down. Rodney, probably.

200
00:13:39,954 --> 00:13:42,651
Him, like a shot.
But you? Never.

201
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:48,394
But still, never mind.
It's the story of my life, really.

202
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,158
My old man let me down, when he walked
out and left me to fend for meself.

203
00:13:55,238 --> 00:14:01,569
Then me mum died, that weren't her fault,
but I felt that she'd let me down.

204
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:07,989
Funny the things that go through yer mind
when you're 16 and you're just all alone.

205
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:11,982
I think that's why I've always been
straight and up front with people.

206
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:16,249
Because I hate the
thought of them having the feelings that I did.

207
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,770
It says here they're paying
you 600 quid!

208
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,400
- You mouthy git!
- You said 300.

209
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,014
I know I said 300. And isn't it obvious
why I said that?

210
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:37,272
I said that because... because...

211
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:47,769
...I knew that if Raquel thought
she was earning 600 pounds for the show...

212
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,346
...that would make her even more nervous
than she is now.

213
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:56,937
So I decided to take the sting out of it,
soften the edges, relieve the pressure,

214
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,051
by telling her it was only worth 300 quid.

215
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,138
Thank you.

216
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,222
- That means you'll do it for me, sweetheart?
- But who will I be singing with?

217
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:11,479
Don't you worry about that.
I won't put you wrong. You trust me.

218
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:16,540
We'll go through all my LPs,
and make a list of classic hits for you to sing.

219
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:20,752
But these songs have gotta have musical
arrangements. We need a pianist.

220
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:24,094
Well, that's no problem, is it?
Albert!

221
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:25,097
Yes, Del?

222
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:29,840
Go and fetch the Yellow Pages,
we'll find a musician.

223
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:34,172
- Alright?
- I'll think about it, Del.

224
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,488
Cushty!

225
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,435
I'm only thinking about it,
Del! No promises.

226
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:42,518
But in the meantime
why don't you have a little practice, with your voice.

227
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:45,910
Get it back in trim, just in case.

228
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:51,681
Yeah. Alright, just in case.
I'm gonna make some coffee. Anyone else?

229
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:54,038
- I'll have one, dear.
- I'll have one sweetheart, thank you.

230
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:59,871
She's gonna knock 'em
bandy, Albert.

231
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:09,277
<i>Do you know the way to San Jose,
I've been away so long I may go wrong and use my way.</i>

232
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,220
She got a voice like an angel.

233
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,369
Raquel. Sing up, darling, come on,
don't be shy.

234
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:24,783
Lovely Jubbly!

235
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,469
Raquel's singing in the
Starlite Rooms.

236
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:32,959
Yeah? Her voice don't half
travel, don't it?

237
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,932
I mean, she's in the
kitch... What's up with you?

238
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:44,315
I've just been to view
the council's offer of accommodation.

239
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,552
And you were right, LDA does not stand
for Luxury Detached Abode.

240
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:49,956
I had a feeling.

241
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:54,184
LDA stands for Low Demand
Accommodation.

242
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:55,540
What's that, then?

243
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,733
It's a place where no one
else wants to live!

244
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,402
What they like?

245
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,676
They're like this!

246
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,493
You saucy git!

247
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,642
This place... I'll have you know that...

248
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:14,248
Raquel, turn the noise down,
will ya!

249
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:17,171
We can't hear ourselves
a thing out here!

250
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:23,150
You should have seen this place they offered me.
It looked like a time-share apartment on Albert Square.

251
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:26,113
- Did you take it?
- Of course I didn't!

252
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:28,773
Well, you've gotta find a
place of your own soon, Rodney.

253
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:31,051
A few months from now
she'll be dropping a kiddie.

254
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:34,974
Yes, I know! But at the
moment the council's my only hope.

255
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:39,753
I'm out of work and got no money coming in,
what am I supposed to do?

256
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:43,068
I don't wish to sound brutal, Rodney,
but why don't you get another job?

257
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,165
It's not that funny,
Albert!

258
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:56,375
With my history the only chance
I've got of getting future employment

259
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,706
is to go out and get me own
window-cleaning round.

260
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:03,119
I'm sorry, I don't understand. You left your
previous employment of your own accord.

261
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,655
You weren't sacked, you resigned.
So where's the problem?

262
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,284
It's not as easy as that,
Raquel.

263
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,696
Is it, Derek?

264
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,477
You see, Raquel, the only real job that Rodney's had
since he left school,

265
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,971
was that job he had with Cassandra's dad.

266
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,361
The one resigned from.

267
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,923
I thought prior to that he was a partner in
Trotters Independent Traders.

268
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:29,120
Yes, he was. And very sorely
missed when he left.

269
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:33,519
But you see, Trotters Independent Traders
was never what you call pukka business.

270
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:36,201
We never actually registered
with Company House.

271
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,417
and sort of keep down the
old paper work and that.

272
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,930
... and income tax and VAT.

273
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:48,412
So since he was 16 when Rodney left school,
the only job he ever had was when he was 26.

274
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,294
So the only time he turned up on
the government's computers...

275
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,726
was when he got that suspended sentence for
possession of cannabis.

276
00:18:55,757 --> 00:18:57,514
And you don't fancy window
- cleaning?

277
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,994
No. I don't like heights.

278
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:02,340
Couldn't you specialise in bungalows?

279
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,527
Why don't you shut up, Albert!

280
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:11,708
Alan's bound to give
Rodney a glowing reference.

281
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:16,332
We know that, sweetheart.

282
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:22,289
But where's he gonna say he's been
for the last 10 years? In the toilet?

283
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:30,107
No, it's a great picky, Rodney.
You can't get a job doing something you like.

284
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:36,462
Like, sort of music.
Cause you're interested in music, aren't you?

285
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:45,297
- Even if it was a part-time job?
- Yeah, that'd do.

286
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,052
Something like a road manager,
or something?

287
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:53,670
Where am I gonna get something like that?

288
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,876
You never know your luck, Rodney.
You never know your luck.

289
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:53,213
He's bloody good, ain't he?

290
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:59,492
Good! He's bloody awful!

291
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:05,289
You don't know what you're
talking about, bruv. Look at all these old dears.

292
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:09,636
They'll be throwing their
corsets on the stage in a minute.

293
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,831
Look, they love him.

294
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:03,688
Give us a non alcoholic lager top,
and a special for me.

295
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:10,313
If I can just get Raquel and Tony together
I'll be on a right winner.

296
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:15,614
- Del, she's pregnant!
- Only just a little bit!

297
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,189
You're just exploiting her, ain't yer?

298
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,116
No. Au cauntraire Rodney,
au contraire.

299
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:24,622
She's gonna be earning out of this,
and earning well!

300
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:29,057
We've all gotta earn a bit
to bring a little bit of money into the flat.

301
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,077
I reckon it's all wrong.

302
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:34,781
It's got nothing to do with
you, is it Rodney?

303
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,243
You are just my road manager
and part-time at that!

304
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:43,127
I've explained your duties -
you just drive 'em to rehearsals,

305
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:46,367
make sure they get tea and sandwiches
and sweep up afterwards.

306
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:54,072
Am I allowed to voice an opinion or repertoire,
presentation, arrangement, interpretation?

307
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:02,454
Right. I will do exactly what you say.
And no bloody more!

308
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:04,944
That is the last word you will hear
from me on the subject.

309
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:06,475
Good.

310
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:15,255
It's old-fashioned.
Who’s' gonna pay money to watch this?

311
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,834
Well, they have, for a start.

312
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:23,718
You think that popular
music is all about the top 10.

313
00:23:24,324 --> 00:23:28,644
Well, it's not you know.
Cause 80 per cent of the people in this country

314
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,545
they listen to what is known as
middle of the road music.

315
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,066
That means, they listen to the gaff like this.

316
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:40,234
When you take that Roger Whitaker
and that John Denver

317
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:46,101
they never appear on Top Of The Pops, but they
sell millions and milions of records,

318
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:52,429
and that is bunce, Rodney, that is serious bunce.
And this is my chanceto get where the action is.

319
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:09,276
I can see it now. Raquel and Tony.
They could be the new... the new Carpenters.

320
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:12,272
Or plumbers, or brickies.

321
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:16,457
- Sonny and Cher.
- Chas and Dave.

322
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,551
- Renee and Renato.
- Mills and Boon.

323
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:28,367
You got that contract?
Where is that contract?

324
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:35,139
I don't know if it's all
legal. I ain't been trained in that sorta thing.

325
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:39,236
You've got two GCEs,
that is good enough for me.

326
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:45,994
Yes, lots of 'forthwiths and 'hereafters'.
Lovely Jubbly.

327
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,450
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You've been a wonderful audience.

328
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,643
Ladies and gentlemen - Tony Angelino.

329
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,317
He'll never sign that contract!

330
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:45,417
He'll sign it, Rodney, don't you worry.
Tony, wonderful performance.

331
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,375
Thanks.

332
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,067
Would you mind?
Would you, please?

333
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:02,070
- Easier than you thought, weren't it Rodney?
- I don't believe you did that!

334
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:04,887
He who dares, Rodney.
He who dares.

335
00:26:08,536 --> 00:26:10,192
Tony, listen.

336
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:16,785
I've got a bit of business to discuss with you, son.
I've got some bookings for you. Are you interested?

337
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,712
Yeah? Come in ere.
We can talk about it while I'm getting changed.

338
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:24,207
Tony, can I have your autograph?

339
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:26,998
I'll be out in a minute, honey.
Out in a minute.

340
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,017
Chicks!

341
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:32,402
What is it, a hen-party?

342
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,511
No. It's the local WI.

343
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:37,406
Still, got to keep them happy.
You know what I mean?

344
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:46,540
My name's Derek Trotter of
the Derek Trotter International Stars Agency, Peckham.

345
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:48,589
You can call me Del.

346
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:58,112
- This is my roadie, Rodney.
- What's this all about, Del?

347
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:02,742
I am putting together a
middle-of-the-road duo.

348
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:06,993
You and a very talented young
singer by the name of Raquel Turner.

349
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:12,403
I've already a confirmed booking at the Starlite Rooms
with an option on a long-term c...

350
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:18,678
...long term contract
if you're good enough.

351
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,721
You're kidding me?
The Starlite, eh?

352
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:28,076
I don't get many bookings.

353
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:35,279
Have you got a manager, Tony?

354
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:39,460
Well, you have now, son. Me.

355
00:27:58,216 --> 00:28:03,560
I can't understand how someone with your talent
hasn't been snapped up already. Can you, Rodney?

356
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:07,230
- Well if he...
- There you are, he's as mystified as I am!

357
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,596
Noone told you anything
about me, then?

358
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,902
No. Is there something I
should know?

359
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:13,517
No, no.

360
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,198
When's this booking Del?

361
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,390
Tomorrow night.

362
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,148
I know that you and Raquel
have got an awful lot of work to do

363
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:25,747
rehearsing, getting your
repertoire together and what 'ave yer.

364
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,093
But I've got faith in you.
Cause you're a pro and so is she.

365
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:33,942
And I'm offering you 100
pound for tomorrow night.

366
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:39,087
The most I've ever
been paid is 50 quid.

367
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:44,738
Well, you're in the big time now,
ain't ya?

368
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:48,433
You'll be rehearsing first
thing tomorrow morning.

369
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:52,302
I've booked a room at the Jesse
Jackson Memorial Hall!

370
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:57,312
I'm gonna give Rodney, your road manager,
a list of classic hits I want you to rehearse.

371
00:28:57,723 --> 00:29:00,413
No, no. There are only a
few songs I can sing, Del.

372
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,934
And that's why you don't get
any bookings.

373
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:05,928
No, it's not that! It's
because I...

374
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,293
- Because of what?
- Nothing.

375
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:14,205
I know what your problem is son.
You can't accept a challenge. That's what it is.

376
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:17,732
But you've got me behind you now.
All you got to do is trust me.

377
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:21,941
And I'll be straight down the line with you.
No secrets, no small print.

378
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:26,957
All you've gotta do is trust me, Tony.
You do you trust me, Tony, don't you?

379
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,156
- Yeah. OK, Del.
- Good boy. You know it makes sense.

380
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:35,287
- Will you be at the hall in the morning?
- No, he's in court tomorrow.

381
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:41,037
Yes, I'm there as a witness for something.

382
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:43,993
You want me to sign that?

383
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:46,420
No, you've already signed it, look.

384
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,459
Lovely Jubbly.

385
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:57,306
I can't believe that was
the same bloke.

386
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:01,311
They're all just costume props.
They all wear 'em.

387
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:04,636
You don't think Mr Spock's
ears are his own, do you?

388
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,716
I've found him.
I've found your singing partner.

389
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:18,601
- He's terrific, ain't he, Rodney?
- Yeah.

390
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,549
You gotta see him to
believe him, haven't you, Rodney?

391
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:33,696
He's terrific. He's got this great voice,
wonderful stage presence and oodles of charisma.

392
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:37,493
This boy is gonna be a star.
And not just local, I mean he's gonna be international.

393
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,793
Where d'you learn about him?

394
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:41,462
He works forTrigger down
the council depot.

395
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:43,320
Is that true?

396
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:49,619
- Sean Connery, he worked on the dust.
- And is he like Sean Connery?

397
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:55,628
Well, he wears a wig. Let me get another lot of drinks.
Rodney, you give me a hand.

398
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:02,567
Del Boy! I hear you're in
court tomorrow.

399
00:31:05,194 --> 00:31:07,823
Don't do a lot for your
yuppy image, does it?

400
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:11,726
I don’t know. It's very trendy nowadays.
All the Big Bang boys have done a bit of stir.

401
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:17,185
It's very fashionable in the City.
Computer fraud, insider dealings, stock manipulation.

402
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,495
What you up for, Del?

403
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,342
Fly-pitching. 50 quid fine
and a slap on the wrist.

404
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:25,682
It's an occupational hazard when you're
upwardly mobile.

405
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,156
I hear Raquel's up the spout?

406
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:32,293
Thank you very much, Boycie.
Mike can we have a round of drinks please...

407
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:36,214
- ...and whatever poison he wants.
- Crystal, give us a round here, love.

408
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:38,614
Of course, it ain't easy
being a father.

409
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:42,594
No, it must have been difficult for you
with all them test tubes and what have you.

410
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:45,130
I am not talking about
that, Derek!

411
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,878
I mean looking after your child's welfare,
planning for his future...

412
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,179
Have you thought
about all that?

413
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,161
Don't you worry about my kid Boycie,
it'll be alright.

414
00:31:53,516 --> 00:31:58,100
Then there's the pregnancy itself.
That can be nine months of pure hell.

415
00:31:58,135 --> 00:32:00,724
Knowing your missus Mike
I can believe it.

416
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:06,391
Of course I was lucky.
Marlene gave birth after only eight months.

417
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,328
Yeah, well they say it's
quicker by tube...

418
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:20,052
We've just come back from The Riverside Club.
We saw Trigger's mate there singing.

419
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:21,411
He's terrific, ain't he, Rodney?

420
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,921
Perhaps Trig could
recommend him to Eric.

421
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,052
Eric? What, from the Starlite Rooms?

422
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:32,248
Yeah, the one who don't like you.
Something about 500 quid.

423
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,597
That all in the past.

424
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:37,375
But that man holds a grudge.

425
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,404
Anyway, he's got 24 hours
to fill a cabaret spot for tomorrow night.

426
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:43,637
He'll never do it. I mean,
the word's out now.

427
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:48,972
He's gotta do something. I've heard
Eugene Macarthy's very much looking forward to it.

428
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:50,808
Who's Eugene Macarthy?

429
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:57,829
A local villain and not a very nice man. Rumour has
it that the SAS pays Eugene protection money.

430
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:00,735
But what the hell's Eugene
gotta do with all this?

431
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,242
- Didn't you hear?
- What?

432
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:05,225
Eugene owns the Starlite Rooms.

433
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,197
No, no. It's Eric.
Eric owns the Starlite Rooms

434
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,799
Eugene bought him out
three months ago.

435
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:15,152
Yes, there was no boardroom negotiations,
no offer and counter-offer.

436
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:19,545
Eugene gave Eric two choices:
Take it or I'll nail you to the door.

437
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:28,078
Eric - realising that he was dealing with a man who
puts out death sentences on Muslims - took it.

438
00:33:28,113 --> 00:33:31,497
Anyway, tomorrow night is
Eugene's mum's 82nd birthday.

439
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:35,425
So he's having a party down at the Starlite Rooms
for her and all the nasties.

440
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:40,540
Eric's down there at the Starlite Rooms,
ain't he?

441
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:43,442
Eric is only the manager now though Del.

442
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,599
And part of Eric's
managerial duties is booking the cabaret.

443
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,951
But every time he books the cabaret
Eugene doesn't like,

444
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,725
he probably gets nailed
to the nearest door.

445
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:55,172
So he came up with a
brilliant solution.

446
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:59,438
He started employing the
services of local entertainment agencies,

447
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:03,896
so if Eugene gets displeased
he takes his wrath out on the agents.

448
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,746
The agents all held a meeting at the local
convalescent home

449
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,424
and decided to boycott the
Starlite Rooms.

450
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:16,698
So unless Eric finds a mug
to supply the cabaret for Eugene's mum's party,

451
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,823
B&Q will be selling another door.

452
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:33,984
- We're in a bit of bother here, bruv.
- Yeah... We?

453
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,513
We've signed a contract
guaranteeing the cabaret!

454
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:42,064
I've signed nothing!
I sweep up and I make the tea.

455
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:47,727
I've been thinking about that. And I think you ought
to have a more creative import in this little project.

456
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:51,493
And I've been thinking and all,
and I don't wanna more creative input.

457
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:55,092
You just gimme the broom,
the teapot and the 50 quid and I'm happy!

458
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:58,355
- Thank you very much, Rodney.
- It's my pleasure, Derek!

459
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:02,538
Come in.

460
00:35:03,946 --> 00:35:05,413
Is Del here yet?

461
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:09,624
I phoned the flat but
there's no reply. Perhaps he's still in court.

462
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:13,559
- But it's nine o'clock!
- Maybe the jury's still out.

463
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:16,895
Don't be stupid, Rodney!
He's only been charged with unlicensed trading!

464
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,684
Well, he's ain't here.

465
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,712
- I can't go through with this.
- Why not?

466
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:24,493
What do you mean, why not?
You were at rehearsals this morning.

467
00:35:24,528 --> 00:35:28,036
You know what happened!
Tony's got a problem.

468
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,248
They might not notice.

469
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:32,679
Of course they'll notice!
How can they not notice?

470
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:38,043
You've gotta go through with this for Del's sake!
Eugene Macarthy has sat out there with his mum!

471
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:39,908
Who's Eugene Macarthy?

472
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:41,637
He's not nice people.

473
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:45,624
Well, you go and tell Eugene Macarthy
and his mum that the cabaret's off!

474
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:50,529
Me? I'm just the roadie! Sweep up
and make the tea, that was my instructions.

475
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:52,714
D'you fancy a cup of tea?

476
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:53,952
No, I don't!

477
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:55,451
- D'you want anything swept up?
- No.

478
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,792
Well, that's me finished here.

479
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,789
- Gordon Bennett.
- Where the bloody hell have you been?

480
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:19,842
Where have I been?
They've put my case on last.

481
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:24,897
Then there was a 65 quid fine,
I realized I'd left me wallet at home.

482
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,509
So I phoned up Sinbad and what does he do?
He only gets on the bleeding bus!

483
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,813
There I am, banged up in the cells,

484
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:35,553
and Sinbad is trying to fight his way
through the Friday afternoon traffic in a bloody bus!

485
00:36:37,174 --> 00:36:40,877
Will you shut up for one
minute? We have got problems!

486
00:36:41,717 --> 00:36:43,162
Problems? What sorta
problems?

487
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:50,129
Hello Eugene!
Very very nice to see you.

488
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:53,498
Eric informs me that you're
supplying tonight's cabaret?

489
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:58,473
I hope it's good, Del. It's my old mum's birthday
and I don't wanna see her disappointed.

490
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:02,917
Of course not, Eugene. It's gonna be the best,
nothing but the very best.

491
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:06,453
Would I do anything less
for your dear mother?

492
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:08,439
Let me introduce my brother...

493
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:11,362
I'm just the road manager.
I just sweep up, make the tea...

494
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:14,237
and I've got nothing to do with the artistic contents
or anything like that.

495
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,626
Well, here's to a good evening.

496
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:20,237
Yes. Thank you Eugene. Enjoy yourself.
You sit back and enjoy.

497
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:28,156
Welcome to the cabaret hour!

498
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:31,957
Before I introduce our star guests this evening,

499
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,507
I just have to say happy birthday,
Mrs Macarthy - Eugene's mum.

500
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,575
Happy birthday, Lil.

501
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:53,179
We're proud to present two young British stars
whose names may not be familiar to you.

502
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:58,180
However, if you was a resident of a certain town
in Nevada, USA,

503
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:00,938
their names
would be on the tips of your tongues.

504
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:06,207
For they have just finished a sell-out season
with Barry Manilow

505
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:10,591
at the Desert Inn,
Las Vegas!

506
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:16,909
Where did he get all that
crap from?

507
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,823
What a stupid question.

508
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:26,336
...they have chosen the Starlite Rooms,
in Peckham.

509
00:38:30,803 --> 00:38:37,830
So a warm welcome please for
Raquel and Tony.

510
00:38:51,006 --> 00:39:00,288
<i>I was alright for a while.
I could smile for a while.</i>

511
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:05,440
<i>But when I saw you last night,
You held my hand so tight,</i>

512
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:12,935
<i>As you stopped to say hello,
And though you wished me well,</i>

513
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:22,657
<i>You couldn't tell,
That I'd been cry...ing, over you,</i>

514
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,913
<i>Cry...ing, over you,</i>

515
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:36,342
<i>Then you said so long,
Left me standing all alone,</i>

516
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:43,251
<i>Alone and crying... crying
... crying... crying.</i>

517
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,114
- She's bloody good, ain't she, Rodney?
- Cosmic!

518
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:09,485
<i>I though that I was over you,
But tell me now, what can I do?</i>

519
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:20,210
<i>I love you even more, than I did before,
So, dah'ling, what can I do...oo?</i>

520
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:28,891
<i>You don't love me,
And I'll always be,</i>

521
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:38,545
<i>Cwy...ing, over you...</i>

522
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:50,274
<i>Yes, now you are gone,
And fwom this moment on, I'll be cwying.</i>

523
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:55,700
<i>- Crying.
- Cwying.</i>

524
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:34,369
What d'you reckon, then?

525
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,333
I'll see you later.

526
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:52,014
So how comes you didn't
know he had trouble with his Rs?

527
00:41:54,234 --> 00:41:55,583
'cause he never told me!

528
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:58,591
All he said was he only
enjoyed singing certain songs.

529
00:41:58,626 --> 00:42:02,654
Can see what he meant now.
He only sings songs without Rs in 'em!

530
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:05,422
So he chose the songs for tonight?

531
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:10,953
I didn't know, did I?
God knows what Eugene and his mum's gonna say.

532
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,167
I never did like that front
door anyway.

533
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:22,154
You bastard!
You just walked out and left us!

534
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,711
Well, what else could I do?
I couldn't go over to Eugene's table and say,

535
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:30,043
"That was alright, different weren't it?"
Did you finish the performance?

536
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,653
Oh yes, Derek, we saw it
through to the death.

537
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:43,800
Please Welease Me, Congwatulations and
The Gween Gween Gwass of Home.

538
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:50,444
And that was followed by a medley
of wock 'n' woll!

539
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,260
That is not funny, Wodney - Rodney!

540
00:43:00,668 --> 00:43:02,531
I thought it was hilarious!

541
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:06,031
I ain't laughed so much since he caught his beard
in the food mixer.

542
00:43:07,664 --> 00:43:12,729
If that's Eugene,
tell him I've gone to get the hammer and nails!

543
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:14,126
Who's there?

544
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:16,702
Can I speak to Mr Twotter?

545
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:19,183
It's Tony. Let him in.

546
00:43:23,585 --> 00:43:25,197
I've come for my money!

547
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:29,084
Not now son. I'm up to my eyes in it.
Come back tomorrow.

548
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,665
No, not tomowow. I want my
money now! I did the performance, didn't I?

549
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:38,669
I did the wepertoire that
you... you insisted on.

550
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:41,267
But I didn't know you
couldn't pronounce your Rs!

551
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,577
What does that matter?

552
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:45,631
Matters quite a lot when
you're singing songs with Rs in!

553
00:43:45,997 --> 00:43:51,846
But I don't sing songs with Rs in! And if a song has
got an R in it I change the lywics!

554
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,358
Well, why didn't you change
the lywics tonight?

555
00:43:54,393 --> 00:43:59,292
How can I change the lyrics to Cwying?
The bloody song's called Cwying!

556
00:44:01,914 --> 00:44:05,501
Tony and I did everything you asked us to do, Del,
so pay the man his money.

557
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,204
And while you're at it, you owe
me money as well.

558
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:09,688
Alright sweetheart,
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

559
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:12,488
Listen, Trotter, you're not
cheating me!

560
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,077
It's alright for me to
be cheated though, innit?

561
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:20,877
Who's cheated you?

562
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,231
Him. He's cheating me.
You know what he did?

563
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:29,481
He charged me £1.40
for bus fares!

564
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:33,593
It was only when I was putting
me dickie bow on, that I realized he's got a bus pass!

565
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:39,625
And I don't suppose the Starlite Rooms
is gonna pay me anything after tonight's disaster!

566
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:41,889
I'm gonna be well out of pocket!

567
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:44,270
We signed a contwact!

568
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:52,156
But my brother drew up that contract
and he put in a get-out claus, didn't you, Rodney?

569
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,964
- No.
- Why didn't you?

570
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:59,367
'Cos you didn't tell me to.
I ain't a lawyer.

571
00:44:59,368 --> 00:45:03,985
I sweep up and make the tea, you remember?
And you owe me 50 quid!

572
00:45:15,663 --> 00:45:17,210
We'll talk about this
tomorrow!

573
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:18,945
Anything you say, Rodney.

574
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:23,976
You know what you've got, don't ya, Dewek?
An 'ism'.

575
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:26,958
An 'ism'? I ain't got an 'ism', have I Rodney?

576
00:45:27,595 --> 00:45:29,730
Well, there's a lot of
crap in the garage.

577
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:37,526
You're not alone in your pwejudice.
We've got sexism, wacecism, higheism and ageism.

578
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:46,709
Well, I'm a victim of pwonunciationism!
I've got a good voice! I've got a good style.

579
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:53,708
I've got a perfect tone. Just because I pwonouce my Rs
differently from the west of you

580
00:45:54,393 --> 00:46:00,326
I can never be a star! Just because of my
pwonunciation you've dumped me!

581
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:03,175
What about me? I got lumbered with a 'star'

582
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:08,179
whose props come from Lilley & Skinner's
Crown Toppers and Mattesons!

583
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:16,001
But you can always find another singer.
I'm stuck with my pwoblem.

584
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:19,998
No one who pwonounces Rs like I do
have ever become successful.

585
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:22,592
There's Roy Jenkins and
Jonathan Ross.

586
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:24,710
Exactly...

587
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,324
Doesn't matter...

588
00:46:32,745 --> 00:46:36,519
- See you, Del.
- Take care, son.

589
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,675
- Waquel.
- Bye, Tony.

590
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:44,203
- Wodney.
- See you Tony.

591
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:59,735
Well, don't you two look at me like that!
I didn't invent pronunciationism!

592
00:47:00,045 --> 00:47:01,792
It's them out there,
the public!

593
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:08,612
If I had my way, I think everyone should be allowed to say
what they like and how they wanna say it. It's a free country.

594
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,753
Del's right. It ain't his fault.

595
00:47:10,788 --> 00:47:13,029
Thank you, Unc. Help yourself to a brandy.

596
00:47:18,847 --> 00:47:20,708
Hello?
Trotters Independence Tra...

597
00:47:21,914 --> 00:47:23,959
Hello Eugene!

598
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:29,159
You discovered that then,
did ya?

599
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:32,983
Funny enough, I was just having a word about that
with my road manager here...

600
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:41,081
Did she? Well, I can't say I blame
her...

601
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:46,713
How is she now? Good...

602
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:57,165
That's alright then, Eugene.
I'll be round first thing in the morning...

603
00:47:58,385 --> 00:47:59,754
Bonjour.

604
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:04,599
D'you wanna hide
a pair of pliers in your pocket?

605
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:11,049
He wants to sign you and
Tony up for a five-week contract!

606
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:14,220
His mum liked you.

607
00:48:14,736 --> 00:48:16,865
- You're kidding?
- No, straight up.

608
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:20,397
She reckoned it was the funniest thing
she'd ever seen in her life!

609
00:48:27,236 --> 00:48:30,215
Just a minute!
I've got some more bookings for you!

610
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:33,880
Stick with me, son,
I'll make you wich!
