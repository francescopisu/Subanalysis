Why don't you get an answering machine?

How do you keep up the pace?
It sounded excessive even for Mel Gibson!

60

I've decided to continue with that.
It hasn't worked, but Rodney's enjoyed trying!

No, I was not! As if I'd get involved in a riot!

- I'll leave it to you.
- How are things with you and Del?

# We need just one voice... #

162
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:46,970
- This is Raquel's most favourite number.
- Yeah?

163
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:49,695
Can I switch it off?

164
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:52,210
No! Leave it.

165
00:11:55,695 --> 00:12:00,610
Every time I hear this number,
it always reminds me of my Raquel.

166
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:03,690
Yeah, switch it off.

167
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:09,570
There you go, Denzil.
One bowl of piping hot porridge.

168
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:13,284
- That'll warm you up on a cold morning.
- Cheers, Sid.

169
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:16,765
- There's a hair in this.
- Give us it here.

170
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,334
There's another one.

171
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:24,487
Hang on.

172
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:30,483
That's disgusting. If the health authority saw this,
they'd close you down.

173
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:34,011
I've been closed down for a lot worse than that!

174
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,530
- I hate politically correct people.
- Yeah.

175
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:41,086
- What are you having, Trig?
- I'll try some of that porridge.

176
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:47,492
There's Denzil. Get me a cup of tea, will you?

177
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,326
All right, Denz?

178
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:53,692
- Two teas, Sid.
- All right, Dave?

179
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,327
Yeah, all right, Trig.

180
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:59,965
Don't have the porridge, Rodney.
I found hairs in mine.

181
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:04,128
- It was only two hairs.
- That's enough, isn't it?

182
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,893
Maybe there's a sporran in it!

183
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,809
- Got all your Christmas presents?
- No, not yet.

184
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:15,490
- Damien wants a pet.
- The council don't allow pets.

185
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:19,409
Only a little one, like a rabbit or a guinea pig.

186
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,806
- How's it going, Del?
- Don't ask, Trig.

187
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,535
- Things the same?
- Still giving me strife.

188
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:30,166
- It's a bitch, innit?
- That's stronging it a bit, Trig!

189
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:32,451
You're too soft, Del.

190
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:35,083
I've been in the same boat as you.

191
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:41,125
- And I got shot of it.
- It's not as simple as just get shut of it!

192
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:45,413
Del loves... Well, a strong bond exists, doesn't it?

193
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,773
- We've been together a long time.
- You'll just get more aggro.

194
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:54,850
I know how you feel.
You become attached to 'em, give 'em pet names.

195
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:58,485
Take my advice.
Get down the dentist and have it out.

196
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,047
The tooth!

197
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:07,653
It's best in the long run. Try my dentist.
He's good. I've been going for years.

198
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:10,693
All right. I might try that, Trig.

199
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:14,291
We were talking about Del and Raquel.
Are you still rowing?

200
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:18,289
- He's never there to find out!
- No!

201
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:21,845
She's still talking to me, unfortunately!

202
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,451
I'll never understand
the workings of a woman's mind.

203
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,494
I suppose that's why I gave up trying in the end.

204
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:34,331
- Here, who was that bird I used to go out with?
- Which one?

205
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,089
Ooh, what was her name?

206
00:14:38,895 --> 00:14:41,011
- What did she look like?
- Redhead.

207
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:44,850
- One of the redheads. Pauline?
- No.

208
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:46,687
- Veronique?
- No.

209
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:48,811
- Janine?
- Her?!

210
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:51,409
- Marian?
- Who's Marian?

211
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:55,966
You met her at Catford dog track.
You bought her a ring.

212
00:14:56,615 --> 00:15:01,928
Oh, yeah! No, not her. The one
I'm thinking about, her dad was a tattooist.

213
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:08,091
She had this tattoo of a heart
with a dagger going through it on her thigh.

214
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:12,851
- Don't ring a bell.
- You would have only been about two!

215
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:17,133
She worked in a betting shop
down Lewisham Grove.

216
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,889
- Betting shop...
- Down Lewisham Grove.

217
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,125
Look, it don't matter.

218
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:27,050
I went out with her for about...
Must have been a month.

219
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:32,414
Actually, she was going steady
with another bloke. Made it more exciting.

220
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:37,251
She was a sporting girl, a good all-rounder.
Know what I mean?

221
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,530
I'd saved up me money to take her on holiday.

222
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:46,085
It was gonna be exotic, the holiday of a lifetime.

223
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:50,885
When all of a sudden, right out the blue,
for no reason, she packed me in.

224
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,205
And yet the night before,

225
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:58,051
I had taken her home to meet my mum and dad
for the first time.

226
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:07,923
So next day I went down
the betting shop to have a chat with her

227
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,245
and they said she weren't there.

228
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:15,045
But I knew she was because I saw
her crash helmet hanging on the hook.

229
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,729
You know where I found her?

230
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:21,774
She was hiding on the roof.
She said she was sunbathing.

231
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:26,725
- Maybe she was sunbathing.
- It was a sloping roof.

232
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:32,652
There she was with her back against the tiles
and her stilettos jammed in the gutter.

233
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:37,733
She nearly fell off twice.

234
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:42,491
Anyway, that was that.
Cor blimey, what was her name?

235
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:48,411
Did you get your money back on the holiday?

236
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,124
No. You know what these caravan sites are like!

237
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:20,047
- Del Boy.
- Rodders! What are you doing here?

238
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:24,447
I had a couple of hours to kill,
so I said to Cass I'd pop down and see Del.

239
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:28,369
'Ere, Miguel. Lager-top, please.

240
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:35,132
- You're drinking a lot of Scotch these days.
- It's the only thing that dulls the pain.

241
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:40,449
Talk to her, Del. There's nothing
that can't be sorted by talking it out.

242
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:43,413
Not Raquel! I mean my bloody tooth!

243
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:47,011
- Well, go to the dentist.
- I don't like dentists.

244
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:50,451
- Then get septicaemia!
- Shut up moaning, will ya?

245
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:53,925
I'm psyching myself up for the game
and you lecture me.

246
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:57,610
It's like playing poker with Neil Kinnock!

247
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,288
Here you are.

248
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,892
- Del Boy. Rodney.
- How's it going, Boycie?

249
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:08,048
Life is one long, uphill struggle
at the moment, Derek.

250
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:13,005
The second-hand car business is
in its biggest slump since... the last one.

251
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:17,214
Me and Marlene could only afford
one week in Barbados this year.

252
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:22,972
Oh, that's terrible, innit? Don't go on about it.
You know how easy I cry!

253
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:27,174
- We'll have to hold a whip for him.
- Can I count the lashes?

254
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:33,933
I happen to believe everyone has the right
to expect a certain standard of living.

255
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:37,087
It's all right for you
coming from that council estate.

256
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,247
Sometimes I almost envy you.

257
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:45,364
Not often, I must admit.
Especially with all the problems you've got.

258
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:49,653
We ain't got no problems. Raquel and I
are just going through a sticky patch.

259
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:54,013
When I mentioned problems,
I was referring to that riot the other night.

260
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:59,727
I hear they went through the estate
looking for any half-decent car, then set fire to it.

261
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:02,887
Your three-wheel van all right, was it?

262
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:06,252
Yes, thank you. They didn't lay a finger on it.

263
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:09,009
That's a godsend, at least (!)

264
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:12,167
Only 'cause I know the leader of the rioters.

265
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:16,533
Terrible, innit? The way they set fire
to their own people's property

266
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,767
when there's a big car site just up the road.

267
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,894
- That's Boycie's car site, Derek.
- Is it?

268
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:27,889
Let's hope someone does not suggest
that to the rioters.

269
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:31,650
Er... Miguel, can you get my friends a drink?

270
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:34,488
Same again. Put it on my account.

271
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:37,453
Well, I must be off. Lots of luck!

272
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:39,765
Cheers, Boycie.

273
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:42,893
Miguel.

274
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:52,087
- Cor blimey!
- Eh?

275
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:57,848
I dunno about my teeth.
I think my eyes need testing.

276
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:06,013
I turned round a bit quick then and I thought
Right Said Fred had just walked in!

277
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:16,894
- Good night.
- Good night.

278
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:21,128
("CRIMEWATCH" THEME TUNE PLAYS)

279
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:34,449
- Aren't you gonna have a bet?
- No! It's a mug's game!

280
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:38,164
The only one who wins is the casino owner.

281
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:43,844
- Sorry, what were you saying?
- So you were lucky.

282
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:47,530
- You've won. So let's go home.
- No, I'm on a roll.

283
00:20:47,695 --> 00:20:50,050
I'll play the evens.

284
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,685
Will you spare one moment's thought for Raquel?

285
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:57,973
Who do you think I'm doing this for?
For her and Damien.

286
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:01,730
I couldn't say before because
I didn't want word to get out.

287
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:05,285
I'm trying to put down a big deal
with Ronnie Nelson.

288
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,933
So why are you at this club most nights?

289
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:12,212
He owns it! He don't come in
before one in the morning.

290
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:18,371
I've gotta hang about to have a word with him.
I can't let this deal slip through my fingers.

291
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:22,972
Tell you what it is.
It's 650 hand-held camcorders.

292
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,807
- Made in Russia.
- Russian camcorders?!

293
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:32,968
I didn't think they went in
for all that "You've Been Framed" cobblers.

294
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:36,252
No, these are ex-military with night-vision.

295
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:41,170
We're going to buy
650 Russian army camcorders?

296
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,769
Yeah, with a bit of luck.

297
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,607
895 quid.

298
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:49,290
You're gonna pay P895 for a camera?

299
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:52,333
No, no, no, no. 895 quid for the lot!

300
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:58,287
- They sound very classy (!)
- State of the art.

- Aren't you gonna have a bet?
- No.

303
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:07,488
Try and look at it from Raquel's point of view.

304
00:22:07,655 --> 00:22:11,933
She's there night after night
with Horatio and his tales of the sea

305
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:14,165
and you're here drinking and gambling.

306
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:17,452
- I know. And does she appreciate it?
- No!

307
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:20,652
No, she does not.

308
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:24,967
Honestly! She thinks I'm out
every night enjoying myself.

309
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,411
Excuse me, darling. Same again, please.

310
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:33,251
That's the trouble with women.
They change and expect you to change, too.

311
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,691
She wanted me to become
a pipe-and-slippers man.

312
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,325
A cup of tea and a biscuit,
watching "Family Fortunes".

313
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:43,089
Stuff that for a game of toy soldiers!

314
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:47,089
I'm not averse to a cup of Darjeeling
and an 'Obnob,

315
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:49,769
but there is a time and place for it.

316
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,813
No, I live life on the tightrope.

317
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:57,694
I enjoy the company of me mates.
Why should I change just 'cause of Raquel?

318
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:01,734
Who are your mates, Del?
Boycie, the freemason.

319

A snob who thinks anyone who's got
a pound less than him is a peasant.

320
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:09,524
Denzil is a man who eats porridge with a wig in it,

321
00:23:09,695 --> 00:23:14,325
and Trigger, a road sweeper
who gives pet names to his teeth!

322
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:18,734
They're still me mates.

323
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:21,204
I'm not like you, Rodders.

324
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:25,163
- Del Boy is not for turning.
- What's that supposed to mean?

325
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:28,372
- Marriage ain't changed me.
- It has, Rodney.

326
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:33,529
Cassandra's into this conservation malarkey
and so is Rodney as well.

327
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:38,610
I have not changed, Del.
When I make my mind up, nothing can alter it.

328
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:42,563
- 140 pieces, sir. Thank you.
- We'll stick with evens.

329
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,044
I'm gonna go and get some chips.

330
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:00,768
Come on! Red, red, red!

331
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:05,848
Excuse me, Del. I'm afraid
Ronnie won't be in now. I'll leave a message.

332
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,131
Oh, all right. Thanks.

333
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:19,566
- Come on, Rodney. Let's go home.
- The ball ain't landed yet.

Oi! How much did you lose?

337
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:31,444
- Fifty.
- You plonker!

338
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:36,690
I wouldn't have gambled
if you hadn't encouraged me.

339
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:41,645
Don't blame me. What did you come in here for
if you didn't want a flutter?

340
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,171
I'll tell you why. Cassandra suggested I come.

341
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:48,645
- Why?
- To get you home at a decent hour.

342
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:52,012
We are trying to save
your relationship with Raquel.

343
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:56,453
You've been falling in half one,
two in the morning, and it is not on!

344
00:25:02,215 --> 00:25:07,084
It's eight o'clock in the morning!
This is all your fault, dopey!

345
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,247
- Me?!
- Yes, you kept me talking in there!

346
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:14,044
- Who was it doing all the gambling?
- You did your fair share.

347
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:19,289
Cor blimey, I could have been home hours ago.
You've dropped me in it!

348
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:23,133
Look, we've gotta be down the market
in half an hour!

349
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:26,173
Listen, I know what you're thinking!

350
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:30,010
You're thinking,
"What do I want with this ski equipment?

351
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:32,484
"There ain't no mountains in Peckham."

352
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:37,365
In a few months,
you may decide to take an Alpine holiday.

353
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:41,323
Due to my unique style of bulk buying,

354
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:47,730
you can go togged out in the latest fashion
at bargain-basement prices.

355
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:51,012
I'm gonna show you how stylish this gear is.

356
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,928
It's being modelled by my brother, Rodney.

357
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:03,373
The jacket is padded in pure fibreglass

358
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:06,607
and quilted in natural nylon.

359
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:11,371
This jacket alone would set you back
120 quid at Lilywhites,

360
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:16,848
but this can be yours for a mere P35
and it comes in all sizes.

361
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:23,250
All this is manufactured by the one country
that leads the world in Alpine clothing,

00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,326
namely, Fiji.

Rodney, it's Cassandra.

368
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:51,209
Cass? I told you never to phone me at work. I'm...

369
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,574
What?

370
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,366
What, now?

371
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,531
I can't. I'm in the midd...

372
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:03,648
Yes, all right.

373
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:08,248
I've gotta shoot off. Cassie needs me.

374
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:10,087
What for?

375
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:16,004
- It's probably the right time.
- She'll keep till this evening!

376

No, it's... You know...

She's most probably at the right temperature.

Stone me, Rodney! What are you two
trying for - a baby or a barbecue?

379
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:36,367
Go on! Hurry up!
Don't you wanna change your clothes?

380
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:40,649
Oh! Look at that!

381
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:43,926
Cass, I'm home!

382
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:48,088
- I'm in here, Roddy.
- Right. I won't be a minute.

383
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:04,486
Sorry about that, Raquel. I was... I was hot.

384
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:08,964
- What are you doing here?
- She's left Del.

385
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:12,207
- Why?
- Do you know what time he got in?

386
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,535
- No.
- Quarter past eight.

387
00:28:19,215 --> 00:28:20,694
Get away!

388
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:25,883
He changed and went straight down the market.
Didn't even stop for his tea.

389
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:29,206
He's not treating me like that any more.

390
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:34,574
Look at it from his point of view.
There are extenuating circumstances.

391

Like what?

392
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:39,010
He's having trouble with his teeth.

00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,292
- That's no excuse!
- No, but he is in pain.

00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:48,414

- I said they could stay here.

396
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:52,488
- Here? But this is a one-bedroom flat.
- This is a sofa bed.

397
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:57,285
I won't be here for long.
A couple of nights. Is that OK with you?

398
00:28:57,455 --> 00:28:59,605
Yeah, course.

399
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:02,573

That's exactly the attitude I took with my Corinne.

409

Even when she left me I refused to change.

00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,412
Seven years ago, but I haven't changed.

411

But there is a difference, Denzil.

412
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:07,494
Raquel would never leave me.
It's the real deep love thing.

What? Here's a mystery for you.

415
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:18,330
Why is it women always wanna know
what time you got in?

416
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:22,488
They say, "What time did you get in last night?"
You say, "About 12.15."

417
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,772
They say, "No, you didn't! It was twenty to two!"

418
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:28,574
I'm thinking, "Well, why bloody ask!"

419
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:33,092
Right, why ask? It's like saying to you,
"What's that on the telly -

420
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:36,452
"Coronation Street" or "EastEnders"?"
You say, "EastEnders."

- Beats me!

"Where are you living now?"

I love her, but sometimes I think getting married
was the worst mistake I ever made.

00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:24,374
I sometimes think back
to when we first met in Lewisham Grove.

with business and his teeth going manky."

466
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:54,286
Exactly. My teeth are not going manky!

- That's the one.
- I know that!

481
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,963
Help yourself to the, um...

482
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:54,729
Mmm? Oh, ta.

483
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:02,406
Very good.

484
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:08,533
Do you have regular dental checks?

485
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:11,971
Yes, Doctor. You can't be too careful
with the choppers.

486
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:15,169
Who was the last dentist you saw?

487
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:19,248
That would be Mr Owens -
had a surgery down Gandhi Avenue.

488
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:25,888
Mr Owens? He died on the night
of the Queen's Silver Jubilee - 1977.

489
00:35:26,055 --> 00:35:28,444
Tragic, wasn't it?

490
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:32,733
So you have a regular check-up every 16 years?

491
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:37,967
- I think it's better in the long run, don't you?
- Yes. Yes.

492
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:42,927
Afraid your tooth is beyond repair.
It'll have to come out.

493
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:45,973
I'll make an appointment for next week.

494
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:48,205
- I'll do it now.
- Now?

495
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:51,094
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

496
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:55,371
This will make one side of your face a bit numb.

497
00:35:55,535 --> 00:35:59,005
You see, the thing is, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

498
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,166
It'll only take five minutes.

499
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:05,010
- My brother's in the van.
- Just a little prick.

500
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:07,211
You know him, do you?

501
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:22,286
Aghhhh!

502
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:26,203
There we are.

503
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:31,574
If you'd like to sit in the waiting room
and give the anaesthetic time to work,

504
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:34,329
I'll call you in five minutes.

505
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:36,804
Thank you, Doctor.

506
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,606
(BUZZER)

507
00:36:40,775 --> 00:36:43,494
Mrs Marshall. You can go through now.

508
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:53,568
Gotta wait for this jollop to work.

509
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:58,490
Doesn't take too long.
We could complete this form while you wait.

510
00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:02,648
It's just for new patients.
I've got most of your details.

511
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:05,170
Now, let me see...

512
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:10,572
- Next of kin?
- I'm only having me tooth out!

513
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,608
It's just local health authority procedure.

514
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:18,204
I ain't got no next of kin.

515
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,572
- No one?
- There's my brother.

516
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:24,374
- Have you got any dependents?
- My brother.

517
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:46,729
- Any children?
- Yeah, I've got a son.

518
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:48,886
That's better.

519
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:53,165
It's Damien. Damien Derek Trotter.

520
00:37:53,335 --> 00:37:56,133
My daughter's got a little boy called that.

521
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:58,251
Damien Derek Trotter?

522
00:37:58,415 --> 00:38:01,327
No, just Damien.

523
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:04,055
You're having me on! You've got a grandson?

524
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,968
- Yeah.
- Never!

525
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:09,888
You must have had your daughter very young.

526
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:14,173
I'd put you down as late twenties.

527
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,451
Oh, get off!

528
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:18,651
Honest. Straight up!

529
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:23,571
- Is he your husband, is he?
- Mr Ellis?

530
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:29,014
- No, I just work here.
- I thought it might be a family business.

531
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:31,450
No, I'm divorced.

532
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:36,927
- We broke up about nine years ago.
- Oh, really?

533
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:42,172
'Cause my w..., er, partner, she left me.

534
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:44,485
Oh, I'm sorry.

535
00:38:45,415 --> 00:38:49,772
People say time's a great healer.
But I'm not so sure.

536
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:55,567
Even now I sometimes think about those days
and it still hurts, you know?

537
00:38:55,735 --> 00:39:02,288
- I know. I still get little pangs.
- When did your relationship break up?

538
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:04,685
This morning.

539
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:07,415
This morning?!

540
00:39:07,575 --> 00:39:12,854
Perhaps we ought to go out with each other
and cry on each other's shoulders.

541
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:14,971
Del, there is a rat in the van!

542
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:19,527
- You what?
- In the van! A rat!

543
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,174
- A rat?
- In the van!

544
00:39:21,335 --> 00:39:23,485
What are you on about?

545
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:27,170
I am trying to inform you
that there is a rat in the van.

546
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:29,371
It's not a rat!

547
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,288
It's a gerbil.

548
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:36,206
All right. So there's a gerbil in the van!

549
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,606
- I know. I got it for Christmas.
- For Christmas?!

550
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:46,844
- For Damien?
- Yes, it's one of his presents!

551
00:39:47,015 --> 00:39:49,290
Gerry the gerbil.

552
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:53,971
I had it in a cage in the van.
The door must have come open.

553
00:39:54,135 --> 00:39:57,650
- Go and put it back in the cage.
- Eh?

554
00:39:58,655 --> 00:40:02,648
Go and put the gerbil back in the cage!

555
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:08,768
Right.

556
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:13,924
Dependents! Huh!

557
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:17,246
My boy wanted a pet for Christmas,

558
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,134
so I got him Gerry the gerbil.

559
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,934
- So what about it, Beverley?
- Sorry?

560
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:26,485
You and me having a date.

561
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:29,806
Well, it's very nice of you, but...

562
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:36,653
Your relationship's only just broken up.
In a couple of days you could be back together.

563
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:39,329
No, we won't. It's finished. Caput!

564
00:40:39,495 --> 00:40:42,931
There's no going back. I'm a free agent.

565
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:46,246
- I go where I want, with whom I want.
- OK, then!

566
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:51,814
Yeah. Lovely jubbly! You know it makes sense!

567
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:58,004
Well, what about this evening? Eight o'clock?

568
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:04,125
Take you out for a slap-up meal.
Steak, onion rings...

569
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,286
Fine!

570
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:12,805
That's where I live. And my phone number
in case anything goes wrong.

571
00:41:12,975 --> 00:41:16,285
- I'll shee you thish evening.
- What?

572
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:21,333
Oh, sorry. The antisheptic's beginning to work.

573
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:24,407
- He'll be with you in a minute.
- Hmm.

574
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:32,288
I'll just, er, shit here.

575
00:41:50,815 --> 00:41:53,488
Are they the Russian cameras?

576
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:59,412
No, this is a pair of Chelsea boots
with an elasticated gusset (!) Of course it is!

577
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:00,974
All right?

578
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:05,447
- How's your mouth, Del?
- Can't feel a thing. Brilliant dentist.

579
00:42:05,615 --> 00:42:10,325
- These are bigger than I imagined.
- They are a bit on the wide side.

580
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:14,329
- You said they was hand-held.
- You're holding it in your hand.

581
00:42:14,495 --> 00:42:19,933
Only just. If you carried one round EuroDisney
you'd do your back in!

582
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:23,929
That's good for you, Rodney.
It'll build your strength up.

583
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:28,247
Save you a fortune on weights
and rowing machines and stuff.

584
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:32,454
- I wonder what that writing says?
- "Reject", probably.

585
00:42:33,615 --> 00:42:37,574
These are not rejects. These are top of the range.

586
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,044
Look at 'em. Solid, they are.

587
00:42:40,215 --> 00:42:45,164
No bits of plastic to break off.
The cassette is inside the camera.

588
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:48,327
Don't muck about with them soppy little things.

589
00:42:48,495 --> 00:42:51,487
This was designed for tank warfare.

590
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:56,445
Yes, can just see 'em now - "Number One,
fire a shot across his bow!"

591
00:42:57,895 --> 00:42:59,487
- Del?
- Yeah?

592
00:42:59,655 --> 00:43:03,091
They don't fit the machine.

593
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:06,327
No, I know that. They're a different size.

594
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:11,205
But that's no problem 'cause Ronnie's
got a consignment of Russian VCRs

595
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,970
coming over next Tuesday from Volvograd.

596
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:21,210
So if we find a mercenary who wants
to tape a tank battle to show the wife,

597
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,684
he has to buy a Russian VCR and all?

598
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:29,248
- I can't see 'em queuing for this!
- 95 quid, the set. Can't be bad.

599
00:43:29,415 --> 00:43:32,566
Think about it. We'll make money on this.

600
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,172
All you do is fall on your arse
and Jeremy Beadle will give you a grand.

601
00:43:37,335 --> 00:43:40,566
- Going out, Del?
- Yes, I've got a date.

602
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:43,044
- A date?
- Uh-huh.

603
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:48,243
- What do you mean, a date?
- I met this woman down at the dentist's.

604
00:43:48,415 --> 00:43:51,646
- I'm taking her out for dinner.
- I don't believe this!

605
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:54,249
Well, you surprise me, Del.

606
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:59,364
Raquel and your baby are round the corner
and you're going out with some young bird.

607
00:43:59,535 --> 00:44:01,526
She's not a young bird.

608
00:44:01,695 --> 00:44:05,404
- She happens to be a grandmother.
- A grandmother?!

609
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:09,124
Perhaps she'll bring her sister along for him!

610
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:14,214
She is a very young grandmother.

611
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:16,969
Tuh! Sister along for...

612
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:22,764
Don't look at me like that, Rodney!
Raquel was the one who walked out on me.

613
00:44:28,855 --> 00:44:33,883
You don't know what it's like.
I'm not an island, Rodney.

614
00:44:34,055 --> 00:44:36,410
A man gets lonely.

615
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:39,533
Raquel only left this morning!

616
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:44,653
She's left you for longer periods
when she's been out shopping!

617
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,170
- It's horrible here now.
- There's Albert.

618
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:49,371
That's what I mean!

619
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:53,528
Could you honestly cheat on Raquel?
Two-time the mother of your baby?

620
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:57,768
Oh, bonnet de douche!
I'm only taking her to a Berni Inn!

621
00:44:57,935 --> 00:45:00,449
That can lead to other things.

622
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:04,369
Yeah. Next week, I'll take her to a Spud-U-Like!

623
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,844
You know what I mean.

624
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:11,406
Did you know that Raquel was crying
this afternoon?

625
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:14,214
- Crying?
- Yeah.

626
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:17,128
Sat on our sofa
crying her eyes out 'cause of you.

627
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:21,251
Poor cow!

628
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:23,406
That's what I thought.

629
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:27,124
I'll see you later. Do enjoy your steak, Derek.

630
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:32,323
Rodney! Rodney! All right, all right.
No, you've made your point.

631
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:36,568
I was only trying to see if I could still pull.

632
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:41,612
- I'll call her and break off the date.
- Good.

633
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:44,573
And call Raquel and ask her to come home.

634
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:47,488
No way, Pedro!

635
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,812
If she wants to come back she's got to call me.

636
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:55,888
You kill me, Derek. I'll see you tomorrow.

637
00:45:56,055 --> 00:46:00,367
You're doing the right thing, Del.
It was a bad move.

638
00:46:00,535 --> 00:46:03,003
Yeah. I expect you're right.

639
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:07,134
Pity, really. She fancied
one of these cameras an' all.

640
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,088
(RINGING TONE)

641
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:17,410
Hi, this is Beverley.

642
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:24,128
I can't come to the phone right now,
but leave a message and I'll get back to you.

643
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:27,287
Er, yeah... Hello, Beverley.

644
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:30,049
This is Del Boy. Um...

645
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:33,685
Thing is, I can't make our date tonight.

646
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:38,292
Um... I'm sorry. I'll give you a call another time.

647
00:46:38,455 --> 00:46:41,094
All right? Bonjour!

648
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:47,653
- I'll pour us a drink, Del.
- I wish I had a dog or a cat.

649
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:50,090
You've got that gerbil.

650
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:53,452
I feel like kicking something up the arse!

651
00:46:57,055 --> 00:47:00,525
- He was doing what?!
- Shh! Raquel's in there.

652
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:04,734
- He was going out with another woman?
- He was threatening to.

653
00:47:04,895 --> 00:47:08,649
He was all dressed up
like a heart-throb out of "Crossroads".

654
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:13,206
Do you think he's having a mid-life crisis,
trying to attract young girls?

655
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:18,165
No. If that was the case,
Del's male menopause started when he was 14!

656
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,771
Anyway, she's not a young girl.
She's a grandmother!

657
00:47:21,935 --> 00:47:24,244
- A grandmother?!
- Shh!

658
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:29,443
He met her at the dentist's.
Not much would have happened on their date.

659
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:32,493
They'd have sat in a Berni Inn counting her teeth!

660
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:36,204
Why doesn't he just phone Raquel?
They miss each other.

661
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:41,085
It's his pride, isn't it? He is the man
and must be seen to be the man.

662
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:45,043
He's never had a very modern attitude
towards women.

663
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:50,608
When he was younger, Del's idea of safe sex
was not telling a girl where he lived!

664
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:55,288
It's funny, but in them days
Del used to be my hero.

665
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,446
Del?! You're joking!

666
00:47:57,615 --> 00:48:01,324
I could tell you things about Del Boy
that would amaze you.

667
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:03,486
Go on, then. Amaze me!

668
00:48:03,655 --> 00:48:08,126
Well... there was the time he took his O levels.

669
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:12,413
I was only a sprog, but I remember
the night he brought his results home.

670
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:16,727
- He got eight A's.
- Eight A's? Del?!

671
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,012
Yep. A for English, A for Maths.
The list went on.

672
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:24,532
- They were someone else's results?
- No, they were Del's results.

673
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,368
Me mum and dad was all excited.

674
00:48:27,535 --> 00:48:31,494
We had a big family celebration.
Aunties, uncles, the lot.

675
00:48:31,655 --> 00:48:35,364
Del was tossing up where to go -
Oxford or Cambridge.

676
00:48:35,535 --> 00:48:38,652
He phoned up both universities, made enquiries.

677
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,534
What the pubs are like, that sort of thing!

678
00:48:41,695 --> 00:48:45,927
- I can't imagine Del getting eight A's!
- He surprised everyone.

679
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:50,373
Then, a couple of days later,
we got a letter from the school.

680
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:53,766
It turned out the A's all stood for "Absent".

681
00:48:53,935 --> 00:48:57,814
- He hadn't turned up for any of the exams?
- Not one!

682
00:48:57,975 --> 00:49:02,685
He'd been down the market
flogging some hooky Tom Jones LPs!

683
00:49:02,855 --> 00:49:05,767
You wouldn't have laughed if you'd been there.

684
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:10,645
Dad went potty. He was shouting at Del,
calling him names.

685
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:14,774
Del was ducking round the room trying to escape.

686
00:49:14,935 --> 00:49:19,884
Then it all turned violent
'cause he'd been out drinking, you see.

687
00:49:20,655 --> 00:49:25,809
He took his belt off and started
whacking him, punching him, everything.

688
00:49:25,975 --> 00:49:28,614
That's what he was like.

689
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:32,768
Mum was screaming, "Don't hit him!"
And I was crying.

690
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:36,407
God. Poor Rodney!

691
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,533
- Was he hurt?
- Not too bad.

692
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:45,246
He was in hospital for a couple of days.
Mum took me to visit him.

693
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:48,168
What happened to your father?

694
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:52,806
- I'm talking about me father!
- Oh! I thought you meant Del.

695
00:49:52,975 --> 00:49:55,728
No, he was all right.

696
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:59,968
He was a dirty little fighter.
He used to go in low and grabbing.

697
00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:03,013
I've seen him in so many fights over the years.

698
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:07,407
I've heard sounds
that only a white hunter could make sense of.

699
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:13,650
That's why he was my hero. From that day on,
me dad never whacked me again.

700
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:17,854
He was too frightened
of what Del would do if he found out.

701
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,370
So that's how my life went on.

702
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:24,210
As long as Del was around,
no one could do me any harm.

703
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,526
Course, he made up for that in later life.

704
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:40,125
- Is it time again?
- Hmm.

705
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:44,249
How are you feeling?

706
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:47,566
Well, you know, I'll give it a go.

707
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:56,093
(RODNEY) Ooh, that's nice!
Don't bite me - you know how easily I bruise!

708
00:51:02,495 --> 00:51:03,814
Rodney!

709
00:51:03,975 --> 00:51:05,488
Hmm?

710
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:13,926
It's all right!

711
00:51:14,095 --> 00:51:16,768
He's just wandered in.

712
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:21,167
Wandered in? Cassandra,
I locked the bedroom door!

713
00:51:21,335 --> 00:51:24,452
(MUSIC: THEME FROM "THE OMEN")

714
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:32,606
- All right if I come in?
- I didn't lock the door!

715
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:36,893
- Rodney!
- Mummy's been looking everywhere for you!

716
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,649
- Sorry about this.
- It's all right.

717
00:51:39,815 --> 00:51:43,649
He sleeps all day and only comes alive at night!

718
00:51:45,175 --> 00:51:47,689
Say night-night to Rodney and Cassandra.

719
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:50,085
- Night!
- Night.

720
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:52,211
Night, Damien.

721
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:56,690
What do you think, then?

722
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:59,972
- Leave it till tomorrow, shall we?
- Yeah.

723
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:08,572
It's for an endangered species.
Do you realise... Oi, Mike.

724
00:52:08,735 --> 00:52:12,887
Listen, um, Del's been hitting
the sauce a bit heavy lately.

725
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:16,206
- Keep an eye on him.
- Leave it to me, Rodney.

726
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,684
All I'm asking for is 50p.

727
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:22,928
What happens when you save these whales?
They'll start breeding.

728
00:52:23,095 --> 00:52:29,170
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- I don't know how anyone could fancy a whale.

729
00:52:29,335 --> 00:52:31,929
No. Big ugly things, aren't they?

730
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:36,008
You haven't got to breed with 'em!
They can sort that out.

731
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:40,407
- I know more about the sea than you.
- Oh, God, here we go.

732
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,772
You'd be surprised how quickly whales breed.

733
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:47,132
- Three.
- And they're not all gentle.

734
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:50,412
- Two.
- A lot together can be dangerous.

735
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:52,486
- One.
- During the war...

736
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:54,850
We have lift-off!

737
00:52:55,015 --> 00:52:58,928
I was in a submarine
and we got attacked by a whale.

738
00:52:59,095 --> 00:53:02,053
It was probably protecting its young.

739
00:53:02,215 --> 00:53:07,005
- No, it wasn't. It fancied us.
- It got the hots for your submarine?

740
00:53:07,175 --> 00:53:09,609
Yeah, it was horrible.

741
00:53:09,775 --> 00:53:14,087
- We were shaking all over the place.
- Like your worst nightmare, innit?

742
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:19,329
No, my worst nightmare is sitting in a pub
having a conversation with you two!

743
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,725
It went on for about half hour.

744
00:53:25,895 --> 00:53:30,525
Skipper told us to hang on
and don't do anything to annoy it.

745
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:33,812
- He put the periscope up once.
- Up where?

746
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:39,045
He looked through the viewfinder and went white.

747
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:43,413
God knows what he saw,
but that man never ate halibut again.

748
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:52,724
What did you do when it was over?
Lie back and have a cigarette?

749
00:53:52,895 --> 00:53:55,250
Don't take the mickey, Rodney.

750
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:59,374
Ever tried to lay an underwater
telephone line in the mating season?

751
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:03,767
- No, I haven't.
- My advice to you is don't ever attempt it.

752
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:09,089
Listen to him, Dave.
He knows what he's talking about.

753
00:54:09,255 --> 00:54:11,769
- OK, Rodders?
- Never thought I'd say this,

754
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:14,051
but here's a man with some intelligence.

755
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:18,766
- Give a couple of bob for charity?
- Yeah, anything for a good cause.

756
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:21,495
- What's this?
- He's trying to save whales.

757
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:27,730
No, they don't get nothing.
Not after the way they beat us at rugby.

758
00:54:29,175 --> 00:54:31,370
Fair enough.

759
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:34,003
How's Cassandra? Pregnant yet?

760
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:37,690
She won't be with that little git
at the bottom of the bed.

761
00:54:37,855 --> 00:54:40,164
What little git's that?

762
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:45,966
Cassandra's got this big teddy bear
she's had since she was a kid.

763
00:54:46,135 --> 00:54:49,730
- It sits on the bed and puts me off.
- Silly mare!

764
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:53,888
How would she like it if you had
your Meccano set at the bottom of the bed?

765
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:57,206
Don't go on about it. It's personal.

766
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:05,964
See you later, Trig.

767
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:09,366
All right, how's Damien and Raquel?

768
00:55:09,535 --> 00:55:13,528
She's taking Damien up London tomorrow
to show him the sights.

769
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:16,163
His dad's been too busy to do that.

770
00:55:16,335 --> 00:55:21,568
Yes, too busy earning the poppy
to pay for the grub and the heating.

771
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,171
- Still crying, is she?
- Yes.

772
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:29,613
All through yesterday afternoon
and then all through teatime.

773
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:34,528
- Is it getting on your nerves?
- Know what's getting on my nerves?

774
00:55:34,695 --> 00:55:38,529
You are missing Raquel and Damien
and they're missing you.

775
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:42,654
But nobody has the intelligence
to sort out the problem.

776
00:55:42,815 --> 00:55:47,605
- All she's gotta do is phone me.
- She doesn't know how you feel.

777
00:55:47,775 --> 00:55:52,291
She thinks you want a life of being
with your mates and going to casinos.

778
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:56,767
She doesn't realise it was just a phase
while you were doing a deal.

779
00:55:56,935 --> 00:56:00,371
Yeah, well, I didn't want word slipping out.

780
00:56:00,535 --> 00:56:04,369
- She don't know that!
- What with that and my tooth.

781
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:07,925
You've had that out. Del, phone her and tell her.

782
00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:11,326
- What, that I've had my tooth out?
- No!

783
00:56:11,495 --> 00:56:16,410
Phone her and tell her that you...
Oh, tell her what you bloody like.

784
00:56:16,575 --> 00:56:18,964
All right, I'll give her a bell.

785
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:22,525
- Del, large scotch on the house.
- Oh. Cheers.

786
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:26,290
Mike, don't give him large scotches on the house!

787
00:56:26,455 --> 00:56:28,923
Sorry, Rodney. I forgot.

788
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,814
Del, that's P1.85, son.

789
00:56:33,255 --> 00:56:36,247
I didn't even ask for it!

790
00:56:38,615 --> 00:56:41,527
Hello, sweetheart. Listen, don't say a word.

791
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:47,053
Don't say anything. Just listen to me
while I'm in the mood, right?

792
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:51,094
I'm missing you, darling,
and I want you to come home.

793
00:56:51,255 --> 00:56:54,691
I know I haven't been fair to you in the past, but...

794
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:59,133
Look, I can explain if you just give me the chance.

795
00:56:59,295 --> 00:57:02,571
I love you and that will never change.

796
00:57:02,735 --> 00:57:06,091
Things will be different in the future.

797
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:09,372
So what do you say?

798
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:11,093
Eh?

799
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:13,644
Oh, sorry, Cassandra.

800
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:17,569
Yeah. I wanna speak to Raquel.

801
00:57:18,575 --> 00:57:21,567
She's in the where? All right, I'll hang on.

802
00:57:26,095 --> 00:57:27,494
Del Boy!

803
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:29,566
Hello, Boycie.

804
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,889
- Who was that woman?

01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:27,768
Oh, Del. This is Beverley.

972
01:12:27,935 --> 01:12:33,373
- Beverley, this is my... This is Del.
- Hi.

973
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:38,053
(DEL) Wotcha!

974
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,811
Beverley's interested in Damien's high chair.

975
01:12:42,975 --> 01:12:47,127
- How'd she find out about that?
- I saw an ad in the newsagent's.

976
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:50,605
I was out the other night on my own,
nothing to do.

977
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:54,846
- Yeah?
- It's for my daughter's baby.

978
01:12:55,015 --> 01:12:58,246
- His name's Damien, as well.
- Cushti.

979
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,213
- Could you deliver it later?
- I suppose so.

980
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:05,493
Beverley can't afford the full amount.
Could we come to an arrangement?

981
01:13:05,655 --> 01:13:08,806
I'll leave that up to you, sweetheart.

982
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:13,332
I've just remembered,
I've got to go out and meet someone. Yeah.

983
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:15,770
Nice meeting you.

984
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:18,893
Yeah. Bye.

985
01:13:19,055 --> 01:13:21,569
He's not usually like that.

986
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:25,808
- Must be pressure of business.
- Hmm.

987
01:13:28,415 --> 01:13:31,213
Rodney. Rodders, I got a problem.

988
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:33,684
I got a big problem.

989
01:13:33,855 --> 01:13:36,813
You know that woman we saw in the market?

990
01:13:36,975 --> 01:13:39,364
- The one who wasn't there?
- Yes, that one.

991
01:13:39,535 --> 01:13:43,414
- She's haunting me!
- What d'you mean, haunting you?

992
01:13:43,575 --> 01:13:48,888
She's the one I made a date with
and then gave her the elbow.

993
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:52,491
Ever since then, she's everywhere that I look!

994
01:13:52,655 --> 01:13:55,294
The other night she was in the pub.

995
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,606
This morning she was standing by a bus stop.

996
01:13:58,775 --> 01:14:01,289
And she was in the market - you saw her!

997
01:14:01,455 --> 01:14:04,253
- No, I didn't.
- See what I mean?

998
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:09,364
And today, to top it all,
I went home and she's in my flat!

999
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:13,210
- In your flat?
- She'd come to buy the high chair.

1000
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,209
- If she thinks I believe that!
- How did she know it was for sale?

1001
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:20,651
She said she saw the ad I placed.

1002
01:14:20,815 --> 01:14:24,524
- That is a bit far-fetched, innit (!)
- Exactly!

1003
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:28,734
You crack me up! Let's look at the facts, shall we?

1004
01:14:28,895 --> 01:14:33,366
She was in this pub.
Maybe, just maybe, she was having a drink.

1005
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:38,211
And then you saw her in the market.
She might have been shopping!

1006
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:43,085
- Bit of a coincidence, though, innit?
- Then you saw her at a bus stop.

1007
01:14:43,255 --> 01:14:49,330
This is just a hunch, but do you reckon
she might have been waiting for a bus?

1008
01:14:49,495 --> 01:14:55,331
I don't know, do I? What I do know is
she is an ex psychiatric patient.

1009
01:14:56,135 --> 01:14:58,695
- So?
- So!

1010
01:14:58,855 --> 01:15:02,370
She is a jealous woman. A woman scorned.

1011
01:15:02,535 --> 01:15:07,165
Jealous women are no problem to me normally.
I can handle all that.

1012
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:13,285
But this one is a jealous woman
who's an olive short of a pizza!

1013
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:15,923
And she knows where we live.

1014
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,644
We could wake up and find
we was killed while we was asleep.

1015
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:25,367
You're letting your imagination run away with you.
Does she seem odd in any way?

1016
01:15:25,535 --> 01:15:28,686
I don't know. You can judge for yourself.

1017
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:31,210
You've got to deliver the high chair.

1018
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:35,050
- Why have I got to go?
- Because I've got a wife and kid.

1019
01:15:35,215 --> 01:15:38,730
Yeah, but I've got a wife and... thermometer.

1020
01:15:44,135 --> 01:15:45,807
Raquel?

1021
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:49,092
Raquel, where are... Raquel?

1022

(WATER BUBBLES)

1023
01:16:25,855 --> 01:16:28,972
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

1024
01:16:29,135 --> 01:16:31,603
- What's happened?
- Look!

1025
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:36,088
Albert's boiling his pants again!

1026
01:16:38,575 --> 01:16:42,284
- What's wrong, Del?
- Where's the gerbil?

1027
01:16:42,455 --> 01:16:46,767
In Damien's room.
He's playing with it. What is wrong with you?

1028
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:50,371
I've got to sort this all out.
I've got to sort it all out

1029
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:55,006
I've got to go out, darling.
I've got to meet someone.

1030
01:17:08,615 --> 01:17:13,643
Now, you listen to what I've got to say.
You leave me and my family alone.

1031
01:17:13,815 --> 01:17:16,852
- You don't frighten me. I'm not scared.
- (BUZZER)

1032
01:17:17,015 --> 01:17:19,165
Mr James.

1033
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:23,931
- What's wrong with you, you moron?
- Oh, just a couple of fillings.

1034
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:30,574
- All right, Del?
- Yeah. See you later, Trig.

1035
01:17:33,175 --> 01:17:36,804
- You were following me.
- I've been following YOU?

1036
01:17:36,975 --> 01:17:39,887
- Yes!
- It's the other way round.

1037
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:45,129
Everywhere I go I see you. I go in the pub
with my daughter and you're there.

1038
01:17:45,295 --> 01:17:48,332
I'm waiting for a bus and you drive by.

1039
01:17:48,495 --> 01:17:53,523
I do a bit of lunchtime shopping
and surprise, surprise, there you are.

1040
01:17:53,695 --> 01:17:57,574
I went to buy a second-hand high chair
and you walked in!

1041
01:17:57,735 --> 01:18:00,533
- I live there!
- OK, I'll let you off that one.

1042
01:18:00,695 --> 01:18:03,209
- Right!
- Listen!

1043
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:08,324
I think, Mr Trotter, our wires have become
crossed somewhere along the line.

1044
01:18:08,495 --> 01:18:11,646
- You were in a psychiatric hospital.
- Yes!

1045
01:18:11,815 --> 01:18:18,288
Don't try and deny it! A friend of mine
was visiting a relative there and he saw you!

1046
01:18:18,455 --> 01:18:21,606
Yes! I worked there as a receptionist!

1047
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:27,164
- Sorry?
- I'm a medical receptionist!

1048
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:31,169
- It's what I do!
- So you weren't following me?

1049
01:18:31,335 --> 01:18:34,964
- Good God! Do you think I'm hard up?
- Eh?

1050
01:18:35,135 --> 01:18:37,774
Now, understand this, Mr Trotter.

1051
01:18:37,935 --> 01:18:43,328
If you follow me or pester me again,
I'll take out an injunction against you.

1052
01:18:43,495 --> 01:18:47,010
This is the last we'll hear of each other!

1053
01:18:47,175 --> 01:18:50,804
Good. And I suppose I should have
expected as much,

1054
01:18:50,975 --> 01:18:53,364
but that high chair's got a screw loose!

1055
01:18:55,295 --> 01:18:57,809
Well, tighten it!

1056
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:10,088
There we are, sweetheart. Get that down you!

1057
01:19:11,055 --> 01:19:13,694
That was a lovely dinner, Raquel.

1058
01:19:13,855 --> 01:19:17,928
- Thanks! Another drink, Cassandra?
- Better not. I'm driving.

1059
01:19:18,095 --> 01:19:23,249
Hm? No, no, no. You can stay over.
We've got plenty of room.

1060
01:19:23,415 --> 01:19:25,883
- We can all mix in.
- Shall we?

1061
01:19:26,055 --> 01:19:29,968
- Yeah. Let's enjoy ourselves.
- Yes, that's it!

1062
01:19:30,135 --> 01:19:34,447
You know it makes sense!
Darling, shall I put "Tubular Bells" on?

1063
01:19:34,615 --> 01:19:38,085
- No, not yet, Del.
- All right.

1064
01:19:38,255 --> 01:19:40,689
She loves that "Tubular Bells".

1065
01:19:40,855 --> 01:19:43,653
Come on, Champ. It's bedtime for you!

1066
01:19:43,815 --> 01:19:47,808
Come along, let's go to bed. That's it. Off we go!

1067
01:19:47,975 --> 01:19:50,205
- Night!
- Good night!

1068
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,252
- Night!
- Say good night.

1069
01:19:52,415 --> 01:19:56,567
- Night!
- Isn't he lovely? And he's only ten!

1070
01:19:56,735 --> 01:20:00,284
Here we go! Which is your room, then?

1071
01:20:00,455 --> 01:20:05,370
- What did you get Del for Christmas?
- One of those answering machines.

1072
01:20:05,535 --> 01:20:09,323
That'll save me getting any rollickings
for forgetting messages.

1073
01:20:09,495 --> 01:20:12,328
This is good. How much did it cost?

1074
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:16,886
Shh! It didn't cost anything!
I swapped it for Damien's high chair.

1075
01:20:17,055 --> 01:20:19,694
I reckon you got a good deal there!

1076
01:20:19,855 --> 01:20:22,449
Does it work?

1077
01:20:23,975 --> 01:20:26,125
Hello, Beverley. This is Del Boy.

1078
01:20:27,335 --> 01:20:31,044
Um, listen, I'm sorry.
I've gotta cancel our date tonight.

1079
01:20:33,815 --> 01:20:37,603
I'll give you a call some time, all right?

1080
01:20:37,775 --> 01:20:39,367

- Me? I haven't said anything!

1089
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:14,495
(CASS) Don't blame Rodney!
(ALBERT) Don't look at me. I'm keeping out of it.
