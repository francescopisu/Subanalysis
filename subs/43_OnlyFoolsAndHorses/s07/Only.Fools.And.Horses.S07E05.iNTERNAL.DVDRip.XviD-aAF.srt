1
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:44,832
Sorry, Cassandra, I'm a bit out of breath.
I've just been doing me physical jerks.

2
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:46,984
Oi, Gazza. Come here.

3
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,916
Don't you tell her Rodney's still in bed
sleeping off another hangover, will ya?

4
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,422
What d'you take me for?

5
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:56,267
Give me five minutes,
and I'll write out a list!

6
00:00:57,097 --> 00:01:01,552
Alright, Cassandra.
I'll tell Rodney you called as soon as he gets up.

7
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:05,339
- I don't believe you!
- I mean in! I mean in!

8
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:10,356
Tell Cassandra I'll phone her later.
I've gotta get this stuff in the freezer.

9
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:14,390
Raquel says she'll call you later.
Oh yes, she’s alright.

10
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:17,921
I mean, women like being
pregnant, don't they?

11
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:23,686
And how you feeling?
Good. Me? Oh I'm alright.

12
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,689
I've just joined the over-sixties club
down on the estate.

13
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,636
Given me a new lease of life, it has.

14
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,652
Eh? Well, yes, there are women there,
but I'm not interested in all that.

15
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:36,157
No, like a squirrel
ain't interested in nuts!

16
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,051
I used to be a bit of a Casanova in my younger days.
I could tell you a tale or two, Cassandra!

17
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,877
During the war... Eh?

18
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,418
There's someone at your front door,
is there?

19
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:51,978
Oh well… Bye for now, Cassandra.
Bye, love.

20
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:59,959
Mrs Lane, or may I call you Dora?
May I have the pleasure of this next dance?

21
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,632
Thank you.

22
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,556
Oh my God!

23
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:12,149
What time d'you call this, Rodney?

24
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:14,858
I call it 11.30, Unc.
What time d'you call it?

25
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:18,238
It's disgusting. A young man like you
getting up at 11.30 in the morning.

26
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:21,619
Your brother was up and out of here
at 7 o’clock.

27
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:24,068
Then he came back
and took Raquel out shopping.

28
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:29,245
Yes, that’s because Del has got
a job to go to and money-earning opportunities.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,463
And he's got a woman in his life!
What have I got, eh?

30
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:36,475
I've got no job to go to
I’ve got no wife to say good morning to.

31
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:41,217
You might be a bit more chirpy
if you didn’t wake up with such a hangover!

32
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:42,649
I have not got...

33
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:48,128
I have not got a hangover!
I am fine! There's nothing wrong with me.

34
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:50,960
Cassandra phoned.
Just wanted to know how you were.

35
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:52,405
You didn't tell her, did you?

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,239
No, I said you were alright.
She just wants your cheque towards the mortgage.

37
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,264
Yeah, well, I'll sort that out.

38
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,608
- Morning.
- Morning, Rodney.

39
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:13,307
That reminds me, sweetheart.
The video shop's got Nightmare On Elm Street in.

40
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:18,475
Albert's just been talking to Cassandra.
She just wanted to know how I was.

41
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:20,077
He didn't tell her, did he?

42
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:23,039
No, he said I was all...
What d'you mean, he didn't tell her?

43
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,011
What’s the matter?
You alright, sweetheart?

44
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:31,766
Yeah, I'm OK. A backache, that's all.
It happens every time we go out in your van.

45
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:35,907
It's just not very comfortable,
specially in my condition. I'm alright now.

46
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:38,110
No, no. Listen to me, sweetheart. I’ll te…

47
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,594
You leave the shopping.
I will continue with the shopping.

48
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,351
You go and have a sit down.
Go on, that's an order!

49
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:49,416
Aye, aye, sir.
Don't forget to deliver our birthday present.

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,650
- Whose birthday is it?
- It’s Boycie's little kid. Anyway.

51
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:57,685
You see, that three-wheeled van
wasn't designed for pregnant women with shopping.

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,953
She's getting bigger by the day.
She's already been banned from the Body Shop.

53
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:08,323
If I could just get the engine to run
a bit smoother, I’m sure that would help.

54
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,513
I've told you, they stopped
making spares for that van years ago.

55
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:17,188
I've tried everywhere. Breakers' yards,
spares shops, archaeologists.

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,103
Archaeologists?

57
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:22,618
Listen to me, Rodney. Talking of archaeologists,

58
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,369
you look as though you've just been
dug up from somewhere.

59
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,786
Why don't you take a leaf out of
your uncle's book. Look at him.

60
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:33,412
He’s in there, he's joined the over-sixties club
and looks like a born-again teddy boy.

61
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:36,594
You're not suggesting
I join the over-sixties club?

62
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,005
No, they wouldn’t have you.
You look too old.

63
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,596
There's been another mugging
on the estate.

64
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,660
You don't want to believe all you read, Raquel.
A lot of that is exaggerated, you know.

65
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:51,125
If I got my hands on them,
I'd string 'em up from the nearest lamppost.

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,466
Listen to you. It's nearly the 21st century
and he still wants to hang 'em up by their neck.

67
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:58,414
Who said anything about hanging them up
by their neck?

68
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,271
They better not try anything on me.
I used to box for the Nuggets.

69
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:07,095
Will you sit down,
you soppy old sod?

70
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,815
You’ll have my clap as you want it
on the floor in a minute.

71
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:22,536
Thank you for calling Boyce Autos and Car Accessories.
How can I help you?

72
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,016
Oh it's you Marlene!

73
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,241
Yes, I'm going out to get Tyler’s
birthday present in a minute!

74
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:36,066
Marlene, I'm trying to run a business here.
If you remember, I sell quality used cars!

75
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:39,941
D'you want me to take that
old banger down the scrap-yard?

76
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:42,244
- If they'll take it!
- I'll get me coat.

77
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,635
A baby grand?

78
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:50,715
Well, of course I want him to be cultured,
but for God’s sake, Marlene, he's only two!

79
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:55,075
I don't give a toss what
Beethoven could do when he was three!

80
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,288
Tyler should start off in a smaller way.

81
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,636
Alright Marlene. Leave it to me.
I'll surprise you.

82
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,681
Where can I get a mouth organ from?

83
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:13,795
Thank you for calling Boyce Autos
and Car Accessories. How can…

84
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,711
Oh, it's you Del Boy!
How's your luck?

85
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,317
Couldn’t be better Boycie.

86
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,713
Business is so good
there aren't enough hours in the day.

87
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,628
I'm thinking of taking on extra staff.

88
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:25,475
Yeah, 'taking on' being the operative phrase!

89
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:29,612
Rodney, why don’t you do something useful,
like go back to bed, son!

90
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:34,404
Hello, Boycie, listen, we've got
a birthday present for the ankle-biter.

91
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:40,758
Cheers, Del. We're gonna have a little celebration.
Just a few dear and close friends.

92
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:44,129
I suppose you and your family could come
along as well if you like.

93
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,467
Thank you, that’s very nice of you Boycie.

94
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:51,581
Listen, d'you reckon you could get one of your
mechanics to have a look at my van?

95
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,654
I know just the bloke.
He had a family bereavement recently.

96
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,817
He could do with a good laugh.

97
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:05,005
Sorry, Del. I just think it’s about time
you got yourself something more powerful.

98
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:08,019
- Like what?
- I don't know. A food mixer?

99
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:14,478
Very gunny Boycie, but that little van
does everything that I need it to, don’t worry.

100
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:19,256
Keep the van for business.
I'm talking about a second car.

101
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:23,602
I've been hearing about all this crime
that’s been occurring on your estate.

102
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:28,162
Don’t you think it’s gonna be safer for your Raquel
to be driving rather than walking?

103
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:32,938
That’s a point Boycie,
I’d never thought of that.

104
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,548
Yes. I mean, a man in your position…

105
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,887
I mean, you need something
that’s gonna reflect your image.

106
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:43,142
I've got a lovely Skoda out in the showroom.

107
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:48,559
Two years old, 8,000 miles on the clock, genuine.
You can have it for two and a half grand.

108
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,657
Two and a half grand is a little bit
out of my price range, Boycie.

109
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:56,131
- What is your price range?
- 400 quid.

110
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:00,074
400? You can't get a walking frame for 400!

111
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,484
Just a moment, Del.
Your luck could be in.

112
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:08,999
I got a cracking little sports coupe,
came in as a part chop on a Honda Prelude.

113
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:12,123
Beautiful bodywork, sound engine,
really nice little runner.

114
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:17,163
It just need a bit of a clean-up,
that's all. I was looking for a grand.

115
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:21,516
But, seeing as it's my son's birthday
and you're a mate, I'll let it go for 400.

116
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,962
Cushty! I'll pop down and take the butcher's at it
later then, Boycie. Alright?

117
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:28,046
- Alright. Cheers, Del.
- Bye.

118
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,777
I'm off then to scrappy.
Are these the keys?

119
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,673
There's been a change of plan!

120
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:47,635
- What d'you think, Rodney?
- I don’t know!

121
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,523
She'll be putty in my hands.

122
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:55,464
Rodney, you’ll never guess what?
I've only bought a new car! Gordon Bennett!

123
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,110
Albert, I thought it was Simon Le Bon!
What are dressed up like that for?

124
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:07,187
I'm playing the over-sixties dominos final
down the Nag's Head, against old Knock Knock later.

125
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:08,793
So you've got a new car?

126
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,355
Yes, a cracker. Raquel's just driven it back.
It's a beauty, innit, sweetheart?

127
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:18,240
- D'you want a cup of tea, love?
- Yeah, I need something, Albert!

128
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:23,221
So you're a two-car family now, then!
Well, one car, one three-wheeled van.

129
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:27,595
Which is one car and three-wheeled van
more than you've got! Or ever likely to have!

130
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,499
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Derek.
Bound to be a job in here for me somewhere.

131
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:34,374
You'll have to come up with a good excuse
before you get a job, son.

132
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,444
I mean, how you gonna explain away them
10 years when you were Del's partner?

133
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:43,432
Albert's got a good point, Rodney. In all of those 10 years
you weren't registered for income tax,

134
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,564
national insurance or anything!

135
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:49,898
Your work record shows that you left school at 16
and promptly disappeared off the face of the earth.

136
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:51,383
I've already thought of that.

137
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:54,995
I'm gonna say I was working
for a foreign oil company in Saudi Arabia.

138
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,751
What, straight from school?

139
00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:00,782
One minute you're a milk-monitor,
the next minute you’re a petrochemist?

140
00:10:01,086 --> 00:10:02,631
No, sorry bruv, that won't wash.

141
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,314
Couldn't you say you'd been on safari?

142
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:08,409
- What, for a decade?
- You could say you got lost.

143
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:14,765
A friend of mine went out with a guy who'd spent
12 years working for a safari company in Kenya.

144
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:16,653
That's stupid, Raquel!

145
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:20,039
Well, it's better than
your paper-round-in-Arabia cobblers, innit?

146
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:23,078
Have you ever thought
of joining the navy, Rodney?

147
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:28,984
Well, funny enough, Unc, no!
How can I join the navy?

148
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:34,253
Exactly. In the old days they used to take anyone.
I mean, let’s face it, they took you!

149
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:37,156
But nowadays you've gotta have qualifications.

150
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:40,934
What chance has
Lawrence of Peckham got, eh?

151
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:44,813
I don't mean the Royal Navy.
I was talking about the merchant.

152
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:50,761
Just think of it, Rodney. Imagine.
Monday, you sail out of Southampton Water.

153
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:53,196
Tuesday, you're through to the Bay of Biscay.

154
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:57,552
Wednesday, you've rounded Cape St Vincent.
Thursday, you dock in Algiers...

155
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:00,342
Friday it's your turn in the barrel!

156
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:05,333
There was nothing like that on any of my vessels!

157
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:12,144
A few funny ones but nothing like that!
Well, what d'you reckon, Rodney?

158
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:15,441
If it's all the same with you, Unc,
I think I'll take a raincheck on this one.

159
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:16,854
You don't know what you're missing.

160
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,706
That suits me!

161
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:21,166
Del, I've been thinking.

162
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:26,169
Trotters Independent Traders has been going through
a period of commercial augmentation.

163
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,133
No, I've been doing alright, Rodney.

164
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:33,489
I was thinking, things must be getting
pretty hectic for you on the old business front?

165
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,697
Straight, Rodney.
It's one power breakfast after another, it is.

166
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,501
Yeah. I suppose it ain't all champagne
and backgammon for you yuppies, is it, eh?

167
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:45,877
I heard you saying earlier that you were
thinking of taking on more staff.

168
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:52,370
So, seeing as I am temporarily between positions
and if the conditions are acceptable

169
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,847
I am willing to work for you.

170
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:57,427
No way, Pedro!

171
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,975
Look, I've got all...
No way, Pedro?

172
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:02,754
I don't need you, Rodders.

173
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,110
I could be very useful to
you during this period of growth!

174
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:07,356
How?

175
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,614
Well... I'm a good salesman.

176
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,438
Leave it out, Rodney,
you couldn't sell a black cat to a witch.

177
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:20,603
- Yeah, but now I've got managerial experience.
- No.

178
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:25,901
- I could computerise your entire business!
- No.

179
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:31,524
- I have got executive qualifications.
- No.

180
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:35,079
Can you lend us a fiver, then?

181
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,969
A fiver? I didn't realise
things were that bad, Rodney.

182
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,063
And you want to be
my financial advisor?

183
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:44,138
I'll be anything!

184
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,986
I'm desperate, ain't I?

185
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,553
Alright Rodney, I’ll tell you what. I will give you a job
with Trotters Independent Traders PLC.

186
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:58,839
Fine... And what wage structure
will I have?

187
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:01,107
Wage structure? I don’t know.
The same as before.

188
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:05,290
Good! So, what was that, then?

189
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,336
If I've got cash on the hip I'll pay you.

190
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,482
And what title will I have?

191
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:15,533
Well, we'll call you Lord Rodney.

192
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:24,317
I meant, company title! See, I was thinking you could call me
your director of commercial development.

193
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,701
Yes, alright. That sounds very good to me.

194
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:33,376
Alright then son. As it says in the Bible,
'Clothes maketh the man.'

195
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,244
- So I want you to whip round your flat a bit lively.
- And pick up my best suit?

196
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,602
No, pick up your car-cleaning gear.

197
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,817
What d'you reckon?

198
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:53,668
- How much d'you reckon I paid Boycie for it?
- What, he charged you?

199
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,240
I stole it off him, Rodders.
400 nicker.

200
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,766
It's a peach,
it handles like Maradona.

201
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:07,544
Oh, Del. Look at the paintwork!
It's got no shine to it!

202
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,195
By the time I've finished it’ll look brand new.

203
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:22,793
Listen. I’ve been meaning to ask you something..
It's a little bit embarrassing.

204
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:26,590
- I'm not cleaning it!
- You bloody well are!

205
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,835
Oh no! The days when I used to do
all your dirty work are long gone!

206
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:35,166
I used to run my own computer section Del!
I was an executive!

207
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:41,589
And now you're cleaning my Capri Ghia!
You seem to forget, Rodney, you are my employee!

208
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:48,228
Since you left Cassandra and your job,
you’ve been eating and sleeping in my flat for nix!

209
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:52,248
If you wanna hand in your resignation
that is alright by me.

210
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:56,361
I'll help you find a little bedsit.
I'll even give you a little leaving present.

211
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,171
A paraffin heater and a mousetrap.

212
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:03,585
- Alright, I'll clean it!
- Are you quite sure about that?

213
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:08,553
- Yes.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

214
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,539
I'm most grateful.

215
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:18,100
Look at that lot, over there
It looks like the Tetley Tea folks' day out, dunnit?

216
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:23,374
Albert's looking very smart.
He must be after one of the ladies.

217
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:29,501
I wonder if it's old Lil with the hairy wart?
Or is it the Widow Manky with the disposable teeth?

218
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:33,192
You should have more respect, Mike.
Those women went through a war for us.

219
00:15:33,227 --> 00:15:36,164
Yeah, you can still see the
bomb damage on some of 'em.

220
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:45,055
It’d be lovely if Albert could meet some nice old lady
to keep him company. D'you know who he's after?

221
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,856
- Yeah. Your mum.
- My mum!

222
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah, that’s right. Him and his mate
are after sorting her out.

223
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:56,902
- I'm not having this!
- No, but if your mum plays her cards right!

224
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,534
Mum! I want a word with you!

225
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,217
Yeah, alright, Marlene,
talk to you in a minute.

226
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:06,355
Can I get you a drink, Dora?
You don't mind me calling you Dora, do you, Dora?

227
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,401
- Of course I don't mind, Albert.
- I just got Dora a drink.

228
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:14,752
Why'd you let Knock-Knock
get you a drink? It was my turn.

229
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:18,575
- You can buy me a drink in a minute.
- Yeah, alright.

230
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:22,809
- How'd the kid's birthday party go?
- It was very successful, thank you Trigger.

231
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:26,780
All the right people were there,
and Del and Albert turned up.

232
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:32,476
Thank you very much, Boycie. Thank you.
Now that he’s gone, who’s for another one, then?

233
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:41,881
Them over by the juke box.
The morons from outer space. Who are they?

234
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:45,410
I don’t know, Del. They've been using the pub
for about two weeks now.

235
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:47,169
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think they were regulars.

236
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:52,740
But, like I say, I don't know nothing about them.
I think they’re friends of the old mongrels down there.

237
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,841
Ollie! Just a minute,
come here son, will you?

238
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,449
What you want, Del?

239
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,668
You see that gang over there by the jukebox?
D’you know anything about 'em?

240
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:03,066
They started coming in here about a fortnight ago.

241
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:06,558
Have they been hanging
round the estate at night?

242
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:09,259
Yeah, couple of times.
D'you want me and the boys to beat 'em up?

243
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,434
- No, no!
- Oi, I don't want no trouble in this pub!

244
00:17:13,469 --> 00:17:18,674
- What you drinking, Albert?
- I'll have a large navy rum, dear.

245
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:21,424
Puts lead in your pencil!

246
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,967
- Well, there's a thing.
- Get old Knock-Knock a drink, will you?

247
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,085
I'll have a pint of ordinary. dear.

248
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:32,865
Why'd they call him Knock-Knock?

249
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,399
- Because he's a very bad dominoes player!
- I'm a better player than you, Trotter!

250
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:41,429
- You've never beaten me at dominoes in all your life.
- I can beat you at anything.

251
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,962
Even when we was at school
I could beat you at anything!

252
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:48,730
Now, come on boys, calm down.
Start acting like grown-ups!

253
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,807
- I had to laugh to myself tonight, Del.
- Did you, Trig?

254
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:54,935
Why, something happened?

255
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:58,589
I was walking across the estate
past the garage block.

256
00:17:58,624 --> 00:18:04,603
It was 7:30 at night, pitch-black,
and there's Dave polishing an old banger!

257
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,440
It takes...

258
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:12,156
Oh my God! I forgot all about my director
of commercial management!

259
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,091
You left him cleaning your car at night?

260
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,943
I’d forgotten he worked for me!

261
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:22,344
- What's Albert and Knock-Knock playing at?
- Dunno, looks like Ninja dominoes.

262
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:26,620
- What you drinking, Boyce?
- Give him a large navy rum.

263
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,730
Look at my clothes!

264
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:34,954
I told you to wear your
car-cleaning gear, didn’t I?

265
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,686
A director of commercial development does not wear
stonewashed Wranglers and Doc Martens!

266
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:42,643
He does when he's cleaning
the guv'nor's Capri Ghia!

267
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:46,625
- And I got Swarfega in me eye!
- Your finger's bleeding, Rodney.

268
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,429
Yes, that’s when my hand
went straight through the bodywork!

269
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:54,004
I'm bleeding, see! That’s blood!
You got any plasters, Mike?

270
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:57,037
What d'you mean,
your hand went straight through the bodywork?

271
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,865
There's a big rust hole in the wing.

272
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,443
Boycie's blokes had filled it full with newspaper
and filler and then sprayed over it.

273
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:07,561
That is slanderous, Rodney. That must have happened
before I took possession of the vehicle!

274
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:13,747
- They were yesterday's newspapers!
- Were they really?

275
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:18,221
Look, you took the car as seen, Del!
I don't owe you no favours.

276
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,789
That's a bit unfair, Boycie?

277
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:23,112
What about that 36-piece tea service
he sold Marlene last month?

278
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:27,210
Yeah, that came in very handy. I gave it
to the Boy Scouts' fete for their rifle range.

279
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:30,718
- That was genuine Dresden!
- Yeah, genuine antique Dresden!

280
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,194
And it was guaranteed
dishwasher-proof!

281
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:36,083
I'll do it, Rodney.

282
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,581
I don't believe him sometimes!

283
00:19:39,616 --> 00:19:43,154
I don't know how he can ask me,
with my executive qualifications

284
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:46,299
to go round to the garage block
and clean the Pratmobile!

285
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:48,945
Don't you let Del hear you call it that!

286
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,715
What about that very important client
I had come over from Belgium?

287
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,544
I wanted two tickets to Wimbledon
so I could impress him.

288
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:58,924
You said, "Leave it to me Boycie,
I gotta contact to Wimbledon".

289
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,638
I got you two tickets, didn’t I?

290
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:04,808
That's right! They drew 0-0 with Ipswich!
That makes us even!

291
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,889
No way, Pedro!

292
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:10,433
I'll see you later, Del.
I'm going round Jevon's.

293
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:14,582
What would you like, Dora?
How about a large snowball?

294
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:19,733
- Oh, lovely!
- Mike, large snowball for Dora.

295
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,738
- That's better. Alright, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine now.

296
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:33,848
Cushty. I'll pick up my Capri Ghia
in the morning.

297
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:38,207
I’ll get my director of commercial
development to drive the van back.

298
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,326
- Del, I don't wanna nag.
- Good. I’ll put a record on.

299
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:48,775
Can we afford to splash out 400 pounds on another car?
I mean, do we really need another car?

300
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,018
Yes, we do! You see the reason why I thought...

301
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:55,996
Look, just because the van gives me backache
was no reason for you to buy another car!

302
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:58,327
No, I know, but listen you’ll see. There is a very...

303
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:01,016
It's a waste of money. You do realise
we've got a baby on the way, don't you?

304
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:06,288
Yes, I do, little things do remind me.
You just shut up and listen for a minute, I’ll explain.

305
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,331
It's a very dangerous world out there, Raquel.

306
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:12,516
And I don’t want you walking
down to the shops or the launderette.

307
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:16,855
I want you to drive. That way you'll be safe and sound.
D'you understand what I’m saying?

308
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,663
- Is that why you bought it?
- Yes.

309
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:23,170
- Aren’t you lovely?
- Yes!

310
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:26,528
- I love you, Trotter.
- Do you?

311
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:30,154
Well, you're only human, aren’t you?

312
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:41,866
Fancy a cup of tea?

313
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,301
Del! It's Albert!

314
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,641
- What about Albert?
- There's no need to panic, alright?

315
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:49,763
- What's happened to Albert?
- He's been mugged!

316
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,562
- He's been what?
- Is he hurt?

317
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:53,771
I don’t know. But he has got double vision.

318
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:57,398
- Where's this happened, Rodney?
- In his eyes.

319
00:21:58,161 --> 00:21:59,614
I don’t mean...

320
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:02,420
Oh sorry, yeah! As he was walking
home from the pub.

321
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:06,137
I was just coming back from Jevon's and I saw this
ambulance, a crowd of people around him.

322
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:09,059
- Did he recognize anyone?
- No. All he knows is there was four of them.

323
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,518
Look, they’ve got him down the hospital.
Come on, let’s go.

324
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:15,531
Alright sweetheart, you don’t worry.
We’ll sort it out, alright?

325
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:21,288
Dipstick. Rodney!

326
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:24,922
He's just gonna put some clothes on,
and then we’ll go.

327
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,694
They said he might be
suffering from shock for a few days.

328
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:36,805
You just wait 'til I get my
hands on the bastards what did it.

329
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,912
Then you'll see what a state of shock
really looks like!

330
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:41,620
Now, you stay out of it! The police
can handle this perfectly well on their own!

331
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:43,876
I don't need the Old Bill!

332
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:48,154
People in this area are used
to sorting their own problems out.

333
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:53,310
It's traditional. I remember once
when I was about 10 years old,

334
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,721
mum had some of her jewellery nicked by this
good-looking Italian bloke.

335
00:22:56,756 --> 00:23:00,319
He wasn’t good looking after
my Dad had finished with him!

336
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,632
But how could you be
certain he was guilty?

337
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,983
Because of the evidence, Rodney.

338
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:09,478
Dad found one of Mum's earrings
on the back seat of this bloke's car!

339
00:23:13,388 --> 00:23:17,532
- It's alright, Unc. Just the door.
- Stay there. Calm down.

340
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:31,537
- I just came round to see how Albert was.
- He's not too good at the moment.

341
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:33,994
Come in.

342
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:40,777
I heard what happened to Albert.
How is he?

343
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:44,582
He looks bloody horrible, don’t he?
They stole his watch, his wallet, everything.

344
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:47,045
I know. How you feeling, Albert?

345
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,679
I’m a bit bruised, dear.
I was jumped on by five of 'em.

346
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:54,962
You just keep…
Five of them? I thought it was…

347
00:23:58,456 --> 00:24:02,038
Rodney, why don’t you make Cassandra
a nice cup of coffee?

348
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:04,845
In the kitchen…

349
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,973
In the kitchen!

350
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,955
Shall we go and make a cup of coffee?

351
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:23,906
Apres moi la deluxe,
as they say in that Latin quota.

352
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,484
So you're working for Del again?

353
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,723
Yes. That wasn't an easy decision.

354
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:39,639
I had lots of offers from local companies,
you know what these headhunters are like.

355
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:41,302
Well, no, not really.

356
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:44,413
Del asked me to be his director
of commercial development.

357
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,816
Seek out new openings,
find gaps in the market.

358
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,769
And if the gap doesn't exist,
create one?

359
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:55,239
Yeah, that sort of thing.
So I thought, that'll do me, lovely jubbly!

360
00:24:56,581 --> 00:25:00,146
I tell you, it is pressure all the way.
I'm never off that phone.

361
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:01,571
You've cut your finger!

362
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:04,560
Yeah, Del got me to clean
his car yesterday and...

363
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:13,207
I just did it as a favour. I don't know if you’ve noticed
his new car parked downstairs. The green Pratmobile.

364
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:18,238
- Does he know you call it that?
- No. I don't think he'd be too pleased.

365
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,968
So things are going well?

366
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:27,541
Yeah. We're into property development,
theatre...

367
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,522
Toilet rolls.

368
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:34,894
That's just the direct retail sales branch of the company.
We've got contacts in the City!

369
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,588
What, the White City?

370
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:40,425
There's no need to laugh at us, Cass!

371
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:44,575
I'm not laughing at you, Rodney!
I'm just trying to break the ice!

372
00:25:45,698 --> 00:25:48,558
So, how's our flat?

373
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:52,806
Much the same as when you left it.
I wish I could say the same about you!

374
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,612
What's that mean?

375
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,202
You've changed!
You're getting more like Del.

376
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:03,536
You're full of front and bullshit, Roddy!
You're even wearing the same clothes as Del.

377
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:09,810
These suits happen to be a new line
we're selling, that’s all. These are Romanian.

378
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,319
We just wear them to let the punter know
what they look like.

379
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:15,384
D'you think that's wise?

380
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:19,683
We do know our market, Cassandra!
And I am not getting like Del!

381
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:21,397
You are, Rodney.

382
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:24,862
Look, you're even wearing
a Del Boy starter kit!

383
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,550
Del told me to wear this because...

384
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,158
Understand one thing, Cass!

385
00:26:30,193 --> 00:26:35,998
- I am not getting like Del! No way, Pedro!
- No way, Pedro?

386
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:42,728
- Look, I'm very busy, Cassandra.
- Yeah, well… I’ll see you, Rodney.

387
00:26:42,763 --> 00:26:45,078
- No, I didn't men it like that.
- Goodbye!

388
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:47,595
I'll give you a bell during the...

389
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,632
Alright, it's only me!
I was just putting the security chain on.

390
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:00,380
No one can get in. You’re safe now.
You alright?

391
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,055
- Yeah, I'm alright, son.
- What are you doing then, Unc?

392
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:05,353
I’m just looking through in me old box.

393
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:12,676
See that? That's where I was born.
Tobacco Road, down by the docks.

394
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:21,149
That's the front of Tobacco Road.
There's your nan - there's your granddad.

395
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:24,659
He'd just joined the army,
doing his bit for king and country.

396
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:30,465
- Why’s he got a vest and plimsolls on?
- Well, he'd just deserted.

397
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:35,194
Albert, tomorrow, would you like us
to take you back to where you were born?

398
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:39,803
Ain’t there any more, dear.
They knocked it down.

399
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,213
- That film you wanted to see is coming on in a minute.
- Oh thanks.

400
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,452
- What film's that, then?
- ‘Out Of Africa’.

401
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:49,536
Not another documentary about AIDS, is it?

402
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:51,965
No, it's a film with Robert Redford.

403
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,940
Did I ever tell you about
the time I was in Africa?

404
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:59,354
- Yeah, thousands of times!
- No. Why, what happened Albert?

405
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:01,656
‘Well, during the war’…

406
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:04,839
During the war
I was on this hospital ship.

407
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:08,896
We'd just picked up some of the
wounded from Monty's North Africa campaign.

408
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:13,920
We dropped 'em off in Durban.
I helped some of them lads off the ship.

409
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:21,208
It was tragic to see some of them, bloody tragic.
I cried for 'em... Daft, eh?

410
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:26,889
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cried when me mum died.

411
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,339
But you were only 16.
I was a full-grown man.

412
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:35,262
I shed a little tear or two, didn’t I,
when Rodney got married and left home.

413
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:38,152
I cried even more when he come back!

414
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,602
The most frightening thing
in all my life happened while I was in Africa.

415
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:47,870
We docked in Durban, and a couple of black blokes
came out and asked me and my mates

416
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:51,267
if we wanted to go out and see the jungle.
We jumped at the chance.

417
00:28:51,302 --> 00:28:55,311
- You're like that when you're young, ain't you?
- Oh yeah, we've all done it, haven’t we?

418
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:59,016
So we got up in this open lorry
and went off.

419
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:02,596
And after about two hours the undergrowth
got thicker and thicker.

420
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,604
Deep in the heart of the jungle. Anyway.

421
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:09,232
Somehow or another I got cut off
from the rest of the party

422
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:14,509
and found meself in this clearing.
I just started to retrace my steps

423
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:16,466
when I heard a noise.

424
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:22,935
I looked around and standing there
was the biggest lion I've ever seen.

425
00:29:23,216 --> 00:29:25,996
You need all that, don’t you?

426
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:33,308
I looked at him, he looked at me.
We just stood there looking at each other.

427
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:37,790
Then suddenly he went ‘aaaargh!’

428
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,509
- Cor blimey, Albert!
- What’s happening?

429
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:42,961
- Are you alright?
- Oh, yeah!

430
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:50,262
I did a very childish thing.

431
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,382
I wet meself!

432
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:56,972
A full-grown man and I wet meself.

433
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:02,108
Alright, alright Unc!
Nothing to be ashamed of!

434
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:08,134
Any bloke would have done the same thing
coming face to face with a man-eating lion!

435
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:13,831
I don't mean when I was in the jungle.
I mean now, when I went ‘aaargh!’.

436
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,066
I don't believe it!

437
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,697
We’ve got a change of clothes
in the airing cupboard.

438
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:41,101
- Alright? How's Albert?
- He's not his old self.

439
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,026
- Oh good!
- What do you mean, ‘good’?

440
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:46,727
- It was just a joke.
- I bloody well hope it was, and all!

441
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,230
Alright, keep your hair on.

442
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,860
- No, no, no!
- What?

443
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:56,633
Nothing. Nothing, sorry. Nothing.

444
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:10,910
So he's no better then?

445
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:15,451
No, he hasn’t been out for ages.

446
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:18,423
The doctor said he should try to get back
to normal life, you know.

447
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:22,548
That's right. I was there.
You know, I reckon the...

448
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,474
I reckon the problem is, right…

449
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,682
You are being very kind and considerate.
You're being patient, understanding.

450
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,481
Well, that’s not normal, is it?

451
00:31:36,175 --> 00:31:38,316
What do you want,
a doughboy round the ear, Rodney?

452
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:41,610
Ah, now you see, that's normal!
D'you see what I'm getting at?

453
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:46,126
Well, this flat is all hurly-burly,
people shouting and arguing at each other.

454
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,926
We don’t mean any harm
it's just the way we are.

455
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,903
But now we're treating Albert
with kid gloves.

456
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:55,640
If it goes on much longer,
he'll start using that as the normal.

457
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:59,601
Then when we go back to the real normality
he’ll go back into shock again.

458
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:02,268
You reckon we ought to toughen up on him?

459
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,897
The gently, gently approach don't work.

460
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:08,963
- I can't be hard on him, Rodney.
- Nor can I! But...

461
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:14,360
We’d be doing it for him, wouldn’t we?

462
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:18,115
Otherwise Del, believe me,
he’s gonna take root in this flat.

463
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,046
Yeah... maybe.

464
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,278
Here you are, Unc.

465
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:26,476
No, no son. I'll sit over here.

466
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:28,931
Alright if I have a brandy, Del?

467
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:34,890
Yeah, that’s alright. I’ll get it….
No, no, you know where it is, go on! Help yourself!

468
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:42,160
We've got a very very busy day
ahead of us tomorrow, Del.

469
00:32:42,195 --> 00:32:44,619
Yes, yes, we have, haven’t we Rodney?

470
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:47,385
So we won't have any time to go down the Pakis
to get any shopping, will we?

471
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:51,107
We can't expect Raquel to do it, can we?
Not in her condition.

472
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:54,179
- We certainly can’t.
- So it must...

473
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:58,239
So, what are we going to do then?

474
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:03,312
Well, we’ll have to send Albert down the shops.
Albert, you'll have to go down to the shops!

475
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:05,880
- Me? I can't go out there, Del.
- Yes, you can!

476
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:08,494
I don't feel really up to it yet, Del.

477
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,389
You go down there
and get them fish fingers.

478
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:17,002
You listen to me. Rodney and I
are very busy at the moment,

479
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:22,783
‘cause Trotters Independent Traders
are going to a phase of commercial augmentation.

480
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:26,251
And with Raquel dropping her chavvy.

481
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,859
I mean, we don’t want any lame ducks.

482
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:34,407
‘Cause you’re getting under our feet.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

483
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:38,358
So you better get up and get out,
‘cause you're no good to us the way you are, alright?

484
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:47,758
Yeah... I understand, Del.

485
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,841
I understand.

486
00:33:53,936 --> 00:33:55,560
Goodnight, boys.

487
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:09,099
- That was a bit hard, weren't it?
- A bit hard? You just told me to toughen up...

488
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:13,117
I'm just saying
it was a bit tougher than I expected, that’s all.

489
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:18,700
Are you comfortable
in that chair, Rodney?

490
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:36,202
I'll just take this into uncle Albert,
then I'll do your muesli.

491
00:34:36,237 --> 00:34:38,469
Lovely Jubbly.

492
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:45,379
All these other ones say the same thing.
'Albert Trotter lost at sea.'

493
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:47,383
- He's gone!
- Gone? Where is he gone?

494
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,443
He's not there! He left a note.

495
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,595
'I won't get under your feet any longer.
Your loving Uncle, Albert.'

496
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:55,906
Let me see that.

497
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:01,302
- That’s ‘cause what you said last night.
- ‘Cause of what I said?

498
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:03,758
I didn't wanna say anything
until you told me to say something!

499
00:35:03,793 --> 00:35:06,835
Well, don't you blame me Derek. I was only trying
to get him out of this flat and back on his feet!

500
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,044
I am not blaming anyone…

501
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,148
Will you two stop arguing?
Go and find him!

502
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:13,106
- Well, where's he gone?
- I don't know! Go 'n' look!

503
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:17,295
She's right. Come on, let's go.
I'll take the van, you take the Pratmobile.

504
00:35:18,974 --> 00:35:20,291
What did he say?

505
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:32,373
What do you mean, 'Pratmobile?'

506
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:55,903
Hello! No, Rodney.
No luck at this end. How about you?

507
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,396
You’re alright, Unc?

508
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,226
What you two doing here?

509
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:35,184
We were worried about you,
silly old git.

510
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,747
We've been looking all over
London for you!

511
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,292
- We found your note.
- How'd you know I'd be here?

512
00:38:41,705 --> 00:38:43,403
Just a guess, really.

513
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:51,174
- You were born round here, weren’t you?
- Yeah. Tobacco Road. My house was...

514
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:54,118
…somewhere round here.

515
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,496
What's this all about then, eh?
Running away from home at your age!

516
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,448
A lot of things been going
through my mind lately, Del.

517
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:12,261
I didn't know if I was coming or going.
I feel I let the family down.

518
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,087
I let you two down.

519
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:22,233
- Don't be so bloody daft!
- You didn't let anybody down!

520
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:24,849
I needed to be alone for a while.

521
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,061
But where were you gonna go?

522
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:34,485
I hadn't given it much thought, Rodney.
I didn't realise things had changed so much.

523
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:42,373
When I first left home, I was about 15,
I just come down here and got a job on a trampsteamer.

524
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,875
Life seemed easier then.

525
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:55,919
Things ain’t that much different now, Albert.
You can always come home, to your family.

526
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,766
- Thanks, son.
- Come on then, let's go.

527
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:06,149
You know, once upon a time ships from
all over the world used to sail in here.

528
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,537
The water used to be covered
with a film of oil

529
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:16,474
and when the sun shone it sparkled
with all different colours.

530
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:22,588
When I was a kid I used to
think rainbows lived in the water.

531
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:26,849
So, you was a bit of a divvy
in them days and all, were you?

532
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,668
- Oi!
- Alright. Sorry.

533
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:36,114
There were tugs nudging
freighters into position.

534
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:41,646
Cranes lifting out timber
from Canada, bananas from Jamaica.

535
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:47,764
The pubs and the cafes, they were filled with
sailors from a hundred countries.

536
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:53,881
By the time I was 7 I could swear
in ten different languages.

537
00:40:54,541 --> 00:41:00,037
There used to be streets all around here.
Loads of two up and two down houses.

538
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:07,008
'Dockers' mansions' they called them.
Ragamuffins kicking footballs up against the wall.

539
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:10,273
Women used to come out and chase us away
with their brooms...

540
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:18,833
They were rough people,
but they was good people.

541
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,620
During the Blitz some of the men
painted a sign on the roof of a warehouse

542
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,757
so that the Luftwaffe pilots could see it.

543
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:37,102
It said 'Dear Adolf, you can break our windows,
but not our hearts!'

544
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:44,035
Look at what they've done to it now!

545
00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:51,159
- Yeah...It's terrific, innit?
- Terrific?

546
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:57,016
Do you know how much some of these
drums are worth, Rodney?

547
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:59,474
I’ll tell you how much they’re worth.
They’re worth an arm and a leg.

548
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:04,459
Lord Linley's got one of these.
And Michael Caine.

549
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:12,557
Makes you proud to be British, dunnit, eh?
I could do with a bit of this.

550
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:17,462
I can see myself with a nice little black Porsche
parked outside,

551
00:42:17,497 --> 00:42:20,577
with the old windsurfer strapped to the roof rack.

552
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:26,755
Then have a few friends down from the City
and we’d have a private party in a pub yonder.

553
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:33,729
A few glasses of the old Moet, ‘cause I'm a champagne
and liver sausage sandwich man,

554
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:40,598
and then we’d watch the old currant bun go down
behind the Docklands arena.

555
00:42:42,724 --> 00:42:44,359
Paradise.

556
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:49,569
And after a few years
when the old property prices start to rocket,

557
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:54,877
then knock it out to some rich Arab
for twice the purchase price.

558
00:42:56,598 --> 00:42:58,380
Lovely Jubbly!

559
00:43:00,918 --> 00:43:03,719
- You alright, Albert?
- Yeah, I'm alright, love.

560
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:08,039
You didn't have to go running off like that,
Del didn't mean anything.

561
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:12,871
I know, he's explained it to me.
It's just that I felt...

562
00:43:13,168 --> 00:43:19,816
I felt like a failure. I'm not a coward, Raquel.
There was nothing I could do, there was six of 'em!

563
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:27,000
I know. Albert, nobody thinks you're...
Six of them?

564
00:43:29,347 --> 00:43:32,458
- Where's Rodney?
- He went out for a drink. Again!

565
00:43:32,783 --> 00:43:34,429
Well, that explains it.

566
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,785
I met a couple of winos this afternoon
drunk as nudes they were…

567
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:40,820
said they were celebrating St Rodney's Day.

568
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:45,692
- I hope he hasn’t gone to the Nag's Head!
- Why, what's happening down there tonight?

569
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:48,418
Nothing! I just hope he hasn’t gone down
to Nag’s Head!

570
00:43:55,648 --> 00:44:01,947
- Is that the bell, Del?
- Yes. No, you’ll get it, will ya? I’m busy.

571
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:06,599
- Raquel!
- No, Raquel can’t go. She’s busy and all. You answer it.

572
00:44:06,634 --> 00:44:09,041
- Me?
- You!

573
00:44:09,378 --> 00:44:12,097
Come on, there’s nothing to be afraid of, is there?
I’m here, ain’t I?

574
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:15,559
You're gonna have to answer the door
sometime or another, it might as well be now.

575
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,868
Albert, answer the door!

576
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,545
- Who's there?
- Knock-Knock.

577
00:44:33,283 --> 00:44:35,757
- It's Knock-Knock!
- Is it?

578
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,293
I can't see him, Del!

579
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,916
Of course you can't see him.
You haven’t opened the door yet!

580
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:44,662
I don't wanna see him!
I can't face it, Del!

581
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,193
Alright, alright. Look, I’ll go, I’ll go…

582
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,229
You can talk to Knock-Knock Albert.
He's your friend.

583
00:44:51,264 --> 00:44:53,404
I don't wanna talk to him,
not at the moment.

584
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:57,265
But he's most probably come to see how you are.
He might have brought you a bunch of grapes.

585
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,591
I'm not feeling all that well.
I think I'll go to my room.

586
00:45:03,226 --> 00:45:06,968
Oi, you stay right where you are!

587
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,126
Yes, that was Knock-Knock.

588
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:15,959
And look, he brought this back for you.
That was a bit of luck, weren't it?

589
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:19,610
It's your pocket watch, Albert.
Where's he get it from?

590
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:23,003
He found it under the bushes
on that patch of grass near the swings.

591
00:45:23,038 --> 00:45:24,758
What, where Albert was
mugged last week?

592
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:31,609
No! Where Albert and Knock-Knock,
whilst walking home from the pub last week, had a fight!

593
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:36,100
- They had a fight?
- Yes, over Marlene's mum!

594
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:43,178
And Knock-Knock knocked him out!
You never were mugged, were you? You lying old git!

595
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:45,972
But what about his money
that went missing?

596
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:50,100
Well, he lost it all, didn’t he?
At dominoes to Knock-Knock!

597
00:45:50,477 --> 00:45:54,539
- Oh Albert!
- I didn't know what to say!

598
00:45:54,574 --> 00:45:58,158
I felt silly, losing to a
man three years older than meself.

599
00:45:58,193 --> 00:46:04,539
He kept saying he was better than me at everything.
So I squared up to him and he hit me!

600
00:46:04,574 --> 00:46:07,329
Do you realize
the problems that you've put us to?

601
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:11,831
The police have been out there making investigations.
I've been running round looking for five muggers.

602
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:13,787
- Six!
- Six?

603
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:16,379
Oh it's six now, is it? Any more offers?

604
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:20,332
I was embarrassed!
Once I'd said it I couldn't go back.

605
00:46:22,932 --> 00:46:27,568
You should have been down the Nag's Head.
There was the punch-up to end all punch-ups!

606
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:28,761
What happened, then?

607
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:31,922
That gang of skinheads was in there,
the ones that Del said had mugged Albert.

608
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:34,205
Anyway, you know oily Ollie, the greaser?

609
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,336
His gang’s come in
they’ve only attacked the skinheads.

610
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:42,972
There was blood up the wall, grease on the ceiling.
Ollie and his boys took a right hammering!

611
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:46,983
It turns out them skinheads aren't skinheads at all.
They're coppers!

612
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:50,158
- They're what?
- They’re undercover policemen.

613
00:46:50,193 --> 00:46:53,453
They was put on the estate a couple of weeks back
when the muggings started.

614
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,080
- Oh no! Oh my God!
- What's up, Del?

615
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:02,815
Well, anyone would have done the same thing,
wouldn’t they, eh?

616
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:06,630
You didn't have anything to do with this,
did you?

617
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:10,151
Well... I wanted to get revenge
for that dozy old twonk!

618
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:16,019
I sort of...
I gave Ollie 100 quid to sort it out.

619
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:20,999
Oh for God's sake! This baby will be born
premature if I hang around you much longer!

620
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:24,280
Be fair, sweetheart.
They looked like muggers, didn’t they?

621
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,784
When Oliver and his army get out of hospital…

622
00:47:27,819 --> 00:47:31,083
I've got a fair idea
where their first port of call is gonna be!

623
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:33,485
Yeah, me too.

624
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:38,513
Well, they better not try anything with me around!
I was Royal Navy boxing champion.

625
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:41,679
I'm gonna kill him! I am!
I’m gonna kill him now!
