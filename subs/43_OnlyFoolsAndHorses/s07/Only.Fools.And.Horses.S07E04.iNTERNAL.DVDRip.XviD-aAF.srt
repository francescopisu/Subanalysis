1
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,327
Alright, Unc?

2
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,938
I sin't stopped since you went out.
How'd the audition go?

3
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,222
Don't ask! Just don't ask!

4
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,886
He got me up on the stage singing "I'm going
to the chapel and I'm gonna get married".

5
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,633
I mena, look at me!

6
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:16,445
I reckon it was your choice
of song, Raquel.

7
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,600
I think next time we should choose something
a bit more modern, like one of the Madonna numbers.

8
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,755
How about Like A Virgin?

9
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:27,697
That's it, something like that!

10
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:30,727
You shouldn't be
standing up in your condition, should you?

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:36,473
Come and sit down. Come and sit in this chair
'cause it's nice and warm.

12
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,542
I was gonna make some tea.

13
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,642
No,no, don't you worry about that.
I'll make a pot of tea. Rodney, make a pot of tea.

14
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:48,587
How come I've gotta do it?

15
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:51,910
Because Raquel's pregnant
and your Uncle's knackered! Now go on!

16
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,140
Yes, and I'm supposed to be
out of work!

17
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:58,146
Not compulsory, Rodney. The government do
allow you to make a pot of tea.

18
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:01,647
What I'm saying, Unc, is,
what about Brian Epstein here?

19
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:04,287
I've got all my correspondence to catch up with,
haven't I?

20
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:06,986
What, one letter?
And that's for Raquel!

21
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:08,960
I'll make the tea.

22
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:12,579
Honestly, it's alright for some little dipstick,
innit, eh?

23
00:02:12,614 --> 00:02:15,192
Going jolly it up down the pub
every night and crawl out of bed

24
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:18,340
when he hears the theme tune to
Home And Away!

25
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,099
But me, I'm a captain of industry.

26
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:24,982
I deal with clients or organizations
that are household names.

27
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,530
Yeah, like Parkhurst!

28
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,518
None of my mates are in
Parkhurst.

29
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:34,827
A captain of industry!
More like a bloody stowaway!

30
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,833
You really get off on this yuppy trip,
don't ya?

31
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:41,194
So, what's the latest brainwave?
Fax machines.

32
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,143
They're handy things to
have, Rodney!

33
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:49,773
For normal people, Uncle, yes! But he don't know
anybody else who's got another fax machine!

34
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:55,905
That's why, in the two months he's been wired
up to the worldwide digital miracle,

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,923
he ain't had one message!

36
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,869
You've got a message on
your fax machine, Del.

37
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:06,744
What does it feel to be a
plonker, Rodney?

38
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,223
This message could have come from
anywhere in the world!

39
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:12,601
This could have come from Rome,
New York, Tokyo.

40
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,900
It's from Mike at the Nag's Head.

41
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:22,459
He had the foresight to buy one
of my machines and I bet he's double-glad he did!

42
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:29,423
Blimey, he's half a moaner, ain't he? '
This message starts: Machine not working prop'

43
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,057
What's he expect for 45 quid?

44
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:40,428
That's interesting. Listen to this.
I've only been invited to a school reunion tonight.

45
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:41,494
You're kidding.

46
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:48,316
No, straight up. It's the pupils of class 4C who left
the Martin Luther King Comprehensive in 1962.

47
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:51,411
That used to be the old
Dockside secondary modern.

48
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:54,148
That's a turn up for the book, innit?
I'm gonna see all my old schoolmates.

49
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,480
- D'you suffer with seasickness?
- No, why's that?

50
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:00,501
It goes very choppy on the
Isle of Wight ferry.

51
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:04,904
For the last time, Rodney, my mates
are not in Parkhurst!

52
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,765
Anyway, it's in the
Nag's Head, tonight.

53
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:11,501
Why don't you come along, anyway?
You might cheer yourself up, you miserable devil!

54
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,122
Hey, Raquel. Guess what.

55
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:17,901
I've only been invited to a school reunion tonight
at the old Nag's Head.

56
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,427
- That'll be nice for you.
- Yeah! Will be great, eh?

57
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:22,598
- What's up?
- Nothing.

58
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:27,913
Come on. There's something bothering you.
I can tell. Was it that audition?

59
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:31,468
- 'Cos if it was, that geezer was right out of order.
- No, it's nothing to do with that.

60
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,848
It's this letter. It's from my solicitors.

61
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:37,799
They've managed to trace my husband's whereabouts
and told him that I've started divorce proceedings.

62
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,905
That's good then, innit?
And what's he say?

63
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,237
His solicitors say that he
is considering his response.

64
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,306
That's alright.
What's wrong with that?

65
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:48,897
I mean, you've been apart for 8 years,
haven't you?

66
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:52,456
In all that time have you ever
seen him or heard anything from him?

67
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,086
No, nothing. But you don't
know him like I do!

68
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,170
He can be horrible
when he wants to be!

69
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:59,999
I wish you'd never suggested
starting divorce proceedings.

70
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:06,882
Don't go on about that. It's gonna be alright, innit?
I mean, he can't do you any harm, can he?

71
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,085
Cause he doesn't even know
where you live.

72
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:13,878
And even if he did know where you live,
he'd have to go through me first.

73
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,859
So you just forget it.
You let the solicitors... solicit.

74
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,328
'Cause I want us to be pukka.
I wanna be married and all the exes.

75
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:32,603
'Cause I know that little faceache in there
weren't planned, but he's here now, ain't he?

76
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,699
Or her.

77
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:41,365
Yeah, or her. You know what?
If I was any happier I'd be dangerous.

78
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:45,032
- 'Cause it's just you and him...
- Or her.

79
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:51,757
You're the best things that's ever happened
to me since... well, since me mum died.

80
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:59,569
- D'you understand what I'm saying?
- Well... I think so.

81
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:05,165
- Well, don't worry, eh? Promise?
- Alright, Del, you know best.

82
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:07,552
That's it. Good girl.
You know it makes sense.

83
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,141
'Cause I'd do anything for you, you know?
Anything.

84
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:16,174
Anything? Alright. Promise me you
won't get drunk with your mates tonight.

85
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,270
On your bike.

86
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:31,983
This is bloody ridiculous. The reunion was supposed to
start at 7.30 and look, it's almost 8.10.

87
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,902
Who's organised this reunion anyway?

88
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,688
- Ain't he here yet?
- Who?

89
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:41,488
Your host. The bloke who's paid for all this.
He said he was gonna arrive late.

90
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:43,705
I think he wants to make an
entrance, surprise you all.

91
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,406
Who is it Mike, come on? Who is it?

92
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,790
I don't know, Del. He just came in yesterday
and said he wanted a room for a school reunion.

93
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:53,146
I wanna have a word with you
about that fax machine you sold me!

94
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:57,759
Yes, yes, alright Michael! I'm busy at the moment.
I'll fax you about it during the week.

95
00:06:58,412 --> 00:07:01,933
- So what was this bloke's name?
- I don't know, I didn't catch it.

96
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,270
But didn't you get his name
on the receipt and in your accounts?

97
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,856
- No, I forgot.
- In other words, he paid cash?

98
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:10,479
Yeah. That's right.

99
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:14,668
- What was he like? Was he tall?
- Yeah, tallish.

100
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:18,942
Here. He didn't have a scar running from the bridge
of his nose right down to the corner of his mouth?

101
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:22,918
- And his right ear was missing.
- Not that I noticed.

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,629
It ain't our old headmaster, then.

103
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:32,044
How could it be our old headmaster?
The doctors said he'd never be allowed back into society.

104
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:41,410
- Trigger!
- Alright?

105
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,116
Was it you?
Was it you who organised all this?

106
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:48,197
Oh turn it up, Del Boy.
Trigger couldn't organise a prayer in a mosque.

107
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,101
I got lost on me way here.

108
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:55,114
You've been coming in this pub
since you were 16!

109
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,207
No, I found the pub alright.
I meant I couldn't find this room.

110
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,774
I've been standing in your dance hall
for the last hour.

111
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:05,975
- All the lights are out, Trig.
- I know.

112
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,640
You've been standing in the
dark for an hour?

113
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:16,968
Yeah! I thought we was all gonna jump out
and surprise someone.

114
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,627
But there's no one else in there.

115
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:26,557
But I didn't know that, did I?
The lights were out! How you going, Dave?

116
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,409
Alright, Trig.

117
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:33,606
Well, I'll send your man up as soon as he arrives.
In the meantime, all enjoy yourselves, lads.

118
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,296
It'ss a bit of a mystery all this, innit?

119
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:42,285
It's like something out of on of them
Agatha Christie films.

120
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,262
I used to fancy her.

121
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:47,268
I mean, think about it, right?

122
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:53,143
Somebody has arranged for you four
to be in this room at the same time...

123
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,740
You used to fancy Agatha Christie?

124
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,611
Yeah. I had a picture of
her on my bedroom wall.

125
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:03,265
But she was an old lady.
All English country gardens and granny hats.

126
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,394
She looked a bit
like Mr Kipling's bit on the side.

127
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:11,130
Well, I fancied her.
I saw her in that film, Doctor Zhivago.

128
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:14,079
That's Julie Christie, you berk!

129
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,169
Yeah, well, whatever, I liked her.

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,193
As I was saying. On a cold,
rainy night in Peckham,

131
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:28,408
somebody has arranged for you four
to be here in this room at the same time.

132
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:35,762
And nobody knows who. And the most important
and frightening aspect of the entire mystery,

133
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:38,696
nobody knows why!

134
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,011
Now, think hard.
Who would do something like that?

135
00:09:52,062 --> 00:09:54,414
Jeremy Beadle?

136
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:59,816
- Jeremy bloody Beadle?
- Don't be stupid.

137
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:04,267
Rodney, you'retrying to frighten us,
Now, pack it in, 'cause it won't work!

138
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,791
- Well, that's it, I'm off!
- Sit down Denzil, you're not going anywhere.

139
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:09,630
I wasn't even at your school for long!

140
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:12,911
Me mum and dad didn't even come down
to London 'til I was 13.

141
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,153
I don't really feel I qualify
as one of the old boys!

142
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,865
- Did you get an invitation?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,413
Then you're staying.

144
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,308
It's just that I've got this thought
going round my head.

145
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:24,566
Well, lend it to Trigger.

146
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:31,725
Say, just say, our old headmaster
has escaped!

147
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:38,283
Yeah, I'm gonna get me coat,
I better go and check on uncle Albert.

148
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,523
Turn the lights on!

149
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:50,884
Shut up, just shut up, will ya?

150
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:56,938
Oh God, It's our old headmaster!
It's bend-over Benson!

151
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:01,323
If it is he's grown
another ear form somewhere.

152
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:05,421
Surprise, surprise!

153
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,035
Slater!

154
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,496
I had you this time, didn't I?
Be honest, I had you going.

155
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:17,204
The last person you guessed would be here tonight
was Roy Slater, eh?

156
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,047
Slater. what are you
doing back here?

157
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:23,330
Come on, Del Boy.
I've gone to a lot of trouble here.

158
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,498
You mean you organised this
reunion?

159
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:29,695
Yeah. I was in town and I thought it'd be
a nice way to catch up with me a few mates.

160
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:32,644
- I hear Marlene's had a nipper!
- What about it?

161
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,815
Well, nothing. Just congratulations.

162
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:39,591
I know you and her have been dreaming
of having a baby for years.

163
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:44,498
It's... it's nice.
And, Rodney.

164
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,793
- What?
- You've got married!

165
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:48,627
I know!

166
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,772
Look, you don't have to be on the defensive
with me, son. I'm pleased for you.

167
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:54,001
Yeah, well the marriage
didn't really work.

168
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,925
Rodney, don't you say a word.
He'll only hold it against you.

169
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,404
Look, Del, I didn't come
here to upset things!

170
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:04,260
It's just a little get-together, that's all.
Can't we at least be friendly?

171
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:09,657
Friendly? With a snide like you?
I wish it had been our old headmaster now!

172
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:12,026
I wish it had been Jeremy Beadle!

173
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,793
I thought you were in Parkhurst!

174
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,573
I got paroled 6 months ago.

175
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:20,187
You back in the police
force now, Roy?

176
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,853
No, Trig. They wouldn't
have me back.

177
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:31,763
Not after I was convicted of diamond smuggling
and given a 5 year prison sentence.

178
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,047
The police are funny about
things like that.

179
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:38,927
I've been living in Colchester,
working for an undertaker, hence the coat.

180
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,828
By the looks on your faces, I wish
I'd brought my tape measure with me.

181
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,477
Fancy a drink?

182
00:12:44,512 --> 00:12:49,389
Not for me, Roy. I've got a
prior engagement with the downstairs toilet.

183
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,410
Save yourself a journey, Boycie.
The biggest karsy's up here!

184
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,623
I've gotta go home, chief inspector.
My uncle promised, he'd tell me all about the war.

185
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:04,138
Wait a minute! Let's get a few things straight.
I'm not a chief inspector any more.

186
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:08,972
I'm just an ordinary bloke. I don't mean you any harm
and I can't do you any harm.

187
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:13,414
I know you'll laugh,
but I've changed.

188
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,880
You've changed?
Pull the other one!

189
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:18,702
A man doesn't go to this
expense without good reason.

190
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:22,695
I know it might sound ridiculous,
but if it were possible,

191
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:25,640
I'd like to wipe the slate clean.

192
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:29,234
Wipe the slate clean!
After what you've done to us in the past?

193
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:32,110
You fitted everyone of us up
on Mickey Mouse charges.

194
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:36,795
I know, Del, I know!
That's why I kept my guest list to just you lot.

195
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:43,704
Cause you're the ones who deserve my biggest
apologies. I wish I could turn the clock back.

196
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:48,553
So do I! To 6:30 this evening.
I would have stayed in and watched the telly!

197
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:54,487
You fitted up me, Boycie and Denzil
on possession of stolen goods.

198
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,306
And we'd bought 'em off you!

199
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,760
- I know. And I'm sorry.
- Sorry!

200
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:07,609
With all due respect, ex-chief inspector,
you can stuff your apologies.

201
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,101
I remember the time you followed me
in the van

202
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:13,636
and you nicked me for doing 70 miles an hour
in a built-up area.

203
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:17,473
It was just my word against his
and guess who the magistrate believed!

204
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:21,908
I mean, you couldn't get that van
to do 70 mph if you pushed it off a cliff!

205
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,981
Rodney, I'm sorry.

206
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:30,740
Yeah, shove it, Slater.
Just shove it!

207
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:35,286
And what about the time you planted
3,000 Green Shield stamps on Trigger

208
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:38,641
and he got put away for 18 months
in a young offenders home?

209
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:43,715
- I'm sorry, Trig.
- Oh that's alright, Roy.

210
00:14:46,788 --> 00:14:50,490
I always wanted to be mates with you lot,
but you sort of spurned me.

211
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:54,168
So, I wanted to hurt you
for not liking me.

212
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:58,730
You know, 'If you can't join 'em, beat 'em'.
That was my attitude.

213
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,431
So the Police Force had become
my God.

214
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:05,987
But in the end even my own colleagues
got sick of me and my ambitions.

215
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,402
I knew my days were numbered.

216
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,275
I began to panic.

217
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:14,640
I felt as if the whole thing
was coming to a premature conclusion.

218
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:16,784
No pun intended Boycie!

219
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:25,945
I was worried about my future.
Financial security, that sort of thing.

220
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:33,263
I turned to crime. I got myself involved in that
diamond smuggling caper,

221
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,756
and as I of all people should know,
I got collared.

222
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:45,440
I spent 3 and a half years
in a 10ft by 6ft prison cell

223
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:48,513
trying to work out
where I'd gone wrong in life!

224
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:56,804
Whilst in prison
I found Jesus.

225
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:59,569
What have they fitted him up with?

226
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:05,855
To be more precise,
Jesus found me.

227
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:13,327
It was round about that time I got a message
to say that my old man had passed away.

228
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:18,281
Yeah, I know, Roy.
I went to his funeral.

229
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,913
Thanks, Del.
I wish I could have gone.

230
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,100
Why didn't you?

231
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:31,376
He most probably didn't have a black suit and a
bloody big ladder! He was in nick, Trig!

232
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:35,310
Yeah, but I thought they let you out
for acts of God like funerals and weddings.

233
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:40,507
I applied for temporary compassionate release.
My mum wrote to the prison governor.

234
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,486
And he wouldn't let you go?

235
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,547
Not after what that old cow
put in her letter!

236
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:49,797
It's pathetic, innit?
Even my own mum's against me!

237
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,849
Perhaps this reunion
weren't such a good idea after all.

238
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:03,458
You all look a bit embarrassed.
Go on, you shoot off. I'll hang around.

239
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:05,531
Gonna sort out the money
with the governor.

240
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:13,582
Alright, Sla... Roy.
I'll have a drink with you, come on.

241
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:19,941
Thanks Del. What about you other fellers?
Will you break bread with me?

242
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:22,061
I'd prefer a Southern Comfort.

243
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:24,286
Have you two gone mad?

244
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:28,217
Come on, look at him.
He's only an undertaker's tea-boy now, ain't he?

245
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:31,158
Yeah, he's still putting
bodies away!

246
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:35,376
You don't honestly believe
he's changed, do you?

247
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:40,847
Personally, I'm not sure.
But I'm always willing to give that somebody a chance.

248
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:43,046
Make it a large one, Roy.

249
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,336
Alright, I'll have a lager.
Trigger?

250
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:48,621
Yeah, alright, I'll have a beer.

251
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:51,087
How can you drink with Slater?

252
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,768
When that's the man who stitched you up
over those knocked-off stamps

253
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,682
and put you away for 18 months!

254
00:17:55,717 --> 00:18:00,468
I know. But when I come out
I got an electric blanket and a radio with 'em.

255
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:10,626
- Fancy a cognac?
- And quick!

256
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:19,602
Yes. It's very simple, Marlene.
When you bring Raquel back here, you can pick me up.

257
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:25,052
No, I am not drunk!
Nobody is drunk!

258
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,176
- Del is!
- No I'm not. Shut up, Rodney!

259
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:30,142
You promised your lover
you wouldn't get drunk though!

260
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,957
Why do women always say
'Don't get drunk'?

261
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:37,290
It's their nature. My Corinne was always
going on about it until she left me.

262
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,161
- Yeah, and my Cassandra.
- My Ada was the same.

263
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:43,942
And they wonder why their
marriages break up.

264
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,388
Take my advice. The only way to avoid a broken
marriage is don't turn up for the wedding!

265
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:53,333
Keep the noise down.
The women might hear!

266
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,235
We don't want them
to know we're enjoying ourselves, do we?

267
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:04,748
Yes, I have had a couple of drinks.
Well,it's a bloody reunion, innit?

268
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:08,035
Yes, alright, I'll se you in a minute.

269
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:14,099
- Wanna another Boyce?
- No. Marlene will be here in a moment.

270
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,725
I will get my coat.

271
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:19,333
It's funny, I've been through
all these photos of the boys,

272
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:24,881
enjoying themselves at various stages
of their lives... and I'm not in one of them.

273
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:27,381
Well, you were busy,
weren't you Roy?

274
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:30,975
I mean, when that one was taken
you were at police training college.

275
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,811
And when that one was
taken you was nicked!

276
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:40,446
I suppose it was tough for you inside, eh? Specially
when they found out you were an ex-copper.

277
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,371
You don't know the half of it.
It was a nightmare.

278
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:45,691
Every mealtime they lined
up against the wall as I passed.

279
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,993
'Snide, snide!' They'd whisper.

280
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:52,071
'We're gonna get you snide.
Hope your wife can sow, Slater.'

281
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,423
Didn't the warders do nothing?

282
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,555
That was the warders!

283
00:19:55,922 --> 00:20:00,526
The convicts really had it in for me.
24 hours a day watching your back

284
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:02,058
especially in the shower room!

285
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:05,217
I've heard there's
a lot of bandidos in there.

286
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:07,948
No wonder Oscar Wilde
wrote a poem about it!

287
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:11,708
You wouldn't believe what they'd sell
for a king-size fag and a book of matches.

288
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,989
Fortunately they didn't give me any
problems.

289
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:16,964
I mean, these days even the poofs don't
fancy me.

290
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:28,580
Here's a photograph with you in it.
Look at that! It's the old school football team.

291
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:33,613
Look at that! How old were we? 14?

292
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:37,691
There's little Del Boy
with his Roger Daltry haircut!

293
00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,140
I was your midfield dynamo.
I used to play like Paul Gascoigne.

294
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:45,920
The one next to me is Boycie
He used to play like Bamber Gascoigne!

295
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,676
There's that Italian kid.
Good player. What was his name?

296
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,934
That will be Marlene.
I better be off.

297
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,960
- Give us a lift home, will you Boyce?
- Yeah, me too, Boycie.

298
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,521
Yes, of course! I'm running a bleedin'
minicab service these days.

299
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,223
- Ta ta, Roy.
- Yeah, see you Trig.

300
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:12,623
- Cheers Sla... Roy. See you around.
We'll have a drink in the week, eh?

301
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:15,648
Yes, I'll be in the
pub sometime or another.

302
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,389
Good, it's a date, then.

303
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,031
I'll get a copy of this photo, if you like.

304
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:29,542
Must have been the last time
that you were with all your old mates.

305
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:34,672
Look at that. Those were the days
weren't they, eh?

306
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,965
We had Denzil in goal. We had Monkey
Harris at left back.

307
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:44,610
We had camaradery.

308
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:47,292
Was that the Italian boy?

309
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,379
Yes Trig, that was the Italian boy.

310
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,418
Come along, Trigger!

311
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,750
- Do you want another drink then, Rodney?
- Yeah, go on then.

312
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,425
Roy? Wanna another drink?
Roy?

313
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,675
Look at that.
The Prodigal Plonker's gone to kip!

314
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,547
How we gonna get him home?

315
00:22:10,582 --> 00:22:11,593
Where's he staying?

316
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:14,938
Some bed and breakfast, he said, somewhere.
Don't bother about it.

317
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:17,535
Leave him there,
let him kip on the setee, alright?

318
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:21,881
Not a bad idea.
I think I'll climb in.

319
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,311
- Alright. Goodnight, unc.
- Goodnight, son.

320
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:28,959
You know Rodney, if someone had told me
a few months ago

321
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:34,024
that I'd been sitting and having a drink
and a laugh with Roy Slater,

322
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:36,112
I'd have said they're off
there bloody heads.

323
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,971
He ain't such a bad bloke, I suppose.

324
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:44,800
No. Take'em out of the uniform
get rid of their badges

325
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:47,429
and they're just like the rest of us.
Just as scared.

326
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:51,072
Here you go.
Want some ice?

327
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:55,351
'Yes, I want some ice Del, thank you very much'.
I'll get it for you Rodney.

328
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,319
'That's very nice of you Del Boy'.

329
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:07,131
I don't believe...
Rodney?

330
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:24,129
- That's alright, I'm not drunk!
- Where's he come from?

331
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:29,683
Where's he? Who's he? You mean Roy?
He's come from the pub. I said come back for a drink.

332
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:33,887
You rotten sod!
All the promises you made me!

333
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,134
You didn't believe me when I said
I was just gonna go out

334
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,157
and have two halves of shandy
and then go to a midnight Mass did you?

335
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:44,809
You're like all the others!
Your promises mean nothing! Bloody nothing!

336
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:49,181
Calm down. Don't get excited.
It's not good for the baby.

337
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,570
- Here, have a drink.
- I don't wanna drink!

338
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,678
I thought I could trust you, Derek!
I believed your promises, all of them!

339
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,456
'Your husband can't get near you, Raquel.

340
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:59,083
- He'll have to get past me first!'
- Well, that's right, innit?

341
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:02,057
Really? Well, what's he
doing lying asleep on our sofa?

342
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:03,937
What you on about?

343
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:08,073
My ex-husband is laying asleep
on the sofa!

344
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:09,723
No, no, no! That's Slater!

345
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,926
I know his name, Del!
I was married to him for four years!

346
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:26,265
- Slater? You were married to Slater?
- Yes!

347
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,759
But that's Slater!

348
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:35,380
I wish I hadn't burnt my wedding photos,
then maybe you'd believe me!

349
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:38,600
No. Not Slater!

350
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:41,578
Slater was my married name!

351
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:45,273
But Slater!

352
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:49,162
Why the Hell didn't you tell me
what your name was then?

353
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,198
I told you my husband was
a policeman.

354
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,445
Yes I know, but his name was Inspector Slater.
Your name's Raquel Turner!

355
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,182
Why didn't you tell me what
your married name was?

356
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:59,079
Because every time I talked about my marriage you
said let's change the subject!

357
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:01,899
- Gordon bloody Bennett!
- Have you said anything to him?

358
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:06,174
No, of course I haven't. Stone me!
Are you sure you was married to him?

359
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:08,237
Of course I'm bloody sure!

360
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:13,669
Alright, calm down, come here.
It's alright, just shut up.

361
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:17,066
Listen, you stay here.
I'll go and see how to get rid of him.

362
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:20,750
Slater?
Gordon Bennett!

363
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:25,875
Rodney! Rodney!
Wake up you dipstick! Wake up!

364
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,207
- Listen.
- What is it?

365
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:31,651
Slater was married to Raquel!

366
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:44,197
No, no. It's not a joke!
Slater was Raquel's husband.

367
00:25:47,065 --> 00:25:51,247
I'm telling ya! I wouldn't lie
about something serious as this, would I?

368
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:58,250
- Does Slater know?
- 'Course he does. He was at the bloody wedding!

369
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:00,971
I mean, does he know about
you and Raquel?

370
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:05,283
No, I don't know. I don't think so.
I've gotta get him out of here.

371
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:11,153
- Hello Roy. Come on, wake up. Come on.
- What's the time, Del?

372
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:14,939
It's time you were gone, mate.
Up you get. I'll get your coat.

373
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,785
- I'll just get a glass of water.
- Yeah, OK.

374
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:27,066
No, no! I'll get you some water.
We got plenty of water. We got this trendy water.

375
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:36,442
Tell me something, Roy.

376
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:41,189
You didn't come back here to Peckham just
to organise the school reunion, did you?

377
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,551
Not just for that. I got a letter from my wife's solicitors,
says she wanted a divorce.

378
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:48,819
So I h've come back to sort a few things
with her.

379
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:51,758
I'm gonna phone her brief and see if
I can make a meeting with her.

380
00:26:51,949 --> 00:26:54,838
So you don't actually know
where she's living then?

381
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:59,024
No. But her solicitors are local so she must be
around here somewhere, mustn't she?

382
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:06,901
Well, Iwas in the area
and I thought I'd look up me old mates.

383
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:13,034
I'm so glad I did, Del. It's done me the
world of good, meeting you again

384
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:17,541
and finding that
you're willing to forgive and forget...

385
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:22,935
I know it might sound
a bit poetic or sentimental,

386
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:30,166
but the cup of human kindness
really does runneth of...

387
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:34,727
That's my wife!

388
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:40,742
This picture here!
That's my Rachel!

389
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:47,907
No, no, that says there Raquel, look.

390
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:50,817
That's her stage name.
She done a bit of singing and acting.

391
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:55,487
What's a picture of my
wife doing in your flat?

392
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:01,217
Well. What's a picture of his wife
doing in our flat, Rodney?

393
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:02,795
- I don't know!
- He doesn't know.

394
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:06,179
Can't you keep your noise down?
I'm trying to get some sleep in there.

395
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,633
Is Raquel in yet?

396
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:12,029
Raquel! You mean she lives here?

397
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:15,705
Yes, I live here.
Hello, Roy.

398
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:20,511
- Rachel!
- Who's Rachel?

399
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,896
I'm sorry. I just don't
understand what's happening!

400
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:34,670
I came back ere and... Oh I see it now.
You're cohabiting, ain't you?

401
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:36,955
If that's the way you want
to put it, yes!

402
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,804
Which one?

403
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:53,680
You saucy git!
What do you mean, which one?

404
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:57,020
- Del?
- Yes, Del!

405
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,821
Who's Rachel?

406
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:09,120
So what's the full SP, Derek? Is this just another sort
you've trawled in your net?

407
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:13,130
Another notch on the bedstead?
Or are you two close?

408
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:17,762
Where'd you get that from?
You're pregnant!

409
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:21,623
Oh that's what it is!
We've been wondering about this, haven't we Del?

410
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:25,834
Look here Slater. You and Raquel broke up
over 8 years ago! She's a free woman now!

411
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,914
Not according to this
letter from Rachel's solicitors!

412
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:32,492
According to this I'm still her
husband and she's still my wife!

413
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,506
He's Raquel's husband?

414
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,253
Yes! Now stay out of it, Unc!

415
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:39,705
You know me, son.
I'm saying nothing!

416
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,886
Where'd you think she's been
for the past 8 years, in a convent?

417
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,955
I just don't believe him!

418
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,463
I'd think she'd have a bloke in tow
and I guessed it wouldn't be Cliff Richard!

419
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,479
You always liked to live a bit,
didn’t you, love?

420
00:29:50,514 --> 00:29:53,956
Alright, that's enough of that, Slater.
Otherwise I'm gonna take you out on that balcony

421
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:57,524
and see if the EEC
have changed the laws on gravity!

422
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,897
How'd you expect me to feel?
This woman who I loved...

423
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,541
Shut up, Roy, you're
making me feel sick!

424
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:07,753
This woman, my lawful wedded wife
has been fertilised by a Trotter!

425
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:12,139
You had the whole world
to choose from, Rachel.

426
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:17,095
You could have had Pol Pot or a Siberian pimp
with gingivitis and a wart on his nose!

427
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,008
But not you. But you decided
to go down-market, didn't you?

428
00:30:20,043 --> 00:30:23,952
That's it pal.
You're out of this bloody house. Go on, get out.

429
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,405
Derek, just calm down.

430
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,232
He's beginning to get on
my bloody nerves now, Rodney!

431
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:30,966
Why did you come back, son?

432
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:38,965
To see me friends, to see my family
and most important of all, to see my wife.

433
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,996
I've got a nice little inheritance
coming soon.

434
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:49,964
It's a nice few grand and I know
this may sound ridiculous now

435
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,676
...well it will sound ridiculous now...

436
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:59,222
but I was thinking maybe you and me
could try again. A fresh start.

437
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,940
Come on. Just naff off out of it, Slater.
Go on.

438
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:05,031
Don't you worry, Del.
I wouldn't take it back now, not in that condition.

439
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,094
Stop it Slater.
You're getting her excited.

440
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:12,673
- Yeah, I always could, couldn't I darling?
- That's it!

441
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:19,172
You better shut up, Roy, or I swear
I'll set him on you! Calm down, Derek, please.

442
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:26,836
Alright, alright Rodney! Come on, you go into bed.
Go on, I'll be there in a minute.

443
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:40,554
- Who's Rachel?
- Shut up, Albert!

444
00:31:46,567 --> 00:31:48,249
You awake, Rodney?

445
00:31:48,402 --> 00:31:51,198
Well, even if I weren't,
I bloody would be now!

446
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:52,396
What's up with you?

447
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,284
You've given Slater my bed!

448
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:58,965
Sorry, I had no choice, did I Rodney?

449
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,206
His bed and breakfast place would probably
have been locked up.

450
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,284
I had to let him kip here.

451
00:32:05,626 --> 00:32:07,397
What d'you mean, you had to?

452
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:11,744
Show a bit of compassion.
Can't you see the predicament that I'm in?

453
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:16,595
No, I can't! All I can see is
that snidey bark Slater lying in my bed

454
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,602
and I'm stretched out on the chaise-longue again!
I'm going to sleep!

455
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:27,349
No, no Rodney, don't go to sleep.
I wanna talk.

456
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,744
What about?

457
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:32,434
What d'you mean, what about? About everything.
About the situation,

458
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:37,447
about Slater and Raquel
and about my little baby!

459
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:44,843
If people find out that Slater
was married to Raquel

460
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,505
that's gonna be the end of me
and Trotters Independent Traders.

461
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:54,574
- No one's ever gonna trust me again!
- But no one trusts you... Why?

462
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,047
What do you mean 'why'?

463
00:32:56,082 --> 00:33:00,033
How d'you think my business associates and clients
would feel knowing that I was going caseo

464
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:05,878
with the ex-wife of an ex-copper?
And not any copper! Slater the slag!

465
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:09,646
Most loathed and hated person
in the parish!

466
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:14,518
If they find out that
Raquel and Slater had lived together

467
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:18,536
and you know... had sl..
sl...

468
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:21,059
- Slept?
- Yeah.

469
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:23,604
Go back to sleep, Rodney!

470
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:27,436
- I could hear voices.
- It was probably us.

471
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,279
Can't you sleep either?

472
00:33:29,485 --> 00:33:32,698
I've been lying in there
for hours worrying about this situation.

473
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:37,035
If people find out that Raquel was
married to Slater you'd be finished.

474
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:43,569
I know that, Unc! People would be
saying things behind me back.

475
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:49,071
Horrible things. Things like
'Slater's reject', things like that.

476
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,143
Have you spoken with
Raquel yet?

477
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:54,773
Of course I haven't!
It's not that poor mare's fault, is it, eh?

478
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,033
I've gotta try and protect her
from the gossip.

479
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:06,563
I've gotta try and protect meself as well.
Cause you kno. I'm a proud man.

480
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:12,997
I don't want people to think
that I mess with rejects!

481
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:20,044
You see Rodney, that's why had to let Slater
have your bed, you see?

482
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,930
I gotta try to keep him sweet.

483
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:26,368
I don't want him going around the parish,
in the pubs and markets opening his mouth.

484
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,099
He's got a hold over me.

485
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,994
But he doesn't know that!

486
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,712
Rodney's got a point, Del.

487
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:35,637
What he's saying is.
don't let Slater walk all over you.

488
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:39,208
If you do he might become suspicious and
start wondering why.

489
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:47,184
I don't know.
Perhaps you're right.

490
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:50,477
Sorry to interrupt. I'm dying of thirst.

491
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:52,478
Couldn't you sleep, Del?

492
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:57,908
No. As a matter of fact I got up early
to give you an early breakfast, Slater.

493
00:34:57,943 --> 00:34:59,487
Oh that's nice of you.

494
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:03,617
Then I was gonna take you by the scruff of the neck
and I was gonna kick you out the bloody flat.

495
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:07,726
Is that right?
I couldn't sleep either worrying about you.

496
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:11,812
What the local reaction would be if they
were to find out the truth.

497
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:14,208
I don't think anyone would
ever trust you again

498
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:17,428
if they knew you were living
with the wife of an ex-copper.

499
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:24,334
Not just any ex-copper! But Slater,
who is universally hated and despised!

500
00:35:24,752 --> 00:35:26,423
I think that would be the end of you.

501
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:32,695
Now I wouldn't like that to happen,
especially not to a good mate like you.

502
00:35:33,106 --> 00:35:38,137
Because, despite the fact
that you have taken my wife,

503
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:46,548
the one woman I ever really loved,
and tubbed her, I don't hold it against you.

504
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:50,383
So, I made a promise to meself
and I'm gonna make the same promise to you.

505
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:53,236
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

506
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:56,550
You know it makes sense, Roy.
Thanks very much.

507
00:35:57,098 --> 00:36:03,537
I just hope and pray I don't have too many beers
down the Nag's Head and go and let it slip.

508
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:07,849
Beer always goes to my head.
Champagne, champagne is different.

509
00:36:07,884 --> 00:36:10,589
I know exactly what I'm
saying with champagne.

510
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:15,346
But until my inheritance comes through
I can't afford those sort of luxuries.

511
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,966
It's a poser, innit, Del?

512
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:25,623
Yes, yes.
That's a bit of a poser, Roy.

513
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:37,529
There's some money there.
Go and have a couple of bottles on me.

514
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:44,854
Are you sure, Del? Well, that's very kind of you.
I really am quite moved. Thanks.

515
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:49,344
See you all in the morning.

516
00:36:49,357 --> 00:36:52,076
I don't know how long I'll be staying,
but that's not a problem, is it?

517
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,538
- No, no! That's no problem, Roy.
- Cheers Del.

518
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:06,390
What you gonna do now, son?
He's got you by the b... well, like that.

519
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:16,703
I don't know what I'm gonna do!
It feels like I'm in a state of shock.

520
00:37:16,738 --> 00:37:21,388
State of shock!
Must be like being hit by a John Barnes free kick!

521
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:24,751
I know. They're short and
curly and all, ain't they?

522
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,174
Don't know how much this is gonna cost me
before it's all over.

523
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:33,889
I've already given him 40 quid
and it's only the first evening.

524
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:38,791
You might have given him 40 quid Del,
but this is Slater's wallet!

525
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:43,811
That's funny,
I thought it was Rodney's.

526
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,806
That's cheered me up a bit, anyway.

527
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:54,980
Here's some sort of contract
from Slater's solicitor to Raquel!

528
00:37:55,737 --> 00:38:01,818
'I, Rachel Slater,
hereby waive all my legal rights and entitlements

529
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:05,116
to my husband's present and
future estates.'

530
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:08,980
It's one of them things them film stars
get their future wives to sign.

531
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:13,416
A pre-nuptial agreement,
or in this case a post-nuptial agreement.

532
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,710
He wanted Raquel to waive
all her rights to his money!

533
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:24,507
What money is he talking about?
I thought he was skint.

534
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:28,590
Yeah, but he's got some kind of inheritance coming up.
I suppose it's what his dad left him.

535
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:32,719
No, his dad wouldn't have left him anything.
He hated him more than the rest of us.

536
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:43,766
Listen to this, "Dear Mr Slater, bla, bla.
I would take this oppertunity to bring to your notice

537
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:49,457
the recordbreaking high which exists on today's
international diamond market.

538
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:55,528
I would strongly advise your consideration
to selling the 10 items you deposited

539
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:58,232
with my firm some years ago.

540
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:00,979
I await your instructions,
yours faithfully, bla, bla, bla."

541
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:04,400
This is from a Bond Street diamond merchant.

542
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:06,970
This is Slater's inheritance.

543
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:12,717
These 10 little sparklers that he pugged away
when the smuggling racket went up the pictures.

544
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:15,541
You've got him, Del!
This is concrete evidence!

545
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:20,420
I know, Rodney. Give me that wallet.
We're gonna hide this.

546
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,728
And we mustn't rush things, Rodney
until we work out how it's best to handle this.

547
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,599
Oh you found it, Del.
I've been looking everywhere for that.

548
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:32,614
That breakfast in bed you mentioned.
About 9.30 alright?

549
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:36,393
- Couple of boiled eggs would be nice.
- Cushty, Roy.

550
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:47,356
Rachel! Sorry, Raquel.
Let me get you a drink.

551
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:48,846
No thanks.
I just called in to see if Del was...

552
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:50,669
No, I insist!

553
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:53,439
Mike, another bottle if
you'd be so kind.

554
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,634
- This on Del's account and all, is it?
- Yeah. That's alright with you, innit?

555
00:39:56,669 --> 00:39:59,746
Yeah, fine. Del said anything you wanted.
It's down to him.

556
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:02,298
They broke the mould when
they made that man.

557
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,662
She seems a nice girl.

558
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:07,287
Raquel? Yeah, she's lovely.
She's been married before, you know.

559
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:10,830
- Oh yeah?
- A right git, I heard.

560
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,102
Really?

561
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:18,782
Her luck changed when she met Del.
He's had his faults, but his heart’s in the right place.

562
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:21,025
Don't tell him I told you that, will you?

563
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,476
What are you playing at, Roy?

564
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:28,724
Why's Del paying for your champagne and
bringing you breakfast in bed?

565
00:40:29,335 --> 00:40:33,536
He's just giving a helping hand
to an old school friend who's fallen on hard times.

566
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,290
When are you going, Roy?

567
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:37,785
I haven't decided. I'm just waiting
for my inheritance to come through.

568
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,878
Then I'm thinking of buying
a house in this area.

569
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:42,256
We'll be seeing quite a lot of each other
in the future.

570
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:45,090
D'you ever think back to our times together?

571
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:49,142
Some things remind me.
Things like repeats of Tenko.

572
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:53,036
Del Boy, Rodney.
Let me get you a drink.

573
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:55,873
Yes. Make it a large bottle, will you Roy?

574
00:40:56,212 --> 00:40:59,101
- You alright, sweetheart?
- Yeah. I called in to see if you were here.

575
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:03,429
Why don't you go and sit in the van?
Cause I'm gonna try to sort this thing out with Slater.

576
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:04,616
It might not be very nice.

577
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,471
You're not going to hit him
over the head with a chair, are you?

578
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,035
- Of course not!
- Oh, well! I'll go and sit in the van then.

579
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:17,599
Alright, Roy?
Enjoying my champagne, are you?

580
00:41:17,634 --> 00:41:20,687
Lovely, Del. Helps me keep a clear head,

581
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:23,951
and as you know best of all
that's very important.

582
00:41:26,508 --> 00:41:29,844
I was gonna take Raquel shopping this morning,
but she was still asleep.

583
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:32,299
She always was difficult to wake up.

584
00:41:33,818 --> 00:41:36,556
You know you how easily
these things can slip out.

585
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:40,562
I was thinking about hiring a car for a couple
of weeks. That alright with you?

586
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,627
Let's go and sit down over there, shall we,
and just discuss it.

587
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:46,266
Of course, lead on.

588
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:53,485
Before we go any further, Roy,
there's something I want to ask you.

589
00:41:54,238 --> 00:41:57,603
You knew all along that Raquel
was living with me, didn't you?

590
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:01,396
I suppose it's no harm in it.
Yeah, I knew.

591
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:04,926
I went to the town hall and looked up her name
on the poll-tax register.

592
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:07,903
Didn't see your name down there, Del.

593
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:12,866
I had to get into your flat
to make sure it's the same woman.

594
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,492
That's when I came up
with the old school reunion idea.

595
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:19,866
Del, go and fetcha bottle of
champagne, as a good chap.

596
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:23,925
You've got a habit of leaving things lying
around, don't you, Slater?

597
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,564
Like the other night when
you left your wallet lying around.

598
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,671
I couldn't help having a little peak
inside.

599
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:32,442
I sw that contract
you wanted Raquel to sign.

600
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,796
Only protecting me interests, Del.

601
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:37,023
If it's good enough for Rod Stewart,
it's good enough for me.

602
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:41,812
We also read that welcome home letter
from your friendly diamond merchant.

603
00:42:43,454 --> 00:42:45,875
What would happen if took that letter
to the Old Bill?

604
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:49,034
Sweet FA, Derek!
You've overlooked something.

605
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:52,460
You may have read my personal paperwork,
but that ain't proof!

606
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:58,799
I've still got exhibit A tucked up safe and sound
in my pocket. Now, get out of that one, Perry.

607
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:05,423
This morning, before I woke you with your breakfast,
I took your wallet out of your pocket

608
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,151
and had another look
at that paperwork.

609
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:11,345
- So what?
- Can I have exhibit A please, Rodney?

610
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:17,708
See this?
That is what's called a fax machine.

611
00:43:17,743 --> 00:43:19,822
It's exactly the same as
the one we've got in the flat.

612
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:22,566
It's a state of the art technology,
that is.

613
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:25,557
You can send a message anywhere in the world
with one of those.

614
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:27,269
And you know what else you can do?

615
00:43:27,412 --> 00:43:29,222
What does it say on there?
Look.

616
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,134
'Photocopier'.

617
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:37,134
Photocopier. Right, Roy my boy,
it photocopies things.

618
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:41,582
Like pictures, like advertising bumf,
like letters from diamond merchants

619
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:45,173
asking what you want done
with 10 little sparklers, things like that.

620
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:47,010
So you've got a copy!

621
00:43:47,045 --> 00:43:49,200
Not just one. Several.

622
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:54,695
I mean, say we mislaid something
as important as that? Be a crime, wouldn't it?

623
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,378
You said it, bruv.

624
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:02,216
You seem to forget, Derek,
I know a lot more about the law than you do.

625
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:05,930
I've already stood trial for those diamonds.
I've served me sentence.

626
00:44:05,965 --> 00:44:08,251
You can't be tried for the
same crime twice.

627
00:44:08,286 --> 00:44:09,747
I know, Rodney thought of that.

628
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:14,355
So we went down to the local newspaper offices
and we read the reports on the trial.

629
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,917
They had every little detail.

630
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:19,420
They even had a photo of you
in the football team, you remember, at school?

631
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:21,727
Spot the Git competition, it was.

632
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:29,226
Now according to the report, you were tried for
illegally importing 78 diamonds into the country.

633
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:35,936
It didn't say nothing about 10 missing diamonds.
Police don't know nothing about them... yet.

634
00:44:36,923 --> 00:44:41,585
I'd wonder how your mates down at the Yard would feel
if they got a copy of that letter.

635
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,330
It'd probably mean a new trial.

636
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:48,645
- And be honest, Roy... Be honest!
- Be honest!

637
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:54,249
You wouldn't stand a chance, would you?
Not with your record.

638
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,674
It'd be an even longer sentence this time.
What? 7 years?

639
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:05,877
I'd reckon 10. Still, that wouldn't worry you,
would it, Roy? 'Cause you like reunions, don't you, eh?

640
00:45:07,692 --> 00:45:10,553
I wonder how your mates in the
nick will feel when they see you back.

641
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:14,654
They'll probably throw a party for you,
on the roof.

642
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:21,381
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect
that you're angling for a deal.

643
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:22,987
Quite right.

644
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,520
Alright. When I've sold the stones,
I'll split the money with you.

645
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:28,740
I'll give you 10 per cent.

646
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:30,574
- No.
- No.

647
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,655
Alright. 80-20 in my favour.

648
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,930
- No.
- No, sir.

649
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:38,768
- Come on!... 70-30?
- No. We don't want the money.

650
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,683
We don't want the m...
We don't want the money?

651
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:46,986
All I want from you is a promise
that you will give Raquel a divorce.

652
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:49,119
Then you leave her alone forever!

653
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:53,959
You get out of tis area and never come back.
You also keep your big mouth shut.

654
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:58,581
Because if one person, just one,
hears that you were married to Raquel

655
00:45:58,616 --> 00:46:03,448
then there'll be a letter with a first-class stamp on it
winging it's way to the commissioner of police.

656
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:06,291
- And that’s the deal?
- That's the deal!

657
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:10,399
Well, those terms seem
acceptable to me, Derek.

658
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:15,711
Very acceptable. I give you my word.
I'll keep my mouth shut.

659
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,645
And I'll keep away from pillar boxes.

660
00:46:19,851 --> 00:46:21,680
I think that
concludes our business.

661
00:46:22,577 --> 00:46:28,015
Michael, a bottle of champagne please,
and two glasses.

662
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:30,621
I've got a train to catch.

663
00:46:33,097 --> 00:46:38,957
Would you do me a favour? When the baby's born,
if it's a boy would you name it after me?

664
00:46:40,254 --> 00:46:46,057
I wouldn't have thought so.
Hardly fair to christen a kid 'Dick', is it?

665
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:51,416
Have a nice life, Del Boy.

666
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:54,687
I will, Slater,
don't worry, I will.

667
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:03,776
Well donw, Rodney! We done it!
What a team!

668
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:07,539
What a bloody team!
Why didn't we take his money?

669
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:09,203
Because it's illegal.

670
00:47:09,238 --> 00:47:12,774
Yeah, but...
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

671
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:18,662
But, you see, when he sells the diamonds,
and he gives Raquel her divorce

672
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:22,813
she will be entitled legally
to 50 per cent of everything!

673
00:47:23,192 --> 00:47:26,071
Oh, Derek! I will drink to that!

674
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:29,041
You two celebrating something?

675
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:32,724
You could say that, Mike.
We've just pulled off the deal of the year!

676
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:36,411
That reminds me, Del.
That fax machine you sold me.

677
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:38,791
The photocopier on it don't work.

678
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:43,722
Don't it? That's funny!
It don't work on ours either!
