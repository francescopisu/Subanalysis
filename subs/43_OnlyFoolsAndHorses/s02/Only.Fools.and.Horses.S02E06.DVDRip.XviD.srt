1
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:48,790
- Poxy weather!
- Yeah.

2
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:52,671
Wish I was chairman of Pac-a-Mac!

3
00:00:57,326 --> 00:01:02,113
Hmm! Oh, by the way, a
Father's Day card arrived for you this morning.

4
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:10,093
Is it Father's Day? It's a pity we don't know where Dad's
living - we could send him a letter bomb!

5
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:14,821
Er, Father's Day card?
Hang about I'm not married!

6
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:18,234
Oh no! I wonder what that
could mean then?

7
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:24,828
Well, I know what it could mean...it means!
Oh no, no, no, she told me - she definitely...

8
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:32,891
You dozy little git! You nearly gave my heart a
connery then. Cor dear.

9
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:35,596
Well, I just wanted to liven us up a bit didn't I.

10
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:39,009
I mean, for the past four days we've
been hanging around in pubs and cafes

11
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:43,711
waiting for this rain to leave off. 'It's just
a summer shower Rodney' you said.

12
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:49,086
'Red sky at night and swallows flying backwards,
that's a sure sign of a heat wave Rodney' you said.

13
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:53,265
Alright - alright, don't go on about it! Where d'you think
I work, the metaphorical office or somewhere?

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,017
No, it'll soon be over. Don't worry.
Who's that on there? You is it?

15
00:01:58,175 --> 00:01:59,254
No it's you.

16
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:03,148
- Anyway, what d'you want to drink?
- I'd better have just 'alf a lager.

17
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,933
Yeah, well, the way business
has been going this week I think I'd better join you.

18
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:14,006
- Hello - how's it going Alex?
- Hello Del. Want a drink?

19
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:18,815
Oh well, go on then, I'll, um,
have half a lager.

20
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:19,948
Half a lager.

21
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,916
Yeah, and I'll have a large Drambuie with lime
- with er - topped up with soda, lots of ice,

22
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:25,858
slice of lemon and a
little cherry on the top.

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,536
Two halves of lager, luv. Done
much today?

24
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:35,154
What in this weather, you must be joking.
I wouldn't send a dog out in this, would you?

25
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:40,582
No, I'll send Rodney out later on. See what he can do.
What are you doing?

26
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:41,942
Have you still
got that travel agent's?

27
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,976
Yeah, it's not doing me no favours though!
I thought I'd clean up on that World Cup

28
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,491
but I couldn't get no bookings.

29
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:52,214
Honest Del, I've got thousands of pounds worth
of holidays just laying about. But everybody's skint.

30
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:54,175
I tell you, this recession's going to be
the end of me!

31
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:56,812
Well you want to cut down on
your prices then don't you, Alex, me old mate.

32
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:58,098
I'd lose money!

33
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,489
No way - you'd have some coming in wouldn't you?

34
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:03,374
I mean, I'd rather lose a thre'penny
bit than a fiver, wouldn't you?

35
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,629
Well that's true, yeah.

36
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:08,281
I mean, listen, I don't care what the papers say,
there's still plenty money about.

37
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:09,505
You know - if you know where to get it.

38
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,019
I mean, you want to find some way of
hooking the punters.

39
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,608
You know, you - you
want - you know, a bit of a gimmick.

40
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:15,867
Such as?

41
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:21,269
Ah? Well. You put it round the manor, right,
that the very next customer in your shop

42
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:24,903
is going to get the biggest cutprice 'oliday
in the history of travel.

43
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:27,557
No - no - listen and I mean really
cheap Alex right.

44
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:31,344
I mean something like anywhere in the world and
you'll knock off 80 per cent of the price.

45
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,939
80 per cent, leave off.

46
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:38,206
Eh, no 80 per cent, now listen - listen.
But only to the very next customer right.

47
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:41,243
So that they'll be doing see - they'll
be fighting each other to get in your shop.

48
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:45,973
Now once they're in there you sell the rest of them
their holidays at the - the normal price don't you.

49
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:48,761
Eh? This time next
year you'll be a millionaire.

50
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:53,892
D'you know that's not a bad idea Del.
Come to think of it, it's a belting idea!

51
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,158
I tell you that's what I'm gonna do,
exactly what you told me.

52
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:57,294
Thanks for the advice, mate.

53
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:59,222
That's alright, don't mention
it pal. I'll see yer around alright?

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,356
Right.

55
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:07,380
- Fancy an 'oliday?
- We can't afford an 'oliday.

56
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,058
Yes we can. Alex, special
offer, anywhere in the world - 80 per cent off.

57
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:14,076
He'll go bust!

58
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:17,307
Yeah I know he will - I know - that's what I told him
but he wouldn't listen, you know what he's like...

59
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:22,332
Ah, what about it then Rodney, eh? Me and you,
eh? What up into the wide blue yonder.

60
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,724
Yeah, get a bit of the
currant bun on our backs, eh?

61
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,345
Oh yeah, I'll have some of
that Del, yeah!

62
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:31,526
You go down the road and knock out a bit of that
gear and I'll do the old bizzo with Alex. Right?

63
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:32,837
Yeah right! 

64
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:41,959
Oi, wait a minute!
It's peeing down out there!

65
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:47,127
Yeah well - you want some
spending money for yer duty frees don't yer?

66
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:51,625
Well yeah, oh I'm never gonna
be able to sell this stuff.

67
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:56,520
Of course you are my son.
Remember me motto. He who dares wins!

68
00:04:58,704 --> 00:05:00,325
Yeah right! See you later.

69
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:03,656
See you later good boy.
Here, Alex. Abut that offer!

70
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:09,002
Genuine Italian sun hats. Made
in Roma!

71
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,590
- I could die you know!
- More than likely!

72
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,075
I mean, fancy sending me out
in weather like that.

73
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,574
Been raining has it?

74
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,641
Been raining? Why don't you stick your nose out
of that door once every so often, eh?

75
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,064
It's been raining non-stop
for four days!

76
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:38,622
I've done it Rodney - done it.
I've booked our holiday. Here you are, my boy.

77
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,314
That's it - there it is all in there.

78
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:43,212
We're going somewhere
different, we are away from the tourists.

79
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,283
Yeah - where?

80
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:50,036
Benidorm! It'll be fantastic Rodney, we'll have
a great time won't we - eh?

81
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:58,658
All that blue sea, the sunshine, dancing with all them
foreign sorts! You know Viva Espania.

82
00:05:58,874 --> 00:05:59,979
Yeah! That's what it's all
about innit?

83
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,940
When do we go Del?

84
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,504
Eh? Er, in three weeks' time Grandad.
It's goodbye Luton airport, hello Benidorm...

85
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,045
Um, yeah, well the thing is
Grandad...

86
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:21,608
I've always wanted to go to
Benidorm. Where is it?

87
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:24,487
It's in Spain, ain't it.

88
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:27,930
Spain? I've been to Spain
before!

89
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:32,730
Oh, oh, well you wouldn't wanna go again then, would
you, it'll be the same old thing!

90
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,338
I ain't never been to
Benidorm! It'll make a nice break.

91
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:41,168
Yeah! Yeah, the thing is Grandad –
I tell you what, um, er, well look,

92
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:44,099
why don't you go out in the kitchen, you
know, and knock us up a nice Spanish omelette –

93
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,825
you know,
help us get in the mood.

94
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,756
Oh! I've only got three eggs left and one
of them's on the turn. Still, if I put a lot of pepper in.

95
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,063
Great - triffic.

96
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,525
Are you gonna tell him?

97
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:08,441
Oh Rodney, how can I tell him,
look at him, he's got his heart set on it ain't he?

98
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:11,925
We can't take him with us Del,
he'll cramp our style won't he?

99
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:14,326
I mean you could bring a
bird back to the room,

100
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,818
go to pour her a Sangria or something
and find his false teeth in the glass.

101
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:25,320
Yeah, that would upset the romantic ambience somewhat,
wouldn't it? Well, what we gonna tell him then?

102
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,814
Er, say the food won't agree
with him!

103
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:32,266
No that won't work, you know
him, he's got a stomach like a rubbish skip!

104
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:35,678
Er, the change of climate!

105
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,181
Now the last holiday we had the change of climate
upset him didn't it and we'd only gone to Bangor!

106
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:50,202
Good one! Like it. No, I can't
Rodney. No look it's gonna break his heart.

107
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,671
Alright, Del, well if you
can't tell him, then I will!

108
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,691
Alright. Just a minute - just now.

109
00:07:56,066 --> 00:08:00,244
If you're going to tell him now, do it gently will
you. You know - I mean - he's family.

110
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:04,867
- You just - just leave it to me Del.
- Alright, good boy Rodney.

111
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,627
Er, Grandad, could I have a
word?

112
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:18,912
Oh Alex? Hello it's Del Boy. Look about
that holiday I booked with you this morning?

113
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:22,865
Yeah - listen - um, d'you reckon the hotel
could put another bed in our room?

114
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,112
Only Grandad's coming.
Oh nice one Alex.

115
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,687
Right, yeah I'll pop that kite round to you in the
morning. Alright, see you around pal.

116
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:48,649
Well?

117
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:53,013
Oh, look, couldn't the hotel
put another bed in our room?

118
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:56,934
Eh no, Del, I couldn't have
told him, it'd broken his heart!

119
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,921
You're just like the man at
the top you are ain't yer, you're utterly ruthless!

120
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,087
- I can be when I want to!
- Oh yeah.

121
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:05,350
I can - I've just this minute told Grandad
I don't like Spanish omelettes!

122
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:09,057
Oh yeah - I mean - that's
really being ruthless that is innit, eh?

123
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,742
I also told him that you love
'em, so you've got two!

124
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:16,953
You...

125
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,219
Careful Del, there's a bowl
down there...

126
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,584
Now then what do you want...

127
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:42,552
Oh God!

128
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:52,854
- 'Ere, hang about. Oi girls.
- Wendy it's alright he's asleep.

129
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:54,787
Now come on, listen...

130
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,507
'Ey, watch it.

131
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,611
There you go Del.

132
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:16,323
Oh, cheers, this is the life, eh Rodders? When we
become millionaires we'll move out - get a villa...

133
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:20,353
Get Grandad one of them little old folks'
homes that they have out here.

134
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:23,317
What old folks homes they have
out here?

135
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:28,656
You know, we saw 'em in the
holiday brochure. What d'they call 'em? Pensions!

136
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:37,796
Grandad I got yer lager! Grandad!

137
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,465
Yoohoo. Grandad, Rodney has a
lager!

138
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,691
You oughta act yer age a bit
more. That could have blinded me!

139
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,244
Come here.

140
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:07,523
I don't want nuffink to drink.
I'm going back to the hotel to have a fiesta.

141
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,478
Hey, d'you reckon he's alright? He's been acting all
edgy and nervous ever since we got here.

142
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:23,022
Maybe it's all that squid he ate...
The grub in the hotel ain't up to much is it, eh?

143
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:26,452
Oh you can say that again!
Here about that soup last night!

144
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:31,286
Called it oxtail - it's more like
foxtail weren't it, eh?

145
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,698
You don't reckon he's sickening
for anything do you?

146
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:40,497
No! It's probably just the heat, he's not as
young as he used to be is he.

147
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:43,680
'Ere Rodney, put some of that oil on me
back will you.

148
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,644
Oh Del I'm sorry. Sorry
I thought it was oil.

149
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:02,792
Childish that. Probably marked
now, is it?

150
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,661
You don’t 'alf go on don't yer?

151
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:08,610
I said I'm sorry! Look, I'll go up to the room
and get you a fresh shirt. Alright?

152
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,960
Yeah, why don't you do that
small thing Rodney, alright.

153
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:35,404
Bon soir.

154
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:38,093
Oh bonjour M'sieur. Vous restez
a l'hotel?

155
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:45,586
Defense de fumier! Avez vous
Dubonnet?

156
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:47,284
Oui, oiu, merci...

157
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:53,021
Garcon, dos Dubonnet pore
favore. Danke schon.

158
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,379
De quelle partie de la France
etes-vous?

159
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:04,968
Oui! Er, je t'aime, je
t'adore? Sur le pont d'Avignon!

160
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:07,364
Pardon M'sieur!

161
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,399
- Hey Jackie!
- Hi!

162
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:16,780
Join me for a drink?

163
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,517
Oh, I'd love to but I think I got stuck with
that little French feller over there.

164
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,237
I wouldn't worry about him.

165
00:14:26,334 --> 00:14:29,635
Pull up a pew - he won't
bother you with me around.

166
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,680
Je suis frontieres.

167
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,260
Thank you waiter!

168
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:52,545
I hope he doesn't kick sand in
my face.

169
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:15,490
Shut up! What's up with you? I
was just about to pull a French sort.

170
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,129
Look you've got to come with
me now. Come on.

171
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,126
- What's the matter?
- It's Grandad!

172
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:21,634
Grandad? He's ill ain't he?

173
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:24,505
I told you there was something the matter with him
but you wouldn't listen to me would you.

174
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,985
- He's not ill!
- Well what's up with him then?

175
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:28,875
- He's been arrested!
- Arrested!

176
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,861
Well come on!

177
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,792
Veesitors!

178
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,817
Huh, it's you two!

179
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:04,006
Yeah, good afternoon Grandad, how are you?
Settled in alright?

180
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,987
Quo vadis senor.

181
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,008
You know, quo vadis!

182
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:20,253
Took yer time getting here
didn't yer?

183
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,155
Now don't you start getting
stroppy with me you ungrateful old git!

184
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,380
I've been running round this town –

185
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,094
I've been running about here like a tit
in a trance looking for you!

186
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:30,629
I went to the police station,
they knew you'd been arrested

187
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,373
- but they couldn't remember
what they'd done with you!

188
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:37,218
Yeah. And for the last four hours I've been
phoning round trying to get hold of a consul!

189
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,125
Oh charming! So while I'm banged up in here
Rodney's out trying to hire a car!

190
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:49,121
Not that sort of consul, you
daft old git. I mean the British consulate!

191
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,171
Well why didn't you bring him
then with you?

192
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,608
Well why did you get yourself
arrested?

193
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:55,883
Sssh! Keep your voice down. You'll get him
chucked out of here!

194
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:10,320
Just - just keep calm will you, everybody please.
Just nice and calm and easy. Right, what happened?

195
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:15,870
Nothing! I was just crossing the road to the hotel, 
when this police car squinched up to me 

196
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:22,626
nearly running me over - next thing I knew I was
banged up in here! They ain't even charged me with nuffing!

197
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:25,219
No - no - look you must have
done something Grandad!

198
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:29,727
You went back to the hotel for a little kip right,
'alf hour later you're doing porridge!

199
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,930
Now think hard Grandad. Have
you done anything remotely out of order?

200
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:37,415
I mean, did you get drunk and disorderly. Did you
have a punch up with the Kuwaiti supporters' club.

201
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,827
Did you goose the maid?

202
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:47,607
No! Well...there was a little incident Del.
It didn't happen today though!

203
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,418
Now we're getting somewhere.
Alright, come on. Tell me when did it happen?

204
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,425
1936!

205
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,675
You know for a moment there I
thought you said 1936!

206
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,588
That's funny that but so did I!

207
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,800
In 1936 I was deported from Spain!
And all her territories and dominions!

208
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:16,905
Would you, er, would you consider it nosey of me
if I were to ask you the reason why.

209
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:19,012
Do you really wanna know?

210
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,920
Well no...we're just curious
that's all!

211
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,751
Yeah, you know, well we just
wondered.

212
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:27,231
Well...I were up to no good
weren't I!

213
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:34,390
Well I didn't think they got ruddy well deported for doing
missionary work id I? So what happened in 1936?

214
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,562
The Spanish Civil War
happened, that's what happened!

215
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:40,143
The Spanish Civil...This gets
worse Rodney!

216
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:44,776
Oh look, it's a long long
story!

217
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:49,345
Well according to Manuel the guard you may have a
long long time to tell it in! So let's hear it.

218
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:55,624
Well in 1936 the family was
living in Peabody Buildings, Peckham Rye.

219
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,982
Oh it was terribly hard times! We had no
money - no food - no future!

220
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:05,251
There was millions of
unemployed on the dole.

221
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:08,351
Excuse me. Just a minute -
just a - sorry - just a minute.

222
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:12,393
I mean, excuse me, I may be
being a wally or something,

223
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:19,725
but you - can you possibly explain to me what a dole queue in
Peckham has got to do with the Spanish Civil War!

224
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,920
I'm building up to it Del!

225
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:25,665
Having a conversation with him
is like the slow death innit?

226
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:33,172
One day me and my mate Nobby Clarke,
we decided we had just about had enough of it.

227
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:36,494
So we run off to join the Foreign Legion!

228
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:39,710
The Foreign Legion? You don't
mean the British Legion?

229
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:49,411
The French Foreign Legion! Camels and forts, you know!
So we hitch-hiked to Southampton.

230
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:51,296
That's where their headquarters was?

231
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,785
No! That's where we tried to
get aboard a boat!

232
00:19:56,045 --> 00:20:00,070
Well, eventually we stowed away on a
tramp steamer.

233
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:11,360
We hid under the tarpaulin in the lifeboat. But oh –
the voyage was terrible, there was storms and gales.

234
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:18,424
Us Trotters have never made good sailors!
Now Nobby was - he was alright on the water,

235
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,530
I think it comes from the time when he was a
caretaker at a seamen's mission in Grimsby.

236
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,289
Oi oi, I don't want to worry you, you know, but our plane
leaves in three days. What happened in Spain?

237
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,350
Well I'm just coming to it!
Oh now where was I!

238
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,717
You and the Fisherman's Friend
were under a tarpaulin in the lifeboat.

239
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:44,648
Oh yeah! Well, when the ship
finally docked guess where we were?

240
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:49,743
- Spain!
- No, Tangiers!

241
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:54,179
Grandad, is it worth me making
any plans for my future?

242
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:57,267
I mean what has all this got to
do with the Foreign Legion?

243
00:20:57,653 --> 00:21:00,982
Tangiers was one of their main
bases wasn't it.

244
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,605
You see any normal person who wanted to join the French
Legion would have gone to France, wouldn't they.

245
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:06,910
Not him, no!

246
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:10,328
Well we jumped ship and made
our way to their barracks.

247
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,456
When we got there we couldn't
believe our eyes.

248
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:20,117
They were the biggest band of cutthroats, villains
and murderers you could ever hope to see!

249
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,472
They was the
scum of the earth!

250
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,270
So you didn't join?

251
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:31,235
We tried but they wouldn't have us!
Well, now me and Nobby was in dead lumber.

252
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:36,854
We had no money, we had nowhere to sleep
and we was a thousand miles from home!

253
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:41,610
But then we had a bit of luck,
well it were more a quirk of fate really.

254
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:46,089
We bumped into an Arab
and he offered us a job.

255
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:53,867
He said he'd pay us to take his motor launch over to
the Spanish coast and deliver a...a cargo.

256
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:57,865
- What sort of 'cargo'?
- Guns.

257
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:04,265
You mean you were gun-running
in the middle of the civil war?

258
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:07,985
Well that's the best time to
do it Rodney, supply and demand!

259
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,194
You dirty little mercenary!

260
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:22,679
Oh we didn't do it purely for financial gain! Oh no,
we both felt a deep commitment to a political cause!

261
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,330
Which side were you selling
to?

262
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,966
Well whichever side had the
most money really.

263
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,374
Oh no, no - it's alright
Rodney.

264
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,318
No, I mean, you know a conscience is nice but
business is business, right.

265
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:39,580
Well it was after the seventh
trip when it happened...

266
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:44,911
There was government troops, lying
in wait for us.

267
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:50,661
They arrested us and they took us to this
little prison outside a town called Tarifa.

268
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:59,274
They took Nobby away and...tortured him! You
could hear his screams echoing through the night!

269
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,931
Woke you up at one point
didn't it?

270
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,135
The last thing on my mind was sleep Rodney!

271
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:10,982
But no matter what they done to him Nobby
wouldn't say a word!

272
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:14,439
I bet he didn't ever have his
Callard and Bowser to suck did he!

273
00:23:16,288 --> 00:23:18,119
Then it were my turn!

274
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:22,857
They...they tortured you?

275
00:23:23,055 --> 00:23:27,896
No! But they would have done
if I hadn't told them everything I knew!

276
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:38,216
Well, a couple of days later these government geezers
arrive with our deportation orders,

277
00:23:38,408 --> 00:23:40,698
and well, well, that's
about it!

278
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:47,174
Are you sure that's about it? I mean you haven't
forgotten any little minor details have yer?

279
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:50,949
Like, I mean, you didn't pop over to Honk Kong
and become an opium peddler

280
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,837
or you didn't get a Saturday
morning job as a white slave trader did you?

281
00:23:55,536 --> 00:24:00,446
No - I just went back to Peckham Del,
put me name down on the housing list.

282
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:06,330
Grandad, why the hell didn't
you tell us all this before we left home?

283
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:11,026
Well, I was gonna tell you but
I thought it might spoil the 'oliday!

284
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:14,296
Spoil the 'oliday! Well what
do you think this has done?

285
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:17,891
We'd have been better off with that caravan
in Buenos Aires now, wouldn't we.

286
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,921
Well it happened a long time ago.

287
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:24,699
I thought the Spanish authorities would have
forgotten it by now!

288
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,424
Forgotten about it? Forgotten
about it.

289
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,435
You're most probably on their ten
most wanted terrorists lists –

290
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:35,056
you're probably somewhere between
Carlos the Jackal and the Black November!

291
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:38,146
- September!
- What?

292
00:24:39,126 --> 00:24:42,383
It's September. The Black
September! You said November!

293
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:48,967
Gordon Bennett Rodney, we haven't got time to stand
about here discussing signs of the bleedin' zodiac!

294
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:52,318
We've gotta think of a way of
getting the Red Shadow out of here!

295
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,098
It's no sweat, they'll just
deport him again!

296
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,215
Just deport him. You're joking
of course.

297
00:24:57,384 --> 00:24:59,225
They've just held the World Cup here
haven't they,

298
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:02,440
they've got 'arf of Manchester
and Glasgow to get rid of first!

299
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:08,461
By the time we get him back he'll be eating
paella and calling us gringos!

300
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,999
There's gotta be a way! Now
there's always a way!

301
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,734
Hello, visiting time's over.

302
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:23,543
Here - listen, oi you two - now you keep schtum.
Let me do all the talking alright.

303
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:28,906
Ah hello Juan! Just the one I wanted to see.

304
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:35,836
Yeah, well, um, no I just wanted to say
like my grandfather here was telling us

305
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:41,256
about the charming reception that he's received
in your charming bijou nick!

306
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:47,989
What ees thees you say to me,
eh? You take thee peees yes?

307
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:53,794
I'm not taking the piss, au
contraire - au contraire Juan.

308
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:56,382
No I was, um - the thing that
I wanted to say to you - was...

309
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:58,654
Oi Del! What the bloody 'ell
do you think you're doing!

310
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:04,699
I told you keep schtum!
Pardona Monsieur, El Wally.

311
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:11,339
I've been racking my brains to
find a way that I could possibly repay you,

312
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:13,712
you know for all the good work that
you've done.

313
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:21,097
And I thought that perhaps you might give this
to the charity of your choice, know what I mean?

314
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:24,053
- The charity of my choice?
- Yeah.

315
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,810
- Gracias senor.
- Granada.

316
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,188
Gracias!

317
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:38,530
Now listen Juan, now - now we're such close friends,
I was just wondering if you -

318
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:42,164
you know, that you could pull a few strings
and get me old Grandad out of this khazi?

319
00:26:43,086 --> 00:26:49,446
Ce senor! You can go!

320
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:54,868
- What - go! What, just like that?
- Si! You are free to go.

321
00:26:56,829 --> 00:27:00,804
Um, excuse me Juan, er, shouldn't you like, clear it
with the Guv'ner first, you know what I mean.

322
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:06,189
There's no need senor, I have
hees release papers here!

323
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:13,234
You mean that you were going
to let him go anyway?

324
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:17,796
Si senor!

325
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:25,620
Nice one. Nice one Juan! Yes - yes a couple more years and
you could be in charge of yer own borstal couldn't yer.

326
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:28,791
How come you're letting me go
so soon?

327
00:27:28,992 --> 00:27:35,164
You done nothing - it's a little offence.
How you say - a traffic violation.

328
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:38,906
You crossa the road almost
causing the car to crash!

329
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:43,277
But we make no charges - bad for
Angelo-Spanish relationships!

330
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,147
Yeah, well, don't think you're
getting Gibraltar back just 'cos of this!

331
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,128
You - well, it appears you walked
across the road Grandfather!

332
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,699
You were done for jay-walking
you stupid old berk!

333
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,271
Well I didn't know Del Boy.

334
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,571
When they screeched to a halt
I thought they'd captured me!

335
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:12,252
Gracias once again senor. The
charity of my choice will ve very pleased.

336
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,356
I bet she will Juan, I bet she will!

337
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,365
Well I suppose we'd better stop off at the drug store and
get something for Grandad's cuts and bruises.

338
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:25,502
I ain't got no cuts and bruises!

339
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:29,161
It's early yet!

340
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:35,280
