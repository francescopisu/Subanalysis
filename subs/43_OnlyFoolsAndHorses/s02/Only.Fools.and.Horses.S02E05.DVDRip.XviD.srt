1
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,220
So we have a deal then Mr
Chin?

2
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:44,717
Yes, we have a deal.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,508
Good.

4
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:47,959
Do you take Barclaycard?

5
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:55,580
Do you? No, call me old fashioned or sentimental if
you like, but I'm a readies man meself –

6
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:57,803
cash in hand that's my motto!

7
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:01,385
Anyway, we'll see you first thing in the
morning right, about 11 o' clock.

8
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:03,034
Can't you do it today?

9
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:10,219
Oh, no, no, no, sorry I can't do it today Mr Chin.
You see, today is a very special day.

10
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:16,160
Today is the anniversary of my late mother's
passing from this immortal curl.

11
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:21,528
And by tradition my brother and me,
we always spend the day with her in the cemetery,

12
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:28,630
tending the grave, that sort of thing.
Anyway, I must rush, gotta buy some flowers.

13
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,225
Yes - I'm very sorry!

14
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:36,341
Oh, it's no sweat, I get them
cheap of a geezer in the market! Sayonara.

15
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:38,029
Cheerio.

16
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:14,779
There you go Mum...s'cuse the feet.

17
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,448
It's the bestest grave in the
entire cemetery Rodney.

18
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,823
Yeah, it's mustard.

19
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,224
Yeah, I mean look at the others –
thy all look like monuments to the unknown gypo

20
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,658
...While the others fall and crumble into dust this will
stand forever. And do you know why?

21
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:39,930
'Cos it's the only one in the entire cemetery
made of fiberglass.

22
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,423
Del, it's the only one in the entire cemetery
that required planning permission!

23
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,130
That's right...

24
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,297
It's looking a bit tatty nowadays.

25
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:59,398
I don't know, it's not too bad. It's bound
to be a bit iffy innit, after 17 years?

26
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:04,960
I mean, so would you after standing there
for 17 years of pigeons and diesel fumes

27
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:12,043
and other mourners stubbing their cigarette ends out on
you. I dunno, maybe you could be right.

28
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,940
It could do with brightening up a bit.

29
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:26,707
If I added some fiberglass models,
of say, an apostle and four cherubims with trumpets,

30
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,805
do you think it would
alter the effect?

31
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:34,537
If you added fiberglass models of Snow White and the seven
dwarfs you couldn't alter the effect of that!

32
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:39,854
Oi, oi, oi, don't start getting sacrificial!

33
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,384
I don't know what's the matter with
you Rodney, really I don't.

34
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:54,957
You seem to have no sense of occasion. You've no...
tres bien ensembles, as the French say.

35
00:03:56,474 --> 00:04:02,759
I mean look at you now, loafing about round your
mother's graveside. Don't you feel any emotion?

36
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,415
Now look Del, I didn't know
Mum that well, did I?

37
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:11,268
When she died I was just a little
nipperoni, all odd socks and eczema!

38
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,504
Now you feel a sense of personal loss –
me, I just feel cheated.

39
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:37,743
I'm sorry Rodney. I should have realized...

40
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:52,045
Our Mum was a wonderful woman...
She had long golden blonde hair...sometimes.

41
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:58,279
You could see her sitting at the bar
in the Nag's Head with her simulated beaver skin -

42
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:03,234
with her rum and pep in one hand,
20 Senior Service in the other.

43
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:11,150
She looked like a lady
- lots of people mistook her for a money lender.

44
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,636
Really?

45
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:13,885
Straight up.

46
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:18,883
Oh yes, course I was much younger then and
didn't have much money,

47
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,609
but every night she used to send across
two or three pints of light bitter,

48
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:27,399
or whiskey if she was flush.
That was Mum...

49
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:35,252
Then come about ten o' clock she'd look over where I was
sitting and she'd shout 'Come on Del Boy,

50
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:39,494
get off home to bed - school in the morning!'

51
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,599
That was the kind of woman she
was Rodney, concerned about our welfare.

52
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:49,912
Where was I then?

53
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:54,038
- Outside in the pram eating an arrowroot.
- Wasn't she worried?

54
00:05:55,797 --> 00:06:05,291
No, it was only an old pram...
No, it's alright, I'm pulling your leg.

55
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:14,886
Course she was worried. No. I like it here
though, don't you Rodney.

56
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:21,280
Nice and quiet, away from the
crowds and the noise and the traffic.

57
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,743
- It really is. It's so quiet.
- Yeah.

58
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:29,959
Tranquil.

59
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,146
You're decorating the kitchen
of a Chinese take-away tomorrow.

60
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,500
The  birds are singing 
and the sun is shining.

61
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:42,765
What did you just say?

62
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,303
That the sun is shining and the birds are singing.

63
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,071
No I mean before that.

64
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:49,735
Everythin's quiet and tranquil!

65
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:55,366
No Del, in between it being quiet and tranquil
and the sun shining and the birds singing

66
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:57,952
you mentioned something bout a
Chinese take-away.

67
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,693
Chinese ta...Oh, the Chinese take-away.
Well the owner's, see, in dead schtuck.

68
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,788
He's got the health inspectors coming
round and he's got to have his kitchen, you know,

69
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:11,923
painted, you know, brightened up a bit.

70
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:13,580
So why have I got to paint it?

71
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,692
Well you're the one that's got the GCE in Art.
It's a good earner this is Rodney.

72
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:22,724
- I'm charging him 150 nicker.
- I don't care.

73
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:26,067
Oh come on, I've given him your
word now.

74
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:31,225
Look, I am not painting the kitchen of some
grotty Chinese take-away. Alright?

75
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:46,196
Alright, if that's the way you want it...Yeah, I remember
what Mum said to me on her deathbed.

76
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:55,338
She called me over
to her side and she said 'Del Boy...Del Boy.

77
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:57,071
Stuttered did she...?

78
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:03,745
Sorry Del...No, really, I'm
sorry. I don't know why I said it...Sorry.

79
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:11,996
'Look after Rodney for me Del Boy' she said,
'Share everything you've got with him,

80
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:23,428
try to make him feel normal...' And that's what I
have done. Half of everything I've got...

81
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,592
I mean, fair enough, I've got nothing, but
half of it's yours!

82
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:36,160
You'd give me half of everything! You'd nick the hole out
of me last polo if I didn't keep my mouth shut.

83
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:39,665
That hurts Rodney...That hurts.

84
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,885
If I had any kind of wealth
I'd give half of it to you like a shot.

85
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:50,862
Yeah? Say you had two Rolls
Royces?

86
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:53,559
Well I'd give one to you
wouldn't I.

87
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,009
You'd give me one of your
Rolls Royces?

88
00:08:56,292 --> 00:09:00,696
Yeah, course I would. If it was weather like this, I'd
give you the one with the sunshine roof.

89
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:05,899
If you had two million pounds
what would you do?

90
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,665
- I'd give you a million wouldn't I.
- Really?

91
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:10,226
In cash.

92
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:18,581
What would you do if you had
two of them deep sea diver's watches?

93
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:27,979
Now you know I've got two of them deep sea diver's
watches...Don't take bloody liberties with me Rodney!

94
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:31,682
Yeah, that's the real Del
coming out!

95
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,543
Alright, you can have one of
me deep sea diver's watches. Alright?

96
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:41,535
No, no, I've got to draw the line somewhere.

97
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:45,231
I'm fed up with you and your bribery and your
emotional blackmail

98
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,067
every time you want me to do the dirty work!

99
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:51,986
It's  point of principle now Del,
you'd better get this straight,

100
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,279
I am not painting that kitchen tomorrow,
I'm not painting that kitchen in 1,000 years –

101
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,307
no way my son!!

102
00:10:03,276 --> 00:10:05,353
I'll give you a lend of me
dirty books.

103
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:06,938
Yeah, alright then.

104
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,625
Oi, Rodney, put that on the
meter will you.

105
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,170
Right, come on, what's that
look for?

106
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:32,345
You can't expect me to paint
with me feet Del Boy.

107
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,232
I don't expect you to paint with your feet.

108
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:38,891
All I expect you to do is sweep up, mix up and hold
the ladder for Rembrandt here, alright.

109
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:55,759
Oi, don't let him out...Well
that's going to please Mr Chin innit?

110
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,828
- Was it his pet?
- No but number 39's off the menu.

111
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,930
D'you reckon them rumours
about these places are true then?

112
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,052
No, of course not.

113
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,214
Well, that cat looked pretty
alarmed about something.

114
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:27,372
Here we are, nice little
kitchen innit?

115
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:34,598
Nice little kitchen? This is the pits Del Boy.
This is the bloody pits.

116
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:38,664
The whole place looks like an explosion
in a dripping factory.

117
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:43,244
This is a working kitchen Rodney.

118
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:50,107
You've got to expect a little bit of fat to spill out
of the pan every now and then.

119
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:55,462
So what period are we going to
decorate it in Del? Early bubonic perhaps?

120
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:02,059
Yes, if you like, look, don't worry about it, you've had all
your inoculations haven't you? Come on.

121
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,666
Is this the kitchen?

122
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:09,707
No, this is the master bedroom,
the kitchen's upstairs in the bathroom you wally.

123
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:12,503
Now, listen you two, you should be out of here
in a couple of days

124
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,515
if you don't do anything
stupid like stopping for lunch.

125
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:22,336
Oi, Rodney, come here, down here, look at this.
This is yer paint - right, there's yer walls,

126
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,454
there's yer ceiling - and now I'll leave it all up
to you Michelangelo.

127
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:35,392
Oh yeah, and just what am I supposed to do with them soppy
little tins - look I can't even dip me brush in 'em.

128
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:43,907
He can't even get his brush in 'em. He can't even work that
little problem out. Tell him how to do it Grandad.

129
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:46,337
Get a pair of scissors and
trim your brush.

130
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:55,718
You don't get a pair of
scissors and trim yer brush up.

131
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,671
Look what you do is get yer little tins open them
up and you put them into your big tin.

132
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:07,942
Oh yeah I'd thought of doing that already...

133
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:17,216
They've got no labels on them,
we don't even know what colour they are.

134
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:20,753
I know, the owner bought them
cheap, he got well taken on, it's a load of rubbish.

135
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,011
You can say that again.
Where'd he get 'em from?

136
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,721
Me.

137
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:29,031
You? Is this nicked Del? I'm
not doing it if they're nicked!

138
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:34,574
It's not nicked. It's bankrupt stock.

139
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,120
I bought a couple of gross as a job-lot.
Trust me, will you, trust me.

140
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:45,344
- Good morning.
- Ah, good morning Mr Chin...

141
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,396
Well my men are here as promised – 
they are the best in the business.

142
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:56,952
The creme da lamenthe
of the painting and decorating world.

143
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,051
Good. You are the painter?

144
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:04,000
No, no, no, he's the painter.
I'm his apprentice.

145
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,332
No, they're the best, the very best.
Don't worry about it Mr Chin - in fact, chin up.

146
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:26,011
Have you decided what colour
the walls will be?

147
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,909
Colour...

148
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:34,888
Yes, I mean, you don't leave an important decision
like that until the last minute.

149
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,965
- Get that lid off.
- I'm trying.

150
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:43,033
Well, Mr Chin, the colour that
I thought of - now you may not agree with me,

151
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:45,611
but somehow I think you will.

152
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:54,471
What I thought, and you can shoot me down in flames
on this one if you like...got it off yet?

153
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:55,629
- No.

154
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:59,821
-I thought the coulour of these walls should be...
- Blue.

155
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:04,009
- What?
- I like blue!

156
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:09,410
Blue, oh blue, Jeux Sans Frontieres, that's exactly
what I thought of.

157
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:14,157
I thought, why don't we paint these
walls a nice subtle shade of blue.

158
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,882
- What shade of blue?
- Yellow.

159
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:19,933
And then I changed my mind. I
thought no not blue...

160
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,745
What I thought we do, 
is we would pain them gold.

161
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:23,815
That is yellow.

162
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:27,653
This is gold Rodney, what's the matter with you,
are you illiterate or something?

163
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:34,130
I remembered the name of your
beautiful restaurant 'Gold for the Golden Locust'.

164
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,433
Well Mr Trotter, I'll leave it to you.

165
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:43,106
As long as my kitchen is painted and cleaned up
before the health inspector call. Alright?

166
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,266
Fine.

167
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:50,055
Sorry,  how do you know the health inspector's calling?
I didn't think they warned you or nothing!

168
00:15:50,345 --> 00:16:00,619
Oh I had a telephone call from a man,
he did not give his name, but he tell me,

169
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:05,688
'Get you kitchen painted or you be in
big trouble. John.'

170
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,419
John?

171
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,074
John, yeah - John. John, you know, John,
it's the expression, cockney expression.

172
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,072
Alright John and all that.
Somebody up there must like him, eh?

173
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:20,729
I wonder who that anonymous
call could have been Del?

174
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:24,516
Well, I don't know. Don't think we're ever
going to find that one out are we Rodney, eh?

175
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:31,829
Well, come on now, we must now say chow mein
and let our men get on with their work. Eh, Mr Chin?

176
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,663
D'you think this anonymous person

177
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:39,496
is likely to ring up any other Chinese Restaurants
and tell 'em to get their kitchens painted?

178
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:43,032
Well I had to do something, didn't I? Otherwise we would
have been lumbered with all this paint.

179
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:46,843
Right, now listen. I'm going to take
these boxes with me, right,

180
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:53,014
so Rodney you'll have to water that lot
down a bit, you don't want it too thick do you

181
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:55,322
'cause the plaster's none too kosher.

182
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:59,893
Just remember, a little dab'll do you, right, a
little dab'll do you!

183
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:05,269
Here, what about all this grease and filth Del Boy.
You arranged for anyone to clean it up?

184
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,365
Of course I have, what do you
think I am a cowboy or something?

185
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,322
There's a tin of Ajax and a rubber glove in
that bucket - go easy on the Ajax. See yer!

186
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:23,443
He's not in.

187
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:24,893
P'rhaps he's gone out!

188
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:31,598
Oh yeah, I never thought of that. You daft old...
of course he's gone out, the question is where?

189
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:36,023
This is the second day on the trot that Del's
done a complete disappearing act,

190
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:40,625
but when I ask him where he's
gone, he always acts sort of evasive.

191
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,744
I thought he told you to mind
your own bloody business.

192
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,468
Yeah, that's what I mean, evasive.

193
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:52,433
You know what, I reckon that while I have been
imprisoned in that Chinese take-away,

194
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:57,994
he's been out wheeling and dealing on the
quiet -  making a few bob and cutting us out...

195
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:00,816
Oh you're in.

196
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:06,723
You can't pull the wool over this boy's eyes can you,
eh Grandad? Yes I am in Rodney...

197
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:10,044
Seven out of ten for
observation.. Did you finish that job?

198
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:11,708
Yeah, about half an hour back.

199
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:17,434
Good, give us the money then, give us the mazoola.
Thank you.

200
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:20,611
One hundred and fifty pounds
- spot on. Well done.

201
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:25,331
We phoned you to come and pick
us up but you weren't in.

202
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,310
- What have you been up to Del?
- Oh bits and pieces.

203
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:32,033
- Where have you been?
- There and back.

204
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,734
- So what you been doing?
- This and that.

205
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,084
Long as I know.

206
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,361
I thought you'd winkle it out
of him in the end.

207
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:47,656
Listen Rodney I been doing
something...private...

208
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,510
Alright so let's just leave it at
that. Okay?

209
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:56,350
I think the best thing to do with this money
is to split it three way.

210
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,798
- Here you are Grandad - that's 35 for you.
- Oh cheers Del Boy.

211
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:04,089
- 40 for you Rodney.
- 40!

212
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,218
Yeah, well, you're the craftsman aren't you?

213
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,115
- You get the most 'cos you're experienced.
- Yeah but over there you said...

214
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:17,059
Hang about, hang about. And you also get
your diver's watch. There you are.

215
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:20,298
Hello, somebody at the front door.
Grandad go and see who that is will you.

216
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,633
Oh, my legs are older than yours.

217
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:25,186
I know, that means they've had
more experience haven't they?

218
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,858
- D'you like it then?
- Yeah, cheers.

219
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:33,840
Good. Oh, the bloke said don't
get it in the water.

220
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,980
Don't get it in the water? But
it's a deep sea diver's watch.

221
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:43,480
I know that, but it doesn't mean to say
you've got to go deep sea diving in it does it?

222
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:47,161
I mean, I've got a pair of them desert boots
but you don't catch me in the Sahara.

223
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,966
Look, it tells you how deep
you are and everything.

224
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,684
It's Trigger for you, Del.

225
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:55,683
- Oh yeah, hello Trig.
- Alright Del Boy? Hello Dave.

226
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:59,007
- What's up with you then Trig?
- I got some more of that paint, interested?

227
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:06,270
Oh yeah. Yeah, I'll have some of that.
Yeah, what is it - same price or lower?

228
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:07,489
Same.

229
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,348
Oi Rodney, don't bang that
watch, it ain't shock proof.

230
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,804
I won't be getting any more of this for a while.

231
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:16,679
I'm laying low for a spell, we almost got
caught the other night.

232
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:22,710
What do you mean almost got
caught?

233
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,265
Yeah, by the railway police.

234
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:29,716
See me and Monkey Harris get this paint
from a storage shed down in Clapham Junction.

235
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:35,872
You swore to me it wasn't
nicked! Bankrupt stock you said!

236
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:37,891
British Rail, same thing innit?

237
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:41,814
Knocked off railway paint, eh?

238
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,716
Well I bet Mr Chin's going to be well pleased when he finds
he's had his whole kitchen done out in Inter-City yellow.

239
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:50,209
I prefer to call it Awayday Gold.

240
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:54,641
I wondered where I'd seen that colour before.

241
00:20:55,011 --> 00:21:00,678
All day long I was whistling 'This is the
Age of the Train' and I couldn't think why.

242
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,006
No, this ain't the stuff they paint trains with.
They use this for painting signs in tunnels.

243
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:12,772
It doesn't matter what they use it for Trig,
it's still knocked off - and it's still illegal.

244
00:21:14,257 --> 00:21:16,177
Yeah, but it's good for the
country though Rodney, innit?

245
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:19,904
Come on Del, how can knicking
off British Rail be good for Britain?

246
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,510
He amazes me you know Trig, he's got a GCE
in Maths, and he still acts like a total wally-brain.

247
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,812
I'll tell you why this is good for the country,
shall I Rodney?

248
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:35,071
'Cos British Rail have to hire more security
guards to protect this paint

249
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,074
thus lowering the unemployment
figures

250
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:44,361
plus, their insurance company will need more
people to handle British Rail claims

251
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:52,258
that means redundant insurance clerks will be snatched from
the dole queues and handed back their dignity. Right?

252
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,633
Now these people may very well
celebrate their good fortune

253
00:21:56,821 --> 00:22:01,627
by buying a car and taking their wife and kids
on a touring holiday round Britain.

254
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:06,388
This will result in a much needed boost
to our ailing car industry,

255
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:13,154
higher revenue for North Sea Oil and a vital
cash injection into seaside resorts and depressed areas.

256
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:18,679
On the other hand. they may decide to take
a holiday abroad, right,

257
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:25,296
thus forcing foreign hoteliers, restaurateurs and bar owners
to buy more British beer, food and goods.

258
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:29,268
This will result in higher export
drive which, in turn,

259
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:31,748
will be very good for our balance
of payments surplus!

260
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:37,488
Soon this country will be rich and famous again
- the starving shall be fed - the homeless will be homed.

261
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:48,034
This watch is broke!

262
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:55,476
This watch is not broke, it's just that
you don't know how to work it properly.

263
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,437
Look, see it tells you the time in all
the major capital cities of the world.

264
00:22:58,692 --> 00:23:00,513
Yeah look, everyone except
London.

265
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:07,758
Look all I can tell by this is that it's nearly
chucking out time in Peking and I'm low on oxygen.

266
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,397
What do you want for nothing?
Jam on it?

267
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,185
- Tunnels.
- What did you say?

268
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:17,684
No, he said that.

269
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:25,983
Trigger said tunnels! He said they use that stuff to paint 
signs in tunnels. Well how can you see a sign in a tunnel?

270
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:27,712
It's pitch black innit?

271
00:23:28,037 --> 00:23:29,643
Na - this is luminous paint.

272
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,687
It's luminous paint Grandad, that means you see it in the
dark...Luminous? Bloody luminous??

273
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,056
I thought you knew Del Boy.

274
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:42,568
What do you mean you thought I knew, you didn't tell me.
What do you think I am, a physic or something?

275
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,071
D'you still want this box of paint?

276
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:45,940
Want it? No I don't want it -
you can stick it up...

277
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:49,481
I'm not in Grandad.

278
00:23:51,284 --> 00:24:02,062
Hello...Oh hello Mr Chin. No,
no Del's gone out...I'm not sure.

279
00:24:02,381 --> 00:24:04,054
Where you gone to Del?

280
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,541
Give it to me you stupid old
git. Now sit down before I knock you down.

281
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,318
Hello Mr Chin. How are you?

282
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:27,142
Don't you 'Hello Mr Chin' me.
What have you done to my walls??

283
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:41,533
Glowing are they? Now listen tell 'em not to be frightened
'cos this is a new energy saving paint.

284
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:47,516
Yes, it's designed to cut down on the
old electricity bills...I get it from a contact in...er...

285
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:48,489
Stockholm.

286
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,270
Yes - Stockholm. Stockholm?!

287
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:56,088
'Cos, you see, the Norwegians
they lead the world in paint technology...Yes...

288
00:24:57,498 --> 00:25:02,356
Yes, I understand, I'll be round to
see you first thing in the morning!

289
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:06,506
Does he want his money back?

290
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:10,624
No, he wants you to go round
tomorrow and do his living room out in it...

291
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,010
I'll have
that other box of paint off you...

292
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:15,231
Oh my God!

293
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,839
Something wrong Del?

294
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:22,482
Oh what have I done? It's all your fault.

295
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,291
It's your fault,
you and your stupid paint.

296
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:27,618
Oi, what have you done?

297
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:31,898
Now, listen Rodney. Listen, you've got to understand right.
That I did it in good faith.

298
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,738
Did what in good faith?

299
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:36,488
I'll show you. 

300
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:44,295
Come on you
better get your coats.

301
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:58,162
Del, what you brought us here for?

302
00:25:58,327 --> 00:25:59,406
Wait a minute.

303
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:12,882
Take a look at that.

304
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:19,472
Oh my good Gawd.

305
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:28,523
Is this where you've been for the past couple of days,
painting Mum's monument??

306
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:32,512
It was her favourite colour
and we both agreed it needed brightening up.

307
00:26:33,214 --> 00:26:36,051
Brightening?? That's more like
a rocket launch!

308
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,257
Well I didn't know it was
going to be luminous did I?

309
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:47,480
D'you realise our mum's grave is now going to become a
beacon for every Satanist and acid-head in England.

310
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,343
There's going to be white witches
dancing round that on a full Moon –

311
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:53,738
there's going to be
chicken blood everywhere!

312
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,897
What worries me is it's on the
main flight path to Heathrow!

313
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:09,208
I wish you two could see yourselves.
There's Mum and her monument - she's fast asleep -

314
00:27:09,407 --> 00:27:12,438
the third coat hardly dry and already you're
quivering in your shoes!

315
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:16,217
Well, I'll tell you this much,
I don't regret that I did it.

316
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:21,568
I will not bow my head to any snotty-nosed town
hall clerks at their narrowminded rules.

317
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:26,160
I shall look them straight in the face and
I'll say 'I am the man responsible –

318
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:27,624
and I'm proud of it'.

319
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:39,360
We'll put it down to vandals - let's get out of
here before we get our collars felt.

320
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,791
