1
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,588
- Have you seen my teeth?
- Have you tried yer mouth?

2
00:00:56,051 --> 00:01:00,806
Now don't get sarky, Rodney. I had 'em lat night,
I meant to put them in soak.

3
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:07,368
I might have left 'em in the kitchen.
D'you want any breakfast, Rodney?

4
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,467
No I don't! My belly' going up
and down like Tower Bridge.

5
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,049
I'll see if we've got anything out here for you.

6
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:20,389
Right. Ah! There you are Rodney. Morning. Great night
last night weren't it, eh?

7
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:25,135
Hey Grandad, I found your teeth, they were outside by
the rubbish chute.

8
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:27,796
What were they doing out there?

9
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,688
Well, I don't know, do I? Did
you lend 'em to anyone?

10
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:32,577
Course I didn't.

11
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,535
Are you sure? Here put a couple of rashers of streaky
in that pan for me will you, Grandad.

12
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,220
That's what you need, Rodney, after a night on the old drink,
a nice drop of the old bacon fat,

13
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:49,596
slides down the little red lane like a pint of Duchhams
on a warm morning.

14
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,124
'Ere what's a matter with you, you're not still
sulking are you?

15
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:54,496
No!

16
00:01:55,314 --> 00:02:00,170
Oh no - no. Come on, grow up Rodney, grow up will you.

17
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,762
What's up with him now?

18
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:07,108
I'll tell you what's the matter with him, shall I,
Grandad. The other day I met a couple of birds,

19
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:13,137
a mother and her daughter. Now I've known them for a long
time, they're two very charming people.

20
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:18,476
Anyway, I suggested that we made up a foursome, right.
So last night we went out for a drink.

21
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:22,798
We took them out and gave them a nice drink.
Had a lovely meal and then, him over there,

22
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,372
he goes and gets the sulks don't he.

23
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:27,695
What's the matter with you,
Rodney? It sounds like a nice evening.

24
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:33,495
Grandad - when he said we was going out with a mother and
her daughter I assumed that I'd be with the daughter.

25
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:41,906
Instead of that, he drags me round every pub in the Old
Kent Road holding hands with some old sort with a cough.

26
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,466
I thought it was a very
romantic evening, Rodney.

27
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:51,331
Well it might have been for you Del. For me the night air
was filled with all the sensuous promise

28
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,915
of a tour round the Sanatogen works!

29
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,710
'Ere, how's that bacon?

30
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,455
Alright. You didn't get in till four o' clock. What d'you
do, go back to their place?

31
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:08,087
No, don't get excited, we went on to this little spick
drinking club I know, over New Cross.

32
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:13,869
'Ere you know who was there, Grandad. Tommy Razzle.
Do you remember Tommy, used to live in Cathles House.

33
00:03:14,117 --> 00:03:16,609
Oh young Razzle - used to have
that dog?

34
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,879
Yeah, that's right - well he's
married 'er now!

35
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:23,862
He still on the Underground?

36
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:28,899
No, no, no, him and er - him and Monkey Harris they've
teamed up together, they put in false ceilings or something.

37
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,228
They've just come back from Saudi Arabia, they was
putting in a false ceiling in a - in a dental clinic or something.

38
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:38,307
Anyway, they had a big row, didn't they, Rodney, last night.
You should have seen it - you see Tommy,

39
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:44,333
he reckoned that he'd seen a salt beef bar in Jeddah
and Monkey Harris said no way.

40
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:49,240
Anyway, before we knew where we were they was off, weren't they.
Tables flying, bottles, glasses...

41
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,460
Almost had to call for the
manager at one point, didn't I?

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,192
Yeah, that's right. It was as bad as that. Anyway somebody
phoned the law right and who'd they send,

43
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:02,956
but a young policewoman! Well, course, that was it weren't it.
Should have seen him over there.

44
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:07,715
What! His eyes went all goggle like that and then he was
sniffing round her.

45
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:12,866
I was not sniffing round her!
I merely asked her if she needed any assistance.

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,342
Oh leave it out! There was Monkey Harris draped over a
keep left sign, there was Tommy with the handcuffs on,

47
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:24,902
their two wives were fighting like a couple of strays and
this plonker here is trying to date the arresting officer.

48
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:31,714
You should have seen it, it was pathetic. He was going,
'Well, you know, um, well I'm thinking of going

49
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:39,786
to the pictures tomorrow, d'you - d'you want to come?'
The only date that you would have got with her

50
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:44,824
was ten o' clock Monday morning at Horseferry
Road Magistrates! How's that bacon?

51
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh, I'll have a look at it.
Oh, Trigger called round last night.

52
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,837
- Yeah. What he want?
- With these watches.

53
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,964
Ah? Watches?

54
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,176
Watches, look.

55
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:57,467
Knocked off are they?

56
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:07,285
No, they're not knocked off. Knocked off - he's a comedian
isn't he - knocked off. Hey, these are not bad.

57
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:14,580
Look at that Rodney - look at that. What do you think of that, eh?
Repondez s'il vous plait, ain't it - that one.

58
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,786
Yeah, they're not bad as it
happens!

59
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:20,285
No, I reckon that's a Longines
or a Cartier.

60
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:27,145
- Trigger said they're four quid each.
- Four quid each, oh well.

61
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,383
Del Boy, I've burnt yer bacon.

62
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:37,542
Oh, you stupid old git. I told you to look after it, didn’t I?
Never mind, you can have it.

63
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:43,231
Come on then Rodney, let's go and see if we can flog some of
these watches. We'll stop off at Sid's place on the way, alright?

64
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:47,377
Yeah, right. Actually, I could do with something to eat now,
I feel a bit better after that.

65
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,058
What have you done with my
Sterodent?

66
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,334
ICI have dropped a point.

67
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,919
Chelsea dropped three on
Saturday.

68
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:17,052
They should never have sold Greavesy should they?
Come on then, you fit?

69
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,492
Yeah, right.

70
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,260
Right, what did you have Del
Boy?

71
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:24,295
Er, just a packet of biscuits
and a cup of tea Sid.

72
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,033
What did you really have?

73
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:39,752
Sausage, bacon, double egg, beans and tomatoes, mushrooms,
black pudding and chips,

74
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,324
three teas, two bread.

75
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:50,885
Bread was toasted.

76
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,855
No fried slice?

77
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:55,879
No, not this morning Sid,
belly's a bit dicky.

78
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,421
- What did you have, Rodney?
- Just me usual bacteria on toast, you know.

79
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,196
One day I'll smack him in the
mouth.

80
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:06,746
Yeah, if you can find it.

81
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:11,265
'Ere, coming down the Nag's Head tonight, they've got a
couple of strippers on.

82
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,213
No, I'm going out tonight.

83
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,119
Oh - here take that back, I want one of them down there.
One of them biscuits, alright?

84
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,843
Oh yeah, where you going?

85
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:23,676
I didn't tell you did I? I've
got a bird - Sandra.

86
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,768
Sandra? Where d'you meet her
then?

87
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,381
She was down the club last
night.

88
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:32,079
I didn't see you talking to anyone lat night, not even the
bird that you were supposed to be with.

89
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,894
Who was Sandra then
- that part-time barmaid, was she?

90
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,393
No. She's not a part-time
wallah. She's got a career.

91
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,020
Oh career. What is she - a
lollypop woman?

92
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:42,983
No! Policewoman!

93
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:09,794
I mean, Rodney going out with a policewoman! What are the
neighbours gonna say? Why's he doing it to us Del Boy?

94
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:19,109
'Cos he's kinky, ain't he. He's got what leading
psychiatrists call a - a 'thing' about policewomen's uniforms!

95
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,863
Well if that's all he wants can't we club together and buy
him one.

96
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:34,183
He don't want to wear it, he wants the policewoman to wear
it. Gordon Bennett, he may be perverted but he ain't dangerous!

97
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:48,030
Could I please have the keys to the
van Del?

98
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:04,640
Oi, have you stopped to consider how your actions are
going to affect our business?

99
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:09,828
Don't you realise that them streets out there are our
boardroom, our factory floor,

100
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:14,266
and the people that live in 'em are our customers, our
business acquaintances.

101
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:18,846
How d'you think they're gonna
feel about doing business with - with a grass?

102
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,898
Bloody 'ell Del, I'm just taking a bird to the pictures
and suddenly I'm Bertie Smalls.

103
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:29,301
You're not taking a bird,
you're taking a policewoman!

104
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,146
But under the uniform she's
just the same as any other girl.

105
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,563
Our kind and their kind don't mix Rodney. We're like cats
and dogs.

106
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:45,591
I mean you'll have to watch every word in case
you say something incriminting. Them people's never off duty.

107
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,061
Oh don't talk rubbish Grandad. She's hardly gonna nick the
bloke who's taking her out, is she?

108
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:57,725
What do you know about it you wally-brain? Don't you know
that police officers have to take a vow that, if necessary,

109
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:02,941
they will nick their own mum and dad - she's hardly
gonna think twice about a rag-bag like you is she?

110
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:08,925
Now you're trying to run my life again ain't you Del? Well,
if I let you get away with it this time

111
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:12,508
I won't be able to go for a Nelson Riddle without
you giving me a blueprint.

112
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:18,742
Leave it out. Hear that? All I've done
for him. Here you are, Grandad.

113
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,140
What have you ever done for
me?

114
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:27,887
What have I done for you? I brought you up, I fed you, I
clothed you, I picked you up when you fell down,

115
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:39,063
I wiped your tears away, but most important of all Rodney,
I've always been there. I have always been there.

116
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:42,352
Besides that.

117
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:45,888
Always used to take you away on holidays.

118
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:53,093
Oh yeah, the Costa Del Kent! That's right, yeah. You used
to create therapeutic little adventure games, didn't you,

119
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:56,031
like 'Let's see who can pick
up the most hops today, Rodney'.

120
00:10:57,628 --> 00:10:59,580
Hopping was all we could
afford weren't it Grandad?

121
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,552
You've either got a short memory Rodney,
or you're just ungrateful.

122
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,195
Don't you remember the time when your little mate
Roy Taylor got a set of Jacko roller skates for his birthday?

123
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:18,409
You came in crying 'cos you didn't have none. The next
day Del Boy brought you in a pair exactly the same as Roy Taylor's.

124
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:23,465
What d'you mean exactly the same as Roy Taylor's?
They were Roy Taylor's!

125
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,871
His big brother give me a right hiding
when he caught me on 'em!

126
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:29,869
Yeah, I got him back for you
though, didn't I?

127
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:34,259
Yeah fine consolation that was weren't it. I'm sat in me bed
with a split-lip and an 'eadache!

128
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,467
Alright, alright then, who paid your fine when you got
caught or smoking pot?

129
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,105
Yeah...well, I could have
handled that myself.

130
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:46,122
What, 300 quid? Do me a favour, Rodders. I remember
when you got nicked for riding your motor scooter

131
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,424
without a crash hat. You only got fined
five quid and you asked for time to pay!

132
00:11:52,024 --> 00:11:54,296
You've always been a bad 'un
Rodney.

133
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,211
What 'cos I didn't wear a
crash helmet?

134
00:11:56,622 --> 00:12:02,818
I mean smoking mari-jew-arna!
You brought a slur upon the family name.

135
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:08,063
Oh leave of Grandad. I'd have to get done for chicken
molesting to bring a slur on this family's name!

136
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,485
Oi, oi, that's enough of that!

137
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:16,930
It's a good thing your Mum
died when she did 'cos that would have killed her!

138
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:25,705
Why don't you shut up you
soppy old goat.

139
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:33,609
Look, I don't care what either of you say. I'm going out,
right. I mean you're always on about how you brought me up,

140
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,180
how you kept me, the one thing
you've never told me is why?

141
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,589
Well  - tell you the truth...

142
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,842
...the council wouldn't let me
keep a dog in the flat!

143
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:50,362
Well, I think it's because you wanted to see me develop
into a mature adult

144
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:56,780
someone who could stand on his own two feet - independent.
And one of the little clauses in my independence,

145
00:12:57,002 --> 00:13:00,886
Del, is that I
decide where I go, what I do and with whom!

146
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:06,899
Alright Rodney, alright, why don't you do that small thing.
You decide where you go, what you do and with whom you do it,

147
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:15,103
because I'm finished with you - I've washed me hands of
you - as far as I'm concerned you don't exist, right?

148
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,662
- And Rodney?
- What?

149
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:26,259
Been raining, them roads'll be
treacherous. Drive carefully.

150
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:33,200
- Yeah I will...Cheers, Del.
- What for?

151
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,867
Nothing. Well I shouldn't be too late, Sandra's got to be
up early, she's on riot patrol.

152
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,235
The world's a strange place to live in innit? Innit Grandad,
eh? One minute you're walking along quite nicely,

153
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:08,164
and the next minute, whack, life jumps
out and gives you sobering thoughts.

154
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:15,661
Oh I've had a lot of sobering thoughts in my time Del Boy.
It was them that started me drinking.

155
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,118
Yeah, I can understand that.

156
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:33,044
The boy's grown into a man.
I don't, I don't feel as needed as I used to be.

157
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:43,014
Soon he'll, he'll fly the nest! But you know what
the most sobering thought of the lot is?

158
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:49,526
One wrong word from that plonker
Rodney and I could end up doing five years!

159
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:11,474
'Ere I was watching that!
Rodney home?

160
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:16,320
No not yet. He's most probably
drove her home.

161
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,586
Yeah, more than likely.

162
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:29,711
Oh he's late though, ain't he.
'Ere I hope she hasn't asked to see his MOT.

163
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:33,983
Here he is now.

164
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:42,127
Oi, hello. Z Victor one. How d'you get on? Hope you didn't
leave any finger-prints over the suspect.

165
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:46,475
Ssssh Del, he's brought her
home with him!

166
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,099
He's done what? What's he trying to do to me? Quick
Grandad, hide things!

167
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,121
What things?

168
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,249
Well everything innit? That's bent for a start.
Quick get rid of it.

169
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,862
The booze Grandad, the booze!

170
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:08,001
Hello. Yeah, we were just talking about you
weren't we Grandad?

171
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,699
We just said, yeah, we'll give Rodney another
month and then we'll phone the police.

172
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,507
I've just brought Sandra back
for a nightcap.

173
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:19,376
- Oh good.
- Hello...again!

174
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:26,282
Yeah hello, again. Well did
you - did you enjoy the film?

175
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,039
Yes it was very good.

176
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:29,911
Take you to see something
romantic, did he?

177
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:31,524
No - The Exterminator!

178
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:36,315
Oh The Exterminator. Well, of course, to Rodney that -
that is romantic.

179
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:39,432
I mean he cried his little eyes out over The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

180
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,747
Leave it out, Del. D'you want
to sit down, Sandra?

181
00:16:51,566 --> 00:16:52,530
And what have you
been doing?

182
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,965
Nothing! No, no, nothing. No, we've been in all evening
haven't we Grandad, eh?

183
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:01,266
Yeah, and we've got witnesses
to prove it!

184
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:07,973
I wasn't asking you to provide an alibi, I was just enquiring
out of politeness!

185
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:14,913
Oh yeah, of course you was Sandra. Sorry.  It's just
that you know us being such a law-abiding family we're,

186
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:18,104
we don't really know
how to converse with er, the Old Bill!

187
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:21,227
He's got a police record.

188
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:32,831
Yes, er Walking on the Moon. You know you've heard that
one, ain't you? I'll play it for you later on if you like,

189
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,297
you know, if you haven't heard it.

190
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:39,086
D'you like Police LPs Sandra? I've got their latest one. It
ain't even been released yet has it Del?

191
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,923
If it hasn't been released how
d'you come by it?

192
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:49,086
No - no, what he means is, no, it hasn't been
released in Britain yet.

193
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,243
You see we got it when we was abroad on holiday,
didn't we?

194
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:55,043
We - we got it on holiday.

195
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,228
Where did you go?

196
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,875
- Italy.
- Spain.

197
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:01,690
- We toured.
- Yeah we toured.

198
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,004
Well this, this is pleasant innit?

199
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:27,219
You know, er, Rodney,
you know he tried to join the police force once,

200
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,714
it was after he failed the intelligence test to become a
Unigate milkman.

201
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:34,436
He's joking.

202
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:39,370
No, no, I'm not. That's a very nice looking
watch you've got there, Sandra.

203
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:42,086
Yes lovely, isn't it. Rodney
gave it to me!

204
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:48,837
Oh, did he? Oh, of course he's a very generous lad, our
Rodney, you know.

205
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:54,788
Sometimes I think he's too generous for his own good. Come on.
Er, Rodney hall you and me get Sandra a drink, eh?

206
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,367
You and me. And me and you. You know,
together. You and me.

207
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,215
Yeah alright. What will you
have Sandra?

208
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,492
- Gin and tonic please.
- G and T.

209
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:07,753
Cheers.

210
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:11,332
- What d'you give her that watch for?
- Don't worry, I'll give you the money for it!

211
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,351
I don't worry about that. I'm not worried
about the money am I?

212
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:17,728
Don't you realise those watches are a very sought
after property.

213
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:22,006
They are especially sought after by the
River Police and the Flying Squad.

214
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:27,632
You mean they're hot?

215
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,425
Hot? They're so hot it is
advisable to wear oven gloves when winding them up.

216
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:34,915
But you told me they were
straight!

217
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:38,539
Yeah well I lied, I lied,
didn't I? Appellation Bordeux controlee!

218
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:40,714
What?

219
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,458
We've got to think of a way to
get that watch back off 'er!

220
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:48,137
Yeah, yeah, I'll just say 'Sandra can I have the watch
back, because I only lent it to you'!

221
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:54,433
No we can't do that. She might get suspicious mightn't she.
I'll have to think of something subtle.

222
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:57,039
Yeah, that's what I like about you Del,
you'll try anything once!

223
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:01,080
Oi, oi, oi! Just er - no I've got an idea. Here.
Just watch me.

224
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:10,315
Here we are Sandra - a nice gin and tonic for you. Please
allow me to put it on the arm of the chaise-longue for you.

225
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,761
Oh dear, oh dear, butterfingers.
I'm ever so sorry.

226
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:16,971
Oh no, no, it's alright. Don't
worry.

227
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:22,824
No, I do worry, I do. I mean I feel partly responsible.
Yes. Oh look you're all wet.

228
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:26,685
Grandad, could you bring a cloth. Look at that all over
your nice new watch.

229
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,808
Give it - give it to me, I'll get it repaired for you.

230
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:31,108
Oh no, no honestly. It doesn't
matter. It's water-proof.

231
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:35,745
Ah? Well, yeah, I know it's water-proof, but is it gin-
proof? You see gin - gin's a very funny thing,

232
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,718
you don't quite know where you stand with it, see.

233
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:45,142
Sorry, sorry about that he's a bit eccentric, you know.

234
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:49,316
Um, no if you, if you, if you give me
that watch I'll get it repaired for you, alright.

235
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,904
Yeah, yeah, he's right, Sandra. 'Cos it's probably out of
guarantee now it's been soaked in gin, you know.

236
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,331
Well are you sure you don't
mind?

237
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:59,387
Mind? La plume de ma tante. It will be a pleasure.

238
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,559
There you are. That's right. There, look I'll let you have
this back in what - you know, in a couple of months

239
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:08,068
it will be as good as new! Well come on then Rodney - you
know - get Sandra another drink.

240
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,272
That got you out of schtuck
didn't it, eh?

241
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,868
What d'you mean, got me out of
schtuck? You put me in it in the first place.

242
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:22,594
Oh that's alright - go on, pass the buck. Alright? Yeah.
No listen, no more cock-ups.

243
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:26,140
Just, you know, you think
before you act, alright?

244
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,333
Alright!

245
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:31,221
Oh blooming 'eck. I'm sorry
Sandra, we seem to be right out of gin..

246
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:35,127
Ah no we're not, no I've got another three cases of it
down here!

247
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:43,164
Unbelievable. I don't believe it. What a plonker!
What a plonker!

248
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:57,277
- Oh well, here we are!
- Yes, here we are!

249
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,591
Do they let you bring your
uniform home Sandra?

250
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:06,432
Yeah, it's hanging in my wardrobe. Why?

251
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:07,880
Nothing.

252
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,795
- Rodney.
- Yes, Sandra?

253
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:24,545
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah...Anything!

254
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:29,326
- You know your flat?
- Yeah.

255
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,144
Is there anything in it that's legally yours?

256
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:42,258
I recognized a lot of the stuff from Scotland Yard
photos and Police Five!

257
00:22:44,326 --> 00:22:51,585
Yeah, er, well I mean you know. You're not interested in the
little things that fall off the backs of lorries are you!

258
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:59,636
No! But I am interested in who pushed them and who picked
them up. I mean you had three cases of export gin.

259
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:01,333
You can't
buy that in Britain!

260
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,561
- No, no, we got it on holiday.
- Oh, you smuggle as well?

261
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:13,262
Ah, come on Sandra. I bought
you a doner kebab tonight.

262
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,171
And you gave me a stolen watch!

263
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,120
Now I didn't know that was
nicked!

264
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:27,129
Well, tell that to the beak Rodney! You don't seem to
realise I'm trying to build a career in the police force.

265
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:32,383
Now, what do you think my commanding officer would do if
he found me in possession of stolen property?

266
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:35,473
Put you in charge of the
Christmas Club more like.

267
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:43,376
This is not funny Rodney, I could end up with the sack.
Which of you two's the culprit, you or your brother?

268
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:52,677
No it's...yeah it's me. Del, Del don't know anything about
it - he's a bit of a wally you see.

269
00:23:55,828 --> 00:23:58,638
Well I'll come quietly, miss -
it's a fair cop.

270
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:09,009
If I was to carry out my duty to the full I'd take you right
down the station now...

271
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:15,211
But you did take me to the
pictures. And you bought me a doner kebab.

272
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:20,395
And a packet of cashews - and
a watch! Oh no, forget about the watch!

273
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:25,739
No, I won't forget about the watch. Neither will I forget
about the others,

274
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:34,217
your brother hid down the side of the armchair. Look - I'll give you
24 hours' breathing space - time to,

275
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:39,560
shall we say spring clean your flat.
And after that I'm coming round with the CID.

276
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,854
That's 24 hours Rodney.

277
00:24:43,414 --> 00:24:48,871
Yeah...right. Reminds me of that Gene Pitney song, you
know 24 Hours From Dartmoor!

278
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:55,111
Well...thanks for a lovely
evening Sandra.

279
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,142
- Thank you, Rodney.

280
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,374
I don't 'alf fancy a coffee!

281
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:04,976
Oh do you? Well there's an all
-night sandwich bar down the Walworth Road.

282
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:14,671
Oh yeah. I'll most probably
pop down there then. Sandra - will I see you again?

283
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:22,565
Of course you will. I'll be round your flat in 24 hours.
And in case you don't recognize me in uniform,

284
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:24,553
I'll be the one with the warrant.

285
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:38,686
'well, we've got 24 hours, Del. Well as you so rightly say Del.
Rodney, 24 hours is better than nothing.

286
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,988
Thanks for being
so understanding, Del!'

287
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:43,979
I'm gonna kill you, Rodney!

288
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:45,075
You're choking me!

289
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,029
Listen - that's right, this is
it you dipstick. Have you got any last requests?

290
00:25:49,467 --> 00:25:52,809
Yeah - I want to leave my plimsoles to medical science,
now get off will you.

291
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:54,900
- No, I won't get off.
- Just leave him alone.

292
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,891
Now, what's up with you now? I
thought you'd calmed down...

293
00:25:58,077 --> 00:25:59,335
I had calmed down.

294
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:04,185
Then I trapped my finger in a flap on that table, got meself
a black man's pinch and it's all this diptick's fault!

295
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,244
I've said I'm sorry. I mean,
what more does he want me to say?

296
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,833
You could say 'I'm emigrating Del Boy.' 'I'm jumping of the
balcony, Del Boy.' Anything that would cheer me up.

297
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,920
Anybody can make a mistake Del
Boy.

298
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:23,100
Yeah, you're right, look at the mistake Mum and Dad made!
How could they produce such a stupid kid?

299
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,126
Oh don't put yourself down Del.

300
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:28,662
I'll chin you, I will.

301
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:34,614
Look, we ain't got time to stand here arguing. We've only
got a few hours to get rid of all this stuff!

302
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,535
That's right. Help me clear
out this sideboard, make it a bit lighter.

303
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:40,261
Did we get this sideboard down
Hooky Street, then?

304
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:46,282
I don't know Rodders. I don't know. Half the stuff in this
flat is legal, the other half...isn't!

305
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:49,736
It's been such a long time I - I just don't
know what' bloody what any more.

306
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:54,956
We're got to get rid of the whole issue. That's it,
come on. Oh I know, there's something that I mustn't forget.

307
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:58,845
- Oi Del!
- What?

308
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,669
Can I keep one of these bottles
of after-shave?

309
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:03,374
Yeah, what for?

310
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:06,089
Well it's just in case Sandra
comes round a bit early, you know.

311
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,899
Just come - come here, a
minute will you.

312
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,549
No I - I don't want it now. I
don't want it.

313
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:19,641
Come here a minute. Come here you! Will you just come here!
I've just about had enough of you. You - come here!

314
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:26,032
