1
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:49,513
When did I nick your speaker? Oh that speaker.
Yeah, well I only borrowed it for the party didn't I?

2
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,933
I gave it back to you the next day.
Well, alright, the next week.

3
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:58,198
Anyway, you’re not honestly trying to tell me that you've
only got one speaker? What just one!!

4
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:04,594
Blimey, what a way to run a railway station.
Anyway, look, never mind about your rotten speaker.

5
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:10,550
Now listen, this is a once in a lifetime offer. How would
you like to buy genuine mink coat for 50 quid?

6
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:19,026
No, no, it's not bent. No, the reason why it's
so cheap is because it's Ethiopian mink...Ethiopian.

7
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,539
Yes, I've got a contact in Babylon.

8
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:30,456
Ah, well, the only difference between Ethiopian
and ordinary mink is the colour...Yeah, that's right.

9
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,565
What colour would you call
them fur coats in the garage?

10
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:34,421
Tabby.

11
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:46,904
They're a sort of mottled grey with
delicate highlights in black and white ... I'll pop one round to you...

12
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,645
You ain't got a dog have you?

13
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:56,347
I'm only asking you to look at it
I don't want you to feed it or nothing!

14
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:26,989
Oh well, win some lose some - nothing ventured, nothing
gained - it's, well, boeuf a la mode, as the French say.

15
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:29,064
What's wrong Del?

16
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:35,128
Wrong? No, nothing's wrong. Things have never been better
Rodney. This time next year we'll be millionaires!

17
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:38,277
Right, here put that parfum de toilette
in the back of the van,

18
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,195
and we'll see if we can make a killing down the old
market, alright?

19
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:42,846
- Right-ho.
- That's it, off you go.

20
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,682
D'you play cards again last
night?

21
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:54,778
Eh? Yeah, yeah, that's right
Grandad you know me, eh? He who dares wins.

22
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,065
How d'you get on?

23
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:04,592
I lost. I even had Mum's lucky rabbit foot with me. Brought
me about as much luck as it did the rabbit.

24
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:13,833
You wanna ease up with this gambling Del Boy. I've seen
too many good men finish up in the gutter chasing 'easy' money.

25
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,636
It's that Boycie innit? You know Boycie, the second-hand
car dealer from Lewisham.

26
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:24,634
I have never seen anyone so lucky at cards Grandad, it's
all for big money an' all.

27
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:27,473
He ain't using a marked deck
is he?

28
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:32,279
What, no, we're close friends,
anyway, he knows I'd break his arms.

29
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:38,544
Well I were in a card school once where the cards was
marked. I lost a fortune.

30
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,253
What, you knew they were
marked?

31
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:46,765
Oh yeah, I marked 'em...I was
never much good at cards.

32
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,583
Stone me! Never mind.

33
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:54,984
Here, this Boycie fella, does he like spinning the old coin
Del, you know double or quits?

34
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:58,029
Well yeah, him, he likes any
form of gambling, don't he?

35
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:04,364
Oh well here Del, you try him
with this. It's a doubleheaded coin.

36
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:12,710
A what - double-headed coin? I thought you only saw
these in them old British movies.

37
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:18,085
Scotch bloke gave me this during the war.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

38
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:22,551
His hands was trembling and his voice
was just a whisper.

39
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:34,061
He said 'I want you to have something to remember me by,
Trotter. Take me lucky coin.' Then he...he went!

40
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:36,466
What - he died?!

41
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:45,192
Deserted. Mind you, you couldn't blame him the way
them Germans was carrying on. Someone was gonna get hurt.

42
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:54,930
I don't believe it! I just don't believe it! I mean I
thought we'd have got a right result with that scent.

43
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:58,725
You know I thought they'd be queuing - camping out
on the pavement like they do at an 'arrods sale.

44
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,187
Instead of that...

45
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,967
How many did we sell in the end?

46
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,136
What, altogether? None!

47
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:13,134
As many as that was it. Hang
on, but I saw you sell one.

48
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,227
- She brought it back.
- Why?

49
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:20,626
She smelt it. She said the last time she smelt
an odour like that was

50
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,417
when the cat sanctuary got
bombed during the war.

51
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,423
Alright Dave? How's yer luck
Del Boy?

52
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,174
Don't ask Trigger.

53
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,270
Still bad eh? I'll have a pint
of mild please, love.

54
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,069
- What's yours?
- No, thanks Trigger, I'm alright.

55
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:41,580
I've never seen such bad poker hands as he's been getting.
He lost 150 nicker in cold blood last night.

56
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,316
A 150 pounds!!

57
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:49,059
It's alright! I'm just going through this losing streak.
It'll be alright, it'll soon pass.

58
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:53,250
You don't honestly believe all that rubbish about winning
and losing streaks do you?

59
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:57,051
You make your own luck in this
world, son, there's no such thing as a losing streak.

60
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:04,212
You give my arse an 'eadache Rodney.
You don't know anything about cards, do you?

61
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:07,257
You and your little mates are still playing strip-snap,
ain't yer?

62
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,228
One of these days they're thinking of inviting
some girls along.

63
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:20,589
You see Dave, a losing streak is like joining the Moonies.
Easy to get into but a bark to get out of!

64
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,942
Just how much have you lost
Del?

65
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:27,468
Got your 'ankie handy? I didn't want to tell you, I
didn't want you worrying,

66
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:34,639
I couldn't stand all that dermatitis all over again!
We've got 70 quid and that's all that's left of your profits.

67
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:38,373
Well at least we can put the
central heating back on and get something to eat.

68
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:43,302
Eh? You don't think I'm wasting this on food and
warmth do you? This is my stake money for tonight's game.

69
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,321
You're playing again tonight??

70
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:47,198
Yeah, tonight 8.30 at our place!

71
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:49,928
- Trigger. Del.
- Hello Boycie.

72
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,887
- Hello Rodney.
- Boycie.

73
00:06:54,814 --> 00:07:02,393
Oh dear what's up with you, bird trouble? You look as
though you've had a promise from a liar...How's yer luck, Del?

74
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:08,084
Oh changing, changing, outed two-and-a-half hundred quid's
worth of French scent this morning.

75
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,197
Oh good, your in the chair,
then are you?

76
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:18,304
- Oh yeah, yeah, Trigger?
- I'm alright.

77
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:24,117
I'll have a cognac. Better make it a small one, don't wanna
skin you before tonight's game, do I?

78
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:28,978
Julie could I have a double cognac please.

79
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:35,083
And I'll have a large, I said a large Chevas Regal with Coke.

80
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:39,601
Yeah and I'll have a double
Southern Comfort with American dry!

81
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:43,213
That's 'alf a lager for Rodney.

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,211
And why don't you have one yourself you know and put the
change in the Third World relief bottle will you!

83
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,303
So how's your luck pal?

84
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,874
Well, not too good to be fair to you. I've sold one today,
mind you, a 1980 Simca Estate.

85
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:04,689
Only made 850 out of it though. I mean what's 850
these days? Hardly heats me swimming pool for a week.

86
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,064
Grim innit?

87
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:10,109
Oh yeah, absolutely. I said to Marlene - the other day,
you remember Marlene, Del.

88
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,223
Oh yeah, yes, all the lads
remember Marlene.

89
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,787
I said to Marlene, if it wasn't
for the fact that I was making so much out of Del and the boys,

90
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,661
I'd have to do something really drastic -
like only having smoked salmon twice a week.

91
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,106
You've got more front than Brighton ain't yer? Listen
Boycie, I'm telling you that my luck's changing.

92
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,565
I'm on a wining streak. Right! No I am,
straight up, now listen, alright then, I'll tell you what,

93
00:08:38,326 --> 00:08:42,930
here's 20 quid right that says the next customer in
buy's a pint of something!

94
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:48,430
You're on! 20 here says the
next customer orders a short.

95
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,321
You're pushing your luck a
bit, ain't you?

96
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,814
No, no, I'm not Rodney, I've just seen the next customer
who's coming in past the window.

97
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:59,452
- Yes, love?
- I'll have a dry Martini and a slim line tonic.

98
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:10,320
It pains me to take it Del, you know it really pains me...
Well cheers.

99
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,474
8.30 round your place is it?

100
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,406
Hold it Del. What are you
doing??

101
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:19,634
Yeah leave him, Del.

102
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:28,509
I'm not gonna hit him you fool. Listen I've got a double
-headed coin I'm gonna stitch him up, where is he?

103
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,653
Boycie. Here, just a minute, just
before you go, I tell you what.

104
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:36,650
You're a gambling man,
that 20 quid I'll toss you for it - double or nothing!

105
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,885
- Go on then.
- Right?

106
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:48,923
- Heads.
- What??

107
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:52,740
Heads.

108
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,974
You know what Del, I hope this winning streak of
yours holds out till tonight.

109
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:26,516
That's it, that is it, I've just done me stake money for
tonight's game, ain't I?

110
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:27,862
- Good!
- What do you mean 'good'??

111
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,377
Look, you're on the verge of losing everything we've ever
worked for in a rotten bloody poker game!

112
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:36,741
What do you expect me to say? 'Good old Del Boy
- he knows a short cut to the workhouse!'

113
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:38,738
Alright Rodney, alright, don't worry.

114
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:42,796
If the worst comes to the worst you know we can
always do ourselves in can't we, eh?

115
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,765
Me, you and Grandad
can go and jump in the River Thames.

116
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,743
Be quicker to drink a drop of
it!

117
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,878
Looks as though you've already
started.

118
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:55,162
Del, why don't you say to Boycie tonight's off?
Say you've caught something!

119
00:10:56,352 --> 00:11:05,136
Look, let me explain something to you Rodney.
Look beneath all this finery - there lies - a berk!

120
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:08,736
Now that surprises
you, doesn't it!

121
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:17,762
Look, you don't remember the day that Dad left home do you?
Course you don't, you was too young.

122
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:25,737
Well Mum she'd, well, she'd only just, you know,
left us, and you were just a little nipper

123
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:30,381
with a pink patch over yer national health specs,
you know to help that turn in your eye, Grandad,

124
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:37,704
he was sitting in his armchair waiting for colour television
to be invented, anyway I came home that evening

125
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:43,340
and found that Dad had gone, taken all
his things and gone. He, he took everything Rodney.

126
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:51,432
He took my savings, me three quarter length suede coat,
he even opened your little piggy bank...

127
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:58,530
The one thing that he didn't get was the money Mum
had left me and you that was 'cos I'd hid it too well see,

128
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:06,234
anyway he'd left us with nothing Rodney, not even the
price of a meal. D'you know what that day was?

129
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:14,956
It was my
16th birthday. He even took my cake!

130
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:18,419
What a lousy b...

131
00:12:18,682 --> 00:12:22,438
Oi, oi, oi, that' yer father
you're talking about!

132
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:25,387
Well I'm sorry Del, but that's
how I feel about him!

133
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,687
Well it's alright, well, it's understandable,
it's understandable...

134
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:33,696
But you see, from that day I swore that I would
never run away from anything in my life, I mean,

135
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,142
you know if a wild lion were to come in
here now my old April'd be pouting like a good 'un,

136
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:43,060
but I'd stand me ground. I would,
'cos it's geezers like me that,

137
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:49,077
that capture German machine gun nests! And that's
why I've got to play the game tonight, Rodney,

138
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:52,802
because I can't run away!
Running away only wears your shoes out...

139
00:12:54,513 --> 00:12:55,800
D'you understand me?

140
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:02,235
Yeah, yeah, I understand you Del! And I'll tell you
something else, we're gonna beat Boycie tonight!

141
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,085
That's the spirit my son,
that's it. We'll take him to the cleaners!

142
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,791
Ey, they'll call our place Che Sketchleys by the time we've
finished with him.

143
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,642
Right, well I'll see you later, I'm gonna
get you some stake money!

144
00:13:13,903 --> 00:13:14,918
Where from?

145
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:20,390
Oi, when the chips are down I can be just as sharp as you.
Now, remember that party we had at the flat last month?

146
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,327
Yeah there was plenty of
booze, right?

147
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:24,791
Not gonna organize a disco are you?

148
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,106
Eh no. I'm gonna take the
empties back for you!

149
00:13:35,122 --> 00:13:39,775
It's amazing ain't it Trigger. I've lived with him all these
years and I thought I knew him.

150
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:49,265
You know, and then something like this happens - some
simple gesture - and then you suddenly realise

151
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:54,547
what a 100 per cent, 24 carat plonker he
really is!

152
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:05,996
- Well?
- Well what?

153
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,034
Are you going to lend me that
money or not?

154
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:12,543
I ain't gonna lend you nothing! If I had a million
pounds I wouldn't give you a penny of it.

155
00:14:13,465 --> 00:14:15,720
Come on Grandad, just give me
a straight yes or no!

156
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,043
Why should I give you money to lose? And don't give me that
old fanny about a losing streak.

157
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:28,227
It's true! Today I put 20 quid on a McAlpines
navvy who was on a diet!

158
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:32,967
Now what are the odds on you picking the only
genuine weightwatcher in London?

159
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:39,830
What makes you think I've got any money anyhow?
I'm an old aged pensioner Del Boy.

160
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:47,441
'I'm an old-aged pensioner, Del.' You crafty old sod!
You had a 25-1 winner at Kempton Park on Monday.

161
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,336
I know 'cos I gave you the fiver! And
Rodney picked up your winnings, 125 quid.

162
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,111
Oh that?

163
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,779
Oh yes, oh that! Come on Grandad lend me a hundred!
I'll pay you back double!

164
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:05,538
Now be fair, I've always been straight with you
haven't I? Remember last month

165
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,641
when you said you was feeling the cold in
bed, what did I do for you?

166
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:11,156
You brought me an electric
blanket.

167
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,996
Right. Give me that hundred
and I'll put a plug on it for you.

168
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,810
Alright. You pay me back
double though!

169
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:20,766
Yeah, don't worry, alright,
alright.

170
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:24,596
'Ere, d'you always wear that
money belt?

171
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:27,418
Well it stops me getting a
chill on me belly.

172
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:32,991
That is most probably why your
kidney stones didn't show up on that X-ray!

173
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:35,970
- There you go
- Thank you Grandad.

174
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,028
And don't lose it!

175
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,011
No, alright - alright, I won't.
Cheers.

176
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:41,349
Trigger and Boycie are here!

177
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:50,417
Alright, alright, keep calm Rodney, keep calm. Right, now
just er, just play it cool, know what I mean?

178
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:55,294
Come on, just er, nice and cool, nice
and cool...What you doing?

179
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,205
Alright then Boycie?

180
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:07,964
- Good evening
- Come on in. Get the boys a drink.

181
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:11,912
You don't see many places like this these
days Del Boy.

182
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,008
Oh thanks. I designed it myself!

183
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:21,556
Yeah I thought as much! As a matter of fact I saw a place
rather like this on a television programme recently.

184
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:22,840
Dallas?

185
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:30,939
No not Dallas - definitely not Dallas. No, it was a charity
appeal - had the wife in tears you know.

186
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,203
Still Marlene's
easily touched.

187
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:36,684
Yeah, as Del said earlier all
the lads remember Marlene.

188
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,528
Yeah, it was one of them programmes that...

189
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,586
Well are we gonna stand here rabbiting all night
or are we gonna play cards?

190
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,665
No, we're gonna play cards Boycie. Sit yourself down over
there, come on Trigger, That's it.

191
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:56,280
Right, that' it Rodney, get them beers down. Right.

192
00:16:58,273 --> 00:16:59,887
Five card draw - usual limit yeah?

193
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:01,717
That's alright.

194
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,050
Right good, right, I've got a
new pack of cards.

195
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,879
Yes I brought a new deck as well.

196
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,490
Oh. Well we'll use mine save
opening yours, alright.

197
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,325
- No we'll use mine.
- No, no, let's use mine!

198
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,666
- Del's the host!
- And I'm the guest! So we'll use mine!

199
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:15,684
Why don't you spin for it?

200
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:21,672
Oh yeah yeah, that's a good
idea, Trigger. Alright with you Boycie?

201
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,502
- Yeah, go on then.
- Okay then here you go.

202
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,485
Heads.

203
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,256
I said 'heads'.

204
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:35,754
But you called heads in the
pub!

205
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,531
And I'm calling heads again!

206
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,197
We'll use your pack!

207
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,258
Is that all you've got Del?

208
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:08,128
Er no, no, no, I've got more than that you know, Rodney's
got the rest for me.

209
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:14,449
Oh, yeah, Del, there's the four pounds and thirty-seven
from the empties.

210
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:29,327
Down to you Trigger.

211
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:40,897
Too heavy for me Del Boy. I'm
calling it a night.

212
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:53,363
Looks like it's down to you and me then Del Boy.
Right, your 30, and I'll raise you 30 ...

213
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,893
It's gonna cost you 30 quid
to stay in, Del.

214
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,109
I ain't got 30 quid left
Boycie.

215
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,042
Well what can I say?

216
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:15,091
Alright, hang about, hang
about. Go on, 30 quid and I'll see you.

217
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,594
I have a running flush. Four,
five, six, seven, eight of hearts.

218
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:30,748
Jeeze and I've got three tens!
Cor, stone me.

219
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:32,651
Not good enough then, is it
Del Boy?

220
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:37,525
Well that seems to be the end of the evening. Shame,
really I was just getting into me stride...

221
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,312
Well I'll bid you adieu then.

222
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:45,397
Hang about, Boycie, no, hang about. I ain't finished yet.

223
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,296
He knows more card tricks than
Paul Daniels don't he!

224
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,491
D'you reckon he's been
switching 'em?

225
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:02,427
Course he's switching 'em!
He's done you two up like a couple of kippers.

226
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:13,226
Del, oy where d'you get that from??

227
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:16,368
Buzzby sent it down the line
didn't he?

228
00:20:18,778 --> 00:20:23,544
How come for the last fortnight we've been off Queer
Street and suddenly all them notes materialize?

229
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:29,582
This is the money that Mum left you and me. She said it
was only to be used in a life-or-death situation.

230
00:20:30,288 --> 00:20:34,151
Oh, now come on Del, this ain't a life-or-death
situation, it's a bloody game of poker!

231
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:39,656
No it isn't Rodney. This is not a game - this is a duel!

232
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,674
Alright Boycie I've got 500 quid here that says
that this game ain't over yet.

233
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:54,908
Nice one, Del Boy, I like yer style. I tell you what let's
make this a bit exciting, shall we? No limit!

234
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,380
That suits me Boycie. That suits me right down to the
ground...

235
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,475
Alright dealer takes one...

236
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:08,409
Go on your bid.

237
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,082
A century.

00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,509
100 notes? You're coming it a
bit ain't yer Boycie?

239
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,830
This is a no limit game between me and Del Boy, so
keep yer nose out Trigger!

240
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:33,340
Don't worry, don't worry Trig. He's bluffing,
alright here you are, there's your 100 and I'll raise you 100.

241
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:43,125
Your 100 - and I'll raise you 100.

242
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,488
You're bluffing!

243
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,723
Only one way to find out ain't
there Del Boy.

244
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:58,550
Oh he's bluffing - he's definitely bluffing, I can
tell by his eyes, he's bluffing.

245
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,735
It's gonna cost you another
100 to find out Del.

246
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:11,002
Trust me Rodney trust me, he's
definitely bluffing! I've got him by the short n' curlies!

247

248
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:47,132
Oh no, no, no, no, Del Boy
that's your 200 - and I'll raise you a grand!

249
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:52,769
Knock him out, Del.

250
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:57,808
It's gonna cost you a thousand
notes to see my cards Del.

251
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,388
I'm skint Boycie!

252
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,515
Well you shouldn't play big
boys' games then should you?

253
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,465
Oh play the game son. That's
the money their mum left 'em.

254
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,130
That's all they've got!

255
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:18,924
Well, Del, do something or get
off the pot.

256
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:22,794

00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:05,496
Leave it out will you Del,

00:27:46,025 --> 00:27:49,714
Four aces! Four bloody aces!

302
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,888
Grandad! Sorry! He's got four aces, SEE!

303
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:57,934
I thought Del Boy might have
something up his sleeve!

304
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:03,554
Oh look at all that lovely
money!

305
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,460
- I told you I could do it, didn't I, eh?
- Well done.

306
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,332
Oi Rodney now careful what is
your game?

307
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:13,395
- Well done Del.
- Thanks.

308
00:28:13,699 --> 00:28:15,513
Nicely played.

309
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:18,487
Where d'you get those our
bloody aces from?

310
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:23,701
Same place you got them Kings!
I knew you were cheating Boycie.

311
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,578
Oh yeah, how?

312
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:28,449
'Cos that wasn't the hand I
dealt you!

313
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,174
- Del, let's take him again.
- No, no I don't want to push my luck.

314
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,939
Oh come on you're on a winning streak!

315
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,491
Eh yeah you're right.

316
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:51,998
Oi Boycie. Hang about, hang about, listen
I always like to see a man get a chance

317
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:56,585
to get some of his money back. Right,
tell you what I'm going to do, look, there's 200 quid.

318
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,872
I'll spin you for 200 quid.

319
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,715
No way. I've beaten you on the spin twice.
By the law of averages you've got to win this time.

320
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:12,008
I'll be fair.
Rodney can call for me.

321
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:14,184
Yeah, yeah, I'll call.

322
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:19,476
200? You're on.

323
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,468
Call Rodney.
- Tails.

324
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,858
