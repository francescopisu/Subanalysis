1
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,166
- Can you manage Grandad?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:53,492
Good. Mind your hernia. Yeah, that's not bad
you know - not bad. I reckon we done well there.

3
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:59,796
Yeah, it's alright for you. Waste of money
if you ask me! Come all this way an' all!

4
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:01,907
What do you mean a waste of
money?

5
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:03,916
I mean, look at 'em,
they're beautiful ain't they!

6
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:08,157
Not only are they an exquisite ornament guaranteed to
brighten and adorn any sideboard,

7
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:12,875
but they are also a
revolving musical box!

8
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:18,683
They are china cats that play How Much is that Doggy
in the Window!

9
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:24,291
Well, what d'you want for one pound and
twenty-five pence - 'okla-bleedin'-homa'?

10
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:30,084
Well don't you think it's a bit sick you know
- a cat playing a song about a dog?

11
00:01:32,585 --> 00:01:34,978
No. It means they're unique!

12
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:39,770
It means there was a balls-up at the factory
and they put the wrong chimes in!

13
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:45,096
Yeah, I'll put the wrong
chimes in you in a minute.

14
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,195
Come on. Get this stuff loaded
into the van, right. Get this gear in 'ere.

15
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,342
No, actually, you know he's
got a point there.

16
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:59,222
I bet there is some trader somewhere who's
got lumbered with a gross of revolving dogs

17
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,313
playing The
Siamese Cat Song!

18
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:05,084
Very funny. Come on Grandad,
we want you in here an' all.

19
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:05,992
Right, go on.

20
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,588
- In you go.
- Alright, alright.

21
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:09,806
Jam him in - go on. The door will hold him in.

22
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,139
Don't worry - we're going to earn out of this.

23
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:27,921
No listen. This is not rubbish you know. This is
North Korea's finest porcelain.

24
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:31,870
But our two great cultures have a different
attitude towards animals.

25
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:37,450
We are both a nation of dog lovers –
the only difference is they love to eat 'em!

26
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,844
Come on Rodders, get your
finger out, we've got a long drive home.

27
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,113
Do they really eat 'em?

28
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:59,596
Yeah, would I lie to you? If a North Korean
came to live in London

29
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:02,408
he'd think that Battersea Dog's Home
was a take-away!

30
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:09,288
No, there's nothing they like more than a nice
plate of poodle kebabs.

31
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:15,630
- Oh leave it out will yer!
- Or a bull terrier pie.

32
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:22,307
- Alright Del Boy, that's enough!
- Or sweet 'an sour greyhound.

33
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:29,366
Oi! - one more word out of you and I'm gonna be sick
on your sheepskin, and I mean it!

34
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:44,116
Go on, put yer foot down Rodney. I'm starving! I could
just go a nice Jack Russell and chips.

35
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:46,608
For the last time shut up!

36
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,037
Oi, look, shall we pull over and give her an 'and?

37
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:54,152
Do me a favour, I wanna get
home for the pubs!

38
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:57,535
We just can't leave her stuck
out here in the middle of nowhere, can we!

39
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:01,708
You're a right little angel
you are aren't you, eh? Go on then, pull over!

40
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,601
Good afternoon madam, can I be
of any assistance?

41
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:16,230
Oh that's awfully nice of you.
Do you know anything about cars?

42
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:21,231
Do I know anything about cars?
I used to drive for the John Player Special team.

43
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:23,006
Oh, the Grand Prix circuit?

44
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,273
No, delivering fags round
Lewisham.

45
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:29,531
He's a card ain't he?

46
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:37,431
I'm trying to get to Ridgemere Hall, it's that large estate
about five miles back up the road.

47
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:41,791
Ridgemere Hall. That's that
big mansion what we passed Del!

48
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,314
You in service there?

49
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,556
Certainly not! I live there
- I'm Lady Ridgemere!

50
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:52,172
Lady Ridgemere! Rodney, get the tow rope.

51
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,962
Would you come with me m'lady, I'll get you
home in no time at all.

52
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:03,267
Here we are. Did you go to the
wedding?

53
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:09,826
The wedding? Oh the wedding?
Yes, we did.

54
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:14,518
Yeah, it was a lovely do weren't it? Yeah.
We watched it on our telly - in colour.

55
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:18,579
It's a pity we didn't know you then
'cos we were doing a lovely line in toasters.

56
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:25,872
That would have made a blinding present!
May I? Mind the hole.

57
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:57,205
Right Rodney, undo the tow
rope and give Grandad his scarf back will you.

58
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:02,642
Is everything alright m'lady?

59
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:09,267
No Wallace - everything is not alright! The car broke down
and I was stranded in the middle of nowhere!

60
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,824
Oh, dear - how dreadful for you!

61
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,184
And who are these - 'people'?

62
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:25,020
Oh they towed me home that's all. Now be a good chap
Wallace and do push the car round to the garage.

63
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,661
Oh very well m'lady!

64
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:34,495
Oi - you shouldn't be pushing a car like that at your age!
Keep your knees bent, and your back straight.

65
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:46,249
Did you hear that?

66
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:53,268
And who are these 'people'?
Ponce! Come Del let's go! Here you are Grandad.

67
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,331
Go? What do you mean 'go'?

68
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,258
You don't think I'm leaving here without so much
as a cucumber sandwich and a cup of Earl Grey do yer?

69
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,423
This is fate, Rodney, Unison Oppotunaire.
There's gotta be an earner in it.

70
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:10,286
Oh no, come on Del, most
nobility are brassic nowadays aren't they?

71
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,634
Oh yeah, and where do you think they get them
from then, eh? Out of a Christmas cracker?

72
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:17,836
Yeah, alright, so they've got the money.
But they don't wanna know the likes of us do they?

73
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,462
No, they think we're peasants!

74
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,632
Peasants? What do you mean 'peasants'?
They may think that you two are peasants!

75
00:07:27,484 --> 00:07:29,927
Well come to think that I
think you two are peasants!

76
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,406
But me, I'm one of them that's accepted anywhere –

77
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:41,849
whether it's drinking lager with the market boys down at
Nine Elms, or sipping Pimm's fruit cup at Hendon regatta!

78
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:45,934
Oi up, eyes down for a full
house, it's his lordship!

79
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:53,680
I say. I'm sorry, I'm afraid we're not open
to the public for another three weeks!

80
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:56,118
No, no, your grace, you're
under a misapprehension.

81
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:58,187
We're not members of the general
public!

82
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:01,834
We're friends of your wife –
she's just popped the car round to the garages.

83
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:06,013
Oh, I see! Well, er, in that
case I suppose you'd better come in.

84
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,664
Oh right. Thanks very much
your grace!

85
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:19,285
And, oi, these are very refined people and they do not
wish to hear your joke about the queer magician. Got it?

86
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,761
And don't you go dropping none
in there!

87
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:36,379
Very nice, very nice! They don't make pictures
like that any more do they, eh? No.

88
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,914
'Cos I'm a great fan of the Byzantine period myself.
I don't think you can whack 'em you know...

89
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,566
Now it's a funny thing you know, your Lordship, but Van
Cough happens to be my favourite artist an' all.

90
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:52,510
- It's a Canaletto!
- I beg your pardon Rodney?

91
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,120
It's a Canaletto!!

92
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,134
I know - I know it's a Canaletto.

93
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,416
I was just saying that Van Cough happens to be
one of my favourite artist that's all!

94
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,534
Here, why do you reckon he
chopped his ear off, eh?

95
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:12,298
- Doctor's orders possibly!
- Do you think so!

96
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,525
- Your brandy sir.
- Oh thank you very much.

97
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,216
I'm afraid we have run out of
cream soda!

98
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:21,424
- Oh well, don't worry about it Wallace.
- I shan't sir!

99
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,022
Excuse me sir.

100
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:29,276
Certainly. Gives good measures here don't he.
You ought to watch him. Very nice, very nice.

101
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:35,746
There he is - look at that, lovely.
I didn't know you went to Cambridge though m'lord!

102
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:40,459
- 'Cos I'm an Oxford man meself.
- You were up at Oxford?

103
00:09:40,657 --> 00:09:43,404
No, but he always supports
them in the boat race!

104
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,268
Yeah, thank you Grandad! Thank
you.

105
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,534
You must be in a hurry to get
home Mr Trotter?

106
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,278
Oh no, no, no m'lady...no, no,
no. No, we've got all the time in the world.

107
00:09:52,879 --> 00:10:00,007
All the time in the world. Yeah, I love this
place, beautiful ain't it.

108
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:04,851
Beautiful house. I think I saw a photograph of
it once in the, er, Horse and Hound.

109
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,602
The Horse and Hound! You hunt
Mr Trotter?

110
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:11,359
Oh yes, I hunt, punt and ski
when the snow's firm enough.

111
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:15,371
- How old is it?
- Er, is what - how old is what?

112
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:16,920
The house - is it old?

113
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:20,757
Yes, the original structure
was built in 1642.

114
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:25,126
- Oh! Still you've done it out  nice!
- Thank you.

115
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,294
Is it haunted?

116
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,710
Oi, what you after a part-time
job or something?

117
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,767
No, I'm afraid the one thing
we lack is a resident ghost.

118
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,802
Oh, never mind you've still
got Wallace ain't you.

119
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:38,344
Yes Wallace, what is it?

120
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:41,412
Begging your pardon m'lord.
There's a telephone call for you.

121
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,004
The chandelier people.

122
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:45,907
Ah, and about time too. You
will excuse me, won't you?

123
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,594
Yes, go on. You take yer time
m'lord

124
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:52,891
Oh this is nice. I see that
you like a bit of china and porcelain m'lady.

125
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,434
Yeah, this is very nice - this.
I like this.

126
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:02,883
Now don't tell me -
don't tell me Capo Del Monte?

127
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:07,883
It's mostly Dresden. And that
particular piece is worth several hundred pounds.

128
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:10,948
Is it really? Gawd, get away,
feel the weight of that then Rodney.

129
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:14,868
Yeah, it is ain't it, eh? Yeah, of course that's
where the money is ain't it - in the weight.

130
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:21,353
Oh mon dieu, mon dieu, if you like
a nice piece of fine porcelain

131
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,871
I've got the very thing for you in
the back of the van.

132
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,141
Don't inconvenience yourself
Mr Trotter.

133
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:32,911
No, no, it's no trouble m'lady. No trouble.
I picked it up in this little, er, antique shop in Yeovil.

134
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:36,618
Well it's, um, it's
well circa something or another!

135
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,499
I'll pop out and
fetch one for you shall I?

136
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:43,154
Right keep sprawnsing alright?
Excuse me m'lady.

137
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:55,526
Where do you live? That is
assuming you're not squatting here!

138
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,553
No, er, we live in London. One
of - one of the better parts of London!

139
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,493
Yeah Peckham.

140
00:12:05,301 --> 00:12:12,410
It's, um, Peckham Village actually! It's, er, well like
a little St John's Wood you know, just south of the water.

141
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,807
It's very nice! We've got a
flat in a tower block.

142
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:27,354
Well it's an apartment! In a - in a complex. A tall complex.
Very sophisticated actually. It's got lifts - everything!

143
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:32,314
Yes. Must be quite valuable
with the price of property these days?

144
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:34,303
Oh no, we rent it.

145
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,069
No, we - we lease it! He forgets bless him.

146
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,971
He's got a bit of shrapnel! It's a lease
Grandad - do you remember, a long-term lease!

147
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:51,764
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. We lease it! The council said we could
buy it for eight thousand pounds though!

148
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:53,989
God help us!

149
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,854
Yes, yes, but it must be in
your office somewhere!

150
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,645
All I know is that your people came
down here, examined the chandeliers.

151
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:05,578
That was three weeks ago and I am still
waiting for your estimate!

152
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:11,405
Yes. Well, I suggest you have
another good look...Yes I'll hold on.

153
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:16,379
- Bisque porcelain!
- What?

154
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,820
Demi-glazed! It revolves and plays How Much
is that Doggy in the Window!

155
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,892
You can't go
wrong for a fiver can yer, eh?

156
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:24,454
No, I suppose not.

157
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,814
No. Don't be long, I'll pour
you a drink, alright?

158
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:33,842
Just a minute Potter, er, Trotter
How Much is that Doggy in the Window?

159
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:39,631
Don't know, depends on how much you want to spend.
Little joke, no, no, no, it's the tune ain't it.

160
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,741
How much is that doggy in the window.
The one with the waggly tail.

161
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,831
Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know. I
know. The thing is a cat!

162
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:56,395
Oh well, you're right an' all, it's times
like this that I wish I went to Cambridge!

163
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,828
Tell you what, look, I'll pour
you a drink. Don't be long.

164
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:05,127
Hello? You found it! Good.
Twelve hundred pounds?

165
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:09,911
Are you sure you're looking at the right paperwork?
Yes, two Louis 14th chandeliers - that's right!

166
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:13,390
But how do you arrive at a figure of twelve
hundred pounds?

167
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:17,207
All you've got to do is take the things down,
clean them, do a few minor repairs!

168
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:22,873
Yes I am aware that it is 17th-century French
crystal, I own the damned things!

169
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,931
Yes, I know it's a job for an expert that's why I got
in touch with you!

170
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,298
But I'm sure if I shopped around I - I could find
a lower estimate than that.

171
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,957
Yes I know that it is a dying trade but there
must be someone, somewhere!

172
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,112
Oh, sorry we couldn't stay
longer yer lordship.

173
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,724
That's perfectly alright
Trotter, please don't apologize.

174
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,660
Oh toujours la politesse, toujours.
I mean this is beautiful innit, eh?

175
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:55,728
Bet you've held a few balls in
here m'lady?

176
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:59,308
What? Oh yes, yes we have!

177
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:04,282
We like a nice social gathering ourselves.
Perhaps you'd like to come to the next one, eh Rodney?

178
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:08,178
Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know,
just bring a bottle and an LP or something.

179
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:13,675
Thank you for the 'cat' Mr Trotter. It blends so well
with the rest of my collection.

180
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,132
Specially with the Dresden I thought!

181
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:21,333
Yes! I'm sorry we weren't able to pay you for it.
But neither my husband nor I carry cash.

182
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,796
Oh don't worry, pay me next
time I'm down.

183
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,554
Yes of course. What do you
mean 'next time'?

184
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,197
D'you mean to say you're
coming here again? Whatever for?

185
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:32,303
To pick up that fiver she owes
him!

186
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:38,084
A la mode, a la mode! Please
accept it as a token of my esteem.

187
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:39,488
Thank you!

188
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:45,544
Yes, well, it's getting rather late! I think we –
we better say goodbye, er, Trotter.

189
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:49,958
Trotter, yeah. Well thank you very much for your
hospitality, it's been very nice of you.

190
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:54,001
Now look at that - that's
beautiful innit, eh?

191
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:55,680
Yes. Goodbye.

192
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,732
- French crystal?
- Yes, it is actually!

193
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,449
Yeah, thought it was. You can always tell by the old,
er, cut of the er...droplets!

194
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:06,062
17th century that, ain't it
Grandad?

195
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,369
Yeah, if you like Del!

196
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:13,545
Yeah, I'd say it was one of the Louis's! If it ain't one
of the Louis's, it's very similar, ain't it Rodney?

197
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:16,960
Oh it's a dead ringer Del,
yeah, dead ringer!

198
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:21,478
Yeah, yeah, but is it Louis
the 13th or Louis the 14th?

199
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:24,248
No don't tell me, your Lordship I
can get this.

200
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:27,610
That is Louis the 14th.
Am I right yer lordship?

201
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:30,960
Spot on Trotter! How do you
come to know so much about chandeliers?

202
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,394
How come we know so much about
chandeliers! 

203
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,602
Oh sorry.

204
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,756
Sorry about our amusement there your
lordship!

205
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:49,953
But see asking a Trotter if he knows anything
about chandeliers is like asking Mr Kipling

206
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:52,216
if he knows anything about cakes!

207
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:54,982
This is our
business!

208
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,221
Really?

209
00:16:56,534 --> 00:17:01,175
Oh yeah. Chandelier, candelabra, quality crystal
and what 'ave yer.

210
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,795
It's been the family trade for
generations.

211
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:05,920
Knowledge has
been passed down from father to son.

212
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,326
Our name goes right
back in history don't it Rodney?

213
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:17,126
Yeah, yeah, right the way back
to the plague!

214
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,578
Our forefathers used to make them –

215
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:27,503
did you know there are still four Trotters
hanging in Buckingham Palace?

216
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:30,654
Amazing!

217
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:35,691
No, straight up - 'cos what, with the advent of solar
energy and fluorescent lighting,

218
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,347
there's not much call for it nowadays.

219
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:41,477
In recent years we've tended to
specialize in the old, er, renovation work.

220
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:46,253
Do you mean to say that you could - you could take that
thing down and - and clean and repair it?

221
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,602
Oh yeah, do that blindfold.

222
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:53,363
Anyway we mustn't keep you any later,
so I'm gonna say bonne bouche to you both!

223
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,018
No hurry Trotter, no hurry!

224
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:59,440
I've just remembered I've got a bottle of rather special
port through there in the study.

225
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,666
What say we open it and
- and have a bit of a chat, eh?

226
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,928
Oh well that's very civil of
you my Lord.

227
00:18:08,528 --> 00:18:10,366
Don't be a plonker all your life Rodney!

228
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:16,096
I've done the deal now. It's 350 quid just to take down
and clean a couple of chandeliers.

229
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,976
And do you honestly think he's
gonna pay us?

230
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,515
Of course he's gonna pay us!
He ain't one of your fly-by-night merchants.

231
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:26,785
I mean he's a lord of the realm, he's got
blue blood and - and mottos!

232
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,041
He didn't even pay us for that
cat!

233
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:31,376
Oh shut up about that rotten
cat!

234
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:38,433
Del, you need specialized equipment for a job like this
- refined glass brushes, advanced soldering gear.

235
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:42,674
What we gonna use, eh? Superglue
and a bottle of Windolene knowing you!

236
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,411
Look I'll get the right equipment Rodney,
I know this panel beater and he owes me a favour.

237
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:54,186
Look once we've done this job our name will spread.
All those dukes an' earls they'll be crying out for us.

238
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:58,712
Just imagine it, eh? We'll be the toast
of the county set, eh?

239
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:01,443
Just think of it, all the hounds, you know,

240
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:06,745
baying with excitement, as our steeds bite
on the rein eager for the chase.

241
00:19:08,962 --> 00:19:13,785
Hello Tally ho Sir Herbert. Did you ken John
Peel? Come on boy...

242
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,593
Take a look at him will yer!

243
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,604
He's spent three hours in a stately home
and he thinks he's the Earl of Sandwich!

244
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:23,965
He can't wait to get a shotgun and a retriever
and go marching across the grouse moors

245
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:26,678
all done up like a
ploughman's lunch can he?

246
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:34,046
No, that's right Rodney. I deserve a bit of the good
life, worked hard enough for it,

247
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:39,054
I mean I've always been a
trier. Where's it got me?

248
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:46,204
Nowhere that's where it's got me! We live 'alf a mile up
in the sky in this lego set built by the council.

249
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:50,218
Run a three-wheel van with a bald
tyre.

250
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:54,255
We drink in wine bars where the only thing's got a
vintage is the guvnor's wife!

251
00:19:55,166 --> 00:20:00,463
That's why I want to grab this opportunity with both
hands Rodney. You know, he who dares wins.

252
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,077
This time next year we'll be
millionaires.

253
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:10,026
Do you honestly believe that Del? I mean, do you really
think we can make a success of this?

254
00:20:10,331 --> 00:20:18,207
Of course we can Rodney. The door will be opened to a new
world. It'll be like...like Alex Through the Looking Glass.

255
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:25,221
You will dine at the finest restaurants on –
on steak chasseur and sutee potatoes.

256
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:29,416
Your shoes will be made by Gucci,
your jewellery will come from

257
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:41,348
Aspreys, your clothes will be made by Man at C & A!
What d'you reckon Rodders, eh? What d'you reckon?

258
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:48,448
Man at C & A. Yeah, alright.
I'll give it a whirl.

259
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:50,767
Good boy. You know it makes
sense don’t you?

260
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,233
Oi, but we do a proper job,
right. No bodging!

261
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,888
Of course not, what do you
take me for, eh?

262
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:05,202
- I'll save the best bit for you.
- I'll see you in the morning then.

263
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,637
Yeah see you in the morning.
Night.

264
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:21,072
'No bodging.' I think he lacks
faith in you Del Boy!

265
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:27,269
Always been his trouble innit,
eh? Oi, 'ere, do me a favour will you Grandad.

266
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:31,768
Pop out in the kitchen see if we've got
any Windolene and superglue left, will you?

267
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,215
Righto Grandad, you pop
upstairs and get the floor-boards up!

268
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:55,620
Now you know what
you're doing don't you?

269
00:21:55,766 --> 00:21:58,045
Don't you worry Del, leave it
to me.

270
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:00,816
Oh he's a craftsman!

271
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,387
Oi, Grandad, d'you want a
jemmy!

272
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,916
No I had one before we left.

273
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,326
Why does he have to remove the
floorboards?

274
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:18,933
What is this, the International
Year of the Wally-Brain or something?

275
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:23,485
Listen, my good man, how do you think that
great big heavy chandelier

276
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:25,320
stays up there on that ceiling,
eh?

277
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:29,241
It is not by the power of
prayer or double-sided sticky tape!

278
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,407
There is a long threaded bolt
through that chandelier,

279
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:37,014
it goes through a wooden joist
and is held in position by a locking nut.

280
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:42,514
Now in order to undo the locking nut you must
first lift up the floorboards! Ordre du jour!

281
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:48,406
We learn something new every
day! If you need me I shall be round at the garages.

282
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:52,032
Right. Here, while yer there
give the van a wash, will you.

283
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:57,566
Ah, talking of wally-brains.
Come on. Here - watch that!

284
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:05,479
I mean this is terrific innit. His lordship's nowhere to be
seen and now even the butler's having a moody!

285
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:07,391
D'you reckon
we're gonna get paid?

286
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:13,033
Look, his lordship is away on holiday, he'll pay us when he
gets back! Now come on, get these ladders up.

287
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,020
Yeah, you never know might
be in for a bonus.

288
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh yeah, perhaps he might
bring us back a nice stick of rock each, eh?

289
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:23,306
Well just shut up moaning will
yer! Oi, Grandad how you doing?

290
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:25,930
Alright Del Boy. 

291
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,676
I've found it Del!

292
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:37,499
Here you are. See, he's found the nut. I told you
we could trust him. Right come on get this out.

293
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,177
I've started to undo it.

294
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:43,572
Gordon Bennett, we ain't even
up the ladders yet!

295
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:46,824
Grandad - don't you touch
nuffink till we tell you.

296
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,635
Come on, we'd better get up
there.

297
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:55,828
Alright Rodders? Is there anything you want?

298
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:59,332
Yeah, I wanna go home! This
ladder's none too safe.

299
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:03,825
The ladder's alright. Look
this is the chance I've been waiting for.

300
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,375
Now, don't let me
down Rodders - now don't let me down!

301
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:13,218
Alright Grandad, we're ready!
You can start undoing it now!

302
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,358
It's coming Del Boy! 

303
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:28,411
One more
turn Del!

304
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:33,583
Right. Now brace yourself
Rodney, brace yourself!

305
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,592
Grandad was undoing the other
chandelier!

306
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,477
How can you tell?

307
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,270
Alright Del Boy?

308
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:41,490
Alright? What do you mean
'alright'? Look at it!

309
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,012
Did you drop it Del?

310
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:52,165
Drop it? How could we drop it? We wasn't even holding it!
We were working on that one!

311
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:01,143
Well I wish you'd said something. I was working on
this one! Is it very valuable Del?

312
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:08,589
No, not really! It was bleedin'
priceless when it was hanging up there though!

313
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,630
What's his lordship gonna say
when he finds out?

314
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:19,578
Well, I think I can safely say that my invitation
to the hunt ball has gone for a Burton!

315
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,064
It's broken!

316
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:27,180
Look, what the hell do you
know about chandeliers anyway?

317
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:30,410
I think he's tumbled Del!

318
00:26:30,827 --> 00:26:33,821
I shall telephone his lordship
at his cottage immediately!

319
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:35,589
Yeah, well, tell him to phone
us at home.

320
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:39,206
Oh. by the way, has his lordship got our home
address and telephone number?

321
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,337
No!

322
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:44,008
Good! Right, out of it. Go on.

323
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,362
