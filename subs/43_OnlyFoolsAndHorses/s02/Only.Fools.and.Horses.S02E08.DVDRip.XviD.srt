1
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,511
Eh, he's good ain't he Del Boy?

2
00:01:00,098 --> 00:01:01,901
Yeah, I wish I could say the
same about this chicken!

3
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:04,046
Wassamatter with it, tough?

4
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:09,010
Tough - tough! It's the toughest chicken I've ever
known. It's asked me for a fight in the car park twice!

5
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:12,498
Alright, come on, what's upset you?

6
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:15,117
Me? Nothing! Don't worry about
me Rodney.

7
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:19,132
I'm not worried about you. I'm
worried bout the fiver I spent on this ticket!

8
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:22,393
I thought we'd be enjoying ourselves you know
- what's the matter?

9
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:27,170
Ah, it's just that - I went round to Lennie Morris's
little kid's christening today you know.

10
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,497
There was just this fantastic atmosphere
in his front room.

11
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:34,717
His Mum and Dad were there,
and his wife and his little baby,

12
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:41,068
and I thought you know, he's got his family
round him! He's got a real family!

13
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:44,536
- And what have I got?
- You've got us!

14
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:48,890
Yeah I thought of that - that
is when I left!

15
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:52,542
You know that rich bird what
he's been seeing lately?

16
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:56,219
Her with the nose. Well she's just
given him the old heave-ho!

17
00:01:56,823 --> 00:02:00,326
No? Oh well that explains it
all don't it?

18
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,130
Del had high hopes of selling
some gear to her.

19
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:03,154
What sort of gear?

20
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,907
Well her dad left her a chain
of launderettes in his will right.

21
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:08,968
Del's gone and lumbered
himself with two ton of hooky Persil!

22
00:02:10,361 --> 00:02:14,051
Oi, oi, don't you say nothing
Rodney, he told me in confidence!

23
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,299
No, no of course not!

24
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,036
Right 'ere you are. Come on.
Get some of this gut-rot down your neck.

25
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:21,278
Ah come on Del cheer up, eh?

26
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,293
Tell you what, let's have a family sing-along
like in the old days, eh?

27
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,047
Yeah, alright. Alright come
on then, go on Rodney. Start us off.

28
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:29,747
Yeah right, altogether.

29
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:35,434
'We're gonna hang out the washing
on the Siegfried line, have you any dirty washing...'

30
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:43,703
Oi Enrico! Enrico! Come here a
minute will you.

31
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:44,598
Si Senor?

32
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,528
Listen, do us a favour, will
you. Sing 'Old Shep' for me.

33
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:56,134
We're trying to enjoy ourselves! You can't enjoy
yourself with a song about a dead dog!

34
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,740
Sing 'Old Shep'!

35
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:04,462
Senor. Eet ees no possible to
seenga thee Olda Shep song!

36
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:10,472
Eet ee - er - howa you say - thee trageec song, si?
Eeet makea thee tears falla from the eyes!

37
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,135
Go on sing Old Shep!

38
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:20,685
Look, leave it out will you Del Boy I've got a living to
earn! That's a killer of a song!

39
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,067
Once I've sung that
the evening's finished.

40
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:33,976
Look I'll sing another song for you -
any other song - but no way do I sing Old Shep!

41
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,071
Sing - Old - Shep!

42
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:48,675
Whena la wasa lad, and Olda Shep was a pup...

43
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:30,629
And eefa dogs have a heaven there's one
thing I know, old Shep has a wonderful home.

44
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:38,569
Bravo, bravo Enrico. Di
Stefano my son, di Stefano!

45
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:46,016
That is my most favourite song
about a dog that is you know.

46
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:50,239
Yeah, I mean as songs about
dead dogs go it's a real mind-bender ain't it.

47
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,592
The only trouble is nobody
likes it!

48
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes they do. Yes they do. I liked it!
And that young lady over there, she likes it.

49
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:06,675
Excuse me gentlemen. I think
I've got a cultural encounter coming on!

50
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:12,238
Del, Del. While you're over there ask your cultural
encounter if she's alright for Persil!

51
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:24,650
- Good evening!
- Oh hello!

52
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:26,941
- Do you mind if I park my bot?
- No, please.

53
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:29,014
- A drink?
- No thank you.

54
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:35,476
Well that was - oh sorry - that was a lovely song
that ain't it. Beautiful eh?

55
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:41,175
Always gets me right here that does, yeah.
Always brings back such poignant memories.

56
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,235
Did you have an old dog?

57
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:49,745
Oh, I've had many old dogs in my time.
Er sorry what did you say your name was?

58
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,608
Heather.

59
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:53,076
Heather! Heather, that's a beautiful name,
that is. Heather.

60
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,553
That's one of my most
favourite names that, Heather.

61
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,953
My name is Del, it's er, short for Derek!
Do you know what the word 'Derek' means?

62
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,025
No I don't.

63
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,541
No, nor do I - I'm always
meaning to check it up.

64
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:11,205
I'm very surprised to see a charming young lady
like yourself here on your own.

65
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:15,658
Well I'm supposed to be meeting
someone here – a girlfriend.

66
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,858
But she doesn’t seem to have shown up
so I was just about to leave.

67
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:22,182
Well, I don't blame you. Now he's sung that song,
it's stone-dead in here innit eh?

68
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:24,883
Listen I hope you don't think
I'm being forward or nothing

69
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,912
but I just wondered if you fancied going on
for a drink in a little nightclub that I know.

70
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:32,507
Well I'm not sure. It's
getting home in early hours!

71
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:35,251
Well there's no bother, no. I
can always drop you off! D'you live local?

72
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:36,248
Brixton.

73
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,754
Oh, Brixton - do you really?
Oh that's funny that is.

74
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:43,004
Funny, funny I haven't seen you before because I do a lot
of work down there you know in Rorke's Drift.

75
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:46,594
What line are you in?

76
00:06:47,216 --> 00:06:51,699
Umm...I'm an importer exporter
of quality merchandise 

77
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,400
- antiques, that sort of thing.

78
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:01,198
I tend to specialise in Parisienne haute couture
fashion, you know

79
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:04,788
and special objets d'art,
modern works of art!

80
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:06,593
It sounds fascinating!

81
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,803
Oh yes it is. Oh, it is. I tell you what. If you're
interested.

82
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:16,501
I've got some very cheap washing powder.
No straight up.

83
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:33,724
Sorry about the light. The landlord took the bulb out,
he says he's doing his bit to conserve world energy!

84
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:37,978
That's a rare combination innit?
A rent collector and a Friend of the Earth!

85
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,173
Oh mind the step.

86
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,150
Well this is it! I told you it
wasn't much of a flat didn't I?

87
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:52,349
- Well don't know, could be worse!
- Oh yeah? How?

88
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:54,905
Could have been on the top floor! 

89
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:09,793
Servir Frais Mois Non Glace, 
as they would say in France.

90
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:12,210
True! Very true!

91
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:16,171
I didn't hear you come in!

92
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:19,087
Sorry I'm late love, Del took
me on to a nightclub!

93
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,421
Only being friendly John, you
know what I mean?

94
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:32,684
Oh, Del let me introduce you, this is Brian.

95
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:36,117
Brian lives downstairs, he's my babysitter.

96
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:41,795
Oh! Pleased to meet you Brian.

97
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:49,185
Nice to meet you too. Well um, I won't stop,
I've got some studying to catch up on.

98
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,304
Brian goes away to university
soon.

99
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,559
Oh you're a bit long in the
tooth for that sort of lark ain’t yer?

100
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:57,701
I'm a mature student!

101
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,685
Oh go on? 'Ere my brother went
to university.

102
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,844
Oh really? What was he reading?

103
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:04,646
Gawd knows. Mayfair and Penthouse 
knowing him!

104
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:10,370
Yes! I see, well I really must be going.
See you in the week Heather. Bye for now.

105
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:14,557
Thanks for looking after the place Brian.
I hope he isn’t get on your nerves too much.

106
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:18,531
No, no, no, I've er, I've got
to get used to people like him!

107
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,012
No, I meant the baby!

108
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:27,930
Oh sorry! No, no, no he was as
good as gold! Bye for now.

109
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:29,860
Bye. Mind the step.

110
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:32,788
I didn't know er, didn't know
you had a baby!

111
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,791
Well he's not a baby any more,
he's nearly three-and-a-half.

112
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,357
There's a picture of him on
the mantelpiece.

113
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:41,676
Blimey he's a big lad for his
age ain't he?

114
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:46,580
No that's Vic, my husband!
That's Darren.

115
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:52,454
Cor, he's a little cracker ain't he eh?
Where's your husband these days?

116
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,700
I don't know - and I don't
particularly care!

117
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:00,044
He walked out of here one morning - said
he was popping down the Jon Centre to sign on.

118
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,471
That was eighteen months ago!

119
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,233
Well the way things are he
could still ne queuing!

120
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,793
Do you know, when we got engaged Vic had a straight
choice between going on holiday with his mates,

121
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:15,607
or buying me an engagement ring.

122
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,419
Did he send you a postcard?

123
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:21,061
Like hell he did! Vic looked
after number one!

124
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,600
I don't think he was ever meant to be
married! He couldn't face the responsibility.

125
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:31,289
I used to say to him 'Vic' - I used to say
- 'you've got a baby now Vic.

126
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,691
Isn't it time you sorted
yourself out?'

127
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:41,281
Oh God, I'm sorry Del, there's nothing worse
than having your ear bent by somebody else's problems!

128
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:43,703
I'm just tired.

129
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:48,350
Yeah, well I'd better be off,
I've got an early call in the morning.

130
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,448
I've got to get down to er, got to get down to
Peckham by seven,

131
00:10:53,923 --> 00:11:01,639
pick up a consignment of fire-damaged
woks. Anyway I'll be finished by about ten.

132
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:04,853
I just wondered whether you might fancy going
out for the day somewhere,

133
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,449
you know and a spot of lunch,
something like that.

134
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,377
Yeah I'd love to. I'll - I'll
see if Brian will baby-sit again.

135
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:11,620
No, no, no I meant you know -
you and the boy!

136
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:14,152
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:17,162
Most men don't want to know
when they find you've got a baby.

138
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,657
Yeah well, I'm not like most men Heather.

139
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:33,302
Yeah I'll see you about eleven right, tomorrow?

140
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:35,100
- Yeah alright then.
- Yeah okay then. Yeah.

141
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:36,927
- Bye then.
- Bye then. Tata.

142
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:43,964
Mind that st...

143
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:08,119
That's right come on then Darren kick the ball
to your Uncle Del! 

144
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,216
Good ball - good ball my son. Now let's
see you come out the goal.

145
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:32,882
This way. Good boy. You'll
play for England one of these days.

146
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:37,743
What do you reckon Rodney,
Darren could play for England now couldn't he?

147
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:41,143
He's better than that load of rubbish!
Right come on.

148
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,135
You'll get in the
England side playing like this.

149
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:47,411
Just have a look at him will yer!
He's like a born-again Ovaltinie!

150
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:51,603
I mean he's only known Heather and the kid
for what - six weeks, and look at him!

151
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:54,406
I don't know what's got into him.

152
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:59,060
He spends most of his time on them
climbing frames and swings and what 'ave yer!

153
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:05,081
The other day I seen the caretaker telling him off
for coming down the slide backwards!

154
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:09,665
Coming down backwards!
That's dangerous innit?

155
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,144
I mean all his conkers and marbles could
have fallen out of his pockets!

156
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:23,006
Listen Rodney, what's the joke?

157
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,937
We're just talking about wallies, that's all.

158
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:28,419
Your name cropped up.

159
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:35,965
Not so much of it! Here y'are
Darren.

160
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:40,750
And that's another thing! I
wish he'd get rid of this sign!

161
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:45,944
I mean whenever I'm sitting in the passenger seat
people 'look' at me...sorta funny!

162
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,846
Oh I wouldn't let that bother
you Rodney!

163
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:53,814
No! They most probably just
think you're a poof!

164
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:13,625
You must have spent a third of
your life standing in front of mirrors!

165
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,858
My earliest childhood recollection is of you
standing in front of a mirror!

166
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:28,024
Up until I was four I thought
you was twins!

167
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:35,340
If you're trying to wind me up
Rodney, it ain't gonna work, no way bruv.

168
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:40,208
Because tonight is a very, very happy night
and a very, very special one for me.

169
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:41,849
What is it, Cub's night?

170
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:47,046
No it ain't Cub's night. Well
go on Rodney. How do I look, eh?

171
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,983
You look, like a second-hand
car trader!

172
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:52,428
Oh, thank a lot Rodney. Here,
that remind me.

173
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,428
You know what we were talking about earlier
on, about Heather and Darren coming over for Christmas.

174
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,873
I mean you don't mind do you?
'Cos you like Heather don't  you eh?

175
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:01,165
Don't you Rodney, eh?

176
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,426
Yeah - she's alright!

177
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:07,199
What about you Grandad? You like Darren don't you eh!
He's not a noisy little brat is he?

178
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,169
Oh no, he's a good little kid.

179
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,901
Yeah. 'ere Rodney.

180
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:17,572
How'd you feel about Heather becoming
your sister-in-law?

181
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:18,654
Do what?

182
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,540
No, no, no, not now! Not immediately I mean,
you know, some time in the future!

183
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:25,075
I haven't even mentioned it to her yet –
I mean I don't want to jump me guns.

184
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,700
Well, I'm not fussed.

185
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:31,818
She won't want to come and
live here with that noisy little brat will she?

186
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:41,758
No. No we've applied for a Council house.
Well where's me billy-goat?

187
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:44,335
Oh here it is here. Right. That's it.
Well I'm off out then.

188
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:48,033
I'm taking Heather out for an evening
that she will never forget.

189
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:55,947
You know it's gonna be soft lights, music, champagne,
of course the very, very finest of foods,

190
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:58,371
I only hope she likes curry.

191
00:18:09,495 --> 00:18:19,464
Well! I suppose it was always on the cards!
I think they'll be happy together, don't you?

192
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,632
Oh yeah, she's a good girl -
she'll look after him.

193
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,516
Yeah. And he thinks the world
of that kid don't he, eh?

194
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:33,252
And they fit so neatly into his style of living,
you know fast foods, ready-to-wear suits,

195
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:40,223
and now he's got an instant
family, eh? I'm - I'm pleased for him.

196
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:43,139
You seem to be forgetting
something Rodney.

197
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,821
If Del Boy moves into his Council gaff
with his off-the-peg next of kin,

198
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:52,227
who the hell's gonna pay
the rent, gas and electric in this place, eh?

199
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,914
We'll have a chicken tikka,
off the bone, a mutton Madras,

200
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:10,222
a pair of onion bhajis, four popadoms,
some nan bread and a couple of portions of rice.

201
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,286
Yes sir. Which rice would you like?

202
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,247
Have you got any Uncle Ben's?

203
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:23,950
No sir. We have pilaw rice,
basmati rice or plain white rice.

204
00:19:24,144 --> 00:19:27,234
Oh, we'll have the pilaw rice,
and make sure you take the feathers out first.

205
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:32,670
Oh and Tony, I want a bottle of your
finest champagne, alright son?

206
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:33,995
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.

207
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:38,265
You're pushing the boat out a
bit aren't you?

208
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,257
No, I'm always like this hen
I've got something to celebrate.

209
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,939
Yeah? What are you celebrating?
You sold all those Chinese woks?

210
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,838
No, no. I got a bit lumbered with those actually

211
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:49,559
I'm giving them away with packets of Persil..

212
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,670
So what's the champagne in aid of?

213
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:02,323
Christmas.

214
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,651
What is it?

215
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:05,960
Open it, see.

216
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,393
Del! It's lovely!

217
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,237
I got it off this mate of mine - Abdul.
He gets a discount at Hatton Garden.

218
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,546
Del, this is an engagement ring?

219
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:35,982
No, it's a set of socket spanners!
Of course it's an engagement ring.

220
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:44,291
I'll change it if you like. See, I remembered what you
said - that you liked solitaire diamonds, so I thought...

221
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:46,674
well y'know...that I'd get her a
cluster of solitaires.

222
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,984
No, no it's a beautiful ring
Del.

223
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,385
What's up then?

224
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,538
It's Vic!

225
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:02,561
Oh is your nose blocked up?

226
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:11,677
No, no it's Vic my husband!

227
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:13,780
Oh! Well what about him?

228
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,634
He wrote to me...Last week!

229
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,116
Oh yeah, last week? You didn't
mention it!

230
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:22,522
I know, I've been trying to find the
right moment to bring the subject up.

231
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,973
He's living in Southampton. Got himself a
nice flat apparently.

232
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:32,594
He wants me and Darren to move down
there with him!

233
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,887
You know, try again –
see if we can make it work this time.

234
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:49,105
Oh yeah well - I mean - you're not gonna believe
all that old pony are you! Are you?

235
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:59,247
The thing is Del he is still my husband!
He's Darren's father! I owe it to him!

236
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:01,405
Oh come on, don't give me all
that Heather!

237
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,092
I mean he don't care a monkey's
about you and Darren!

238
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:07,264
I mean what did big brave Vic do
when the going got heavy, eh?

239
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:09,507
He pulled on his hiking boots and had it
away on his toes.

240
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,005
You don't know what he's like
Del!

241
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,091
I do know what he's like 'cos
he's exactly like my old man,

242
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:16,074
that's what he did to me
eighteen years ago!

243
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:22,191
It wasn't all his fault! He was unemployed –
all he wanted was a regular job.

244
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,814
You've no idea what ort of pressure that
can do to a family!

245
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:30,410
Well he's got himself a job now in a
department store.

246
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,230
Oh yeah, doing what?

247
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,325
He's a Father Christmas!

248
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:39,529
Oh, well that's a steady
little number that, innit eh?

249
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:43,656
Free uniform - luncheon
vouchers, forty-eight weeks holiday a year!

250
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:47,963
I still love him!

251
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,272
What about me?

252
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:58,439
I love you Del, but not in that way!

253
00:22:59,157 --> 00:23:01,666
I feel for you the way someone
would feel for a...

254
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:04,209
Goldfish or a gerbil?

255
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:11,186
No! Like a brother! I feel for
you the way you feel for Rodney.

256
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:13,624
And I thought you liked me!

257
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,145
Heather, I thought that you
and I had an understanding!

258
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:23,833
Honestly Del, I never knew you felt that strongly
I mean, you never said anything.

259
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:32,267
I'm not a poet Heather! You
know, I can't do all that lovey-dovey stuff.

260
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:41,165
I feel things but when I try to say
'em they always come out - wallyish!

261
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:48,589
I thought it was obvious the way that I felt
for you. What else could I have done?

262
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:54,042
I don't know, a sign, or something.

263
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:58,133
What like, tie a yellow ribbon
round an old oak tree or something?

264
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:05,543
I leave next Tuesday. Will you
come round and say goodbye to Darren?

265
00:24:13,556 --> 00:24:18,528
He really took to you. You
like kids don't you?

266
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:24,032
Yeah! I used to go to school
with a lot of 'em!

267
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,326
It's a beautiful ring Del.
Thank you.

268
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:37,264
Normally I'd let you keep it -
but I only got it on a week's approval.

269
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:41,973
I don't really feel hungry any more Del.
I think I'll go.

270
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:47,525
That's alright, I'll get a taxi!

271
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:42,911
When I was a lad and Old Shep was a pup,
O'er hills and vales we...

272
