00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:07,046
# Stick a pony in me pocket

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:10,839
# I'll fetch the suitcase from the van

3
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:13,923
# 'Cause if you want the best 'uns

4
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:15,884
# But you don't ask questions

5
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,561
# Then, brother, I'm your man

6
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:22,838
# 'Cause where it all comes from
is a mystery

7
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:26,841
# It's like the changing of the seasons
and the tides of the sea

8
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:30,716
# But here's the one
that's driving me berserk:

9
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:33,640
# Why do only fools and horses work?

10
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,604
# La-la la-la la

11
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:37,598
# La-la la-la la

12
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:41,237
# La-la la-la la
la-la la-la la... #

13
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:46,637
What's up with you, Rodney?

14
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,798
I'm a bit nervous, that's all.

15
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,845
I mean, this bloke we're
gonna see, this Justin.

16
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:55,795
He's not going to ask me
about my private life, is he?

17
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,527
Of course he ain't.
Well, not that private.

18
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:03,397
He won't want to know about you
and Cassandra's little problems.

19
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:06,240
No, no. Good. 'Cause otherwise I...

20
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,916
What problems? Me and Cassandra
haven't got any problems.

21
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:13,123
That's not what you said to me.

22
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:17,201
So there's been one or two minor hiccups

23
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,198
in the bedroom department,

24
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:22,120
but they're personal
and I told you in confidence.

25
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:23,766
All right.

26
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:28,525
I'm not going to be telling him
about your thongs and things.

27
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,797
I won't say what Cassandra wears either.

28
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,556
Sorry to keep you. It's been
a particularly busy morning.

29
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:41,606
I've got all the basic details
about your business career,

30
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:44,565
but I'd like to get an insight
into the real you.

31
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,326
How you started,
how you became so successful,

32
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:53,197
but more importantly, your lives
and your "raison d'etre".

33
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,245
Oh, yeah. "Laboratory Garny."

34
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:05,957
So, in your own words
and in your own time.

35
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,883
Well, where shall I start, Justin?

36
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:15,400
Well, up to a few years ago,

37
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,604
we were just very ordinary people

38
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:23,124
living very ordinary lives.
Weren't we, Rodney?

39
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:41,600
Mmm.

40
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,644
And then, as you know,

41
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:48,483
one day I discovered an historic
and almost priceless artefact.

42
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:51,081
At first we didn't know what to do with it.

43
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,566
That's right.

44
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:56,402
We thought about donating it
to the British Museum.

45
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,797
Yeah. And then we decided to flog it.

46
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,639
So before you know it,

47
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,559
Rodders and me have come into

48
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:07,766
nigh on six and a half million quid.

49
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,807
Well, after we divvied the dosh up -

50
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,437
making sure our Uncle Albert
got a nice little drink.

51
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,763
But we thought of others first.

52
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,556
We donated to charity -

53
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,038
anonymously, of course.

54
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:36,118
So, eventually, we had to start
thinking about our future.

55
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:42,044
So we sought out this City stockbroker
and he advised us

56
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:45,404
to invest in a new and vibrant venture.

57
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,478
The Central American market.

58
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:50,115
It was attracting massive funds.

59
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,755
We were making more money
than the Royal Mint.

60
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,440
But we weren't flash.

61
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,075
Oh, no, no. We weren't flash.

62
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:03,596
When we went away on business,
we took the family with us.

63
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,235
There would be me and Raquel -

64
00:04:06,407 --> 00:04:09,126
my significant other -
and, of course...

65
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,923
- Rodney, Cassandra.
- Cheers.

66
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:18,438
And not forgetting
my young son Damien.

67
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,878
He's a lad, in't he, eh?

68
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,920
# She's into superstition

69
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:32,237
# Black cats and voodoo dolls

70
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,841
# I feel a premonition

71
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,601
# That girl's gonna make me fall

72
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,120
# She's into new sensations

73
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,721
# New kicks and candlelight

74
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:51,481
# She's got a new addiction

75
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:54,161
# For every day and night... #

76
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,883
Oh, Mr Trotter.

77
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,878
It's good to see you again.

78
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,558
Bonnet de douche, Dominique.

79
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,240
Bonnet de douche.

80
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,486
Del, you've got to have a word
with Damien.

81
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:15,162
- People are complaining.
- Oh, no. What's he done now?

82
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,318
He's weed in the swimming pool.

83
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:19,680
Leave it out, Cassandra.

84
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:22,600
All little boys do a Johnny Cash
in the pool.

85
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:26,521
Yes, but not from the top
of the four-metre diving board.

86
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,285
The little git.

87
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,839
# To make you go insane
All right!

88
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,475
# Upside inside out

89
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:45,002
# She's living la vida loca

90
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,000
# She'll push and pull you down

91
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,476
# Living la vida loca... #

92
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:53,566
Well, this is the bizzo, ain't it, Rodders?

93
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,524
It's not too bad, is it?

94
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,042
Old Uncle Albert would love it here, eh?

95
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,404
Yeah. Mind you, bet your life
he's been here before!

96
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:06,926
He's happy down on the coast,
right next door to the sea.

97
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:10,159
And he's living in sin
with old Elsie Partridge -

98
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,124
his "girlfriend".

99
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:15,165
His girlfriend! Do me a favour!

100
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:19,161
I heard she cut the ribbon
on the opening of Stonehenge!

101
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,442
At least we don't get
the Battle of the Baltic every night.

102
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:28,361
- "During the war..."
- "During the war..."

103
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,641
Come on, Rodders. I feel lucky tonight.

104
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,525
Del, I can't, mate.

105
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,997
- What?
- I promised Cassandra.

106
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,886
No gambling, no discos,

107
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,117
no talking to women and no boozing.

108
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:48,476
Yeah. What she meant was not to excess.

109
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:50,924
You're not on probation, are you?

110
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:56,282
I'll treat us to a few bottles
of champagne to get us started.

111
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:00,799
- "During the war..."
- "During the war..."

112
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,606
"I was aboard this battle cruiser..."

113
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:08,443
And then, just as everything
seemed to be going so well...

114
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,723
# Her lips are devil red

115
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,082
# Her skin's the colour mocha

116
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,522
# She will wear you out... #

117
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,439
Something...

118
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,763
something terrible happened.

119
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,962
Chateauneuf du Pape!

120
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:39,038
Negotiations between
the Central American countries

121
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:40,959
had collapsed.

122
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,595
We was wiped out. Nicht a coin.

123
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:47,157
We'd even paid for the hotel
on a credit card -

124
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:50,000
a credit card
which had now been withdrawn.

125
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:54,206
But Derek is, if nothing else,
a very creative businessman,

126
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,325
and he came up with a solution
to our dilemma.

127
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,479
(MUSIC: "LA VIDA LOCA")

128
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,525
Monsieur Trotter! Your bill!

129
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,998
Right. It's time to go.

130
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,838
Follow me, gentlemen.

131
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,922
How long did it take
the news to hit the UK?

132
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:36,079
As long as it took to push
a button on the Internet.

133
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:39,205
Suddenly, all our "business associates"

134
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,085
wouldn't return our calls.

135
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,397
We were in the financial wilderness.

136
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,286
Fortunately, we come
from a strong community,

137
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:49,359
and when our old friends
from Peckham heard the news

138
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,917
they was as gutted as us.
Weren't they?

139
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,564
(SNIGGERING)

140
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:05,080
There's a name that crops up
every now and then.

141
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,238
Michael Fisher.

142
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:11,036
Landlord of a public house -
the Nag's Head, Peckham.

143
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,596
What part did he play in the proceedings?

144
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:16,998
Well, Mike invested
his life savings in our venture.

145
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:18,885
He remortgaged the pub.

146
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,003
Will Mr Fisher give evidence?

147
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,839
No. He's in prison.

148
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,164
He's awaiting trial.

149
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:30,643
The Fraud Squad claims
that he tried to recoup his losses

150
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,798
by embezzling the brewery.

151
00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,916
Never was a man more innocent.

152
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:39,363
I take it Mr Fisher
will be pleading not guilty?

153
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,643
No. He confessed to everything.

154
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:56,439
For Gawd's sake, sit down!
You're wearing the marble out!

155
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:59,997
I can't help it! I've never
been a character witness before.

156
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,919
And you think we have?

157
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,885
I'm worried.
Del's made a terrible mistake.

158
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,281
Of course he's made a terrible mistake.

159
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:10,165
That's why he's in court.

160
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:13,399
No. I mean having you four
as character witnesses.

161
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,206
It's like inviting
the Manson Family to dinner.

162
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:21,519
I saw Del and Rodney earlier.
They seemed confident.

163
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,362
They've arranged to meet Raquel
and Cassandra to celebrate,

164
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,643
so I'd avoid Pizza Hut if I were you!

165
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:33,883
Del was not confident.
He was deeply worried.

166
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,958
He didn't even touch me up.

167
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:41,885
- I've got most to worry about.
- Why?

168
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,278
I'm managing the Nag's Head
till Mike is released.

169
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:47,836
But how exactly do I know
what he got up to?

170
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:51,682
Yeah. How does Sid know Mike
didn't post-date his fiddles

171
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,758
so the police think they're Sid's?

172
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:55,997
There's nothing to be nervous about.

173
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,237
All you've got to do is tell the truth.

174
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,796
Trig, if I go in there and tell the truth,

175
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,356
Del and Rodney will spend
the next five years

176
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:06,485
sharpening Jeffrey Archer's pencils.

177
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,204
What are you going to do, Trig?

178
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,676
I'm gonna tell 'em I hear voices.

179
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:15,922
Trig, you're not on trial,
you're a character witness.

180
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,284
I know, but I hear voices.

181
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:24,716
Oh, Gawd, it's gonna be
one of them days.

182
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:28,718
I notice that your properties
were company owned,

183
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,401
- so you both lost your homes?
- Yes.

184
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,637
I had a lovely place on the river.

185
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:37,356
Well, I had an estate
with peacocks and everything.

186
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:40,881
Anyway, at least we weren't homeless.

187
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,642
Due to my foresight
some years previously,

188
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:48,402
I had bought another property.
So we had somewhere to live.

189
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:52,037
Yeah. It's called our old flat,
Nelson Mandela House!

190
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,280
That just goes to show
how our fortunes altered.

191
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:59,405
- Suddenly, everything changed.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,717
All our good luck turned to bad.

193
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,243
Every day there was more rows,
there was more bad news.

194
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,725
We thought things
couldn't possibly get worse.

195
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,037
Boy, how wrong we were.

196
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,081
(AUDIENCE CHEER)

197
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,480
Good evening.

198
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:24,605
Welcome to the quiz show
everyone is talking about.

199
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,837
This is the fastest game show on TV.

200
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,157
This is Monday, this is Jonathan Ross,

201
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:31,318
and this is Goldrush!

202
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,764
It's no good looking at me
with that Anne Robinson face.

203
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,003
I'll look at you any way I like.

204
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,320
At least I am trying
to do something about it.

205
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:51,523
What exactly are you doing?

206
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,679
- I'm after a stockbroker.
- You've got a stockbroker.

207
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,724
That's the one I'm after!

208
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:00,644
Why didn't he tell me
the market was going to crash?

209
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:03,037
He phoned you at least six times.

210
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,357
He said he had to speak to you urgently,

211
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:07,438
but you were too busy.

212
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:09,438
Well, I was water skiing.

213
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:11,404
You wasted our birthright!

214
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,035
And then Trotter's Independent Traders

215
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,324
hired a helicopter to fly
to Nice to collect magazines.

216
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:18,920
Unbelievable!

217
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,246
That was you!

218
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,246
Oh, yeah.

219
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:27,763
Well, I'm a big man.
I've got broad shoulders.

220
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:31,203
The buck stops here.
I take full responsibility.

221
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,756
Even though it was Rodney's fault.

222
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:36,441
Me?! How the hell was it my fault?

223
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,599
You were the company's
Director of Administration.

224
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:42,281
That meant organising
the Christmas parties.

225
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,962
They were about as exciting
as a Buddhist hen night.

226
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,565
You were the Managing Director,
the Chairman,

227
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,082
the Chief Executive and the President.

228
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:54,726
It's my fault, is it?!

229
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:58,721
Either you or this is
the Chinese Year of the Dodo!

230
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:03,075
Wait a minute. You can't lay
all the blame at Derek's door.

231
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,680
I know it's tempting.

232
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:08,599
Why is it that whenever we've got
something good going,

233
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:12,157
anything that remotely resembles
a future, he nauses it up?

234
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,239
- That's just the way he is.
- Thank you.

235
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:22,804
It's unfair of you to blame Rodney.
He is your brother.

236
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:26,323
Yes, and like a brother,
he's let me down all his life.

237
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:30,320
Is that right?

238
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:34,366
If I'm such a let-down,
why did you insist on having me around?

239
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,278
To keep my promise to Mum.

240
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,044
And you never know when you
might need some bone marrow.

(PHONE RINGS)

242
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,082
Cassandra, answer that phone, please.

243
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,078
Yes, sir. Straight away, sir.

244
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,807
This time next year, we'll be millionaires.

245
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:55,925
This time last week, we were millionaires!

246
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:59,402
Sorry. I can't hear you very well.

247
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:01,478
Go in the kitchen, then!

248
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:04,559
Don't worry. I've worked it
all out. I'm serious.

249
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:09,278
I've worked out a way to make
a hundred thousand pounds.

250
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,484
- Invest that wisely...
- Invest that wisely!

251
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,207
Invest it wisely, and before you know it,

252
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:17,722
you and I can buy a nice little gaff each.

253
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:21,641
All right. Go on, then. What's the plan?

254
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,163
I wasn't going to say anything,
but... OK. You ready?

255
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:30,126
I'm going to apply to go on
that new game show, the Goldrush.

256
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:36,684
Did I say something amusing?

257
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,763
Last night one of the questions was

258
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:43,840
who introduced the potato to England?
You said King Edward!

259
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,997
I didn't hear the question properly.

260
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,959
Look, Del, if you want
to appear on the telly,

261
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,038
try for something more simple.

262
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,960
Like go on Stars in their Eyes
as Barry White!

263
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,804

- It's Elsie Partridge's son.
- What's he want?

265
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:08,080
It's Uncle Albert. I'm sorry.

266
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,080
I'm so sorry.

- Shall I bring the wreath?
- Wait till the hearse arrives.

Hello. I'm Marion. I did
a bit of cleaning for Albert.

274
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,523
Lovely old man.

275
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:15,959

Damien, put it back.

284
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:57,237
I feel bad, you know,
about leaving him here on his own

285
00:17:57,407 --> 00:17:59,318
while we was off globe-trotting.

286
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:01,717
He wasn't on his own.
He was with Elsie.

287
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:05,038
But Elsie was in that rest home
for the last six months.

288
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,163
But he had her family around him.

289
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,397
Yeah. He was having a good time.

290
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,159
Yeah, I know.

291
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,080
It's just I wish we'd taken him with us

292
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:16,841

and other places.

293

more times than a satellite,

never had a passport.

00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,917
Good job Hitler didn't find that out.

298

Hey, Rodney.

The old sod. He only had his own
monogrammed brandy glass.

301
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,363
He loved his cognac, didn't he?

302
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:56,042
"Just to keep the old colds
at bay." Eh? Remember?

- And Damien. My son Damien.

Well, I suppose
we'll all miss him in our way.

312
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,642
Yeah. We're missing him already.

313
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,397
I tell you one thing we won't miss.

314
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,082
All those bloody wartime sagas.
Ooh.

315
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:38,880
Actually, Roland, we used
to love hearing about his past.

316
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:41,402
That's right. Couldn't get enough of it.

317
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,206
Yeah, but he did go on, didn't he?

318
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,676
He never bloody stopped.

319
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:51,526
Yeah. Well, you'd have to blame me
for that one, Roland.

320
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,367
You see, I used to love them stories.

321
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:58,566
I loved them so much that when
he said, "Germany surrendered",

322
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:01,400
I'd say, "Tell us about
when war was declared",

323
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,604
and he'd start all over again
and go right through it.

324
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,122
We'd stay up all night, wouldn't we?

325
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:10,006
More fool you. I used to tell him straight,

326
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,123
"Oi. Knock off the John Wayne stuff.

327
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,801
"You'd think you'd won
the war by yourself!"

328
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,878
Well, in many ways, that's true.

329
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:20,483
Everyone involved was fighting
their own individual war.

330
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:23,404
Yes. And you've got to remember

331
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:27,196
that a lot of blokes lost
their lives for our liberty,

332
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:30,359
so that 50 years later, prats like you

333
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:33,917
would have the freedom
to knock 'em. All right?!

334
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:37,477
- Take it easy, Del.
- Have they got a garden here?

335
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,560
You and I ought to go outside
and have a more detailed chat.

336
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:45,037
- Del, that's enough, mate.
- Go on, Dad. Deck him!

337
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,883
- I didn't mean to upset anyone.
- Calm down.

338
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
- All right.
- The hearse is on its way.

339
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:55,877
I'll go and get the wreath. You just...

340
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,799
All right, Rodney.

341
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:06,283
Have you calmed down?

342
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes, yes, it's all right, sweetheart.

343
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:13,324
I'll tell you another thing.

344
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,559
None of the others have bothered
to turn up, have they?

345
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,957
Boycie, Marlene, Denzil, Trigger.

346
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:22,881
"Don't worry, Del Boy,
we'll be there. Pay our last respects."

347
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:25,038
Well, where are they?

348
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:29,041
You'd think Sid would put in
an appearance. He was in the war.

349
00:21:29,207 --> 00:21:32,517
No. He's in that pub
making too much money.

350
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:36,438
Well, maybe they had problems.
It is a bit of a journey.

351
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:40,282
Good old Mike would have made
more of an effort to get here

352
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:43,439
- and he's in the nick!
- Come on, you, outside.

353
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,199
All right.

354
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:53,641
I'm sorry again. I really
didn't mean to offend anybody.

355
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:56,367
It's OK. Emotions
are running a bit high.

356
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:59,439
I bet Bunny's up there
having a right laugh at us.

357
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,563
I bet he is.

358
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,566
Bunny?

359
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:07,958
- Yeah. Albert.
- Why do you call him Bunny?

360
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:12,040
That's what they called him
in the RAF. His surname was Warren.

361
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:16,117
(ORGAN MUSIC:
TOCCATA AND FUGUE)

362
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,957
Is that a Spitfire, Dad?

363
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,802
We're at the wrong funeral.

364
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:52,325
Yes.

365
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,397
You have my deepest sympathy,

366
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:46,286
but I must bring you back
to the matter in hand.

367
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:48,961
Are there any mitigating circumstances

368
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,197
you'd like me to tell the court?

369
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:56,077
Yes. Remember to tell them
that we were slaves to detail.

370
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,044
- Weren't we?
- Absolutely.

371
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:01,836
We always got our cheques off
to the Inland Revenue on time.

372
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,360
Always.

373
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,358
Be upstanding.

374
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:10,756
The Inland Revenue versus
Trotter's Independent Traders.

375
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:15,159
Fair do's, they bounced,
but they was always on time.

376
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:24,125
I don't believe it.
Where does he get this crap?

377
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,763
I thought they were gonna bang you up.

378
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,804
Well, you was wrong, Rat Boy.

379
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,800
I was exonerated of all responsibility.

380
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,435
- So you both got off?
- Not quite.

381
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:40,844
I'll get you a cup of tea.

382
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:43,475
No. I need something
stronger than tea.

383
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:47,003
- What happened, Dad?
- They declared me bankrupt.

384
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:50,557
- Are you going to prison?
- No! Well, not yet.

385
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,399
Why does he go on about prison?

386
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,206
His mates' dads are doing time.
He feels left out.

387
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:57,278
Damien, go and tidy your room.

388
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,756
- I tidied it already.
- Tidy it again.

389
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,880
So what exactly does it mean?

390
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:10,121
It means that the Inland Revenue
give you a year to pay off your debt.

391
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:13,723
Then they come and take
all your goods - anything of value.

392
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,479
So it won't affect us.

393
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:20,920
We have got something of value.
You're sitting in it. This flat.

394
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:24,124
Our home. They'll steal
the roof from over our heads.

395
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:27,597
You take it from me,
that is not going to happen, Derek.

396
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,758
Have you got an idea, Rodney?

397
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:33,681
It's been on the market for five years
and no one's looked at it!

398
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,600
That's because I had it up for its true value.

399
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,759
They'll auction it for a third of its price.

400
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:41,918
What we gonna do?

401
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:44,158
You could always look for a job.

402
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:49,958
Trigger said they're recruiting
down at his depot.

403
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:53,836
The pay's not too bad.
I know it's road sweeping, but...

404
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,278
She's right, Del.

405
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:00,560
I suppose so.

406
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,002
I'll help you fill in your application.

407
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,166
Me?

408
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:09,478
You can't expect Del to go out
sweeping the roads.

409
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:13,162
Not at his age. I was talking about you.

410
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:15,158
- Me?!
- Oh, come on.

411
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:17,761
Can you see Rodney
pushing a broom around?

412
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,236
It's all right. They give training.

413
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,438
So how much do you actually owe
the taxman?

414
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:28,644
48,750.

415
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:30,604
- Four.
- What?

416
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,725
48,754.

417
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:35,400
- Four.
- Plus interest.

418
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:39,556
Oh, well. I never really liked
this place anyway.

419
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:42,923
Look what you've done now!

420
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,285
You've upset her.

421
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:47,438
What, by adding four quid?

422
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:51,837
No, it was dopey there
talking about interest.

423
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,759
- It's got her worried.
- Oh!

424
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,600
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm having a shower.

425
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,758
Don't use all the hot water.

426
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,597
It's all right, sweetheart, come on.

427
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,758
We'll soon be back on our feet.

428
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:10,717
How? You owe
nearly P49,000 plus interest!

429
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:13,924
It's not a very good start, I must admit.

430
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:18,115
Let me do that. Go on.
You get some plates out.

431
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:20,882
It's gonna be all right. I worked it out.

432
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:24,517
I'm a trader, ain't I?
I've been trading since I was 12.

433
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:27,042
I could sell rice to the Chinese.

434
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:31,482
I'm gonna go back to trading.
I'm gonna work for a local firm.

435
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:33,319
Yeah? Like who?

436
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,603
Trotter's Independent Traders.

437
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,404
What are you talking about?
The firm's been liquidised

438
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,081
or liquidated
or whatever the word is.

439
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:44,522
No, no. The firm can go on trading,

440
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:47,155
but I've been disqualified from running it.

441
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:49,921
That doesn't mean to say
I can't work for it.

442
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,284
All we need is a new managing director.

443
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:55,881
Oh, God. I actually got excited then.

444
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:57,765
Who is going to be stupid enough

445
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,282
to take over Trotter's Independent Traders?

446
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:08,082
Rodders, get it down your neck.

447
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:09,600
Cheers, mate.

448
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:12,406
I don't know what we're going to do, Rodney.

449
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,000
No. Me neither.

450
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,876
Here I am, disqualified
from running me own company.

451
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:21,278
If I take out a loan,
the taxman will nick me

452
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,678
and if I work in cash,
Customs and Excise will nick me.

453
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:28,476
My credit rating is so low,
I can't even pay with money.

454
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:35,319
If only there was some way
in which we could carry on trading.

455
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:38,206
Yeah.

456
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:42,565
It's no use you trying
to cheer me up, Rodney.

457
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm afraid the company's finished. It's gone.

458
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:49,519
Trotter's Independent Traders is no more.

459
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:54,158
It's kaput. It's dead. Dead as the emu.

460
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,118
Well, that's not strictly true.

461
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:02,881
I mean, the company can still operate,

462
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:05,925
it's just that I'm banned from running it.

463
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,519
I know.

464
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:17,004
If only there was someone
who could take over the firm.

465
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,556
Someone young and enthusiastic.

466
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:22,639
Someone full of enthusiasm and ideas.

467
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:25,401
Eh? I wonder who.

468
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:36,723
Young and energetic,
with ideas and enthusiasm.

469
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:42,199
- Hang on a minute.
- You've thought of someone.

470
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:46,281
No. He emigrated, didn't he?

471
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,284
(QUIETLY) "He emigrated,
didn't he?" What a wally.

472
00:29:51,447 --> 00:29:54,757
Honestly, I don't believe him sometimes.

473
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,763
- There might be one person.
- Whom?

474
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:02,446
Me.

475
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,083
You? How do you mean, Rodney?

476
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:12,398
Look, look.
You've been made bankrupt, right,

477
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:17,004
and are therefore not allowed
to run a company, right? I haven't.

478
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,281
No. You got me all confused now.

479
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,920
Let me explain in simple terms, right?

480
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:29,602
Legally, there is nothing to stop me

481
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,759
taking over Trotter's Independent Traders.

482
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:35,839
Let me see if I've got this right.

483
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:39,397
What you're saying
is that you could run the firm.

484
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:41,319
By George, I think he's got it!

485
00:30:41,487 --> 00:30:43,762
That is a brilliant idea, Rodney!

486
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:47,124
"Argent compatant"
as they say in Cannes!

487
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:50,518
Tell you what we'll do.
We'll see our lawyer tomorrow,

488
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:54,566
go to Companies House and make
you the new Managing Director.

489
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,480
Rodney Trotter.
Hey, Raquel, guess what?

490
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,639
Rodney has had a brilliant idea
to save the family.

491
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:03,116
He's going to be the Managing Director

492
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,243
of Trotter's Independent Traders.

493
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:09,446
I'll just be in charge of sales,
purchasing and finance.

494
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:12,997
Congratulations. I'm surprised
you didn't think of that, Del.

495
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,044
That's just what I was thinking.

496
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,686
(SCREAMING)

497
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:20,562
Damien, get away from that keyhole!

498
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:26,805
He's a lad, in't he?

499
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,082
The world's full of surprises, innit?

500
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:36,000
Look at that. Mickey Pearce
has learnt to read.

501
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:41,446
"Trotter's Independent Traders
now under new management.

502
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:44,360
"Managing Director, Rodney Trotter."

503
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,916
You seen this? Rodney Trotter's
a managing director.

504
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:52,124
Yeah. And Cliff Richard's
on 40 Silk Cut a day.

505
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:55,440
No, it's true. Look.

506
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,120
"Consultancy and party planning."

507
00:31:59,287 --> 00:32:02,597
Remember their last do?
Depressing, weren't it?

508
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:04,200
Albert's funeral?

509
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:06,835
No. I'm talking about Rodney's wedding.

510
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:12,036
I'm gonna give him a call. Wind him up.

511
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,357
Leave him alone. He's doing his best.

512
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:18,600
They've had a setback, losing
their money and being bankrupt.

Very nice.

I don't believe you did that.

We're not even going out with you.

531
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:22,405
- Why not?
- We're going out on our own.

Yeah, well.

I'm taking her out to a club.

538

First thing we did when we met was dance,

539
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:45,361

No. Take her out to dinner.

There's a nice new place opened
down Jomo Kenyatta Grove.

542

- She'll love it.
- No. You don't understand.

of the mating ritual, innit?

Yeah, I know... if you are a good dancer.

- I am a good dancer.
- You're not a good dancer.

in that disco in Monte Carlo.

Not that sort of magazine.

641
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:40,005
You end up making comparisons.

No. It is a man's magazine,
but not that sort. It's serious.

He's developed this
psychological healing process.

645
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:58,206
I'd like us to try it, Cass.
You never know, do you?

646
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:01,882
- So who is he?
- He's American. West Coast.

647
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:06,040
He reckons that most couples' troubles
stem from bygone days.

648
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:09,882
- Things in the past.
- Like your childish behaviour?

649
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,480
Yeah, that...

650
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:17,246
That sort of thing, yeah.
He calls that "memory baggage".

651
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:20,319
And how do we unload
this memory baggage?

652
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,478
We become different people.

653
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,638
- Different people?
- Yeah.

654
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:27,401
We don't have to go to a plastic surgeon.

655
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,797
It's simply "remembering to forget".

656
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:34,006
To forget who you were and become reborn.

657
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,681
His clinic's called Fantasy Therapy.

658
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:39,919
Wait a minute.
Does this involve dressing up?

659
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:42,123
Of course not!

660
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:47,077
It's based on a theory known
as "iconoclastic auto-suggestion".

661
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:48,600
Sorry?

662
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,679
It's "the subconscious rejecting reality"...

663
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:55,799
and something else.

664
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,040
Basically, each person
writes down their fantasy figure

665
00:42:00,207 --> 00:42:03,802
and then the other person,
for a while, becomes that figure.

666
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:06,879
- And there's no dressing up?
- Absolutely not.

667
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:09,845
It's all up here.
See, we suspend reality

668
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:13,317
and then we create our own
little make-believe world.

669
00:42:14,647 --> 00:42:18,765
What do you think, Cass?
Are you willing to give it a try?

670
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:22,520
All right.

671
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:24,720
Yeah?

672
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:28,800
Well, that's good. That's very healthy.

673
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:32,164
- It does involve dressing up.
- Yes.

674
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:36,681
OK. Let's go for it.

675

There's a pen.

677
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:49,083
You write down yours, OK?
And I'll write down mine.

678
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:09,125
- I never watch The Bill.
- I've got it on tape... probably.

679
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:14,086
Your turn.

680
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:21,557

- Oh, yeah!

00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:24,606
A little bit.

682
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:27,600
Bloody hell, Cass.
How am I supposed to be him?

683
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:30,636
I don't know and I don't care.

684
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:35,085
To hell with putting clothes on,
let's go home and take some off.

685
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:39,961
Yeah. Yeah, right. Bill, please.

686
00:43:42,807 --> 00:43:44,638
Hurry it up.

687
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:01,843
- I thought you'd be in bed.
- We're just going. Goodnight.

688
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:05,158
Goodnight. Never guess
who phoned for you earlier.

689
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:06,726
Richard Branston.

690
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:08,606
Really?

691
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:11,884
Of course not. I'm gonna kill
that Mickey Pearce.

692
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:15,722
- Oh, well. See you, then.
- See you.

693
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:19,118
- I couldn't sleep.
- No? Oh, well, 'night.

694
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:22,199
Night-night. I was lying in bed there,

695
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,325
thinking about all the family.

696
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:28,604
You know, about Mum and Uncle Albert.

697
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:32,996
Yeah. Well... 'Night, then.

698
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,359
Look at that old bed.

699
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:48,156
If that bed could speak
it could tell some tales.

700
00:44:48,807 --> 00:44:52,766
Yeah. Old Granddad
had his first fit in that bed.

701
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,483
Then there was Uncle Albert.

702
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:02,356
Uncle Albert slept in that for years.
Do you remember him?

703
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:04,961
Snoring, tossing and turning...

704
00:45:05,967 --> 00:45:08,925
scratching his old beard.

705
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,757
A lot of history in that bed.

706
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,804
Yeah. Anyway, goodnight.

707
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:20,485
Try and imagine what it's like.

708
00:45:20,647 --> 00:45:23,844
We're lying in bed and all we
can hear is you watching telly.

709
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:25,918
It's not just you.

710
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:29,557
It's Raquel and Damien
and all his friends, and Trigger,

711
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,606
and anyone else who comes round
any time of the day or night.

712
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,758
The flat's overcrowded, Del.

713
00:45:35,927 --> 00:45:38,361
The flat's always been overcrowded.

714
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:43,319
The council said it was
designed to be overcrowded.

715
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:46,243
Cassie and I can't help thinking

716
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:49,683
that if we can hear you, you can hear us.

717
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,397
Never hear a sound from your room.

718
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:55,725
Exactly!

719
00:45:55,887 --> 00:46:00,005
While we're at it,
this ain't gonna solve anything.

720
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:04,240
I know, I know. I just get
so wound up sometimes, I just...

721
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:06,885
It's water.

722
00:46:08,047 --> 00:46:10,686
I know that.
You should have a proper drink.

723
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:12,920
No, no.

724
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:17,080
Years ago, I may have given in
to that temptation, but not now.

725
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:20,876
I'm a different bloke now.
Much stronger. I've got more...

726
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:25,836
- Go on, a small one.
- You know it makes sense.

727
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:28,999
Oi, darling.
A couple of scotches, please.

728
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,117
So how can I help?

729
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:35,437
Go out! All of you.

730
00:46:35,607 --> 00:46:38,280
Just leave me and Cass on our own for once.

731
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:41,676
Rodney, this must be your lucky day.

732
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:45,806
I wasn't gonna say nothing yet,
it's a bit of a secret...

733
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:51,596
but I'm taking Damien and Raquel
out next Thursday.

734
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:53,805
Really?

735
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:56,805
You'll have the whole
evening to yourselves.

736
00:46:58,087 --> 00:47:00,396
Cheers, Del. You are a diamond.

737
00:47:02,927 --> 00:47:05,999
- At least give us a clue.
- I'll say that this is a night

738
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:10,080
that you will never forget.
I'm not saying anything more.

739
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:13,557
Just sit back in comfort
and enjoy the evening.

740
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:16,116
Oh, yeah. What did Monkey Harris say?

741
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:19,165
- How do you mean?
- What do you mean?

742
00:47:19,327 --> 00:47:21,636
I asked you to phone Monkey and say yes.

743
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:26,835
I forgot, Del. Sorry. What with
getting ready. Was it important?

744
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:31,159
Was it important? Hang on, driver.
'Course it was important.

745
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:35,002
He's had a consignment
of electronic personal organisers

746
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,158
and they're selling like crazy.

747
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:40,956
He's got another 200 and I want
my name on them before tomorrow

748
00:47:41,127 --> 00:47:43,118
or they'll all be gone.

749
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:46,085
Raquel, you've really
let me down on this one.

You dis you man, woman.
You can't do simple ting.

Monkey? Listen, I've got to hang up.

- Oh, God, it's you, Cassandra!

I thought you was a real policewoman.

759
00:50:16,887 --> 00:50:19,242
You nearly gave me a connery!

00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:22,046
- You said you was going out.
- I went out.

- What are you doing?
- I've come back.

- Why are you dressed like that?
- Like what?

763
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,284
Like a couple of wallies.

764
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:41,005
What, like this?
Oh, don't be naive, Derek.

765

Well, whoever you're supposed
to be, darling, you look very nice.

Yeah. It is a bit early. That's 'cause um...

I know you want to go out,
but I just remembered something.

I don't want to spoil your fun,

would you mind if you didn't go?

- No trouble at all.
- Anything for you, Del.

Oh, right. Good.

a very, very important phone call.

I want you to answer it.
You're not going out, are you?

Absolutely not. We'll go

Wow. And she's only three.
That's impressive.

850
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,644
Come on, this is class!

851
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:21,122
Finally, Derek Trotter from Peckham.

852
00:56:23,007 --> 00:56:24,360
Derek is a businessman

853
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:27,246
who lives with Raquel,
his significant other.

854
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:32,236
He has an eleven-year-old son, Damien,

855
00:56:32,407 --> 00:56:35,524
and his pastimes include
fine wines, the theatre,

856
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:38,645
and 16th-century Italian Renaissance art.

857
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,763
They're our contestants!

858
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:47,641
(INAUDIBLE)

859
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,723
As always, we start with the timed round.

860
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:54,845
Let's see who's got the fastest finger.

861
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:57,840
(CASSANDRA) Oooh, Rodney!

862
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:04,403
Whose diary recorded the Plague
and the Great Fire of London?

863
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:06,637
(BUZZER)
Mrs Dale's.

864
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:12,965
Nice try, Del, but I'm afraid that's not right.

865
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:15,436
You're frozen at the back of the queue.

866
00:57:15,607 --> 00:57:19,395
- Janice?
- Is it Bridget Jones, Jonathan?

867
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:24,199
Again, so close, Janice, but so very far.

868
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,597
You go to the back. Del, you move up.

869
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:30,123
Mike, get this right and you're
first on the Rainbow Road.

870
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:32,039
What's at the end of the rainbow?

871
00:57:32,207 --> 00:57:34,118
A pot of gold!

872
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:41,319
I think I know it, Jonathan.
It's Adrian Mole.

873
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:46,003
Oh, bad luck, Mike.

874
00:57:46,167 --> 00:57:48,635
It was Samuel Pepys.
You go to the back now,

875
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:50,923
everyone else moves forward one,

876
00:57:51,087 --> 00:57:54,523
which means Derek is the first
on the Rainbow Road.

877
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,120
Del, come and join me.

878
00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:05,160
First things first, Del. Here's your pound.

879
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:08,205
That's yours, and welcome to the BBC!

880
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:11,558
Just make sure it ain't Irish.

881
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:15,286
The rules are simple, which is just as well.

882
00:58:15,447 --> 00:58:17,324
You'll get a series of questions,

883
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:20,365
each having three possible answers.

884
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:24,520
Each correct answer moves you
to another colour of the rainbow

885
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:28,600
and the prize money increases,
right up to the gold question,

886
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:31,839
which is worth P100,000.

887
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:33,965
Lovely jubbly!

888
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:38,040
You also have a number of options
to help you on your way.

889
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,563
You have a Shot in the Dark,
you have an SOS,

890
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,319
or you can Drop One.

891
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:48,516
This is class! Where do we get them?

892
00:58:48,687 --> 00:58:51,804
But Janice and Mike
can play their Aces at any time

893
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:53,798
and challenge you.

894
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:57,243
So, if you're ready, let's play Goldrush!

895
00:59:04,727 --> 00:59:09,278
You have 20 seconds. Which is
the highest mountain in Africa?

896
00:59:09,447 --> 00:59:11,358
Kilimanjaro or Fuji?

897
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:14,041
It's Kilimanjaro. Any idiot knows that.

898
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:15,879
Well, I didn't.

899
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:21,159
Anybody coming back from Ibiza
with a duty-free brain cell

900
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:23,318
knows it's Kilimanjaro.

901
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:25,876
But this is Derek Trotter.

902
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:28,443
I'm going to go with...

903
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:30,885
Kilimanjaro.

904
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:33,003
Derek, that's the right answer!

905
00:59:38,127 --> 00:59:42,598
I thought it was because Fuji
make cameras, don't they?

906
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,044
Well done. Now, let's move up
to the next colour

907
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:49,926
and take a look at the P2,000 question.

908
00:59:50,447 --> 00:59:54,076
Del, you're doing really well.
Janice challenged you wrongly.

909
00:59:54,247 --> 00:59:57,557
She has doubled your money
to P10,000.

910
01:00:01,887 --> 01:00:05,960
The next question, the green
question, is worth P25,000.

911
01:00:06,127 --> 01:00:09,244
You've still got your
Shot in the Dark and SOS.

912
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:11,125
Let's look at the question.

913
01:00:11,287 --> 01:00:13,482
In which state was President Kennedy

914
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:16,036
when he was assassinated in 1963?

915
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:18,960
Well, he was in a terrible state. He died.

916
01:00:23,447 --> 01:00:26,917
You were a bit quick there.
Let me give you the answers.

917
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:30,796
Was it Texas, was it Florida,
or was it California?

918
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:36,445
Sorry, Jonathan, no.

919
01:00:36,607 --> 01:00:39,644
I'm gonna have to use
the Shot in the Dark on this.

920
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,126
OK.

921
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:43,562
I'll go for um...

922
01:00:44,847 --> 01:00:46,326
Florida.

923
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:48,079
No!

924
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:49,885
(TRIGGER) No.

925
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,402
I'm afraid Florida is wrong.

926
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,718
It was Texas. But you played
your Shot in the Dark,

927
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:59,118
which means you lose the money
and you're frozen.

928
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:01,084
Here's the penalty question.

929
01:01:01,247 --> 01:01:05,559
How many wheels
does a Reliant Robin have?

930
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,719
This question is worth P50,000.

931
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:17,355
If Derek is correct, these lights turn gold

932
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:19,961
and he'll be answering
the P100,000 question.

933
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:22,595
For P50,000, here it is.

934
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:26,123
Which classical guitarist wrote the opera,

935
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:31,486
The Child and the Enchantment?
Ravel, Segovia, or Rodrigo?

936
01:01:32,847 --> 01:01:34,803
I think I know this one.

937
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:37,725
I think it's...

938
01:01:37,887 --> 01:01:39,684
Ravel...

939
01:01:41,047 --> 01:01:44,517
Or, I keep thinking, it could be...

940
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:48,127
Could it be Segovia?

941
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:52,440
Then again, it might be...

942
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:54,526
Rodrigo?

943
01:01:54,687 --> 01:01:57,247
Well, it's definitely one of those three.

944
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:03,166
In that case, Jonathan,
I'll have to use me old SOS.

945
01:02:03,327 --> 01:02:05,966
Who would you like to be
your saviour tonight?

946
01:02:06,127 --> 01:02:09,358
- My brother Rodney.
- And where is Rodney now?

947
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:13,076
He's at home, taking care
of a bit of business.

948
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,636
(ECSTATIC MOANING)

949
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,604
(PHONE RINGS)

950
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,325
(RODNEY) No! No!

951
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:22,399
(CASSANDRA) Del said he was
expecting an important call.

952
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:24,478
(RODNEY) Oh, bloody hell!

953
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:32,520
- Hello!
- Hello. Is that Rodney?

954
01:02:32,687 --> 01:02:34,006
Yes.

955
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,601
This is Jonathan Ross from Goldrush.

956
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:39,281
Piss off, Mickey!
You're getting on my tits!

957
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:50,322
Mickey pretending to be Jonathan Ross.

958
01:02:50,487 --> 01:02:52,364
Rodney, we need your help.

959
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:54,798
Roddy.

960
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:58,078
It IS Jonathan Ross.

961
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,758
Oh, my God.

962
01:03:02,767 --> 01:03:05,600
Hi, Jonathan. How are you?

963
01:03:05,847 --> 01:03:08,680
I'm just fine, thanks.
I've got Derek here.

964
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:12,476
- He's on P25,000.
- You're kidding?

965
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:17,038
I'm serious. He's got a problem
with the P50,000 question

966
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:19,402
and he's chosen you as his saviour.

967
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:22,286
Listen carefully.
You get 20 seconds to answer.

968
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:24,165
Listen, Rodney...

969
01:03:24,327 --> 01:03:26,636
Hold on. What's in this for me?

970
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:30,156
I'll make sure you get a drink.

971
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:36,720
Which classical guitarist wrote
the opera,

972
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:39,481
The Child and the Enchantment?

973
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:42,480
Was it Ravel,

974
01:03:42,647 --> 01:03:45,161
Segovia or Rodrigo?

975
01:03:46,367 --> 01:03:47,686
Ravel.

976
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:51,283
- How sure are you?
- One hundred per cent, Derek.

977
01:03:51,447 --> 01:03:52,800
Good boy.

978
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:56,284
Take it away, Del!

979
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:58,358
I know my classics.

980
01:03:58,887 --> 01:04:03,039
Yeah. I'll go with that.
It's Ravel, Jonathan.

981
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:05,926
You don't have to take
his answer, you know.

982
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:09,682
I know, but he knows what
he's talking about. It's Ravel.

983
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:12,042
- You can change your mind.
- No.

984
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:13,526
Derek...

985
01:04:14,487 --> 01:04:16,682
that was the wrong answer.

986
01:04:22,927 --> 01:04:24,838
It was Segovia.

987
01:04:26,247 --> 01:04:29,922
No, no. Rodney said it was Ravel.

988
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:32,760
I know he did, but he was wrong.
Bad luck, Del.

989
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:34,997
He's got two GCEs!

990
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:39,801
Derek, you've used up all your options.

991
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:43,960
You've lost all your money.
You're frozen out of the game.

992
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:46,595
Janice, join me on the Rainbow Road.

993
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:02,559
I was certain.

994
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,957
- I was so certain it was Ravel.
- You did your best.

995
01:05:07,127 --> 01:05:10,881
Yeah. Yeah, I did,
and Del was OK, wasn't he?

996
01:05:11,047 --> 01:05:14,244
Yeah. Till he kicked the podium over.

997
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,875
No, no. I think that was just an accident.

998
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:21,438
No. He kicked it, it fell over.
Jonathan Ross had to pick it up.

999

01:05:28,247 --> 01:05:31,478
- All right?
- Yeah. You?

1001
01:05:32,647 --> 01:05:35,036
- Where's Del?
- I haven't a clue, Rodney.

1002
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:37,357
At the end of the show, he disappeared.

1003
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:40,644
He went off and abandoned
his child and his wi...

1004
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:43,079
his significant other...

1005
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:46,125
in an area of London
we've never been in before.

1006
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:47,800
Thank Christ.

1007
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:50,879
Thankfully,
the studio paid for a cab home.

1008
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:54,275
- I'm gonna make a coffee.
- Raquel...

01:05:54,447 --> 01:05:56,722
Don't. We're friends.

1010
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,877
I don't know why my dad
didn't use Trigger as his SOS.

1011
01:06:02,047 --> 01:06:03,878
Trigger wouldn't have a clue!

1012

What the hell happened to you?

1015
01:06:17,847 --> 01:06:19,644
I went out.

1016
01:06:19,807 --> 01:06:22,526
Oh, good. Long as I know.

1017
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:31,406
All right?

1018
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:34,206
How's your evening been, Rodney?

1019
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:37,397
Not very good, to be honest.

1020
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:41,606
No? Well, bloody snap! You Moby.

I'm sorry. I could have sworn
it was Ravel.

1022
01:06:45,807 --> 01:06:47,923
- So could Cassandra.
- Yes, I could.

1023
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,521
You're both a pair of dipsticks, then!

1024
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:54,726
You... You're never going
to borrow my Capri ever again.

1025
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:57,003
Well, that bone marrow, forget it.

1026
01:07:01,287 --> 01:07:06,202
I mean to say, I mean everyone
knows that Ravel makes shoes.

1027
01:07:09,287 --> 01:07:12,120
- What?
- Shoes?

1028
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:15,836
Shoes. It was a trick question
and you fell for it.

1029
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:17,679
Oh, right.

1030
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,678
Yes. Sorry.

1031
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,001
Still, at least you won a pound.

1032
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:26,364
That wasn't even enough
for a bus fare home!

1033
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:31,806
Anyway, I went to a club
after the show to drown my sorrows.

1034
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,844
I was in this club

1035
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:36,396
and I was talking to this lap...

1036
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:40,719
lap... lap... laptop salesman.

1037
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:45,563
Even he said it wasn't Ravel.
Would you like a drink, darling?

1038
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:47,445
- No.
- OK. Fine.

1039
01:07:47,607 --> 01:07:52,317
Look what you've done.
You've upset her. You stay here.

1040
01:07:56,847 --> 01:07:59,042
You know, for the rest of my life,

1041
01:07:59,207 --> 01:08:02,279
getting that question wrong
in front of my family,

1042
01:08:02,447 --> 01:08:05,996
my friends... well,
the entire British nation,

1043
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:09,716
will be the most embarrassing
thing that's ever happened.

1044
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:12,162
- Russell Crowe?
- Yeah!

1045
01:08:15,327 --> 01:08:16,999
Or maybe not.

1046
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:19,158
(PHONE RINGS)

1047
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:22,920
Hello.

1048
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:26,997
Yes. Can I ask
who's calling, please?

1049
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:32,437
Del, it's the producer
of Goldrush. He wants you.

1050
01:08:32,607 --> 01:08:35,883
What's he want?
I bet it's about that podium.

1051
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:39,801
I bet someone's damaged it.
All right. I'll speak to him.

1052
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:44,683
Hello. Yes. This is Derek Trotter.

1053
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:47,240
What?

1054
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:50,726
No? No.

1055
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,283
He says there's been a mistake.
It was Ravel.

1056
01:08:55,447 --> 01:08:57,802
No? I knew I was right. Yeah.

1057
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,243
He says I can take the P50,000
and go back on the show.

1058
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:03,238
Yes!

1059
01:09:04,447 --> 01:09:08,201
Oh, have a day off, will ya, you lot!

1060
01:09:10,287 --> 01:09:12,278
Who do you think this is?

1061
01:09:12,447 --> 01:09:14,915
You can hear the jukebox in the pub.

1062
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:17,521
Bloody Mickey Pearce. I'll murder him.

1063
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:20,520
No. Get to the back
of the queue. Sshh.

1064
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:23,485
I tell you what we would like you to do.

1065
01:09:23,647 --> 01:09:26,400
Give all the money to charity.

1066
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:29,206
And if you phone here once again,

1067
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:32,439
I'm going to come and kick
your arse into shredded duck.

1068
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,040
Goodbye.

1069
01:09:37,447 --> 01:09:41,998
Jonathan, he said give
the 50 grand to charity.

1070
01:09:42,927 --> 01:09:45,077
Wow, what a nice guy.

1071
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:50,916
Who do people think we are, eh?

1072
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,396
We're the Trotters, and we're back!

1073
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:55,205
Yes!

1074
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:01,918
# We've got some half-price cracked ice

1075
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:03,486

# Ball games, gold chains,

1078
01:10:09,607 --> 01:10:12,519
