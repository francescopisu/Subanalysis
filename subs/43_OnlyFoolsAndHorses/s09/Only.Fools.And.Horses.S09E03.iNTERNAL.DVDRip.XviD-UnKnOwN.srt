1
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:53,282
You'd better get ready for school, Damien.

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,621
- I am ready.
- Oh, right.

3
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,504
- All right, Dad?
- Ooh.

4
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:05,127
- Was that a contraction?
- No. Indigestion.

5
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:08,043
It was that bacon burger I had for breakfast.

6
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,922
You never used to eat bacon or burgers.

7
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:16,225
I'm craving bacon now.
Bacon and Rolos - together.

8
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,931
When I was having Damien,
I had a craving for tuna.

9
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:22,485
Tuna for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

10
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:27,161
It was horrible. Saying goodnight to her
was like kissing Japan.

11
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:32,670
- Shut up!
- How's it gonna be when I go into labour?

12
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:35,294
Some women just sail through.

13
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:39,211
I remember when Mum
was giving birth to Rodney,

14
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:43,598
she said it was the worst experience of her life.

15
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:46,751
That doesn't mean
Cassandra will have a bad time.

16
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,790
No... I see what you mean. No.

17
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:54,889
- You should have a nice easy birth.
- Why?

18
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,485
Well, look at you. You and Rodney
are both very skin... slim, aren't you?

19
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:06,310
So the chances of you having
a very skinny... slimmy baby are very high.

20
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:08,538
You won't have to push so hard.

21
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,294
Your little sprog will come shooting out like that.

22
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:15,727
- Del, please!
- Sometimes you overstep the mark.

23
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:20,999
No. Cassandra won't need a midwife
in the delivery room.

24
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:24,506
What she will need is a goalkeeper.
"Here it comes!"

25
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,450
- Come on. You'll be late.
- Ready for school, son?

26
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:35,474
- Sunglasses, Walkman, mobile phone?
- Yeah. Don't fuzz me, man.

27
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:39,866
- Off you go.
- I think I'll have a lie-down.

28
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,338
Up we get.

29
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:50,290
I don't know if Cassandra feels up to it,

30
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,990
but she was planning to spend the day
at her parents' house.

31
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:58,985
- I thought I might go with her.
- Yeah. We'll meet you down the pub later.

32
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:03,576
I'll get a bacon sandwich and a packet
of Werther's Original for Cassandra.

33
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:07,120
- Do you think she's all right?
- She's fine.

34
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,670
She's had buckets of pork and toffee.
She's bound to feel a bit gippy.

35
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:16,503
Yeah, you're right. We'd better do something.

36
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:21,684
- I thought we'd go down Ronnie Nelson's...
- No, not today, Rodney.

37
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:26,283
- Del, Rodney is the managing director.
- Yes. I'm in charge.

38
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:29,793
I know. I'm going to put some flowers
on Mum's grave.

39
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:32,828
- I'll come with you.
- No.

40
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,657
Stay here and look after Cassandra.

41
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:39,965
Yeah. If she feels better,
I'll go down Ronnie's place.

42
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,483
No. If she bucks up,

43
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:48,708
take her and Raquel over to her mum's
and stay with them in case of car-jacking.

44
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:52,573
On your Capri Ghia? Yeah, right.

45
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,809
- Oi!
- What?

46
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:59,882
- What's the matter with him?
- You never let him do things on his own.

47
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:05,869
I can't let Rodney go out on business.
He'd come back with a bag of magic beans.

48
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:10,220
- And you're so successful, aren't you?
- Don't start.

49
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:12,413
- This situation...
- What situation?

50
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:16,606
You being made bankrupt,
owing the Inland Revenue P53,000

51
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:20,195
and the Official Receiver threatening to evict us.

52
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,025
- That.
- Yes. And those letters from the solicitors.

53
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,618
- Have you phoned them yet?
- No. I've been busy.

54
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:31,651
- Have you told Rodney?
- No. He's got enough to worry about.

55
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:36,238
I'll tell him when the moment's right.
Can I borrow these?

56
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,702
- Have you told Raquel yet?
- Told her what?

57
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:47,291
That they're auctioning this flat in a month.

58
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:51,485
No. I'll tell her when the moment's right.

59
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:54,914
- Del...
- No. See you, Rodney.

60
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,164
Are you all right, Mum?

61
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,400
I've come to give you a bit of a scrub-up.

62
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,707
How do you like your new obelisk?

63
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:23,767
The other one, your old one, was OK,
but it wasn't quite you,

64
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,470
so when me and Rodders became millionaires,
we got you this new one.

65
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,893
Best one in the yard, this.
This is the Ferrari of shrines.

66
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:37,174
Anyway...

67
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:41,606
Cassandra... She'll be giving birth soon.

68
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,597
Another grandchild in the family.

69
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:50,219
I said to them, if it's a girl,
would they name her after you?

70
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,022
Joan.

71
00:05:54,099 --> 00:06:00,716
I'm sorry I haven't been down for a long time,
but I've had one or two problems.

72
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:03,913
What with the bankruptcy and all of that.

73
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:10,332
Then I received this letter
from the Official Receiver,

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,803
says they want to auction the old flat.

75
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,322
The lads have been good.

76
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:21,469
They've all been trying
to think of ways for me to make money.

77
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:25,062
- You gotta invent something.
- Invent something?

78
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:27,257
All inventors are rich.

79
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:32,324
What's the name of that bloke
who invented the Dyson vacuum cleaner?

80
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,630
Dyson.

81
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,782
Millionaire. What about that bloke
who invented the biro?

82
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,456
- Bic?
- Millionaire.

83
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,161
I know, Trig. I've thought of that,
but everything's been invented.

84
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:52,280
Not everything. Picture this.

85
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:56,267
You're on a crowded bus,
you get an itch in your back.

86
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:01,290
No matter how hard you try,
you can't reach it. What do you do?

87
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,968
Ask one of the other passengers to scratch it.

88
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,799
- Yeah.
- No, you can't do that, Dave.

89
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:10,235
No. I was just having a laugh.

90
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:16,023
I tried that once
and it caused nothing but trouble.

91
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:20,769
Now... What's this?

92
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:24,440
- Chopstick.
- Correct.

93
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:28,715
With this you can reach down and hit the spot.

94
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:36,896
That's very good, Trig. Not quite
up to Bill Gates' standard, but it is brilliant.

95
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:42,278
I don't want to disappoint you,
and the Chinese have always been inventive,

96
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:48,029
but we created something years ago
that beat them to the punch - a backscratcher.

97
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:52,379
But they're big long things, Dave.
You can't carry one in your pocket.

98
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,811
People will look.

99
00:07:54,975 --> 00:08:01,559
Yes, but you've got to have something long
to get it right down where the itch is.

100
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:05,908
- That thing's too short.
- So what's the answer?

101
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,099
Another drink?

102
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,054
No.

103
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,556
Two chopsticks.

104
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:20,594
I'm gonna fit a little hinge on the end...

105
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,538
...so you can open it out,

106
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:30,608
scratch away, fold it down again...
and put it back in your pocket.

107
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:35,437
And you can use it for pointing at things.

108
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:41,980
That's brilliant, innit? No more fingers.

109
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:46,844
This is just a specimen.
I'm going back to my flat to work on it.

110
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:50,838
When I take the patent out,
I'm gonna put it in your name.

111
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:54,704
Thanks, Trig. See you on "Tomorrow's World".

112
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:01,813
Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.

113
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:05,723
Seems like nothing's gonna change my bad luck.

114
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,999
Raquel says we ought to try feng shui.

115
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:13,145
I said to her,
"What good is eating raw fish gonna do?"

116
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:20,732
And I'm getting all these letters
from my solicitor demanding a meeting.

117
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:26,675
If I don't get over 50 grand in four weeks' time,

118
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,665
I'll be kipping on that bench over there.

119
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,337
Least I'll be keeping you company.

120
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:39,121
If there's anything that you can do -
you know, while you're up there,

121
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:44,909
like a word in the right ear -
I'd be ever so grateful.

122
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:52,412
Anyway, I'd better buzz off. See you soon, Mum.

123
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,568
Bonjour.

124
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:12,725
- What you doing?
- I'm writing a screenplay for a movie.

125
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,113
Oh. Where is everyone?

126
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:22,106
Your dad's at the cemetery.
Cassandra's at her parents' place with your mum.

127
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:28,133
- Is it a silent film?
- No, it's not a silent film.

128
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:32,279
- You might be able to help me.
- What do you want me to do?

129
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,829
Bugger off and leave me alone.

130
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,213
- All right, Dad?
- Yeah. All right, son.

131
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,001
Postman's given me a letter
from the Official Receiver.

132
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:51,155
- I suppose it's about this flat.
- It ain't a Christmas card.

133
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:53,954
- Been busy?
- Yes.

134
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,774
- What's wrong, Dad? You look worried.
- I am worried, son.

135
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:06,317
Oh, dear. I don't know. I haven't slept for ages.

136
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:12,184
I feel so stressed out,
Yehudi Menuhin could play a symphony on me!

137
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:16,336
- I'm gonna go and play football.
- All right.

138
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:19,249
Don't forget what I said about dirty tackling.

139
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,605
- Yeah. Be first.
- Good boy.

140
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,891
How's that creative writing course of yours?

141
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:56,201
- Fine.
- Good. 'Cause I worry about you.

142
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:02,589
Even though I've got bankruptcy
looming over me, and my eminent eviction,

143
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,943
I lie awake at night worrying.

144
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:12,439
I say to myself, "Is Rodney
getting his commas in the right place?"

145
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:14,597
What's up with you?

146
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:20,429
I'll tell you. Here I am, halfway down the gurgler
with only my head above the water,

147
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:26,131
and you're poncing around on your wife's laptop,
wasting money on some course.

148
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:30,521
I'm not wasting money.
I'm investing in our future.

149
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:35,626
What future?
We've got all the prospects of a Toilet Duck!

150
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:40,337
I'm trying to get us out of this situation
by earning some serious money.

151
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:44,807
Have you any idea how much you can earn
by writing a book or a film?

152
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:51,116
- I bet you've never heard of JK Rowling.
- As a matter of fact, I have.

153
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,027
He's one of my favourites.

154
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:57,383
No... Yeah, right.

155
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:03,561
JK Rowling wrote all the Harry Potter books
and has earned over P70 million.

156
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:07,919
70 million?! That would do us, wouldn't it?

157
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,270
- It could get us over the worst.
- Go on, then.

158
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,498
- What?
- Write one.

159
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:17,570
I can't write a Harry Potter book. It's copyrighted.

160
00:13:17,738 --> 00:13:23,879
Don't worry about that. Just change a bit.
No one will notice. Call it Harry Trotter.

161
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:29,705
- No.
- Will you shut up, you tart?

162
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,458
All you need is a couple of wizards

163
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:38,162
and some little git with John Lennon glasses,
and then we're off.

164
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,042
I can't write all that magic stuff.

165
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:45,743
I'm more Michael Crichton and Thomas Harris.
He wrote "Silence Of The Lambs".

166
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,942
Oh, yeah? Hannibal the Cannonball?

167
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:52,849
No, it's can... Yeah.

168
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:57,521
- Well, he's earned over $100 million.
- 100 million?

169
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:02,031
I know it's all big talk -
70 million here, 100 million there.

170
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:07,017
You're entitled to talk big
once you've been a millionaire like what we have.

171
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,202
You know what this is, don't you?

172
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:18,187
Every time I go down
and have a little talk to Mum,

173
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,386
something turns up to save us.

174
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:27,449
This is it. This is a sign. This is Mum's doing.

175
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:33,317
Come on, Rodney.
We're gonna come up with a film idea.

176
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,035
Yeah.

177
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:44,128
So I rang Mike in prison
and we decided to turn this into a theme pub.

178
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:48,835
- Good.
- We decided on 1930s, pre-war London.

179
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,229
It's turned out well.

180
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,906
I ain't started yet.

181
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:59,259
- It's still at the consultation stage.
- Let us know when it's finished.

182
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,928
Raquel. Cassandra. What are you drinking?

183
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:05,918
- Vodka and tonic, please, Trig.
- An orange juice, please.

184
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,229
- Del and Rodney here?
- I ain't seen 'em.

185
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:13,737
- Tell Del the prototype has hit a snag.
- Right.

186
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:17,889
- Me paraffin heater melted the chopsticks.
- OK.

187
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:22,913
I might have to go to a Chinese shop.
He'll understand.

188
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,306
- What are they doing?
- Who?

189
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:34,975
These people that landed
on an uninhabited desert island in the Specific.

190
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,201
- Right. They're scientists.
- Right.

191
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:41,433
They've been sent there
because of strange goings-on.

192
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:45,869
- Like people getting killed?
- Yeah. Disappearing strangely.

193
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,980
Right. This idea's getting betterer and betterer.

194
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:56,123
So they land in a jumbo jet flown by...
I'm thinking Mel Gibson.

195
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,874
Mel Gibson? Yeah!

196
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,500
- He ain't got all that paint over his face?
- No, no.

197
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:07,857
- He's the leading scientist.
- Right. OK.

198
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,127
- What's he doing flying the plane, then?
- I dunno.

199
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:18,143
We could say that in the past
he was a pilot for...

200
00:16:18,314 --> 00:16:20,187
Monarch.

201
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:24,933
No. Something exciting. NASA.

202
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,686
NASA! Yes, sir! NASA.

203
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:33,311
So Mel and his assistant...
I was thinking Julia Roberts.

204
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:37,667
Julia Roberts. Now you're talking like a mogul.

205
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:43,651
So whilst they're out there doing
all their scientific research and all that stuff,

206
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,800
something in the jungle is watching them.

207
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:51,076
- The monster.
- Except it's not really a monster.

208
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:57,458
What they don't know is on this island
are a forgotten tribe of Neanderthals.

209
00:16:57,622 --> 00:17:01,209
Cor blimey. Well, you need that, don't ya?

210
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:05,516
Old Mel's got his work cut out.

211
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:08,952
Doing all his research and trying to sort Julia out.

212
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:13,019
So there's all these cavemen...

213
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:17,533
Yeah. And women.
The women. You know what I mean?

214
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:21,759
'Cause serious filmgoers, they like a bit of that.

215
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:26,544
I was thinking about... Liz Hurley and Jordan.

216
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:31,539
- We'll talk about it.
- And they're killer cavemen.

217
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:35,403
- Yes!
- This is gonna be a blockbuster.

218
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:39,001
It's called "The Island Of Death".

219
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:41,627
We'll talk about that as well.

220
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:46,618
Did you get the baby blues
after Damien was born?

221
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:52,371
- I had my moments, but not too bad.
- I didn't get depressed after I had Tyler.

222
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:56,642
I was private. The doctors and the drugs
are better than on the NHS.

223
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:59,675
I didn't get post-natal depression, did I?

224
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:04,422
How would I know? You've been
screaming and crying all your life.

225
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,332
Only since I married you!

226
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:12,401
It's our anniversary soon. 34 years.

227
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,279
They dig up fossils younger than that.

228
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:21,814
Put a bit of make-up on 'em
and I might fancy them more than you.

229
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:25,649
Mind you, she has her uses.

230
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:31,434
If I have to draw a straight line
and can't find a ruler, I just use her chest.

231
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:36,391
That is one 'orrible git.

232
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,581
But he has got his nice side.

233
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,042
Last month he took out
a massive life insurance on me.

234
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,955
- Shows he cares.
- Come on, Marlene.

235
00:18:49,121 --> 00:18:51,754
Let's go home and ignore each other.

236
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:59,569
Right. Where are they now?
At the end of the runway.

237
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,482
Yeah. Just getting ready to take off

238
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:07,791
when suddenly a big bird
gets sucked into one of the engines.

239
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:12,145
Yes! I can see that, Rodney. That is drama.

240
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:15,768
- Yeah.
- I feel an Oscar coming on here.

241
00:19:17,095 --> 00:19:20,080
Who do you see playing the big bird?

242
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:26,189
- Eh?
- Roseanne Barr. She ain't small.

243
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,781
No. When I say big bird...

244
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,244
If you got Roseanne Barr
stuck in your engine, you'd know.

245
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:39,634
No, no. I'm talking about an eagle or a coroment.

246
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,898
A cornament... An eagle.

247
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:47,419
Oh, right. I see.

248
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:51,533
Ah! No, no... Got it, Rodney.

249
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:55,235
This is it. Listen to this. Mel... Right?

250
00:19:55,405 --> 00:20:01,546
- His assistant is played by Roseanne Barr.
- I don't want Roseanne Barr.

251
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,852
But when Mel pulls her out of the engine,
she's in a right mess.

252
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,448
Del...

253
00:20:08,614 --> 00:20:13,393
No, listen. This is when we find out
that not only is Mel a pilot

254
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:18,306
and a science researchist,
but he's also a plastic surgeon.

255
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:23,772
- No.
- And he's got his plastic surgeon tools.

256
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:28,206
- So he operates on her.
- I don't want him operating on her.

257
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:32,715
And then he turns her into Julia Roberts, right?

258
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:38,779
When she sees what he's done, she says,
"Bloody hell, Mel! Help yourself."

259
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,808
And that is your romance.

260
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,356
I'm not having Roseanne Barr's legs
sticking out of one end of an engine

261
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:53,502
and Julia Roberts' head
sticking out of the other end.

262
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:01,843
- Are you certain he said they'd meet us?
- I'm positive.

263
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:07,385
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

264
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:10,018
Why do they do things like this?

265
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,012
As I've said to you before,
women are from Venus, men are from Peckham.

266
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:27,378
- Let me carry that coffee.
- Get off me, Rodney!

267
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:32,089
I know you're an attentive man,
but you're getting on my bloody nerves.

268
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:38,082
- Hormones, eh?
- Yeah. I'm glad I ain't got none.

269
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,985
It's an answering machine.

270
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:46,137
Hello. Denzil, this is Delboy.

271
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,005
I haven't been able to get hold of you.

272
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:55,113
I just wanted to let you know
I had a job for you worth 500 quid.

273
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:58,871
I've had to let it go to someone else now.

274
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:05,176
So I just wanted to let you know
what a half-head I think you are. Bonjour!

275
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,362
- You'll never guess.
- What?

276
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:13,310
I've been talking to that woman
who cleans for Boycie and Marlene.

277
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:17,783
She says she hasn't seen Marlene
for eight days now.

278
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:21,980
- What do you think's happened?
- I dunno. Strange, though.

279
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:25,841
I can't understand
how they weren't divorced years ago.

280
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:30,314
Marlene will never divorce Boycie.
She hates him too much.

281
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:36,424
You shouldn't laugh.
Marital break-ups can be very damaging.

282
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:39,095
I did some work for the Samaritans.

283
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:41,928
- On the phones?
- Yeah.

284
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,793
Yes. Very successful he was, too.
No one ever phoned back.

285
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,425
Del, have you seen Marlene recently?

286
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:58,455
No. I bumped into Boycie.
He said she'd gone away.

287
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:03,359
- Maybe he's murdered her!
- Keep your nose out of this.

288
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:08,189
- Do you think she's left him?
- They were having a row. It got nasty.

289
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,781
He accused her of being flat-chested.

290
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:16,372
- They're always having rows.
- You haven't seen Denzil either.

291
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,837
Maybe they've run off together.

292
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:21,562
Hark at him.

293
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:26,227
Marlene has run off with Den... zil.

294
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:33,644
Jane, half a lager and Del's usual.

295
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,924
Poison in the dining room.

296
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:40,707
- Candlestick in the bedroom.
- You playing Cluedo?

297
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:46,540
No. It's called "Whatever happened to Marlene?"
It's been ten days now.

298
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:51,402
I reckon she's either run off with another bloke
or Boycie's killed her.

299
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:54,204
Or she's spending the week at her sister's.

300
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:58,031
Her sister's? You and your imagination, Rodney.

301
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:02,304
Do you remember
the old Jolly Boys' outings we went on?

302
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:07,289
- The beanos to Margate? They were great.
- We ain't had one in years.

303
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:11,994
No. After the last one
the coach firms wouldn't do business with us.

304
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,781
But I was going through some old boxes
and I found this.

305
00:24:20,344 --> 00:24:25,724
It's the first Jolly Boys' outing. July 1960.

306
00:24:25,891 --> 00:24:30,999
There's Del, about 15.
There's Trigger. Boycie. Denzil.

307
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:35,539
- What a bunch of mongs.
- Bloody 'ell. They look stupid.

308
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:39,578
That was the fashion. There's your dad - Reg.

309
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:44,357
- Oh, yeah.
- There's your grandfather. There's me.

310
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:48,987
Blimey, Sid. You looked like an old git
even in them days.

311
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:53,622
Yeah. I haven't really aged.

312
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:58,132
See you later. I gotta get something to eat.

313
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:01,404
- We do food here.
- I know. I've tried it.

314
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,757
Fair enough.

315
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:10,505
Sid, can I borrow this to get a copy made?
I'm gonna embarrass Del with it.

316
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,015
- I want it back, though.
- Yeah. 'Course.

317
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,838
- There you go.
- Ta.

318
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:24,861
- What are you smirking at?
- Nothing. You all right, Trig?

319
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:27,983
Nothing to report. Waiting for the glue to dry.

320
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,172
Mum's the word.

321
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:36,443
I hope you're around on Saturday night.
It's a special evening.

322
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:39,033
The brewery given us a new guvnor?

323
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:45,419
No. Somebody's booked the pub for a do
and it's the first of my tribute nights.

324
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:51,361
I've got a couple of singers from Newcastle.
They call themselves "Lordy Geordie".

325
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:56,714
They do a tribute to Robson and Jerome.

326
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:01,302
Why?

327
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:05,208
I didn't ask.

328
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:10,281
The first act on is a David Bowie tribute.
A carpenter.

329
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:13,510
Calls himself Ziggy Sawdust.

330
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:19,735
Make a note of that, Rodney. I can't miss this.

331
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:23,806
Yeah. Sounds good, doesn't it?

332
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:31,704
- I've got a good idea for one of our films.
- What's that?

333
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:35,654
You know, Denzil and Marlene
running off together.

334
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:39,651
These two people
who've known each other since their teens

335
00:26:39,816 --> 00:26:42,245
and hid their passion for each other,

336
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,916
and when they reach middle age,
they can't contain it no longer,

337
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,667
so they rush into each other's arms.

338
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:54,498
- This is Denzil and Marlene.
- We'll get someone nice, though.

339
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:58,804
I can't do romance.
I'm more into science fiction.

340
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:01,957
Yeah. I like all that as well, Dave.

341
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:08,180
I mean, you think about space.
It's everywhere, innit?

342
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:13,608
You're right. You can't move for it.

343
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:16,365
I read something frightening.

344
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,638
Scientists have discovered
this gigantic black hole on the edge of our galaxy,

345
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:25,498
and if our planet continues
on its ever-widening orbit,

346
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:28,131
we'll be sucked into it and destroyed.

347
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,652
I'll make sure I'm out that day.

348
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:34,880
So when's this going to happen?

349
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:42,979
They can't be too specific. They can't say
Saturday 12th March at half past three.

350
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:47,290
No, but they can give us an idea,
give or take a fortnight.

351
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,761
Well, roughly...

352
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:54,756
within two to three hundred million years.

353
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,983
We got time for a quick one, then?

354
00:27:59,988 --> 00:28:02,780
So what are they gonna do about it?

355
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:08,638
- What are who gonna do about it?
- The government.

356
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:15,266
Well, there's nothing... Send McAlpine's up
with a spaceship full of bricks.

357
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,419
They'll need more than one.

358
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,927
Del, I know you don't believe
in this UFO rubbish,

359
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:28,155
but I've been sitting here looking at the sky

360
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:30,910
and I suddenly noticed a star.

361
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:33,584
It's night, Trig. It happens.

362
00:28:33,749 --> 00:28:38,732
Yeah, but this star suddenly disappeared
and then it came back again...

363
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:43,085
and then it disappeared
and then it came back again.

364
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:48,546
And then it disappeared...
and then it came back again.

365
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:53,022
Do you think that's a close encounter?

366
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:57,212
No. It's called blinking.

367
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:04,745
- It's done it again, look.
- No. Missed it.

368
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:14,127
There it goes!

369
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,954
It's amazing, innit?

370
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,107
Dear God.

371
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:27,851
Trotters Independent Traders.

372
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:32,769
Yeah? Thank you. We'll be right down.

373
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:38,955
It's the manager of the Sopranos Pizza Parlour.
We've found Denzil.

374
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:50,447
Denzil, me old mate.

375
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:54,593
All right, Del?
All right, fellas. How's it going?

376
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:59,186
Yes. Fine.
We were worried about you, me old mate.

377
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:03,889
- Don't worry about me. I was just off...
- No, you sit down.

378
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:06,849
Let's have a little chinwag, eh?

379
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:15,343
Is there anything you'd like to tell us?

380
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:19,818
We promise we won't be judgmental.
These things happen.

381
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,487
- Who told you?
- Del worked it out.

382
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:28,395
Yeah. Once Marlene went missing and so did you,

383
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,020
you didn't have to be Jeremy Paxton
to work out you'd run off together.

384
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:37,733
Run off with Marlene?
Have you gone mad or what?

385
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:42,285
- Where've you been, then?
- In hospital.

386
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:45,637
Hospital? Was there something wrong with you?

387
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:49,942
- Of course there was something wrong.
- What?

388
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:57,211
I don't want to talk about it, Del.
It's been with me for quite a while.

389
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:03,229
I didn't say anything to you because...
I didn't want to admit it to myself.

390
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:09,260
Finally, the doctor said
I'd got to have the operation or...

391
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,176
Or what?

392
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:17,434
Trigger, you don't need to ask that question.

393
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:22,871
- If he says "or", you know what he means.
- What?

394
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:28,775
I've had the operation and I'm feeling better.

395
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:34,840
The specialist said it could always return.
I've just gotta live in hope.

396
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,257
Let's get a drink. Four beers, please, over here.

397
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:46,609
I didn't spot you lot lurking over here.
How's it all going?

398
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:48,490
All right.

399
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:53,396
You and me have got a mutual friend.
That young nurse - Jolene.

400
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,181
I took her out.
She told me all about your case.

401
00:31:57,352 --> 00:32:01,097
I don't believe this.
It's supposed to be confidential.

402
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:05,882
She'd had a couple of drinks.
I don't envy you at all, Denzil.

403
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,684
My old granddad suffered with piles.

404
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:16,506
- Piles?
- You've had piles?

405
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:22,682
Us worried sick about you and all you'd got
was a touch of the Farmer Giles!

406
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,995
Not piles, Derek - super-piles.

407
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:29,466
All this fuss over a few haemorrhoids.

408
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:32,269
Haemorrhoids? They were more like asteroids.

409
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,730
Surgeon said it was keyhole surgery.

410
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:40,725
Didn't say it was the keyhole
to the Tower of soddin' London!

411
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:46,235
- You wanna see what he's done to me.
- No. I'll just take your word for it.

412
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,937
So what's this about Marlene?

413
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:54,693
- Nobody's seen her for a week.
- We thought she was having an affair.

414
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,922
Funny you should say that.

415
00:32:57,091 --> 00:33:01,359
I was in town two weeks ago
and I saw Marlene with a fella.

416
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:07,219
All dressed up - low-cut blouse,
high heels, full make-up, the lot.

417
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:09,975
What does she see in a bloke like that?

418
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:16,959
No, not the... He's talking about Marlene!

419
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:20,473
- You are talking about her, aren't you?
- Yeah.

420
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:24,666
So maybe Boycie found out
Marlene was having an affair.

421
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:30,047
And then he took out
a very large life insurance policy on her.

422
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:38,393
Hello, Boycie. Thought we'd pop in.

423
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:48,879
You must appreciate I'm a very busy man,
so what can I do for you?

424
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,715
- A cup of tea wouldn't go amiss.
- How's Marlene these days?

425
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:58,938
- She's fine.
- It's just we haven't seen her around lately.

426
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:03,169
No. That's because she's been away.

427
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:07,244
I'll put the kettle on.

428
00:34:09,322 --> 00:34:12,307
- He's done her in.
- You don't know that.

429
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:16,663
- What other explanation is there?
- Staying with friends?

430
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:22,284
Don't be stupid. Who the hell's gonna have
Marlene in their house for a week?

431
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,717
You be observant. This could make a nice film.

432
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:30,070
We've got to be careful about what we say.

433
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:34,932
We could be making a terrible mistake
and cause a lot of pain and distress.

434
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:38,642
You're right. Subtlety is the order of the day.

435
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,606
Absolutely.

436
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:48,465
- Well?
- Right. Well, Boycie...

437
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,977
I hope you won't take offence
by what I'm about to say, but...

438
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,758
we think you've murdered Marlene
and buried her in the garden.

439
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:04,189
Beautiful, Derek.

440
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:08,972
How dare you? Murdered my wife
and buried her in the garden?

441
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:11,604
I've never been so insulted!

442
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,645
You know how much I've spent on that garden.

443
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:21,788
Yeah. I never thought of that.
So what have you done with her, then?

444
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:25,855
I have done nothing with her. She's upstairs.

445
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:29,290
She's upstairs. What else is there to say?

446
00:35:29,454 --> 00:35:32,201
Dead or alive might help.

447
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:40,226
Marlene and I will be down the pub tonight.
Then you'll have proof, Inspector.

448
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:46,205
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

449
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:56,219
See you later, Marlene.

450
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,858
She's probably asleep.

451
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,085
Oh, yeah. Right.

452
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:06,681
See you later, Marlene!

453
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:12,553
She's a deep sleeper.

454
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,412
She's dead to the world.

455
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,851
See you tonight, Boycie.

456
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,565
Bonjour.

457
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:39,003
# This is Ground Control to Major Tom

458
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,791
# You've really made the grade

459
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:48,944
# And the papers want to know
whose shirts you wear

460
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:54,011
# Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

461
00:36:56,051 --> 00:36:59,830
# This is Major Tom to Ground Control

462
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:03,588
# I'm stepping through the door

463
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:08,735
# And I'm floating in a most peculiar way... #

464
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:13,645
- What's all this, Sid?
- It's like that Spanish place in Fulham.

465
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:15,920
That's tapas. This is...

466
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,512
- Well, it's not good, is it?
- It's English tapas.

467
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:24,896
Does Mike know you're doing this?
I know he's inside, but it's still his pub.

468
00:37:25,063 --> 00:37:28,331
He said, "Treat the pub as if it were your own."

469
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:33,239
That's just a figure of speech.
If you stay at someone's house, they say that.

470
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:36,513
Doesn't mean you build a through lounge.

471
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:41,261
- There it is. Take it or leave it.
- Thank God. We've got a choice.

472
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:50,474
- Do you think Boycie will turn up?
- No. He'll be halfway across Europe now.

473
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,708
Yeah. Grab the insurance money and run.

474
00:38:18,537 --> 00:38:20,330
Good evening.

475
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:25,237
I know what you've been saying about me,
so I am here to prove you wrong.

476
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:29,510
Would you all please greet my wife Marlene?

477
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:39,682
Good evening, everyone.

478
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:45,228
- Sorry about your hair, Marlene.
- This cost me a bloody fortune up west.

479
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:47,982
You look like Brian May in a spin dryer.

480
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:52,290
- Tell him!
- Ignore him.

481
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:55,123
If I may, my dear?

482
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:05,896
Entente cordiale!

483
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:13,561
- Got a feeling this is gonna cause trouble.
- She'll have someone's eye out.

484
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:31,123
So that's where she's been -
up town getting a boob job.

485
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,477
She has not had a boob job.

486
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:38,828
- Leave it out. You brought a firm in.
- I have not brought a firm in.

487
00:39:38,989 --> 00:39:43,971
I'll call Twickenham,
see if they've got any balls missing.

488
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:47,360
She has not had a boob job.
That's all natural.

489
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:52,954
- She never used to have boobs that big.
- How the bloody hell do you know?

490
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:57,623
- You told me.
- Oh, yeah.

491
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:03,085
We got a dress designer in
who made the most of what was available.

492
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:07,712
And who was the bloke
she was seen up town with the other week?

493
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:10,343
That bloke? That bloke was...

494
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:13,658
That bloke was er...

495
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:19,126
- All right. That was her plastic surgeon.
- Aha! Now it comes out, eh?

496
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:24,799
- I thought it'd bring us closer together.
- It'll have the opposite effect!

497
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:28,506
I hope not. It was four grand a boob!

498
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,100
How much did that cost you, then?

499
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:36,169
About eight grand, Trig.

500
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,968
Blimey!

501
00:40:43,437 --> 00:40:47,341
Must be horrible going round
with a couple of big boobies.

502
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:49,970
Raquel and I are used to it!

503
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:56,918
- Are they laughing at me?
- No. They're just having a good time.

504
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:59,548
We'll see about that.

505
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:05,494
Raquel, I'm so glad
you wore that dress again.

506
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:08,173
It's always been one of my favourites.

507
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,243
That reminds me, Boyce,
we've got to collect the curtains.

508
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:17,710
Listen! And her looking like
one of those women you put over toilet rolls.

509
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:21,702
- Did you hear what she said?
- Yes.

510
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:25,646
Be fair, Raquel.
Marlene's made a big effort this evening.

511
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:28,088
You can see a struggle's taken place.

512
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:33,431
- She's been in that bedroom for hours.
- Shut up!

513
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,948
I'm just trying to defend your honour.

514
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:42,809
Trying to defend Marlene's honour?
What have you got in the shed? A time machine?

515
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:48,719
You're just jealous because I can afford
surgery for my 40th birthday.

516
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:55,308
When I met you you were pushing 40.
For the last few years you've been towing it!

517
00:41:55,468 --> 00:42:00,485
Right, that's it!
Raquel, get out of the pub. You're barred.

518
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:05,842
- What are you talking about, Sid?
- Eh?

519
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:10,464
- No. Marlene, get out. You're barred.
- I beg your pardon?!

520
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:13,538
Get off home and take your foster tits with you.

521
00:42:14,863 --> 00:42:18,245
- Did you hear what he just said?!
- Yes.

522
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:20,526
How dare you?

523
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:24,196
- We'll finish our drinks and...
- You'll get out now.

524
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:26,392
- Right.
- Come along, Marlene.

525
00:42:26,556 --> 00:42:30,222
I've never been so insulted in my life.

526
00:42:32,023 --> 00:42:37,959
Sid, far be it for me to interfere,
but you're taking this a bit too seriously.

527
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:42,872
- You're like Mussolini in a Harvester.
- I'm running this pub now.

528
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:46,385
You shouldn't have banned Boycie and Marlene.

529
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:50,929
- And why is that?
- Because it's their anniversary do.

530
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:59,750
Excuse me! I am paying for all this.

531
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:02,947
Right. Drinks all round.

532
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:25,126
Raquel, where are you?

533
00:43:29,249 --> 00:43:32,994
You rotten, lying, devious, cheating man!

534
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:36,938
- Have I upset you?
- I found that letter from the Official Receiver.

535
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:41,014
Oh, right. Yeah.
I've come home to talk about that...

536
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:44,721
You lied to me and to Rodney
about those letters.

537
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:46,878
What letters?

538
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:53,102
All right. These letters.

539
00:43:54,988 --> 00:44:00,096
"Cartwright, Cartwright & Cartwright,
Solicitors of Law." There's ten letters.

540
00:44:00,256 --> 00:44:04,682
- It looks worse than it is.
- Because half of them are Rodney's.

541
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:07,796
You've been hiding
my personal correspondence?

542
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:12,736
I just wanted to take the pressure off you
because of Cassandra and the baby.

543
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:16,208
And you didn't tell me
the flat was being auctioned.

544
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,648
You had all that ironing.

545
00:44:21,685 --> 00:44:27,985
It's been one bit of bad news after the other.
I was trying to protect you all.

546
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,374
You're a control freak.
To you other people don't matter.

547
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:35,129
- That is not true, sweetheart.
- You just step over them.

548
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:41,276
And what do they do in return?
They love you so much they all try to help you.

549
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:47,421
They all try to help me?
You wanted me to ask Boycie for a loan.

550
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,218
That's the same as joining the Moonies.

551
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:54,442
Rodney's trying to write
"Freddie Krueger And The Chocolate Factory"

552
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:58,830
and Trigger's scratching his arse
with a chopstick!

553
00:44:59,836 --> 00:45:02,469
These people are supposed to help me?

554
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:05,092
You ungrateful sod.

555
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:09,927
At least I didn't suggest
forming a Hollywood film company.

556
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,756
You're gonna wish you'd never said that.

557
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:18,939
- Just bringing up a pertinent point.
- No. That's like bringing up a furball.

558
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:21,823
You were going to form a film company?

559
00:45:21,984 --> 00:45:25,332
You see? Not me, him. Rodney.

560
00:45:25,496 --> 00:45:29,275
He wanted to make this film
about an uninhabited island

561
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:31,636
with cavemen living on it.

562
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:34,468
- How's it uninhabited, then?
- I don't know.

563
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:40,934
- Then this jumbo jet lands.
- A jumbo jet? Where's the runway?

564
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,401
- Well... I don't know.
- What's all this noise?

565
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:48,871
You've got to hear the latest from these morons.

566
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:51,595
They're going to make a Hollywood film.

567
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:55,738
What was it? They land on
an uninhabited island in a jumbo jet.

568
00:45:55,904 --> 00:45:58,696
- Who do?
- Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.

569
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:02,807
- He wanted Julia Roberts.
- He wanted Liz Hurley and Jordan.

570
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:08,904
How can you land a jumbo jet
on an uninhabited island? Where's the runway?

571
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:13,137
Yeah. I dunno. Ask him here. Cecil B Demented.

572
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,004
- I don't know.
- See?

573
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:25,750
Maybe Fred Flintstone
and Barney Rubble knocked it up!

574
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:29,898
And who was going to produce this masterpiece?

575
00:46:30,064 --> 00:46:32,697
Exactly. Alfred Stopcock here.

576
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:37,086
So while we're worrying ourselves sick,

577
00:46:37,247 --> 00:46:42,911
these two are getting drunk
and dreaming of making a Hollywood film.

578
00:46:43,074 --> 00:46:47,216
- Listen to me, Raquel...
- No. You listen to me.

579
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:52,571
You've got to make contact with reality.
Everything with you is image.

580
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:57,839
I saw you in the pub. We're broke
and you threw money around like Elton John.

581
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:04,253
And instead of finding work, you sit in this flat
pretending to be Quentin Tarantino.

582
00:47:04,424 --> 00:47:09,168
When we're in the Capri,
you have the windows up, even in a heatwave,

583
00:47:09,332 --> 00:47:12,476
to make it look like you've got air conditioning!

584
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:18,949
- I know I'm not perfect...
- That is the understatement of the year!

585
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,822
Unless a miracle happens, in ten days' time,

586
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:27,760
my son and I are going to be living
in some bed and breakfast in Sodoffsville!

587
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:33,672
If it's a miracle you want, then I'm your man.
I'm chairman of Miracles R Us.

588
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:39,896
You're a man, Del! You'll never understand.
Just remember, only women bleed.

589
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,522
Cor blimey! Only women bleed!

590
00:47:43,692 --> 00:47:45,678
Gordon Bennett!

591
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,543
I am not a control freak.
It's just that I have had no choice.

592
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:57,008
Do you realise that when I was 16,

593
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:03,162
my old man walked out and left me
and Rodney with our daft old granddad?

594
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:06,390
He tried his best, but he wasn't up to it.

595
00:48:08,114 --> 00:48:13,937
So I had to take over and I've been doing it
ever since and I can't get out of the habit.

596
00:48:17,572 --> 00:48:20,034
I'm gonna have a lie-down.

597
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:31,610
All right?

598
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:38,122
Yeah. Fine. Raquel and I
have had a quiet little chat.

599
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:40,587
Yeah, I heard.

600
00:48:53,169 --> 00:48:57,198
You got somewhere to stay after the auction?

601
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,264
Trigger said I could doss down at his place.

602
00:49:00,432 --> 00:49:06,652
There's not much room, what with
all those "X-File" videos and chopsticks.

603
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,283
Oh, dear. Women.

604
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:14,512
Do you know what Raquel said?
Only women bleed. Blimey!

605
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:17,980
She ought to be outside the Nag's Head
on a Saturday night.

606
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:23,573
They reckon they suffer.
They don't know what it's like to be a bloke.

607
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:29,004
They worry about their PMT.
Us men worry about...

608
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:31,626
- Our MOT?
- Yes.

609
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:34,828
- Do they listen to us?
- No, they don't.

610
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:40,132
No, they don't. She'll never meet
another bloke like me, will she?

611
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:43,760
No, she won't.

612
00:49:44,847 --> 00:49:47,401
That's it, Rodney.

613
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:54,383
Once the flat is auctioned...
we'll go our separate ways. I won't see her again.

614
00:49:54,545 --> 00:49:57,575
- Del, don't say that.
- No. That's it.

615
00:49:57,737 --> 00:50:03,832
She won't be able to get round me.
When my mind is made up, my mind is made up!

616
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:07,828
Del?

617
00:50:07,993 --> 00:50:09,547
Yes.

618
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:14,567
I just said I'm going for a lie-down.

619
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:27,099
She's...

620
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:30,616
She's all right really.

621
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,685
She's lovely, isn't she, eh?

622
00:50:36,486 --> 00:50:39,040
Yeah. She's lovely.

623
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:21,808
You're not with me tonight, are you?

624
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,851
Sorry. Just thinking.

625
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:27,396
I know you're worried about losing the flat,

626
00:51:27,566 --> 00:51:31,073
but my mum and dad
said we're welcome there.

627
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:35,221
- I know you and my mum don't...
- That's great. Thanks.

628
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:40,408
- I can't eat.
- What's wrong?

629
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:43,164
Nothing. I'm just not hungry.

630
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:46,156
I refuse to have this baby till you tell me.

631
00:51:48,158 --> 00:51:54,616
Take a look at this.
It's the Jolly Boys' outing to Margate. July 1960.

632
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:58,653
This is great. Is that Del?

633
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:01,401
Yeah. 15.

634
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:04,279
And Trigger. Look at Trigger.

635
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,469
- Keep looking.
- That must be Boycie. Those eyes.

636
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:14,486
- And Denzil. Look at his hair!
- Yeah. Keep looking.

637
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:18,435
There's your granddad. Ah. And there's you...

638
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:22,470
Yeah.

639
00:52:24,313 --> 00:52:28,217
July 1960. Before I was born.

640
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:42,665
- Where is everyone?
- I'm in the bathroom. Dinner's in the oven.

641
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,623
All right.

642
00:53:00,508 --> 00:53:02,540
Dear, oh, dear...

643
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:07,480
Bloody hell.

644
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,402
So who is he?

645
00:53:11,562 --> 00:53:13,628
He's my father.

646
00:53:13,797 --> 00:53:17,418
- But your father is...
- My real father.

647
00:53:17,588 --> 00:53:20,732
My biological old man.

648
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,768
I've had my suspicions for years.

649
00:53:24,931 --> 00:53:28,393
People tried to convince me
it was my imagination.

650
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:37,335
His name was Freddie the Frog. He'd been
a Royal Navy diver, hence the nickname.

651
00:53:37,502 --> 00:53:41,724
He and my mum were... friends.

652
00:53:41,891 --> 00:53:44,320
Are you absolutely certain?

653
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:49,911
Look at the photo, Cass.
We don't need DNA with this one.

654
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:59,842
All right? What's the first name
that springs to mind?

655
00:54:00,009 --> 00:54:03,119
Well... Rodney.

656
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,585
Exactly. Rodney.

657
00:54:07,352 --> 00:54:10,303
Who is he?

658
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:15,685
His name was Freddie Robdal.
He was a mate of my dad's.

659
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:20,390
My mum was having a rough time
with the old man.

660
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:24,544
He was very handy,
if you know what I mean, with women.

661
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:29,978
Not much cop when it came to men,
but a hard nut with women and kids.

662
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,530
One day my dad brought Freddie home

663
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,913
and him and my mum got on
like a house on fire.

664
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:42,019
They had the same taste in music
and... well, everything.

665
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,538
And what was he, this Freddie Robdal?

666
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:50,559
He was a gentleman safe-cracker.
They called him the Raffles of Peckham.

667
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:56,110
People have mentioned him before
and we sounded similar.

668
00:54:56,277 --> 00:55:00,545
He was a connoisseur of fine wines, a gourmet,

669
00:55:00,706 --> 00:55:04,815
a real snappy dresser, big-time charmer.

670
00:55:04,976 --> 00:55:07,405
So how are you similar?

671
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:12,355
We're about the same height.

672
00:55:13,836 --> 00:55:17,298
Where's Freddie the Frog or Daddy now?

673
00:55:17,467 --> 00:55:24,209
He's dead. Back in '64, he was breaking
into a safe and he sat on the detonator.

674
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:27,878
He sat on the detonator? Why?

675
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:32,866
I think it's what's known,
in the underworld, as "an accident".

676
00:55:35,944 --> 00:55:38,849
And you've known all these years?

677
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:43,557
No. At least, not when Rodney was a baby.

678
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:48,345
When you get to 20
and your six-year-old brother is taller than you,

679
00:55:48,514 --> 00:55:51,147
it makes you think.

680
00:55:51,308 --> 00:55:54,373
I never knew really who he was.

681
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,524
As a youngster,
I was told to call him Uncle Fred.

682
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:04,229
Then a few years back,
Uncle Albert got drunk at an old folks' do...

683
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:07,427
It was a wet corset contest.

684
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:15,171
Anyway, he told me
all about Freddie and my mum.

685
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:24,389
I don't know if you noticed, but there are
no photographs of my mum in this house,

686
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,978
except for a couple of close-ups.

687
00:56:28,141 --> 00:56:31,489
I assumed your dad had taken them when he left.

688
00:56:31,653 --> 00:56:37,112
No. He only used to take money
and things that he could sell.

689
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,026
Then Uncle Albert told me.

690
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:46,730
It was my Aunt Rene who dealt with it
just after Mum's funeral.

691
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:53,354
Every photograph in this house
had a picture of Freddie Robdal in it.

692
00:56:53,522 --> 00:56:56,587
My Aunt Rene knew that as Rodney got older,

693
00:56:56,754 --> 00:57:00,056
people would see the stimularities...

694
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:03,769
...so she burnt 'em.

695
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:05,924
Do you think Rodney knows?

696
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:10,794
He's never been very observant, has he?

697
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,912
Nah. He ain't got a clue.

698
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:20,217
- Do you think Del knows?
- He would have said.

699
00:57:20,379 --> 00:57:23,841
- Are you gonna tell him?
- No.

700
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:28,428
It'd break his heart.

701
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:33,346
Will you say anything to Rodney?

702
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:39,007
I can't. It'd break his heart.

703
00:57:53,421 --> 00:57:57,609
- Who have we got to see?
- Cartwright.

704
00:57:57,771 --> 00:58:00,404
What do you think he wants?

705
00:58:00,565 --> 00:58:05,785
You've asked me that a hundred times
and a hundred times I've said I don't know.

706
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:09,936
Well, think hard.
We don't want to go in there unarmed.

707
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:14,244
If we know what you did,
we can have our excuses ready.

708
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:16,443
I've done nothing but think.

709
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:22,226
All I know is that every business decision,
every tactical move that I've ever made,

710
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:25,537
we've already been done for.

711
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:28,497
It's probably nothing.

712
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:32,404
Del, solicitors don't send you ten letters
for nothing.

713
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:36,394
This is something
and my instincts say it's something bad.

714
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:44,260
- We're gonna go to prison.
- Shut up, you tart. We're not.

715
00:58:44,422 --> 00:58:49,359
Cassandra's going to be bringing my baby
to visit me in Wormwood Scrubs.

716
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:53,275
And you know the fun they get up to in prison.

717
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,264
You can guarantee I'm gonna be a prime target.

718
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:02,651
I hope they put us in separate cells,
you depressing git.

719
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:08,324
How do you expect me to feel?
In a few weeks I could be someone's bitch!

720
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,424
Some great big ugly geezer's
gonna choose me to be his special friend.

721
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:20,253
All you've got to say is, "Oi! None of that."

722
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:23,084
He'll say, "I'll look after you, Rodney."

723
00:59:23,251 --> 00:59:27,870
He'll lend me his Rolling Stones CD
and then we'll be engaged.

724
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:30,627
At least we'll have a party, then.

725
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,704
I'll ask for solitary confinement.

726
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:39,528
No, don't do that.
You don't want a reputation as a tease.

727
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:47,224
- You're enjoying this.
- Just listen to me, dopey.

728
00:59:47,394 --> 00:59:50,980
The lawyer has asked us to come in for a chat.

729
00:59:51,145 --> 00:59:57,366
This whatever it is is a civil matter.
You only go to prison for a criminal offence.

730
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:03,954
That means a police prosecution.
Do you see any Mr Plods around here?

731
01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:09,971
Yes. I'm so stupid.
I just let my imagination run away with itself.

732
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:19,837
- But if the worst comes to the worst...
- All right. I'll go in the showers first.

733
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:29,443
- I've been doing a bit of thinking.
- Mm?

734
01:00:29,615 --> 01:00:32,600
You know that photo that Sid lent me...

735
01:00:33,805 --> 01:00:37,153
Gentlemen? Mr Cartwright will see you now.

736
01:00:50,087 --> 01:00:55,069
Gentlemen, please take a seat.
So... at last we meet.

737
01:00:56,193 --> 01:01:01,379
You two have proved very elusive.
I've been writing to you for three months.

738
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:07,556
- Yes. Sorry about that. We've been busy.
- We've had a few problems recently.

739
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:13,231
I heard. I took the liberty of speaking
to your solicitor. He related a tale of woe.

740
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:17,933
The international stock market
can be a fickle thing.

741
01:01:18,101 --> 01:01:20,927
No. I was referring to his unpaid bill.

742
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:28,115
Oh. We were discussing that
out in your waiting room. It's in the post.

743
01:01:28,277 --> 01:01:31,818
I'm sure. Let's attend to the matter at hand.

744
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:34,780
Can't you just tell us the worst?

745
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:39,958
Tell us what you're suing us for
and we'll tell you why we can't pay.

746
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:44,159
Mr Trotter, you seem to be
under the wrong impression.

747
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,588
Did you read my letters?
I said I had something that may be of interest.

748
01:01:48,749 --> 01:01:53,290
My firm acted as solicitors for your great-uncle,
Albert Gladstone Trotter.

749
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,920
Oh, no.

750
01:01:56,092 --> 01:02:00,155
All right. What did he do?

751
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:05,464
Nothing, as far as I know.
This is a reading of his last will and testament.

752
01:02:06,947 --> 01:02:09,852
- Albert left a will?
- He didn't have nothing.

753
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,006
Well, not quite.

754
01:02:12,174 --> 01:02:17,032
When you came into your fortune,
you made Albert a very generous gift.

755
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:20,108
Yeah. We saw that he was all right.

756
01:02:20,275 --> 01:02:25,939
But that would be six years ago.
He's probably blown all that.

757
01:02:26,102 --> 01:02:31,164
Not entirely. As you know,
Albert lived a very simple life.

758
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:34,439
He didn't buy properties or Rolls-Royces,

759
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:38,222
didn't care for Caribbean holidays
or Hawaiian cruises.

760
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:43,932
He simply invested your gift, and in
a far more stable area than you managed to.

761
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:48,446
All his investments were blue-chip -
not very exciting, but stable,

762
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:51,639
and bringing in a small interest.

763
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,264
He's left his entire estate to you.

764
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:58,657
Before I do the legal reading,
let's cut to the chase.

765
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:04,364
After death duties,
he has left you the sum of P145,000.

766
01:03:08,003 --> 01:03:10,387
Er... each.

767
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:26,958
Hello? Raquel. Raquel!
You'll never guess. We're saved.

768
01:03:27,118 --> 01:03:31,182
It was all about Uncle Albert and his will. Hm?

769
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,855
We're on our way.

770
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:38,410
She's in delivery room ten.

771
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:42,436
- I don't know if I can face this.
- Course you can.

772
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:46,983
You gotta be there for the birth.
You'll never forgive yourself.

773
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:49,660
- No, you're right.
- Here y'are.

774
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:53,932
This is it. Give us your coat.

775
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:58,673
Good boy. Right. Go on, then.

776
01:04:07,504 --> 01:04:10,647
Oh, bloody hell.

777
01:04:10,816 --> 01:04:12,802
I'm sorry.

778
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:19,514
What are you playing at?
You just wander in for a look?

779
01:04:19,675 --> 01:04:24,817
- It weren't like that. I... I'm sorry.
- Bleedin' perv!

780
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:33,514
It was room 16, not ten.

781
01:04:33,682 --> 01:04:38,824
- I nearly got a punch on the nose.
- Shut up, you tart. Come on.

782
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,490
- Rodney...
- I gotta be there for the birth.

783
01:04:45,654 --> 01:04:49,797
- You can't be there for the birth.
- What?

784
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:54,545
They've had to give Cassandra
a Caesarean section.

785
01:04:54,713 --> 01:04:58,776
- What's happened to my baby?
- The baby's been delivered.

786
01:04:58,943 --> 01:05:01,133
Mother and child are fine.

787
01:05:06,645 --> 01:05:08,870
Mr Trotter?

788
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:30,580
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- I've never felt better in my life.

789
01:05:32,504 --> 01:05:34,967
She's a love, isn't she?

790
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:50,412
Well... What do you reckon?

791
01:05:53,256 --> 01:05:55,968
She's like a work of art.

792
01:05:57,406 --> 01:06:01,548
Yeah. Lovely jubbly.

793
01:06:23,704 --> 01:06:26,769
What are you gonna call her?

794
01:06:26,937 --> 01:06:29,763
I don't know yet.

795
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:34,310
Me and Cass had this agreement.
If it was a boy, she'd name him.

796
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:40,335
- If it was a girl, I could name her.
- You're not going to hold me to that?

797
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:43,577
Oh, yeah.

798
01:07:02,413 --> 01:07:06,193
What were you saying on the phone
about Uncle Albert?

799
01:07:06,364 --> 01:07:10,234
Oh, I'll explain it all later.

800
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:16,172
All I'll say is the auctioneers can go
and stuff themselves 'cause we are staying put.

801
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:26,995
Del.

802
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:47,057
A work of art.

803
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:51,053
Yes, you are.

804
01:08:19,712 --> 01:08:23,491
Did you love him? Did he love you?

805
01:08:26,177 --> 01:08:30,399
I hope he made you happy.
You know... a few laughs.

806
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:36,227
I've got two photos of you.

807
01:08:37,231 --> 01:08:40,738
But that's it. That's my past.

808
01:08:41,581 --> 01:08:45,803
My history is two photos. One of them's blurred.

809
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,992
Don't matter.

810
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,695
I hope she'll be as lovely as you.

811
01:08:57,863 --> 01:09:00,325
Well, she will.

812
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:08,109
I wish I'd known you. I wish we'd had...

813
01:09:09,914 --> 01:09:12,741
Well, you know, something to...

814
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,852
Just something.

815
01:09:26,835 --> 01:09:30,375
If you bump into Uncle Albert, say thanks.

816
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:39,202
There you are, Rodney.
I've been looking for you.

817
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:43,950
I thought I'd take her out for a walk.
Did a bit of tidying up.

818
01:09:46,947 --> 01:09:50,296
She's a little heartbreaker, eh?

819
01:09:51,577 --> 01:09:55,038
- Have you got a name for her yet?
- Mm.

820
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:22,173
Joan. Do you like your name?

821
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,558
Del, can I ask you a question?

822
01:10:31,004 --> 01:10:33,387
What's that?

823
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:40,212
Other than looks, was he like me in any way?

824
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:45,727
- Who?
- You know who. Freddie Robdal.

825
01:10:47,366 --> 01:10:49,352
My father.

826
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:56,095
Freddie the Frog was a professional burglar.

827
01:10:56,265 --> 01:10:58,568
He was disloyal to his friends.

828
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:02,405
He was a womaniser,
a home-breaker, a con man,

829
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:05,600
a thief, a liar and a cheat.

830
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:11,858
So, no, Rodney, you're nothing like him.

831
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,405
Come on. Let's go home, bruv.

832
01:11:35,533 --> 01:11:39,516
- Can I ask you a question, Rodders?
- Fire away.

833
01:11:39,683 --> 01:11:42,474
Where did that runway come from?

834
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:48,462
I don't fancy making that film any more.

835
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:52,652
You know what, Rodders?
That's a bloody good idea.
