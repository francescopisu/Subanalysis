1
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:07,166
# Stick a pony in me pocket

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,840
# I'll fetch the suitcase from the van

3
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:15,681
# 'Cause if you want the best 'uns
but you don't ask questions

4
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:18,725
# Then, brother, I'm your man

5
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:22,838
# 'Cause where it all comes from
is a mystery

6
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:26,841
# It's like the changing of the seasons
and the tides of the sea

7
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:30,443
# But here's the one
what's driving me berserk:

8
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:34,084
# Why do only fools and horses work? #

9
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:54,399
Del... got a minute
to run a leather over my Mini?

10
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,764
Marlene, I'm not a car cleaner.

11
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:05,318
I merely agreed to do some driving for Boycie.

12
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:10,402
Sorry, darling, I forgot.
Just doing it to earn some money?

13
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:13,999
No, no. This is a hobby of mine.

14
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:19,639
I love driving you and Boycie
to weddings, waiting till midnight.

15
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:24,039
Yes, Marlene, I'm doing it to earn a few quid.

16
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:28,564
I've got a few problems on the financial front.

17
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:32,117
Being bankrupt doesn't help, does it?

18
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:36,679
I never thought of that!

19
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,200
Marlene,

20
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:42,360
finish your make-up. You should
be ready for the second coat.

21
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:47,521
Keep your noise down, Boycie,
or people will think we're vulgar!

22
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:52,556
- Del, coffee?
- Cheers, Boyce.

23
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:56,845
No, I mean go and make me a cup!

24
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:01,358
Boyce, you know this car's a GTi?

25
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,916
If you rearrange the letters,

26
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,602
you've got a personalised number plate!

27
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:10,361
Two sugars in mine.

28
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,479
- Good afternoon!
- Afternoon.

29
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,366
Have Mr and Mrs Boyce moved?

30
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,559
Er, no. They're in prison.

31
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:32,436
- What?
- I'm searching the house.

32
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:35,440
- I'm from the Drug Squad.
- My word!

33
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:41,639
They will be on parole soon, so watch your step!

34
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,559
Thank you, Officer.

35
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:47,196
Not at all, Ma'am.

36
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,121
"Two sugars"!

37
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:58,280
I shouldn't go in my condition.
I can't smell my own aftershave.

38
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:01,359
But I can't smell Del's either, so that's a plus!

39
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:04,166
Keep your mouth shut at this wedding.

40
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:06,761
Don't be sarcastic to my family.

41
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:09,999
That'll limit the conversation!

42
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,398
They make Grant Mitchell look intelligent!

43
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm fed up having to defend you.
OK, you're ugly, but successful.

44
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:26,160
It's taken years to convince
my mum you're not a vampire!

45
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:31,724
Looking forward to the wedding?

46
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:35,200
You look lovely, darling!

47
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:44,519
Did I tell you about my new business deal?

48
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:47,804
Yes, two or three dozen times!

49
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:53,121
In a few weeks, Boycie will fly
to Paris to sign the contract!

50
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:59,840
- He'll be a multimillionaire!
- I'll wet meself in a minute.

51
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,966
Should we buy a new house
or have this renovated?

52
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:07,039
Marlene, have some sensitivity.

53
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:12,235
Don't talk about millions
and big houses in front of Del.

54
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:17,879
It must have been awful for you
and Raquel having that money

55
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:22,404
- and then losing it.
- Good comes out of bad, Boycie.

56
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:28,119
Raquel says she now appreciates
the little things of life.

57
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:34,318
Marlene knows all about that.
She had no choice!

58
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:43,526
When the contract's signed, Del,
we'll get together for a chat

59
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:46,804
about what you did
when you became a millionaire.

60
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:51,245
Make sure I don't make the same mistakes!

61
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:58,843
Marlene, where's my hair gel?

62
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,761
- Wherever you left it.
- Oh.

63
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,646
- Uncle Rodders...
- Hmm?

64
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:02,879
What was my dad like as a teenager?

65
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,366
Horrible.

66
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,121
Boo Yukka Shah!

67
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:14,640
- Uncle Rodders...
- Hmm?

68
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,402
- What'll I be like in my teens?
- Horrible.

69
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:20,606
Yes!

70
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,638
Mum, Rodders says
I'll be horrible when I grow up.

71
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:29,278
- Did he?
- All teenagers are horrible.

72
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:34,475
- The "Kevin and Perry" period.
- They are a bit annoying.

73
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:39,675
But when you're 21, a man
becomes sensible and normal.

74
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:46,161
Anyway, I squeezed this tube
of onion puree into his hair gel.

75
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:54,045
So Boycie goes to the wedding
smelling like a Big Mac!

76
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,244
That's the theory, anyway!

77
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:00,080
What's happening? Anything on the go?

78
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:04,081
- What's that?
- Nothing to worry about.

79
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:10,402
I'm the managing director
of Trotters Independent Traders.

80
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:13,161
Cool! He's better than "The Beano"!

81
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:18,476
- Hang about.
- You were declared bankrupt.

82
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:23,675
You're banned from running
any company or dealing in shares.

83
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:28,204
You can't even ride past
the Stock Exchange on a bike!

84
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:31,200
You owe the Inland Revenue P50,000!

85
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:35,565
Who's out earning money, driving for Boycie,

86
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:40,118
- while you sit on your IQ!
- I'm trying to eat!

87
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,237
I'll take this conference call
into the boardroom. All right!

88
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:49,080
Sorry, pal, what did you say?

89
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,922
Just Rodney reminding me who's in charge.

90
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,123
What?

91
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,000
A-ha!

92
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:03,280
Sorry to spoil your appetite,
but we can't hide from this.

93
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:08,567
We need the money
or the Inland Revenue will sell this flat

94
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,322
and we'll all be up... I don't know.

95
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:15,843
- I've got responsibilities.
- I know.

96
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:20,080
- Del will think of something.
- Should that encourage me?

97
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:24,843
- Del got us in this mess!
- The judge blamed both of you!

98
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:29,159
"Like two Neros playing
while your empire burnt."

99
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:34,560
We may have been two Neros,
but only one was fiddling!

100
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,440
Yeah, cushty, Monkey.

101
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:41,963
All right, we'll see you, Monkey.

102
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:45,199
Bonjour, Monkey. That was Monkey.

103
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,442
He's had a consignment
of log-effect fires from Slovakia.

104
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:57,522
I don't want a load of Slovakian log-effect fires.

105
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:01,521
- That's what I told him.
- Oh. Good.

106
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:06,397
- How did you know that?
- We know what we both think.

107
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,957
We've always been telescopic.

108
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:13,802
These gas fires, they're selling
like hot cakes.

109
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,606
Paddy the Greek bought 150.

110
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:21,158
He sold 'em to a builder for 50 quid a pop.

111
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,400
- P50 apiece?
- Yep. And Lenny the gas fitter.

112
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,196
He's putting one in each room
of a big house he's doing.

113
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:34,282
I thought, "Easy money."
Then I thought, "There's business,

114
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:38,406
"and then there's what Rodney's doing."

115
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,799
- We're into party planning!
- Yes.

116
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:46,642
- It's big.
- Yes, up in Sloane Square

117
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:50,686
where they like a roasted pepper
and couscous!

118
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:55,125
In Peckham they like a kebab and a tattoo!

119
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:59,439
They are very fond of log-effect gas fires.

120
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:03,077
Well, I am interested in them now.

121
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:06,523
Good. I told him we'd have 20.

122
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:12,324
Oi! Oi, oi, will you stop that?

123
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,160
That is your uncle's urn!

124
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:23,196
- What are you doing up?
- It's a daytime tradition!

125
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:27,804
Yes, but you're pregnant.
You must rest. Where were you going?

126
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,481
- To get some juice.
- I'll get it.

127
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,922
- I can get the juice.
- I'll get the juice.

128
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,922
- I'm good at getting juice.
- For God's sake, I'll get it!

129
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,442
Damien, get the juice.

130
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:46,284
You've got to calm down, Rodney.
You'll be a nervous wreck.

131
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:51,396
You've got to be strong,
physically and mentally.

132
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,764
I remember the night Damien was born.

133
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,164
It was a wonderful moment.

134
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:03,605
But it was very traumatic and very stressful.

135
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:09,518
It wasn't a walk in the park for Raquel, either!

136
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:13,680
No, it wasn't. I'll get some more tea.

137
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:19,080
I'm getting some cereal.
Me, not you, not anyone else. Just me.

138
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:21,841
OK. Just be careful.

139
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,998
Oh, my God!

140
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,637
Rodney, sit down. Behaving like a moby.

141
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:33,040
I've waited a long time for this baby.
It mustn't go wrong.

142
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,243
Fair enough.

143
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:39,241
There's one thing I don't understand.

144
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:44,356
A year ago, you and Cassandra
were really trying for a baby.

145
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:47,439
You was at it like a pair of goats.

146
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:52,840
You became so pale you had
to have your passport photo redone.

147
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,683
Stop discussing my private life
in front of Damien!

148
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,077
Yes, OK. Sorry.

149
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:04,525
Anyway, when nothing happened,
she sent you to Harley Street

150
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:09,317
- to have your whatsit tested.
- I know!

151
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:14,197
I couldn't get the milk
in the fridge for specimens!

152
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:22,999
You said if it wasn't for the magazines,
you'd pack it in!

153
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:31,085
We weren't successful at first.
They thought I had a low count.

154
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:36,605
You were to and fro for ages.
Shame they didn't do air miles!

155
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:40,919
Low count? Who was
on the calculator - Trigger?

156
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,725
I don't believe you!

157
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,675
Then you change your mind
about having a chavvy

158
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:49,520
and go late-night shopping
at family planning.

159
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:54,158
We discussed it. Our initial
reaction was, naturally,

160
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:58,320
to wait until the financial
climate was more conducive.

161
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:02,002
Then we had a change of heart.

162
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:07,161
I understand that. But you'll
have the bailiffs as godparents!

163
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:13,884
This baby is a token
of our belief in our marriage,

164
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:18,120
in Trotters Independent Traders
and in the future of Britain.

165
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:24,123
But most important, as a token
of our belief in this family.

166
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,005
Rodney...

167
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,521
...if your mother could hear you
she'd be so proud.

168
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,918
- It's how we feel.
- Good boy!

169
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:40,362
- I know how you get babies.
- I bet you do!

170
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,405
It must have been horrible!

171
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,555
He's a lad, isn't he?

172
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:50,606
- I'll kick his teeth in!
- Thank you.

173
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:59,201
He does my head in. I bet
he nicked your contraceptive pills.

174
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:05,715
- Don't be so silly!
- No, I searched this flat!

175
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,526
No, it was him, rat boy!

176
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,756
- He's only young.
- He seems to know everything.

177
00:14:12,927 --> 00:14:16,966
He's a cross between
Harry Potter and Swampy.

178
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:22,281
Rodders, we've got business to sort out.
Go and start the van.

179
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,996
He ain't used to me being in charge yet!

180
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,237
- See you later.
- Bye.

181
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:29,965
Bye!

182
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,764
"Final reminder".

183
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:34,883
"Final reminder".

184
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,958
"Final reminder".

185
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,836
"This is not a circular".
No, it's a final reminder.

186
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,601
This letter's addressed to Albert Trotter.

187
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:47,396
The Royal Naval Association. They haven't heard.

188
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,242
- Should we open it?
- No, leave it to Del.

189
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:55,878
I'm off, sweetheart. See you later, Cassandra.

190
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:59,562
A letter's arrived from
the Seamen's Association.

191
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,321
Oh, that'll be for Rodney.

192
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,803
Tea, please, Carol. All right, Boycie?

193
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,685
Denzil.

194
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,003
What's happening?

195
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,965
One of nature's great phenomenons.

196
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:34,166
One that, sadly,
David Attenborough has ignored.

197
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:38,639
It's called "The Trotters
try to park a three-wheel van".

198
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:43,244
No, hard on your left! Right, that's it.

199
00:15:43,407 --> 00:15:45,921
- Hard on your left!
- My left?

200
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,078
Right hand down!

201
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:52,525
- Hard on your left, Dave!
- Will you shut up!

202
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,040
Eh?

203
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,437
It's the wrong angle!

204
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,075
How's business?

205
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,397
What business?

206
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:06,759
I just got myself a new truck
and haven't had any work since.

207
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:12,081
- It's all bad news these days.
- You could be wrong.

208
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,847
I'm in the motor trade, right?

209
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,726
Recently, a fellow mason from my lodge

210
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:24,405
mentioned my firm to a player
whose name I cannot divulge.

211
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:29,721
He's a Lebanese gentleman
who's made his mark in Europe.

212
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,079
I'll pull out and straighten up.

213
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,757
They reverse vasectomies
quicker than this!

214
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:47,602
- Shut up, will ya?
- Hard on your left, Dave!

215
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:53,285
So, what's his business?

216
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,564
He's in the commercial sector.

217
00:16:56,727 --> 00:17:00,481
Negotiations are at a very sensitive stage.

218
00:17:00,647 --> 00:17:04,799
But in a few weeks, Boyce Autos
could own the UK franchise

219
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:07,322
for most of them cheap cars in Europe.

220
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,763
Great! So where do I fit in?

221
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,600
You? You don't.

222
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:19,276
So why are you telling me, then?

223
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:22,598
You said it was all bad news, but it isn't.

224
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:26,840
Next month, I could be a millionaire.

225
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:29,965
I don't soddin' believe you, Boycie!

226
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,721
I'm trying to cheer you up.

227
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,561
Can you smell onions?

228
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:44,159
If you can't do it, I'll do it myself!

229
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:49,959
- Oi! Who's running this firm?
- It's got you puzzled as well?

230
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,799
At last!

231
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,716
- You can't park there, Dave.
- Eh?

232
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,640
Too close to a council installation.

233
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:19,123
It's my duty as an environmental hygienist
to uphold the law.

234
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:22,404
- What's in that thing?
- Freezing salt.

235
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:27,687
People like me have to spread it
on the roads in icy conditions.

236
00:18:28,447 --> 00:18:30,597
What icy conditions?!

237
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:34,680
I attend lectures on modern climactic change.

238
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:39,045
What with global warming and Al Pacino...

239
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,880
El Nino, Trig.

240
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:46,317
You don't know what's gonna happen.

241
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:49,925
We're getting a bite to eat.

242
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,716
If I buy you two pints and a cheese roll

243
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,765
will you turn a blind eye?

244
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,600
- Are you bribing me?
- Yes.

245
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:04,077
- All right, then.
- Good. Come on, let's go.

246
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,045
I'll tell 'em what I think of 'em.

247
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:12,200
- What's up?
- Neighbours won't talk to us.

248
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:16,645
They're looking down their noses
like we're criminals!

249
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:20,880
They're jealous
about my European deal. Ignore 'em.

250
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,477
- OK, what's so funny?
- Your advert!

251
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,480
It's just stupid. Look, Rodney,

252
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:32,959
- I used to run my own firm.
- You got probation for that.

253
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:37,484
It didn't go as I'd planned,
true, but the point is,

254
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:42,004
- nobody reads the small ads.
- That's where you're wrong.

255
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:47,400
Two months ago, Boycie
put an ad in for his car firm.

256
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:52,038
It read, "Urgently required, security guard."

257
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:56,166
That night, his showroom was burgled.

258
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:02,004
Someone reads the small ads!

259
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,160
- He's right!
- I've got business to see to.

260
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:10,843
You've got to cash
that giro cheque, haven't you?

261
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:16,122
Hello, Cassandra. How's my godchild?

262
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:19,438
I don't know, Mickey, but MY baby's fine.

263
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:23,800
- Here's the mum-to-be.
- Hello!

264
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,084
What are you doing walking about?

265
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:33,038
We got fed up so I'm getting
some exercise. Doctor's orders.

266
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:36,802
Doctors say to carry on as normal.

267
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,562
You're not having a natural birth, are you?

268
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:44,003
- We discussed a birthing pool.
- With the damp in your flat,

269
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:47,045
I wouldn't bother!

270
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:55,001
Shame you don't have
any fire grates in your place.

271
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:00,002
Lenny Corby's fitting eight
log-effect fires in our house.

272
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:04,638
I'll invite you and the family
for the switching-on ceremony.

273
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:09,881
- Something to look forward to.
- I'm having an adrenaline rush!

274
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:15,319
When the baby's born, don't worry if it's ugly.

275
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:19,480
- They're all ugly at birth.
- Some more ugly than others.

276
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:24,846
When Boycie was born,
the midwife slapped his mother!

277
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,360
On that note, I'll bid you all goodbye.

278
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:36,566
Marlene, you can drive me to the showroom.

279
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,719
- See you, Cassandra, Raquel.
- Bye!

280
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:43,197
Del, I brought that letter addressed to Albert.

281
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,925
Albert?

282
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:48,318
I hope you don't have my experience.

283
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:52,526
From the moment the baby arrived,
my wife gave me hell.

284
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,520
Women get post-natal depression.

285
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:57,882
But we'd adopted!

286
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:04,682
Take no notice. Sid's a cantankerous,
miserable old sod.

287
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:07,202
His wife was hot-blooded. Spanish.

288
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:12,122
He only taught her English
so he could stop speaking to her!

289
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,437
Rodders, listen to this.

290
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:19,362
A naval friend of Albert
is organising a reunion

291
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:24,203
for the crew of the fleet
that went to Denmark in 1944.

292
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:27,643
- Did Albert go to Denmark?
- No, the fleet never made it.

293
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:32,198
I remember him saying. The ships
were named after sea creatures.

294
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:36,406
HMS Shark, HMS Barracuda...
What was Albert's ship?

295
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,956
HMS Cod.

296
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:46,676
Yeah. He said they got into trouble
but it wasn't his fault.

297
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:51,967
- That would have been a first!
- It's in a village in Normandy.

298
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:55,517
Write and say Albert isn't with us any more.

299
00:22:55,687 --> 00:22:57,917
I suppose so.

300
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:01,875
It's a shame Elsie Partridge
didn't live long enough to go.

301
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,882
- She'd love representing him.
- Remember their story?

302
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,561
They fell in love before the war.

303
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:14,278
He had to go and fight and they
both married other people.

304
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:20,044
Years later, they met again
and spent their last years together.

305
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:25,319
What's up with that scatty cow?

306
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,637
Her hormones do somersaults
'cause she's pregnant.

307
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:34,480
Oh. You're all right, ain't you?

308
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,319
Yes!

309
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:40,526
It's like "Captain Corelli's Mandolin".

310
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:47,200
What's Captain Pirelli's mandarin?

311
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:50,165
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin".

312
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:54,081
A film about two lovers
who meet again after the war.

313
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,681
A woman's thing.

314
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:00,037
I've had a thought.

315
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:05,361
If Elsie can't represent Albert,
Rodney and I ought to go.

316
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,884
That's a brilliant suggestion.
Albert would love that idea.

317
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:15,804
He's not the only one. You two
are going on a booze cruise!

318
00:24:16,527 --> 00:24:21,282
- That hurts, Raquel.
- That's a cruel thing to say.

319
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:27,556
This is a family thing. We just
want Albert to be remembered.

320
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,844
It's like... It's our duty.

321
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:35,717
- Sorry, I was only joking!
- I know you didn't mean it.

322
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:40,483
Raquel, Cassandra, look, a picture of my wife.

323
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,115
Come and have a look.

324
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:47,997
We could take Albert's ashes
and scatter them at sea.

325
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:51,239
That's a very good idea, Rodney.

326
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,240
He would really like that.

327
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:57,638
We'll have to do it
as we come out of the harbour,

328
00:24:57,807 --> 00:25:02,562
because we'll be too pissed to do it later.

329
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:10,839
You drive Raquel and Cassandra home.
I'll pick up the bill.

330
00:25:11,007 --> 00:25:12,565
- Sure?
- Yeah.

331
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,719
Sid, what are all these little holes?

332
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,605
Darts.

333
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,243
It's a long story. We met in 1950...

334
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:25,843
- Want a lift home?
- Yes, please!

335
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,282
- Bye!
- See you.

336
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:31,166
Sid, take it out of that.

337
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:34,478
- Have you still got your lorry?
- Yeah. Why?

338
00:25:34,647 --> 00:25:37,525
Me and Rodney may go to France.

339
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:41,726
- Do you want some rolls?
- Thanks. No, not now!

340
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:46,802
Next month. Got an idea in me head.

341
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:50,437
- No.
- No? You haven't heard it yet.

342
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:54,885
Good. The police can't drag it
out of me under interrogation.

343
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,515
What are you on about?

344
00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:01,839
When you have an idea, someone
in a uniform asks me questions!

345
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:05,682
Can I help it if I am misunderstood?

346
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:11,479
Oh, I understand. You can get
booze very cheaply in France.

347
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:14,719
I've got a lorry, Sid's got a pub.

348
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,879
So what are you saying?

349
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:23,803
I'm saying Del buys P1,000-worth
of half-price alcohol,

350
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:27,482
we drive it back, Sid gets a load of cheap booze,

351
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:29,683
and we share the profits.

352
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:34,796
No, I was thinking of bringing
you some French cheese.

353
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,879
But now you've suggested that...

354
00:26:38,047 --> 00:26:41,676
- That's a brilliant idea!
- First class.

355
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:46,284
A few trips and we'd earn some decent money.

356
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:50,406
- I'm not doing it.
- It was your idea!

357
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,842
No, it wasn't!

358
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:56,124
Well, it was in a way. I mean...

359
00:26:56,287 --> 00:27:00,917
That's not what I meant. I was
trying to... I didn't mean...

360
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,397
The thing is, I was just trying to...

361
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:10,202
- Is this anywhere near legal?
- Of course! Don't tell Rodney.

362
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:41,846
Here, Rodney. You do the honours.

363
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:46,285
- He would have liked it.
- Yes.

364
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:49,598
Do it ceremoniously.

365
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:54,045
Not like you're emptying a hoover bag.

366
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:14,564
See you again sometime, Unc.

367
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,639
Good luck, old 'un.

368
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:20,367
(RATTLING)

369
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:24,679
- Did you hear that?
- Hope it's not his dentures!

370
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,799
- I don't believe it.
- What?

371
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:39,001
- Cassandra's contraceptives!
- Cassandra's pills?

372
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:43,718
- Who put 'em in there?
- Who do you think? Damien!

373
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,477
He's a boy, isn't he?

374
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:53,037
You don't need 'em. She's up the duff!

375
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:56,643
But if he hadn't put... You know.

376
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,797
- He's a little sod, isn't he?
- Yeah.

377
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:08,357
I dunno where he gets it from.

378
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:14,238
- Must take after Raquel, eh?
- Yeah! More than likely!

379
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:16,523
Come on.

380
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:32,485
(DEL) Right, we travel up
this road another three miles.

381
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,400
Then look for a sign saying,

382
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:39,606
"Sainte Claire La Chapelle". Right?

383
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,119
(VAN BACKFIRES)

384
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:51,235
- Where'd you get that?!
- What, this?

385
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:56,117
Well, I'm gonna blend in
with the locals, Rodney.

386
00:29:56,287 --> 00:30:00,041
I've always been a bit of a Francophile.

387
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:05,201
- More like a Franco Spencer!
- Just keep driving, will ya?

388
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:09,995
Anyway, where is my book? Ah!

389
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,567
Bone up on the old French.

390
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:16,321
Amazing how quick you forget it.

391
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:18,603
- I noticed (!)
- Hmm?

392
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:22,043
I've forgotten the French I learned at school.

393
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:26,519
Don't you worry. I'll be with you.

394

(REGULAR BACKFIRING)

395
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:36,435
It is a difficult language, you know.

396
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:41,078
One of my most favouritest meals
is duck a I'orange.

397
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:45,559
- I can't say that in French.
- It's "canard".

398
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:49,803
You can say that again, bruv!

399
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:54,483
The French word for duck is "canard".

400
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:59,596
Is it? I thought that was
something to do with the QE2!

401
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:03,237
No, that's Cunard. They make the boats.

402
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,967
The French for duck is "canard".

403
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:11,804
Lovely jubbly. So how do
the French say "a I'orange"?

404
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:18,046
- A I'orange!
- The same as we do?

405
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:19,640
Yes!

406
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:25,757
Oh, dear! It's a pity they don't
use more of our words, innit?

407
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:31,117
- Yeah. Stupid, aren't they?
- Yeah.

408
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,601
(DEL) I can't wait to get there, Rodders.

409
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,679
I bet they'll throw a mardigras.

410
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:41,078
The French don't scrimp on celebrations.

411
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:45,445
(RODNEY) I imagine it'll be
a quiet backwater somewhere.

Bonjour, Monsieur. Bonjour.

419
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,478
Excuse me. Did you say "Trotter"?

420
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:34,480
We're Albert Trotter's great-nephews.

421
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:38,242
Very pleased to meet you. George Parker.

422
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:41,160
I sailed with your uncle during the war.

423
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,286
- Is Albert not coming?
- No, I'm afraid not.

424
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:49,565
Unfortunately, he passed away
a few months ago.

425
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:52,287
I'm very sorry to hear that.

426
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:55,118
Yeah, so are we.

427
00:32:57,327 --> 00:33:00,080
Well, where's the crew?

428
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:01,566
Crew?

429
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:05,720
Oh, I'm the only one that's turned up.

430
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:10,722
The others are either dead,
in homes or couldn't be bothered.

431
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:16,644
I see. Well, we're here to represent Albert.

432
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:20,197
- So let's get started!
- Mr Mayor.

(DENZIL) We should have got a later ferry.

439
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:08,641
But did I say that?
No, I listened to Del as I always do.

440
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,604
(TRIGGER) Still,

441
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,201
it gives us time to see France.

We've got sodding hours to kill!

Relax, Denzil, relax.

444

Corinne was always saying that.

445

"Relax, Denzil".

446
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,441
And I would.

447
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:38,566
- Then Del would phone...
- I liked Corinne.

448
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:43,083
I used to hope that if I got married,

449
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:47,126
- it'd be to a girl like her.
- Yeah, she was OK.

450
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,960
Ever thought of getting married?

451
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:54,279
No, I haven't met the right person yet.

452
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:58,918
I've always had this image
of my perfect woman.

- My dream girl.
- What's she like?

454

Oh, that's Albert, all right!

460
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:37,756
You two haven't a clue.
You've led lives of luxury.

461

You don't know what it is
to suffer on the high seas.

462
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:46,285
Actually, we do.
We've served our time at sea.

463
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:50,645
- Where? In the Falklands?
- A cruise around Hawaii.

464
00:35:50,807 --> 00:35:55,323
- A cruise-liner is not a ship!
- Kept the water off our feet.

465
00:35:56,727 --> 00:36:01,847
On the Russian convoys, your
uncle and me had 100-foot waves!

466

It got a bit choppy round Honolulu one night.

467
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:10,316
- We had storm and tempest.
- You didn't see our cabaret!

468
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:14,526
- We had hail and sleet.
- We had Hale and Pace!

469
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:21,884
Sometimes I think about the future.

470
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:26,598
I don't want to end up
a lonely bachelor like my cousin Ronnie.

00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:35,839
Well, they were men!

- I'd like to meet a nice woman.
- Me, too.

- Take her for something to eat.
- Yeah.

478
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:55,322
Get to know each other a bit.
Might like each other.

479
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:58,240
Who knows, in time...

480
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:03,718
...maybe she might do
a bit of ironing for me!

481
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:10,204
There's something I want to know.

482
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,677
How come you, the crew
of a British naval vessel,

483
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:17,726
- ended up 30 miles inland?
- That's a long story.

484
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:22,756
- We gotta go.
- We were sailing in a flotilla.

485
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:24,804
Oh, God!

486
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:30,724
We were going to Denmark
to drop off supplies to the Marines.

487
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:35,483
Our ship, HMS Cod, was at the rear of the fleet

488
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:38,923
and Albert was at the wheel.

489
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:44,286
We got a radio message to say
a German fleet was approaching.

490
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:49,760
Soon, Jerry spotted us.
Albert, without waiting for orders,

491
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:54,443
threw the ship to port.
Five minutes later, we crashed.

492
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,201
- Into what?
- France!

493
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:03,283
We hit some rocks off Normandy
and ran aground.

494
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,405
We were sitting ducks.

495
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:10,162
Jerry was on our tail,
so we legged it overland.

496
00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:13,876
We were going for two days and nights.

497
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:18,404
We ended up here in this little village.

498
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:22,321
The people, God bless them,
took us in and hid us.

499
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:25,877
The Gestapo looked for us but never found us

500
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:29,198
until that fateful day when we were betrayed.

501
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:32,086
- You're kidding!
- No, no.

502
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:38,686
I don't want to upset you,
but Albert was a bit of a lad then.

503
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:42,601
He could sing, dance, play the piano.

504
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:46,555
The women liked him and he liked the women.

505
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:53,439
During our stay here... how shall
I put it? He kept himself busy.

506
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:55,563
Oh, no.

507
00:38:55,727 --> 00:39:00,642
I don't believe him, the garrity old git!

508
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:03,241
Tout de suite!

509
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:07,480
It was every man for himself in those days.

510
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:12,163
There was a war on. They were hard times...

511
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:30,037
(SILENT)

512
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:58,835
Most men were either away or locked up.

513
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:03,239
But when they heard about Albert
they weren't best pleased,

514
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,602
which was understandable.

515
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:09,442
- Who grassed you up?
- The French Resistance.

516
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:14,635
One day, the SS turned up
and rounded us all up.

517
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:19,198
Albert, with one or two others, escaped

518
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:22,359
and made it back to Blighty.

519
00:40:22,527 --> 00:40:27,396
Excuse me. Just going to the gents.

520
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,964
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

521
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:38,595
I think I am.

522
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,599
There's another one, look!

523
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:52,961
It's like a geriatric "Village of the Damned"!

524
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:58,482
I don't know about
"Sainte Claire La Chapelle".

525
00:40:58,647 --> 00:41:02,879
They should have renamed it "Trottersville".

526
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,606
(RODNEY) Think of the other
countries he visited

527
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,918
and what he must have got up to!
America, India...

528
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:13,124
(DEL) I bet he didn't leave Australia alone.

529
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:16,962
Africa, Middle East... Remember
that woman he mentioned?

530
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:20,199
He's been putting it about all over!

531
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:24,679
Raquel was wrong. It wasn't like
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin".

532
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:28,806
More like Captain Birds Eye's Banjo!

533
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,084
Merci beaucoup. Au revoir!

534
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,806
I really don't understand you.

535
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:49,118
We can buy a bottle
of duty-free wine on the ferry.

536
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:53,485
Yeah, but things in here
are a euro or two cheaper.

537
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:58,243
- And we've got to save money.
- Suppose so.

538
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,795
I don't believe it!

539
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:06,845
- What's that?
- Look over there.

540
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:09,965
- It's Denzil!
- You're having me on!

541
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:13,482
Hello, Denzil!

542
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:17,606
Hey! Del! Rod! Hi!

543
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:22,682
- Fancy meeting you here!
- What are you doing here?

544
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,237
I had a free day, and Christmas is coming,

545
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:29,479
so I popped over for a couple of packs of beer.

546
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:35,517
- What brings you here?
- We went to Albert's reunion.

547
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:41,683
Rodney said why don't we get
a case or two of wine, didn't you?

548
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:44,285
Yeah.

549
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:46,677
Have you got your truck here?

550
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:49,600
It's out the back. Why do you ask?

551
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:54,397
I was thinking, we haven't
got much room in our van,

552
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:58,845
and if Denzil's got space in his truck,

553
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:03,046
we could take a couple of extra cases. Hmm?

554
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:06,324
- Yeah, maybe.
- Del Boy!

555
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:11,641
- Dave!
- Trigger! Would you believe it?

556
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:14,924
Only if I'd been heavily sedated!

557
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:18,682
Hello, Trig! What are you doing here?

558
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:22,442
You said meet us here at four o'clock!

559
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:30,795
I don't believe you sometimes, Trigger!

560
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:35,518
- This is a set-up, isn't it?
- No, no, no, no, no!

561
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:39,362
- It's just a surprise for you!
- Right.

562
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:42,564
We're surrounded
by gallons of cheap booze,

563
00:43:42,727 --> 00:43:46,037
Denzil's truck's here
and the pub needs its cellar filled!

564
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,845
Oi, oi, oi!

565
00:43:48,007 --> 00:43:50,646
Keep the noise down!

566
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:53,367
OK, I admit it.

567
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:56,599
It's my fault. I agreed to it.

568
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:01,158
- Agreed to it with whom?
- With me!

569
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:03,921
I'm running the firm now!

570
00:44:04,087 --> 00:44:08,638
Everyone's at it. We're just
a bit slow on the uptake.

571
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:13,676
- I don't believe this!
- We need the money!

572
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:21,363
- OK, but I wasn't looking.
- You was in the toilet.

573
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:25,236
- You know it makes sense.
- I've paid, Del.

574
00:44:25,407 --> 00:44:30,720
- They're loading it out back.
- He's paid for it. Come on!

575
00:44:38,247 --> 00:44:40,317
Is this it?

576
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:43,320
And that.

577
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:48,319
Oh, my God!

578
00:44:48,487 --> 00:44:51,604
We'll help. We ain't got long.

579
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,520
- We got plenty of time.
- Yeah.

580
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:59,807
Wait, did any of us change
our watches to French time?

581
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:01,446
- No.
- No.

582
00:45:01,607 --> 00:45:05,839
No! God, we've only got half
an hour before the ferry leaves!

583
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,885
You dipstick, Rodney!

584
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:12,278
Oi! Pierre! Get out of it.

585
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:26,805
Mange-tout! Mange-tout!

586
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:39,399
Voila!

587
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:44,123
(RAQUEL) So how was Albert's reunion?

588
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:47,882
Brilliant. Thousands of people there.

589
00:45:48,047 --> 00:45:51,881
Thousands. There was a fly-past
and everything.

590
00:45:52,047 --> 00:45:54,880
I tried phoning you, but couldn't get through.

591
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:59,165
We had a letter. They've cut
the phone off. The bill's unpaid.

592
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:01,841
I'll sort it out tomorrow.

593
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:05,556
I'll say I couldn't call 'em
'cause they cut the phone off.

594
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:09,117
- Have you eaten?
- On the ferry. An omelette.

595
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:11,960
Del had a mutton Madras
and four Irish coffees.

596
00:46:12,127 --> 00:46:14,322
Very nice, too, thanks.

597
00:46:14,487 --> 00:46:18,719
You should have seen the size
of this wine warehouse we went to!

598
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:21,606
I said to Denzil we should have them here.

599
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:24,884
- Denzil was with you?
- Eh?

600
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:33,280
Yes, he was there. We bumped
into him. It was a coincidence.

601
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:36,359
- Yeah. Amazing (!)
- Yeah.

602
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,246
Look what I got here.

603
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:43,923
A bottle of champagne
to celebrate our safe return.

604
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:49,196
All the arrangements we made with Sid.

605
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:53,838
Del said, "Keep the pub cellar clear."
And what does he do?

606
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:57,682
- What?
- Well, you were there!

607
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:00,361
He let the brewery make a delivery!

608
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:05,317
The way that brewery carries on,
you'd think they owned the pub!

609
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,283
Trigger!

610
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:23,319
(DENZIL) Bloody hell!

611
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:29,926
So you just happened to meet
Denzil in a wine warehouse.

612
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:32,760
- Did Denzil have his lorry?
- Don't know.

613
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:36,761
- Didn't ask.
- It could carry a lot of beer.

614
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:40,681
- Did Denzil follow you back?
- No, he stayed there.

615
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:44,920
Yeah, he's having a little holiday.

616
00:47:45,087 --> 00:47:48,523
Yes. Ooh, look, I've just remembered.

617
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:51,485
I got you a French football shirt.

618
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:54,400
- Brilliant! Can I try it on?
- Course.

619
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:59,595
- Cass, some French perfume.
- I got you this, sweetheart.

620
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:02,076
There you are.

621
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:05,683
Oh, Del, they're lovely!

622
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:08,884
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

623
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:12,164
But zircon can be good company!

(MOBILE RINGS)

625
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:18,526
Hello?

626
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:23,396
- Del, it's Denzil.
- Denzil?!

627
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,003
Why's he phoning me from France?

628
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:31,957
No, he's at your garage.
I know what you're up to. Why lie?

629
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:36,484
I didn't think the truth
would do me any favours.

630
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,401
We need the money, Raquel. That's no lie.

631
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:44,276
Let me speak to him. Bonjour, Denzil.

632
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:50,357
Champs Elysees!

00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:53,797
(DEL) Sprechen Sie lingo?

634
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:57,004
Sprechen Sie de old Anglaisee?

635
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,637
Give it up, Del, he don't speak a word.

636
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,640
So what'll we do with him?

637
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,163
- Just let him go.
- We can't do that!

638
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,285
What would happen
to a stranger on this estate?

639
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:16,044
- He could be part of Al-Qaeda!
- Don't be stupid!

640
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:20,405
Does he look like he works
in a furniture store?

641
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:27,365
- No, no...
- Denzil, let's not go there.

642
00:49:27,527 --> 00:49:30,963
- We'll drop him off somewhere.
- What if the Old Bill pull him?

643
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:36,645
They'll take him
to the immigration centre in Croydon.

644
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,959
He was hiding in my truck.
That's a P2,000 fine!

645
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:45,837
Some illegals tell the police
who brought them in.

646
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:49,044
How would we fare under British justice?

647
00:49:49,207 --> 00:49:55,237
We can't leave him here.
He'd probably suffocate or something.

648
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:59,480
- We'll take him to the flat.
- What'll we say to Raquel?

649
00:49:59,647 --> 00:50:04,482
We got a bloke, don't know who
he is, but do him egg and chips.

650
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:08,356
- You are a plonker!
- Got a better idea?

651
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:13,396
We can keep an eye on him
and stop him going to the police.

652
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:17,037
Oh, I don't believe this! All right.

653
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:23,965
You carry on unloading
and we'll take him... somewhere.

654
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:33,957
- What shall we say?
- We'll have to play it by ear.

655
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:37,324
We've got to get him pugged away
somewhere.

656
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,045
Come on.

00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:54,922

- Course he does!

- Of course.
- Course he has a name.

- Well?
- His name?

00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,726
His name... His name is Gary.

671
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:49,844
Yes, this is Gary.

672
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:53,276
Good old Gary!

673
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:57,278
- Nice to meet you, Gary.
- Hi, Gary!

674
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,483
He's...

675
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:04,284
He's a little bit shy.

676
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:08,725
He probably wants to sit down.
Gary, sit down. Good boy.

677
00:52:08,887 --> 00:52:11,447
He's sitting, look.

678
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:14,758
- Where do you know him from?
- Who? Gary?

679
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,645
Yeah.

680
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:21,164
- Um...
- From Rodney's evening school.

681
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:23,682
Yes, from evening school.

682
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:27,840
But I was at your evening school.
That's where we met.

683
00:52:28,007 --> 00:52:31,716
- I don't remember Gary.
- It's another evening school.

684
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:35,926
- When did you go there, then?
- One evening.

685
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,644
Would you like something to drink?

686
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:44,445
Gary?

687
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:48,886
Gary!

688
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,396
Yes, he said, "Gary!"

689
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:59,957
It's the way he says it! "Gary"!

690
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:04,122
He can't speak English, can he?

691
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:10,157
What? Him? Speak English?
Once he starts, he doesn't stop!

692
00:53:10,327 --> 00:53:14,525
Did you meet Rodney at evening school, Gary?

693
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:17,726
Gary!

694
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:23,206
Oh, my God, he's an illegal immigrant!

695
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,121
Shh! Don't say that too loud
round this estate!

696
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,404
- You'll cause a panic!
- We've got an illegal!

697
00:53:31,687 --> 00:53:35,566
Sweetheart, I'm really sorry.
It's nothing to do with us.

698
00:53:35,727 --> 00:53:40,642
- He was in Denzil's lorry.
- We hadn't a clue he was there.

699
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:43,241
He must have snuck in.

700
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:46,080
- What will you do with him?
- I dunno.

701
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:48,477
- He can't stay here.
- Where will he go?

702
00:53:48,647 --> 00:53:51,241
Shall we sit him down to watch the football?

703
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:56,765
If we chuck him out, he'll be
a crack addict by the second half!

704
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:01,125
What we might have to do...

705
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:03,118
No, no. No, no, no.

706
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,960
No, it's all right.

707
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:11,155
Look, it's a lighter, see? Lighter. Right?

708
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:16,084
Gary!

709
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:30,923
"Two teaspoons of curry paste."

710
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:33,203
That's one...

711
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,406
Two...

712
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:39,445
One for the pot. Cushty.

713
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:40,926
Yes!

714
00:54:41,087 --> 00:54:45,638
- I can smell something.
- You can't wait, can you?

715
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:47,479
I can!

716
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:51,686
You've got to take your time with this.

717
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:54,361
The longer the better!

718
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:57,485
I have to find out what nationality Gary is

719
00:54:57,647 --> 00:55:00,684
and send him to whoever represents his people.

720
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:04,726
But he doesn't speak English,
so how will you do that?

721
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:06,605
Well...

722
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:09,327
Yeah. Good point.

723
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:13,002
- Where's Gary?
- He's having a shower.

724
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:15,317
I've lent him some of Del's clothes.

725
00:55:15,487 --> 00:55:18,365
Give him some of Del's aftershave too!

726
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:22,315
No, things are bad enough for him as it is!

727
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:25,638
Del, Rodney's only gone and...

728
00:55:25,807 --> 00:55:31,404
Look at that! I'm calling this "Chicken Trotter".

729
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:34,877
That could be a very apt name for it!

730
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:45,437
OK, Gary?

731
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:47,040
Gary.

732
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:50,165
Come and sit down, son.

733
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:58,565
Oh, my God!
He looks like a set of traffic lights!

734
00:55:58,727 --> 00:56:04,085
- Don't be rude!
- He's from a war-torn country.

735
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:07,205
Probably witnessed mass murder.

736
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:12,077
Maybe he was one of the murderers!

737
00:56:14,647 --> 00:56:17,719
He doesn't look like one.

738
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:21,436
In Del's pyjamas, Adolf Hitler wouldn't either!

739
00:56:21,607 --> 00:56:25,043
You could have colour-coordinated him!

740
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:28,643
Fashion design isn't my strong point.

741
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:31,162
Right, here we go!

742
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:35,605
Ah! Very nice. Very tasteful, Gary.

743
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,325
Gary!

744
00:56:37,487 --> 00:56:39,842
Get your laughing gear round that.

745
00:56:41,127 --> 00:56:45,166
- Why did you make curry?
- I wanted him to feel at home.

746
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:48,524
I don't think he's Asian. He's more Arabic.

747
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:54,319
Let's go to "Perfect Pizza"
for a pepperoni and sheep's head!

748
00:56:56,167 --> 00:57:01,161
It's only a ruby. No matter
if you're Asian, Arab or Eskimo,

749
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:04,046
everyone loves a ruby.

750
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:08,523
Ooh! Gary!

751
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:11,326
- Glass of water.
- Gary!

752
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:14,001
Get him a glass of water.

753
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:17,637
- He can finish that out there.
- Gary!

754
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:24,365
Maybe the vindaloo was a bit hot for the boy?

755
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:25,846
(DOORBELL)

756
00:57:26,007 --> 00:57:28,282
- It's the police!
- This is great.

757
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:31,405
I'll give birth in Holloway!

758
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:34,798
Shh! I don't know. Shh!

759
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:40,360
- Hello? Who is it?
- Del, it's Boycie!

760
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:43,883
It's OK. It's only Boycie.

761
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,240
What an unpleasant surprise!

762
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,162
- Rodney.
- Boycie.

763
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:58,079
Good evening, Raquel. You look lovely tonight.

764
00:57:58,247 --> 00:58:00,761
You too, Cassandra.

765
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:05,796
You have that maternal glow
from being in the family way.

766
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:12,362
- Hello, little man.
- Do not touch me, batty boy.

767
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:18,879
- He's a character, isn't he?
- What do you want, Boycie?

768
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:23,199
- Cognac would be lovely.
- You'll be lucky!

769
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,756
Here you are, Rodney.

770
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:29,442
Boycie, no way am I driving for you tonight.

771
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:33,680
No, it's not that, Del. I've got a problem.

772
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:37,157
I've been chucked out of my house!

773
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:40,721
- Good for Marlene!
- She's finally done it!

774
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:46,120
Marlene didn't. The police did.
The house is full of gas.

775
00:58:46,287 --> 00:58:51,566
Those bloody log-effect fires
Lenny Corby fitted are leaking.

776
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:55,322
The gas board can't turn it off at the mains

777
00:58:55,487 --> 00:58:58,843
'cause Lenny snapped the handle off!

778
00:58:59,007 --> 00:59:03,000
They evacuated the whole road.
Marlene's gone to her mum's

779
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:06,762
and I was going to a hotel,

780
00:59:06,927 --> 00:59:11,478
but I left everything in the house.
Wallet, keys, the lot.

781
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:15,481
Fire brigade won't let me back in.
It's dangerous.

782
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:18,957
All I've got is what I'm wearing.

783
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:22,642
That's bad news, Boycie.
What are you doing here?

784
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:27,517
I was in trouble, so I thought
I'd go and see my best friend.

785
00:59:27,687 --> 00:59:30,645
But you decided to call here first?

786
00:59:30,807 --> 00:59:33,844
Derek has always been my best friend.

787
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:36,521
On yer bike, Boycie!

788
00:59:36,687 --> 00:59:41,317
I just need a bed for the night.
I'm at your mercy.

789
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:44,445
Why can't you stay at Marlene's mum's?

790
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:47,599
The batty old mare won't let me in!

791
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:50,327
We had a row at that wedding.

792
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:53,877
She cast doubt upon my personal hygiene.

793
00:59:54,047 --> 00:59:58,677
There was a horrible smell
of onion and she blamed me!

794
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:05,286
- Can't you stay with Trigger?
- Ever spent an evening there?

795
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:08,803
It's like having a seance with Mr Bean.

796
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:13,483
- Denzil has room at his place.
- He's not there!

797
01:00:14,847 --> 01:00:18,556
- It seems you don't want me.
- It's not that, Boycie.

798
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:20,285
It is!

799
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:23,405
It's just that we're overcrowded.

800
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:26,798
Raquel and I have our bedroom,
Cassandra and Rodney theirs,

801
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:29,242
- Damien's in his.
- The sofa will do.

802
01:00:29,407 --> 01:00:32,365
- Gary's sleeping on there.
- Gary?

803
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:34,246
Gary.

804
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:38,956
- Good God!
- Gary is Rodney's friend.

805
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:42,483
Did he get ready for bed in a power cut?

806
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:52,120
- They're your night clothes.
- Got it in one.

807
01:00:52,287 --> 01:00:57,600
Who else can combine lime green
and bright red and make it work?

808
01:00:57,767 --> 01:01:01,203
I've always had an eye for colour.

809
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:04,279
Derek, could I have a word, please?

810
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:07,519
Course you can, sweetheart.

811
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:23,525
Before you say anything,
Boycie's not staying.

812
01:01:23,687 --> 01:01:27,441
We've already got Gary.
At least he doesn't speak!

813
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:32,601
Lawrence of Peckham you may be,
but Boycie's not staying here.

814
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:35,406
Look, darling, sweetheart.

815
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:38,877
I feel just a little bit guilty, you see.

816
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:42,483
I made Boycie's hair smell like shepherd's pie.

817
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:44,126
Good!

818
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:48,166
No, because he wouldn't have
rowed with his in-laws.

819
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:54,038
He would have stayed there.
And then there's these gas fires.

820
01:01:54,207 --> 01:02:00,077
- Oh, no! You sold them?
- No, not me. It was Rodney.

821
01:02:00,247 --> 01:02:04,035
I said, "Don't sell 'em, they're dangerous."

822
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:07,722
But he wouldn't listen to me.

823
01:02:07,887 --> 01:02:11,721
I feel guilty. It's only one night!

824
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:16,726
OK. If they're not gone
by tomorrow evening, I will be!

825
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:22,200
They will be history. Thank you,
darling, you are a diamond!

826
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,120
No, it's just a little blister.

827
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:28,040
OK, Boycie, we've decided.

828
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:32,166
You can stay on the camp bed.
It's in the cupboard.

829
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:37,321
Perfect, Derek. Damien,
you're sleeping on a camp bed.

830
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,523
No, he is not!

831
01:02:39,687 --> 01:02:42,804
You get rid of kids to make way for adults.

832
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:47,404
But in your case
it's an exception. That or nothing.

833
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:51,003
OK, the camp bed it will have to be.

834
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,123
Here we are.

835
01:02:54,447 --> 01:02:58,201
I promise you'll hardly know I'm here.

836
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:05,285
Did you make that drink for me, Raquel?

837
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:08,564
Tell you what, I am starving!

838
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:15,924
- Fancy a plate of curry?

841
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:33,525
Are you still awake, Gary?

842
01:03:34,247 --> 01:03:35,965
Gary.

843
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:41,036
That curry's doing a conga in my colon!

844
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:47,847
I only had one mouthful.

845
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:52,523
- Are you still hungry, Gary?
- Gary.

846
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:55,679
I'll make us a sandwich.

847
01:04:12,327 --> 01:04:16,206
Do "sell by" dates mean nothing
to the Trotters?

848
01:04:16,367 --> 01:04:20,599
I've seen younger items
on the "Antiques Roadshow"!

849
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:23,804
It'll have to be cheese, Gary.

850
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:25,639
Gary!

851
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:37,039
Do you want piccalilli?

852
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:42,446
Are you cold, son? Get back into bed.

853
01:04:42,607 --> 01:04:47,203
Get back in there. Nice and warm. That's it.

854
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:51,600
Blimey, you are cold, aren't you?

855
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:59,604
Get the suitcase out,
set it up and I'll do the spiel.

856
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:03,077
Excuse me! Hello? I'm in charge now!

857
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:06,000
OK. What do you want to do?

858
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:09,117
I'll get the suitcase, you do the spiel.

859
01:05:09,287 --> 01:05:12,085
That's a good idea (!)

860
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:23,120
Hello, sweetheart! How are you?

861
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,926
- "One night", you said.
- Yeah, but...

862
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:29,966
Four bloody nights
they've slept in the living room!

863
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:33,039
OK, I'll have words, don't worry.

864
01:05:33,207 --> 01:05:39,077
Boycie puts that hair gel on
and then complains about the smell!

865
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:42,523
But I can't say anything to him.

866
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:45,520
Or he'll know it was me what done it.

867
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:51,159
Good news. The gas board
has cleared us to move back in.

868
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:55,957
- Thank you for being there.
- That's OK, Boycie.

869
01:05:56,127 --> 01:06:01,281
- You'd do the same for us.
- I suppose so.

870
01:06:01,447 --> 01:06:05,486
I'd get that smell sorted out if I were you.

871
01:06:05,647 --> 01:06:09,925
I reckon someone's dumped
a kebab in your air duct.

872
01:06:10,087 --> 01:06:12,317
You know that contract of mine?

873
01:06:12,487 --> 01:06:16,002
- Yes.
- I have to sign it in Paris.

874
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:21,002
I want you to drive me there.
Make the right impression.

875
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:24,398
So go and hire us a nice vehicle.

876
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:27,639
Your showroom is full of cars!

877
01:06:27,807 --> 01:06:31,117
Yes, but I want one that'll get us there!

878
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,519
You don't mind if I take your staff away?

879
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:39,919
Not at all. I'll come with you for the ride.

880
01:06:40,087 --> 01:06:46,003
Seeing me become a millionaire
may rekindle a few memories!

881

You are one flash git, aren't you?

882
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:56,400
Why don't we drop Gary off on the continent?

883
01:06:56,567 --> 01:07:02,244
Don't be stupid, Rodney!
We'd be the only ones ever to get fined

884
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:05,399
for smuggling someone OUT of the country!

885
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:09,924
I just saw him hitch-hiking
round the Elephant and Castle.

886
01:07:10,087 --> 01:07:14,239
- He's gone?
- Damien took him to football.

887
01:07:14,407 --> 01:07:20,437
I saw him in a campervan
with a bunch of Australian backpackers.

888
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:25,525
- Well, we did our best for him.
- Yeah.

889
01:07:25,687 --> 01:07:29,521
I suppose he'll see a bit of the world now.

890
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:34,479
Can you smell onions?

891
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,406
Yeah.

892
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:47,716
- I told you I'd get it sorted!
- Well done, Del.

893
01:07:47,887 --> 01:07:51,721
- I'll see you back at home.
- OK.

894

895

- It's a van!
- It's all they had!

896
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:12,961
- They were out of saloons.
- It's comfy.

898
