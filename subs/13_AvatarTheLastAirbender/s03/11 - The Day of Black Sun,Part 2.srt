220
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:30,070
The Firenation is falling back.

221
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:35,474
Sokka, we're on our way to victory.

222
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:52,091
No.

223
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:56,195
No, no, NO!

224
00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:01,322
Firelord Ozai, where are you?

225
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:38,739
Dad!

226
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,792
You’re on your feet again.

227
00:24:41,793 --> 00:24:43,140
Thanks to your sister.

228
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:46,611
I’m in no shape to fight
but maybe there is someway I could help.

229
00:24:46,908 --> 00:24:49,708
Everything’s going smoothly
and the eclipse hasn’t even kicked in yet.

230
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:55,938
Let’s hope our luck holds out.
Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong?

231
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,426
Yeah…. Is that… is that Aang?

232
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,679
What?

233
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,180
Please tell you’re here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a
big wimp and you didn’t even need the eclipse to take him down

234
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:14,861
He wasn’t home. No one was.
The entire palace city is abandoned.

235
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,048
They knew.

236
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:18,381
Aang: It’s over.

237
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:24,082
The Fire Lord is probably long gone. Far away on some
remote island where he’ll be safe during the eclipse.

238
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:29,349
No. My instincts tell me he wouldn’t go too far.
He would have a secret bunker.

239
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:33,874
Somewhere he could go so it’ll be safe during a
siege but still be close enough to lead his nation.

240
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:38,375
If it’s an underground secret bunker we’re
looking for, I’m just the girl to find it.

241
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,521
The Mechanist gave me this timing device.

242
00:25:40,722 --> 00:25:45,022
It looks like we’ve got about 10 minutes until the full eclipse.
10 minutes to find the Fire Lord.

243
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,113
We can still do this.
We can still win the day.

244
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,930
Wait. If they knew we were
coming, it could all be a trap.

245
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:55,994
Maybe we should use the time we have left to
make sure all of us get out of here safely.

246
00:25:56,654 --> 00:26:00,354
Everyone who’s here today came prepared
to risk everything for this mission.

247
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:02,064
They know what’s at stake.

248
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:07,513
If there’s still a chance and there’s still hope,
I think they would want Aang to go for it.

249
00:26:08,137 --> 00:26:08,637
What do you think?

250
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:13,347
You’re the one who has to face the Fire Lord.
Whatever you decide, I’m with you.

251
00:26:16,273 --> 00:26:17,273
I’ve got to try.

252
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:25,703
Do you feel anything down there

253
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,248
Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing
through the inside of the volcano.

254
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:33,069
Anything else?
Is there a structure somewhere?

255
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,809
There’s something big, dense, and made of
metal deep in the heart of the volcano.

256
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:41,453
Sokka: Sounds like a secret bunker to me.

257
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,847
Aang: Stay safe. We’ll be back soon.

258
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,390
Toph: This way! That one’s a dead end.

259
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:53,991
Sokka: What would we do without you?

260
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,933
Toph: Perish and burn in hot magma.

261
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,334
Yeah, pretty much.

262
00:27:01,474 --> 00:27:04,274
Toph: The tunnel continues on the other
side and it leads right to the bunker.

263
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:06,549
Sokka: We’ll have to be fast but careful.

264
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,670
Aang: How was that careful?

265
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:13,309
Sokka: I was wrong.
We need to be fast, careful and lucky.

266
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:22,874
Sokka: There’s no floor!
It’s just a river of lava.

267
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,230
Aang: Climb aboard and hold on tight.

268
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,559
Sokka: That’s some door!

269
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,088
Not a problem.

270
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,109
I am so glad we added you to the group.

271
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:28,796
Retreat! Everyone move to secondary
defensive position! Retreat!

272
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,194
Bato: The eclipse is only minutes away.

273
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:37,552
We should be able to make it up the hill
by the time it starts

274
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:41,053
and secure the entire palace
by the time it’s finished!

275
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,530
We can wait here if you want.

276
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:50,031
No. I want to press
forward with the others.

277
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:05,036
War Minister Qin: The Fire Lord’s chamber is that way down
the hall to the left and up the stairs. You can’t miss it.

278
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Thanks.

279
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:20,554
Sokka: Only 30 seconds
until the total eclipse.

280
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:29,171
I’m ready. I’m ready to face the Fire Lord.

281
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,899
Azula: So, you are alive after all.

282
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,343
I had a hunch that you survived.

283
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:44,044
It doesn’t matter, I’ve known
about the invasion for months.

284
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:51,845
I’m ready to face you.

285
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:58,772
Fire Lord Ozai: Prince Zuko,
what are you doing here?

286
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:17,028
The Mechanist: The eclipse is starting.
Put on your eclipse glasses.

287
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:32,125
Fire Lord Ozai: Why are you here?

288
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:33,825
I’m here to tell the truth.

289
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:39,127
Fire Lord Ozai: Telling the truth during the
middle of an eclipse. This should be interesting.

290
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:49,416
Zuko: First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was
Azula who took down the Avatar, not me.

291
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:52,396
Fire Lord Ozai: Why would
she lie to me about that?

292
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:55,064
Zuko: Because the Avatar is not dead.
He survived.

293
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:57,008
What?!

294
00:30:57,425 --> 00:31:01,425
Zuko: In fact, he probably is leading this invasion.
He could be on his way right now.

295
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,918
Get out! Get out of my sight right now
if you know what’s good for you.

296
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:08,412
That’s another thing.
I’m not taking orders from you anymore.

297
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:14,541
You will obey me
or this defiant breathe will be your last!

298
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,819
Think again! I am going to speak my
mind and you are going to listen.

299
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:24,844
Where is he? Where is the Fire Lord?

300
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:29,494
Hm, you mean I’m not good enough for you?
You’re hurting my feelings.

301
00:31:31,226 --> 00:31:33,926
Stop wasting our time and
give us the information.

302
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:36,997
You’re powerless right now, so
you’re in no position to refuse.

303
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,520
And stick to the truth.
I’ll be able to tell if you’re lying.

304
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:43,151
Are you sure? I’m a pretty good liar.

305
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:49,241
I am a 400 foot tall purple platypus
bear with pink horns and silver wings

306
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:52,983
Okay you’re good, I admit it.

307
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,209
But you really ought to consider
telling the truth anyway.

308
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,342
When I left Ba Sing Se,
I brought home some souvenirs.

309
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:12,818
Dai Li agents.

310
00:32:27,338 --> 00:32:28,838
Bato: Surround the periphery!

311
00:32:28,925 --> 00:32:31,825
We have to secure the palace
by the time the eclipse is over.

312
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:35,689
Otherwise, we’ll be in for
the fight of our lives.

313
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:44,116
Tyro: Stop! Surrender peacefully
and we won’t harm you.

314
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,820
We’ll never surrender.

315
00:32:51,184 --> 00:32:52,584
Er okay, we surrender.

316
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:59,621
Hakoda: There it is. The Fire Nation
royal palace. We’ve come so far.

317
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:01,462
It’s not over yet.

318
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,482
Zuko: For so long, all I wanted
was you to love me, to accept me.

319
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:13,111
I thought it was my honor that I wanted but
really, I was just trying to please you.

320
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:18,282
You, my father, who banished me
just for talking out of turn.

321
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:21,103
(points a sword at Ozai) My
father, who challenged me;

322
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,189
A 13-year-old boy to an Agni Kai.

323
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,190
How can you possibly justify
a duel with a child?

324
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,154
It was to teach you respect.

325
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,493
It was cruel! And it was wrong.

326
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:32,247
Then you have learned nothing.

327
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:37,043
No, I’ve learnt everything!
And I had to learn it on my own.

328
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:41,775
Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation
was the greatest civilization in history..

329
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:46,367
And somehow, the war was our way of sharing
our greatness with the rest of the world.

330
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:52,395
What an amazing lie that was. The people of
the world are terrified by the Fire Nation!

331
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:59,209
They don’t see our greatness, they hate us! And we deserve it.
We’ve created an era of fear in the world.

332
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:06,810
And if we don’t want the world to destroy itself, we
need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness.

333
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:12,532
(laughs mocking) Your Uncle
has gotten to you, hasn’t he?

334
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,659
Yes. He has.

335
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:42,177
I can’t pin her down. She’s too quick.

336
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:59,973
Wait! Aang, Toph, stop attacking.

337
00:36:00,597 --> 00:36:03,397
Don’t you see what she’s doing?
She’s just playing with us.

338
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,093
She’s not even trying to win this fight!

339
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,369
Not true, I’m giving it my all.

340
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,391
You’re trying to keep us
here and waste all our time!

341
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,210
Um, right. I think your
friend just said that genius.

342
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:18,094
And since you can’t see, I should
tell you I’m rolling my eyes.

343
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:19,791
I’ll roll your whole head!

344
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:21,635
She’s just baiting you again.

345
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:24,428
Okay, so what do we do? Just ignore her?

346
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,390
We don’t have a choice.

347
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:29,905
We just have to get out of here and
find the Fire Lord on our own somehow.

348
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:32,636
It’s a trap. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

349
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:34,686
Ignore!

350
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:40,900
So, Sokka’s your name right? My favorite
prisoner used to mention you all the time.

351
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,361
She was convinced that you
were going to come rescue her.

352
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,740
Of course, you never came
and she gave up on you.

353
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,650
Come and get it…

354
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:01,616
Where is Suki?!

355
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:07,086
Zuko: After I leave here today, I’m going
to free Uncle Iroh from his prison

356
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:11,702
and I’m going to beg for his forgiveness.
He is the one who has been a real father to me.

357
00:37:12,183 --> 00:37:17,583
That’s just beautiful. Maybe he can pass
down to you the ways of tea and failure.

358
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:20,955
But I’ve come to an even
more important decision.

359
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:25,520
I’m going to join the Avatar.
And I’m going to help him defeat you.

360
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:31,468
Really? Since you’re a full blown traitor
now and you want me gone, why wait?

361
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:36,547
I’m powerless, you’ve got your swords,
why don’t you just do it now?

362
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:41,467
Because I know my own destiny.
Taking you down is the Avatar’s destiny.

363
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,468
(sheathes his swords) Goodbye.

364
00:37:45,357 --> 00:37:49,457
Coward! You think you’re brave enough to face
me but you’ll only do it during an eclipse.

365
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:53,935
If you have any real courage, you’ll
stick around until the Sun comes out.

366
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,010
Don’t you want to know what
happened to your Mother?

367
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:11,973
What happened that night?

368
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,740
My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded
me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son.

369
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:26,857
And I was going to do it. Your Mother had found
out and swore she would protect you at any cost.

370
00:38:27,182 --> 00:38:30,882
She knew I wanted the throne
and she proposed a plan.

371
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:37,001
A plan in which I would become Fire
Lord and your life would be spared.

372
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:40,996
Where’s Suki? Answer me!

373
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,164
Sokka, she won’t talk.

374
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:46,868
Where are you keeping her?!

375
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:51,727
Your Mother did vicious,
treasonous things that night.

376
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:57,790
She knew the consequences and accepted them.
For her treason, she was banished.

377
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,005
So she’s alive.

378
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:10,306
Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful
a penalty for treason. Your penalty will be far steeper.

379
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:35,021
Oh. Sounds like the firebending’s back on.

380
00:39:43,865 --> 00:39:49,865
Dad’s all the way at the end of the hall and down the secret stairway
on the left. I’m sure he’ll be more than happy to see you now.

381
00:39:50,734 --> 00:39:53,734
Sokka: I fell for it!
I used up all our time.

382
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:58,931
It’s not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us.
She had every move planned out.

383
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:01,542
And now it’s too late.

384
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:07,335
Maybe it’s not too late. The eclipse is
over but I can face the Fire Lord anyway.

385
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:09,646
No. I don’t think that’s a good idea.

386
00:40:09,914 --> 00:40:13,514
But I’m ready! I came here with a job
to do and everyone’s counting on me.

387
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:16,622
The Fire Lord knew we
were coming this time.

388
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:19,656
We thought we had surprise
on our side but we didn’t.

389
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:23,336
It just wasn’t our day.
What we need to do now is go help our friends.

390
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,393
I guess you guys are right.

391
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:28,142
You’ll have another chance.
I know you will.

392
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:36,575
Bato: What should we do, Hakoda?
Shouldn’t something have happened by now?

393
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,026
I don’t know.

394
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:43,304
But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we’re
going to see some firebenders any minute.

395
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:55,632
The Mechanist: My own invention.
Oh this is terrible!

396
00:41:07,485 --> 00:41:08,485
They’re back!

397
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,770
It was all a trap. Azula knew we were
coming and she’s plotted out every move.

398
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:29,897
We just got to get to the
beach as fast as we can.

399
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:32,661
If we can make it to the submarines,
maybe we can get away safely.

400
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:39,698
Aang: They’ve got air power, but so do I!
I’m going to do what I can to slow them down.

401
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,890
Katara: Appa, you and I can help too.

402
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:50,004
Everyone, let’s get back to the subs!

403
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:22,281
We can’t keep them all back.
They’re too many of them!

404
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:24,201
Let’s join the others.

405
00:42:36,982 --> 00:42:37,982
Uncle!

406
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:44,342
Where is my Uncle?

407
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:48,083
Warden Poon: He’s gone.
He busted himself out.

408
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:52,009
I… I’ve never seen anything like it!
He was like a one man army!

409
00:42:59,758 --> 00:43:02,758
Try and find cover!
I think we’re about to see some bombs.

410
00:43:22,274 --> 00:43:24,274
Why aren’t they turning
around to attack us again?

411
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:29,608
They’re headed for the beach.
They’re going to destroy the submarines!

412
00:43:30,162 --> 00:43:31,262
How are we all going to escape?

413
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,300
We’re not.

414
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,320
Then our only choice is to stand and fight.
We have the Avatar, we could still win!

415
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:42,976
Yes, with the Avatar we could
still win on another day.

416
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:46,797
You kids have to leave.
You have to escape on Appa together.

417
00:43:46,897 --> 00:43:50,897
What? We can’t leave you behind.
We won’t leave anyone behind.

418
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,840
You’re our only chance in a long run.

419
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:56,647
You and Sokka have to go
with Aang somewhere safe.

420
00:43:56,745 --> 00:43:58,745
It’s the only way to keep hope alive.

421
00:43:58,812 --> 00:44:01,512
Bato: The youngest of our
group should go with you.

422
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:04,251
The adults will stay behind and surrender.

423
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:07,777
We’ll be prisoners but we’ll
all survive this battle.

424
00:44:08,492 --> 00:44:11,892
Tyro: I’ve got some experience
with the Fire Nation prisons.

425
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:14,412
It’s not going to be easy but we’ll get by.

426
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:15,486
They’re at the beach already!

427
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:57,566
The Mechanist: Bye, son.

428
00:44:57,892 --> 00:45:00,392
Teo: Bye, Dad. I’m really proud of you.

429
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,090
The Duke: I’ll miss you, Pipsqueak.

430
00:45:06,657 --> 00:45:07,657
Pipsqueak: Take care, The Duke.

431
00:45:10,412 --> 00:45:11,412
Haru: I’ll be back for you Dad.

432
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:14,189
Tyro: If we don’t escape on our own first.

433
00:45:17,442 --> 00:45:20,842
We lost today but we’ve
never been this close.

434
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,250
We tasted victory and that
counts for something.

435
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:25,519
We’ll miss you Dad.

436
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:31,339
Bye Dad. We won’t be apart for
too long this time. I promise.

437
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:48,075
Thank you all for being so brave and so strong.
I’m going to make this up to you.

438
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:06,628
Captain: Should we follow them, Princess?

439
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:10,729
No. They’re too fast.
It doesn’t matter, they’ll be back.

440
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:19,088
I know just the place for us to go where we’ll
be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple.
