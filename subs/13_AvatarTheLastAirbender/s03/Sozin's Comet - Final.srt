1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,370
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,540
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,710
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,860
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,450
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,780
<i>Then, everything changed when
the fire nation attacked</i>

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,890
<i>only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,490
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,190
<i>A hundred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar.</i>

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,860
<i>An airbender named aang.</i>

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,070
<i>And although his airbending skills are great, he has
a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,130
<i>But I believe, aang
can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,290
You have mastered all four elements?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,510
Yeah, and now you're going down!

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,640
No, it is you who are going down.

16
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,240
The comet is already here,

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,290
and I am unstoppable!

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,710
The avatar state is defence mechanism,

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,729
desinged to empower you with a skills

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,410
and knowledge of all the past avatars

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,700
the glow

22
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,780
is the combination of all your past lives,

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,040
focusing their energy through your body.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,310
I can feel a lot of energy
twisted up around there.

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,420
Let me just see if I can...

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,160
What happened generations ago

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,329
can be resolved now…

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,750
by you.

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,570
Born in you, along with all this strife,

30
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,400
is the power to restore
balance to the world.

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,650
To the world.

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,550
After I leave here today,

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,540
I’m going to free Uncle
iroh from his prison

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,700
and I’m going to beg for his forgiveness.

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,370
But I’ve come to an even
more important decision.

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,519
I’m going to join the avatar.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,030
And I’m going to help him defeat you.

38
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,460
Where is my Uncle??

39
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,460
He busted himself out.

40
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,810
Sokka!

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,440
It's you!

42
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,680
We kissed at the invasion.

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,580
And I thought we're gonna be together.

44
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,010
But we're not.

45
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,190
Aang,

46
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,700
I don't know.

47
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,830
You miscalculated.

48
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,600
I love zuko more than I fear you.

49
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,300
No, you miscalculated, you
should have feared me more!

50
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,840
You were right about what katara needed.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,030
Violence wasn't the answer.

52
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,580
It never is.

53
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,860
Then I have a question for you.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,790
What are gonna do when you face my father?

55
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,340
More ferocious!

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,410
Imagine striking through
you opponents heart!

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,510
I'm trying.

58
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,980
Now let me hear you roar like tiger-dillo!

59
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,920
That sounded pathetic.

60
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,000
I said, roar!

61
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,180
Who wants a nice cool

62
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,040
glass of watermelon juice?

63
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,610
Uh, oh, me-me, me!

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,690
Hey, your lesson is not over yet!

65
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,850
Get back here.

66
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,710
Come on, zuko,

67
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,830
just take a break.

68
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,070
What's the big deal?

69
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,160
Fine.

70
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,390
If you want to lounge around
like a bunch of snails all day

71
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,520
then go ahead!

72
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,500
Maybe zuko's right?

73
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,010
Sitting around the house
made us pretty lazy.

74
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,290
But I know just a thing to change that:

75
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,960
Beach party!

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,190
Check out my appa sand-sculpture.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,650
Not, bad boldy.

78
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,740
But I've been working on my sandbending.

79
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,830
You're gonna love this.

80
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,540
Wow!

81
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,810
You even made a little
earth king and bosco.

82
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,050
Trying to top that, sokka?

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,890
Ta-da!

84
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,140
Is that a...

85
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,500
Blubbering blob-monster?..

86
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,110
No, it's suki!

87
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,180
Suki, we will all understand if
you'll break with him up over this.

88
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,030
I think it's sweet.

89
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,810
But it doesn't even look like..

90
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,110
A-a-ah!

91
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,620
What are you doing?

92
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,700
Teaching you a lesson!

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,450
What happened?

94
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,780
Zuko's gone crazy:

95
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,420
I've made a sand sculpture of suki

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,810
and he destroyed it!

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,930
Oh, and he is attacking aang.

98
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,600
Get a grip before I'll
blast you off this roof!

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,550
Go ahead and do it!

100
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,450
Enough!

101
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,470
What's wrong with you?

102
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,700
You could have hurt aang.

103
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,770
What's wrong with me?

104
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,570
What's wrong with all of you?

105
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,740
How can you sit around having beach parties
when sozin's comet is only three days away?

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
Why you all look at me like I'm crazy?

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,140
About sozin's comet...

108
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,170
I was actually gonna wait to fight
firelord until after it came.

109
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,190
After?

110
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,570
I am not ready.

111
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,840
I need more time to master firebending.

112
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
And, frankly,

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,350
your earthbending can
still use some umpf too.

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,250
So,

115
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,220
you all knew aang was gonna wait?

116
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,200
Honestly,

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,880
if aang tries to fight the firelord right

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,380
now... he'gonna lose.

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
No offence.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,130
The whole point of fighting
the firelord before the

121
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,840
comet was to stop the fire
nation from winning the war.

122
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,810
But they pretty much won the
war when took ba sing se.

123
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,860
Things can't get any worse.

124
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,560
You're wrong.

125
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,340
It's about to get worse
that you can even imagine.

126
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,340
The day before the eclipse

127
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,850
my father asked me to attend
an important war meeting.

128
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,880
It was what I dreamed about
and wanted for so many years.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,410
My father has finally accepted me back.

130
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,190
Welcome prince zuko.

131
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,400
We waited for you.

132
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,130
General shinu, your report.

133
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,670
Thank you, sir.

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,470
Ba sing se is still under our control,

135
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,120
however, earthbending rebellions have prevented us
from achieving a total victory in the earth kingdom.

136
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,330
What is your recommendation?

137
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,280
Our army is spread too thin,

138
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,700
but once the eclipse is over
and the invasion defeated

139
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,140
we should transfer more domestic
forces into the earth kingdom.

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,080
Mmm, prince zuko,

141
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,510
you've been among the
earth kingdom commoners,

142
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,180
do you think that adding more
troops will stop these rebellions?

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,230
The people of the earth
kingdom are proud and strong.

144
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,570
They can endure anything
as long as they have hope.

145
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,960
Yes, you're right.

146
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,310
We need to destroy their hope.

147
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,310
Well, that's not exactly what I...

148
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,190
I think you should take their precious hope

149
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,550
and the rest of their land and
burn it all to the ground.

150
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,900
Yes, yes, you're right azula.

151
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
Sozin's comet is almost upon us.

152
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,490
And on that day it will lend
us with the strength and

153
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,520
power of hundred suns.

154
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,280
No bender will stand a chance against us.

155
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,570
What are suggesting, sir?

156
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,470
When the comet last came,

157
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,910
mine grandfather, firelord sozin,

158
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,560
used it to wipe out the air nomads.

159
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,340
Now, I will use it its power
to end the earth kingdom!

160
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,400
Permanently.

161
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,610
From our airships we will
rain fire over their lands.

162
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,510
The fire that will destroy everything.

163
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,170
And out of the ashes, a
new world will be born.

164
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,440
A world in which all the
lands will be fire nation,

165
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,210
and I am the supreme ruler of everything!

166
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,350
I wanted to speak out against
this horrifying plan

167
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,450
but ashamed to say I didn't.

168
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,550
My whole life I struggled

169
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,680
to gain mine father love and acceptance.

170
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,290
But once I had it.

171
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,110
I realize I lost myslef getting there.

172
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,510
I forgotten who I was.

173
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,850
I can't believe this.

174
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,310
I always knew the firelord was a bad guy.

175
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,640
His plan is just a pure evil.

176
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,190
What am I gonna do?

177
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,060
I know you're scared.

178
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,880
And I know you're not
ready to save the world.

179
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,680
But if you don't defeat the
firelord before the comet comes...

180
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,980
there won't be a world to save anymore.

181
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,400
Why didn't you told me about
your crazy dad's plan sooner?

182
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,090
I didn't think I had to.

183
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,450
I assumed you are still gonna
fight him before the comet.

184
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,310
Noone told you decided to wait.

185
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,370
This is bad.

186
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,050
This is really, really bad.

187
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,950
Aang,

188
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,080
you don't have to do this alone.

189
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,740
Yeah, if we all have to fight
the firelord together,

190
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,580
we're gonna shot it and take him down.

191
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,750
All right!

192
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,310
Team avatar is back!

193
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,240
Air.

194
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,450
Water.

195
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,380
Earth.

196
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,580
Fire.

197
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,420
Fan and sword.

198
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,348
Fighting the firelord is
gonna be the hardest thing

199
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:04,660
we've ever done together.

200
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,690
But I wouldn't wanna do it any other way.

201
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah.

202
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,490
All right.

203
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,910
Get over here, zuko.

204
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,160
Being part of the group,

205
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,370
also means being part of the groups hugs.

206
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,110
There is one technique you need
to know before facing my father.

207
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,410
How to redirect lightning.

208
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,520
If you let the energy in your body flow,

209
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,870
lightning will follow it.

210
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,410
And you turn your opponents
energy against them.

211
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,130
That's like waterbending.

212
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,090
Exactly.

213
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,230
Mine Uncle invented this technique himself

214
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,890
by studying waterbenders.

215
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,320
So, have you ever
redirected lighting before?

216
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,310
Once.

217
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,730
Against mine father.

218
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,990
What was it feel like?

219
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,340
Exilirating.

220
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,920
But terifying.

221
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,240
You feel so powerful holding that
much of energy in your body,

222
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,590
but you know if you make the wrong move:

223
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
It's over.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,660
Well, not over-over, I mean,

225
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,720
there is always katara and a little

226
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,590
spirit water action, amirite?

227
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,750
Actually I

228
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,990
used it all up, after azula shot you.

229
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,240
Oh.

230
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,640
You'll have to take firelord's life,

231
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,360
before he takes yours.

232
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,640
Yeah,

233
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,250
I'll just do that.

234
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,350
Gather around, team avatar.

235
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,170
In order to take out the firelord.

236
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,430
Or... in this case... the melonlord.

237
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,710
Timing has to be perfect.

238
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,060
First, suki and I will draw his fire.

239
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,590
Then katara and zuko charge in
with some liquidy hot offence,

240
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,410
and while the melonlord is distracted

241
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,370
aang snoopes in and

242
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,770
ba-am!... He delivers the final blow.

243
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,950
Ehm, what about me?

244
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,130
For now... you're the melonlord's forces.

245
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,700
So I get to chuck flaming
rock at all of you?

246
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,860
Whatever makes the training
field more realistic.

247
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,830
Sweetness.

248
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,220
Mua-ha-ha-ha!

249
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,380
Watch it, toph!

250
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,900
I'm no toph,

251
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,410
I am melonlord!

252
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,360
Mua-ha-ha-ha!

253
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,660
Now, aang.

254
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,520
What are you wating for?

255
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,760
Take him out!

256
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,170
I can't.

257
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,030
What's wrong with you?

258
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,400
If this was the real deal... you'd
be shotful of lighting right now.

259
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,190
I'm sorry... but it just
doesn't feel right.

260
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,430
I didn't feel like myself.

261
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,130
There. That's how it's done.

262
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,610
I have a surprise for everyone!

263
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,690
I knew it!

264
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,780
You did have a secret thing with haru!

265
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,700
Ehm... no.

266
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,010
I was looking for cooking pots in the attic

267
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,650
and I found this.

268
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,560
Look at baby zuko!

269
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,170
Isn't he cute?

270
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,280
Oh, lighten up... I'm just teasing.

271
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,890
That's not me.

272
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,720
It's mine father.

273
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,740
But he looks so sweet and innocent.

274
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,290
That sweet little kid
grew up to be a monster.

275
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,830
And a worst father in
the history of fathers.

276
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,870
But he's still a human being.

277
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,000
You're going to defend him?

278
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,130
No, I agree with you.

279
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,309
Firelord ozai is a horrible person.

280
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,690
And a world will probably
be better off without him,

281
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,430
but there's got to be another way.

282
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,560
Like what?

283
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,040
I don't know.

284
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,280
Maybe we can make some big
pots of glue and then I can

285
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,320
use gluebending to stick
his arms and legs together

286
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,760
so he can't bend anymore.

287
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,630
Yeah,

288
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,010
then you can show him his baby pictures

289
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,118
and all this happy memories
will make him good again.

290
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,960
Do you really think that will work?

291
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,350
No!

292
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,540
This goes against everything
I learned from the monks.

293
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,570
I can't just go around wiping
out people I don't like.

294
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,690
Sure, you can.

295
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,150
You're the avatar.

296
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,970
If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm

297
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,140
pretty sure the universe will forgive you.

298
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,240
This isn't a joke, sokka!

299
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,610
None of you understands
the position I'm in!

300
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,100
Aang, we do understand. It's just..

301
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,849
Just what, katara, what?

302
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,380
We're trying to help.

303
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,110
So when you figure out the way
for me to beat the firelord

304
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,210
without taking his life,

305
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,590
I'd love to hear it!

306
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,320
Aang, don't walk away from this.

307
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,180
Let him go.

308
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,500
He needs time to sort it out by himself.

309
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,190
Hey, momo.

310
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,310
I don't suppose you know what I should do.

311
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,850
I didn't think so.

312
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,580
Ok, that's everything.

313
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,180
No, it's not.

314
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,260
Where's aang?

315
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,590
Aang?

316
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,060
Aang?

317
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,730
Come on, lazy bones, let's go!

318
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,520
He left his staff.

319
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,070
It's so strange.

320
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,290
Aang's not in a house.

321
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,520
Let's check the beach.

322
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,970
Look!

323
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,590
There is his footprints.

324
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,400
The trail ends here.

325
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,810
So,

326
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,330
he went for midnight swimming
and never came back?

327
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,920
Maybe he was captured...

328
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,060
I don't think so.

329
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,310
There's no sign of a struggle.

330
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,980
I bet he ran away again.

331
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,940
He left his glider and appa.

332
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,030
Then what do you think happened
to him, oh, sloozy one?

333
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,830
It's pretty obvious:

334
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,359
Aang misterously disappears
before an important battle?

335
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,870
He's definitely in a spirit world journey.

336
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,860
But if he was,

337
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,540
wouldn't his body still be here?

338
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,520
Oh yeah, forgot about that.

339
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,869
Then he's gotta be
somewhere on ember island.

340
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,280
Let's split up and look for him.

341
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm going with zuko!

342
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,660
What?

343
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,510
Everyone else went on a
life-changing field-trip with zuko?

344
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,680
Now, it's mine turn.

345
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:27,960
Aang, aang, aang, aang,
aang, aang, aang, aang!

346
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,790
Avatar state, yip-yip!

347
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,320
And when I was nine,

348
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,580
I ran away again.

349
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,420
Aha.

350
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,289
I know I shouldn't complain.

351
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,370
My parents gave me
everything I ever asked for.

352
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,480
But they never gave one
thing that I really wanted.

353
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,860
Their love.

354
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,280
You know what I mean?

355
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,050
Look,

356
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,530
I know you had a rough childhood.

357
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,660
But we should really focus on finding aang.

358
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,650
This is the worst field trip ever.

359
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,540
Judging by the looks on your faces,

360
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,460
I'm guessing you guys
didn't find aang either.

361
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,010
No.

362
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,610
It's like he just

363
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,350
disappeared.

364
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,979
Hey, wait a minute.

365
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,330
Has anyone noticed that
momo is missing too?

366
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,010
Oh, no!

367
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,780
I knew it was only a matter of time!

368
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,780
Appa ate momo!

369
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,490
Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy!

370
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,720
Appa didn't eat momo.

371
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,230
He's probably with aang.

372
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,780
That's just what appa wants you to think.

373
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,050
Get out of the bison's mouth, sokka.

374
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,760
We have a real problem here.

375
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,940
Aang, is nowhere to be found and
a comet is only two days away.

376
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,750
What should we do, zuko?

377
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,070
I don't know.

378
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,950
Why are you all looking at me?

379
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,970
Well, you are kind of the
expert on tracking aang.

380
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,100
Yeah, if anyone's got
experience hunting the avatar,

381
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,950
it's you.

382
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,230
Zuko, I don't want to tell
you how to do your job,

383
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,750
but why we are heading
to the earth kingdom?

384
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,150
There's no way aang's there.

385
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,630
Just trust me.

386
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,730
Come on, slowpokes, faster!

387
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,720
Sorry, I'm late father.

388
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,410
Good palanquine bearers are so
hard to come by these days.

389
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,140
So, is everything ready for our departure?

390
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,790
There's been a change in plans, azula.

391
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,690
What?

392
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,690
I've decided to lead the fleet
of airships to ba sing se alone.

393
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,640
You will remain here, in the fire nation.

394
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,330
But, I thought we were
going to do this together?

395
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,600
My decision is final.

396
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,410
You...

397
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,470
You can't treat me like this.

398
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,120
You can't treat me like zuko!

399
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,910
Azula, silence yourself.

400
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,620
But it was mine idea to burn
everything to the ground.

401
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,719
I deserved to be by your side.

402
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Azula!

403
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,580
Listen to me,

404
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,580
I need you here to watch over the homeland.

405
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,510
It's a very important job that
I can only entrust to you.

406
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,670
Really?

407
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,159
And for your loyalty,

408
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,980
I've decided to declare
you the new firelord.

409
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,560
Firelord azula?

410
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,310
It does seems appropriate.

411
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,380
But, what about you?

412
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,220
Firelord ozai is no more.

413
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,870
Just as the world will be reborn in fire,

414
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,600
I shall be reborn as the
supreme ruler of the world.

415
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,220
From this moment on, I will be known as

416
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,620
the phoenix king!

417
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,159
And the reason you brought us

418
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,849
to the seedy earth kingdom
tavern is what now?

419
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:52,719
Jun.

420
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:59,819
Oh, yeah, this weird bounty
hunter with a big mole.

421
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,029
Mole,

422
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,189
her skin is flawless.

423
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:04,309
No she has this giant mole-creature,

424
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:05,549
she rides around on.

425
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:06,749
Shirshu.

426
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,529
It's the only animal who can track

427
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,299
aang's scent anywhere in the world.

428
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,959
It's the one shot we have to finding him.

429
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:27,498
I don't know who this jun lady is,

430
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,139
but I like her!

431
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:36,989
Hey, momo.

432
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:41,169
I just had a strangest dream.

433
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:43,179
Wait.

434
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:55,349
Where are we?

435
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,329
Hey, I remember her,

436
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,219
she helped you attack us.

437
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:11,999
Yep.

438
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,539
Back in the good old days.

439
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:16,639
Oh, great, it's prince pouty.

440
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,349
Where is your creepy granpa?

441
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,709
He is my Uncle!

442
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:21,059
And he is not here!

443
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:25,031
I see you worked things
up with your girlfriend.

444
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,411
- She is not mine girlfriend!
- I am not his girlfriend!

445
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:29,841
Ok, ok....Sheesh.

446
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,361
I was only teasing.

447
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:32,691
So what do you want?

448
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:34,961
I need your help finding the avatar.

449
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:37,131
Hm...Doesn't sound too fun.

450
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:41,481
Does the end of the world
sound like more fun?

451
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,081
Nyla!

452
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:56,121
Who is my little...Uumm...Snufly-wafly?

453
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,841
No! Careful there!

454
00:25:58,161 --> 00:25:58,871
Ok,

455
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,191
so who's got something with
the avatar's scent on it?

456
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,671
I have aang's staff.

457
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:24,671
Well, what does that mean?

458
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:26,721
It means your friend is gone!

459
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:27,881
We know he is gone!

460
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,181
That's why we are trying to find him!

461
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,541
No, I mean he is gone gone.

462
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:34,191
He doesn't exist!

463
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,361
Where are we, momo?

464
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,721
Maybe I am in the spirit world?

465
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:50,871
But, wait, you can see me!

466
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,271
We can both be in the spirit world.

467
00:26:57,681 --> 00:26:58,321
Nope,

468
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,251
my bending works.

469
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:02,501
Maybe if we climb to the top of the island,

470
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,901
we can figure it out where we are.

471
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,641
What do you mean aang doesn't exist?

472
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:09,221
Do you mean he is...

473
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:10,851
You know...Dead?

474
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:13,161
Nope, we could find him if he were dead.

475
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,271
Oh...lt's a real headscratcher.

476
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:16,141
See ya.

477
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:19,101
Helpful...Real helpful.

478
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,111
Wait. I have another idea.

479
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,811
There is only one other
person in this world,

480
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,701
who can help us face the firelord.

481
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:27,761
I'll be right back with the smell sample.

482
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,701
You saved your Uncle's sweaty sandal?

483
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,381
I think it's kinda sweet.

484
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,181
Let's do this.

485
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,441
Hey, wait up!

486
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,271
We are going to ba sing se?

487
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,301
Your Uncle is somewhere beyong the wall.

488
00:28:13,302 --> 00:28:15,731
Nyla is getting twitchy,
so it can't be too far.

489
00:28:15,971 --> 00:28:16,831
Good luck.

490
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,911
It's been a long day.

491
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,971
Let's camp and start our
search again at dawn.

492
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,711
It's a hexagon.

493
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:39,191
It doesn't seem like normal rock.

494
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,241
It's not made of earth.

495
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,201
This is so strange.

496
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,291
I wish some help right now,

497
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:51,041
I wish I had roku.

498
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:53,561
I do have roku!

499
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,351
You're right, aang.

500
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:09,221
All the past avatars,

501
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:12,160
all their experience and wisdom

502
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:13,961
is available to you,

503
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:17,261
if you look deep inside yourself.

504
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:19,421
So, where am I, roku?

505
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:20,931
What is this place?

506
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,451
I....Don't know, aang.

507
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:26,371
But I see that you are lost

508
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:28,701
in more ways that one right now.

509
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:30,031
I am.

510
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,811
I need to figure it out what to
do when I face the firelord.

511
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:54,611
Well, look who is here?

512
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:07,181
Everyone expects me to
take firelord's life.

513
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:09,091
But I just don't know if I can do that.

514
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:10,991
In my life,

515
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:12,381
I tried to be disciplined

516
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,591
and show restraint.

517
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,151
But it backfired,

518
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:18,771
when fire lord sozin took advantage

519
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,931
of mine restraint and mercy.

520
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:24,231
If had been more decisive,

521
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:25,940
and acted sooner,

522
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:27,690
I could have stopped sozin

523
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:30,711
and stopped the war before it started.

524
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:33,941
I offer you this wisdom, aang.

525
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:37,081
You must be decisive.

526
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,031
What's going on?

527
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:46,841
We're surrounded by old people?

528
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,041
Not just any old people,

529
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:51,710
these are great masters
and friends of ours.

530
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:52,881
Pakku.

531
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:56,081
It is respectful to bow to an old master,

532
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:57,920
but how about a hug,

533
00:30:57,921 --> 00:30:59,451
for your new grandfather?

534
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:02,551
That's so exciting!

535
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:05,711
You and gran gran must be so happy
to finding each other again.

536
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:09,131
I made her a new betrothal
necklace and everything.

537
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,481
Welcome to the family, granp-granp.

538
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,481
You can still just call me pakku.

539
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,641
How about...

540
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,141
Gran-pakku?

541
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:19,711
No.

542
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,701
And this was aang's first
firebending teacher.

543
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:24,121
Jeong-jeong.

544
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:26,621
Master piandao.

545
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,181
Hello, sokka.

546
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:29,281
So wait,

547
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:31,091
how do you all know each other?

548
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:33,521
All owl people know each other,

549
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,631
don't you know that?

550
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:39,251
We all are part of the same
ancient secret society.

551
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:42,731
A group that transcends the
divisions of the four nations.

552
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,481
The order of the white lotus.

553
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:47,591
That's the one.

554
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:52,091
The white lotus was always been about
philosophy, and beauty, and truth.

555
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:53,821
But about a month ago,

556
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:57,410
a call went out that we were all
needed for something important.

557
00:31:57,411 --> 00:32:00,221
It came from our grand lotus, your Uncle.

558
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,271
Iroh of the fire nation.

559
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:04,061
Well, that's who we are looking for.

560
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,321
Then we will take you to him.

561
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:06,841
Wait,

562
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:09,151
someone is missing from your group,

563
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:11,131
someone very important...

564
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,831
Where is momo?

565
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:15,551
He is gone,

566
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,871
and so is aang.

567
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:20,151
Oh well, so long as they have each other

568
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,561
I am sure we have nothing to worry about.

569
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:23,451
Let's go!

570
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,761
Avatar kyoshi,

571
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:34,601
I need your wisdom.

572
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:44,491
In my day,

573
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,461
chin the conqueror threatened to
throw the world out of balance.

574
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,391
I stopped him,

575
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,631
and the world entered a great era of peace.

576
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,191
But you really didn't kill chin.

577
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,601
Technically, he fell to his own doom

578
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,751
because he was too stubborn
to get out of the way.

579
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:03,301
Personally, I don't really
see the difference,

580
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:04,471
but I assure you...

581
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,571
I would have done whatever it took

582
00:33:06,691 --> 00:33:08,111
to stop chin.

583
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:10,381
I offer you this wisdom, aang.

584
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,611
Only justice will bring peace.

585
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,681
I knew I shouldn't have ask kyoshi.

586
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:22,221
So, bumi,

587
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,251
how did you end up escaping

588
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:24,721
your imprisonment in omashu?

589
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,101
Escape?

590
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,511
I didn't escape.

591
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,361
Everybody else escaped.

592
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:31,731
There I was back in a ...

593
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:37,001
Moment. I didn't know what or when,

594
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:40,201
bit I knew I'd know it when I knew it.

595
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:41,811
An eclipse.

596
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:42,961
That'll do it.

597
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:55,361
What do you think you're doing?

598
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,981
Taking back my city.

599
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:04,031
You've got no fire power

600
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:05,641
and it's payback time!

601
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,181
Wow,

602
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,891
you took back your whole
city all by yourself.

603
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:00,831
So what about you, guys?

604
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:04,471
Did you do anything interesting
on the day of the eclipse?

605
00:35:05,251 --> 00:35:06,021
Nah.

606
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:07,221
No, not really.

607
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:10,371
I need to look deep inside myself.

608
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,031
I am avatar kuruk.

609
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:23,721
When I was young,

610
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:25,211
I was always a

611
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:27,731
"go with the flow" kind of avatar.

612
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,991
People seemed to work
out their own problems,

613
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:34,791
and there was peace and
good times in the world.

614
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,811
But then, I lost the woman I loved to koh,

615
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,081
the face stealer.

616
00:35:44,661 --> 00:35:45,991
It was mine fault.

617
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:49,061
If I had been more
attentive and more active,

618
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,641
I could have saved her.

619
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:52,281
Aang,

620
00:35:52,881 --> 00:35:55,751
you must actively shape your own destiny,

621
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:57,901
and the destiny of the world.

622
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:11,451
Well, here we are.

623
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:13,981
Welcome to owl people camp.

624
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:16,521
Where?

625
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:18,171
Where is he?

626
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:20,371
Your Uncle is in there, prince zuko.

627
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:32,701
Are you okay?

628
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,571
No, I am not okay.

629
00:36:35,021 --> 00:36:36,651
My Uncle hates me, I know it.

630
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,441
He loved me and supported
me in every way he could.

631
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,701
And I still turned against him.

632
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,811
How can I even face him?

633
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:44,941
Zuko,

634
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:47,051
you're sorry for what you did, right?

635
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,031
More sorry than I've been about
anything in my entire life.

636
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:51,741
Then he'll forgive you.

637
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:53,011
He will.

638
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:02,761
Uncle,

639
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,251
all these past avatars,

640
00:37:20,631 --> 00:37:22,481
they keep telling me I'm
gonna have to do it.

641
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:23,681
They don't get it.

642
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:25,541
You're right,

643
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,401
maybe an air nomad avatar

644
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,261
will understand where I'm coming from.

645
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:32,691
I know you can't really talk,

646
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,591
pretending you can just helps me think.

647
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:38,531
I am going to pretend I
didn't pretend to hear that.

648
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,511
I am avatar yangchen, young airbender.

649
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,161
Avatar yangchen,

650
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:54,331
the monks always taught me
that all life is sacred,

651
00:37:54,831 --> 00:37:57,681
even the life of the tiniest
spider-fly caught in its own web.

652
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,411
Yes,

653
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,291
all life is sacred.

654
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,551
I know, I am even a vegeterian.

655
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:06,791
I've always tried to solve my
problems by being quick or clever,

656
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,901
and I've only had to use
violence for necessary defence.

657
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,321
And I've certainly never
used it to take a life.

658
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,031
Avatar aang,

659
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:16,521
I know that you're a gentle spirit.

660
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:18,621
And the monks have taught you well,

661
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,041
but this isn't about you,

662
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:23,351
this is about the world.

663
00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:24,391
But the monks taught me,

664
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,271
that I have to detach
myself from the world,

665
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,971
so my spirit could be free.

666
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:32,111
Many great and wise air nomads
have detached themselves

667
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:34,711
and achieved spiritual enlightenment.

668
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:37,321
But the avatar can never do it,

669
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:40,421
because your sole duty is to the world.

670
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:43,151
Here is my wisdom for you.

671
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:48,561
Selfless duty calls you to
sacrifice your own spiritual needs

672
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:54,001
and do what ever it takes
to protect the world.

673
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,101
I quess I don't have a choice, momo,

674
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,271
I have to kill the fire lord.

675
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:17,351
Uncle,

676
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:21,061
I know you have mixed
fellings about seeing me.

677
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:23,971
But I want you to know,

678
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:25,180
I am so,

679
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,061
so sorry, Uncle.

680
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:30,451
I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did.

681
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:33,520
I don't know how I can
ever make it up for you.

682
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:34,531
But I...

683
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:41,981
How can you forgive me so easily?

684
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,351
I thought you will be furious with me.

685
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,341
I was never angry with you.

686
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:49,361
I was sad,

687
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:52,381
because I was afraid you lost your way.

688
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,321
I did lose my way.

689
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,681
But you found it again,

690
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:02,151
and you did it by yourself.

691
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,481
And I am so

692
00:40:04,601 --> 00:40:07,051
happy you found your way here.

693
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:09,411
It wasn't that hard, Uncle.

694
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:12,091
You have a pretty strong scent.

695
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:25,411
Wait,

696
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:27,151
is it just me

697
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,481
or those mounts getting bigger?

698
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:41,091
There are not getting larger,

699
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,491
they are getting closer.

700
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,951
The whole island is moving.

701
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:14,961
It's amazing, momo.

702
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,791
The biggest animal in the world.

703
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:19,021
I've got to swim around and find its face.

704
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:32,379
Uncle,

705
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,101
you are the only person
other then the avatar

706
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:36,171
who can possibly defeat the fatherlord.

707
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:38,111
You mean the firelord?

708
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:39,731
That's what I just said.

709
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,651
We need you to come with us.

710
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:45,501
No, zuko.

711
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,531
It won't turn out well.

712
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,001
You can beat him.

713
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:50,351
And we will be there to help.

714
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:53,091
Even if I did defeat ozai

715
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,431
and I don't know that I could.

716
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:58,531
It will be the wrong way to end a war.

717
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:02,591
History will see it as just
more senseless violence,

718
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:05,661
a brother killing a brother to grab power.

719
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:08,721
The only way for this war to end peacefully

720
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,341
is for the avatar

721
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:12,021
to defeat the firelord.

722
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:14,251
And then,

723
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:17,241
then would you come and take your
rightful place on the throne?

724
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:18,681
No.

725
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,391
Someone new must take the throne.

726
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:24,150
An idealist with pure heart

727
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:26,701
and unquestionable honour.

728
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:30,261
It has to be you, prince zuko.

729
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,971
Unquestionable honour?

730
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:34,021
But I've have made so many mistakes.

731
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,121
Yes, you have.

732
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:39,401
You struggled, you suffered,

733
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,791
but you have always followed you own path.

734
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:45,311
You restored your own honour,

735
00:42:45,431 --> 00:42:47,800
and only you can restore the honour

736
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:49,541
of the fire nation.

737
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:51,841
I'll try, Uncle.

738
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,391
Well, what if aang doesn't come back?

739
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,971
Sozin's comet is arriving

740
00:42:58,091 --> 00:43:00,271
and our destinies are upon us.

741
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,351
Aang will face the firelord.

742
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,951
When I was a boy,

743
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:07,101
I had a vision, that I'll one day

744
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,501
take ba sing se.

745
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:11,271
Only now do I see that

746
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:13,810
my destiny is to take it back

747
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:15,491
from the fire nation,

748
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:19,161
so the earth kindom can be free again.

749
00:43:19,771 --> 00:43:22,561
That's why you gathered the
members of the white lotus.

750
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:23,671
Yes.

751
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:25,601
Zuko,

752
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,331
you must return to the fire nation,

753
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:30,201
so that when the firelord fall,

754
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:32,051
you can assume the throne

755
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:33,740
and restore peace

756
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,911
and order.

757
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:37,540
But azula will be there,

758
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:38,661
waiting for you.

759
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:40,471
I can handle azula.

760
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:41,611
Not alone.

761
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,241
You'll need help.

762
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:45,211
You're right.

763
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,181
Katara,

764
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:48,871
how would you like to help
me put azula in her place?

765
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:50,941
It would be my pleasure.

766
00:43:51,191 --> 00:43:52,181
What about us?

767
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:53,761
What's our destiny today?

768
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:56,541
What do you think it is?

769
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:57,901
I think that

770
00:43:58,141 --> 00:43:59,731
if we don't know where aang is,

771
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:02,491
we need to do everything we can
to stop the airship fleet.

772
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:05,451
And that means, when aang
does face the firelord,

773
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:07,741
we will be right there if he need us.

774
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:16,030
Nothing runs faster over
land or swims quicker

775
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:17,931
than a giant eel-hound.

776
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:20,161
The airship base is on the small island

777
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,131
just off the earth kindom shore.

778
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:25,301
You should be able to intercept the
fleet within the day's journey.

779
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:27,881
Thank you, master.

780
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:36,311
So if I'm gonna be the firelord
after the the war over,

781
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:38,531
what are you going to do?

782
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:41,691
After I reconquer ba sing se,

783
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:44,761
I am going to reconquer my tea shop

784
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:48,521
and I am going to play pai sho every day.

785
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:54,621
Goodbye, general iroh.

786
00:44:55,031 --> 00:44:56,831
Goodbye, everyone.

787
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:59,651
Today destiny is our friend,

788
00:45:00,441 --> 00:45:01,921
I know it.

789
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:44,951
A lion-turtle.

790
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:49,681
Maybe you can help me.

791
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:51,001
Everyone,

792
00:45:51,321 --> 00:45:53,131
even my own past lifes

793
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:56,031
are expecting me to end someone's live.

794
00:45:57,741 --> 00:45:59,381
But I don't know if I can do it.

795
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:01,461
The true mind can weather

796
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:03,711
all the lies and illusions

797
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,511
without being lost.

798
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:08,051
The true heart can tough

799
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:09,501
the poison of hatred

800
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:11,281
without being harmed.

801
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:13,811
Since beginningless time

802
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:16,211
darkness thrives in the void

803
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:17,911
but always yields

804
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,861
to purifying light.

805
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,891
Wait for him.

806
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:33,491
He will come.

807
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:48,491
It's time for this world to end in fire

808
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:53,571
and for a new world to
be born from the ashes.

809
00:47:43,496 --> 00:47:44,736
Zuko, don't worry,

810
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:46,146
we can take azula.

811
00:47:46,576 --> 00:47:47,976
I'm not worried about her,

812
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:49,386
I'm worried about aang,

813
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:52,076
what if he doesn't have the
guts to take out my father?

814
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:54,486
What if he loses?

815
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,356
Aang won't lose.

816
00:47:56,476 --> 00:47:57,606
He's gonna come back.

817
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:00,236
He has to.

818
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:21,246
What am I holding?

819
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:24,556
A cherry-pit, princess.

820
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:25,456
Correct.

821
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,336
And what day is this?

822
00:48:27,456 --> 00:48:29,416
It's the day of your coronation.

823
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:31,006
Yea, it is.

824
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:34,536
So please, tell me why on the
most important day of my life

825
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:37,036
you decided to leave a pit in my cherry?

826
00:48:37,326 --> 00:48:39,736
It wasn't a decision, it was a just

827
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:41,206
small mistake.

828
00:48:41,326 --> 00:48:42,246
Small?

829
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,716
Do you realize what could have happened
if I didn't have sensed the pit in time?

830
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,876
I suppose, you could have choked?

831
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:49,726
Yes,

832
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:52,476
then you understand the
severity of your crime.

833
00:48:53,366 --> 00:48:54,886
I understand, princess.

834
00:48:55,006 --> 00:48:56,746
Please, forgive me.

835
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:58,245
Oh, very well,

836
00:48:58,246 --> 00:48:59,936
since it is a special day,

837
00:49:00,056 --> 00:49:01,476
I will show mercy.

838
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:03,606
You are banished.

839
00:49:03,726 --> 00:49:05,406
Leave this palace immediately.

840
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:09,296
What are you all looking at?

841
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,386
I have two feet, that need scrubbing.

842
00:49:11,506 --> 00:49:13,666
And make sure you get inbetween the toes.

843
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:15,586
I won't have as first day as firelord

844
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:17,856
marked by the poor foot hygiene.

845
00:49:22,186 --> 00:49:23,705
It's weird to say,

846
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:26,235
but the comet actually looks beautiful.

847
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:29,706
Too bad the firelord is about
to use it to destroy the world.

848
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:55,996
We're too late!

849
00:49:56,116 --> 00:49:58,306
The fleet's already taking off!

850
00:49:58,426 --> 00:50:00,006
Then we're taking off, too.

851
00:50:00,436 --> 00:50:01,766
Where is the closest airship?

852
00:50:01,776 --> 00:50:02,506
It's right there...

853
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:03,756
A-a-h!

854
00:50:42,396 --> 00:50:43,756
You sent for us, princess?

855
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:45,006
Is everything all right?

856
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,446
Actually everything is not all right.

857
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,776
Do you know how long it
took you to get here?

858
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,745
E-e-eh, few minutes a guess?

859
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:53,386
Five, to be precise.

860
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:55,786
In which time an assasin
could have smugged in,

861
00:50:55,906 --> 00:50:56,636
done away with me,

862
00:50:56,756 --> 00:50:58,236
and went on his merry way.

863
00:50:58,246 --> 00:50:59,935
My apoligies, princess.

864
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:02,595
Is this how you plan to
treat your new firelord?

865
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:04,605
With retardiness and disloyalty?

866
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,215
Dai Lee would never betray you.

867
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:08,786
And I'm sure that's just what
you told long feng before

868
00:51:08,906 --> 00:51:10,956
you turned against him and joined me.

869
00:51:12,506 --> 00:51:14,196
You're all banished.

870
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:14,906
But...

871
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:15,776
Bye,

872
00:51:21,896 --> 00:51:23,836
please send in the next
group on your way out.

873
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:20,676
That's how it's done.

874
00:52:21,076 --> 00:52:21,986
Good work, toph.

875
00:52:21,987 --> 00:52:23,615
Time to take control of the ship.

876
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:24,606
Take the wheel.

877
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,086
That's a great idea.

878
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:28,536
Let the blind girl steer the giant airship.

879
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,246
I was talking to suki.

880
00:52:31,006 --> 00:52:32,876
That would make a lot more sense.

881
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:35,056
What are we gonna do with
the rest of the crew?

882
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:36,786
Take us down closer to the water.

883
00:52:36,796 --> 00:52:38,056
I've got an idea.

884
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:45,816
Attention, crew, this is
your captain speaking.

885
00:52:45,936 --> 00:52:48,846
Everyone please report to
the bomb bay immediately,

886
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,976
for hot cakes and sweet cream.

887
00:52:52,426 --> 00:52:55,286
We have a very special
birthday to celebrate.

888
00:53:05,136 --> 00:53:05,756
Hey.

889
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:07,136
I'm quin Lee.

890
00:53:07,256 --> 00:53:09,006
I work up, in the communications.

891
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:10,336
Oh, hi.

892
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:11,976
I work down, in the engine room.

893
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,236
That's probably we never met before.

894
00:53:15,056 --> 00:53:16,606
Big airship, you know.

895
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:17,606
Yep.

896
00:53:18,216 --> 00:53:20,176
So, do you know whose birthday it is?

897
00:53:20,786 --> 00:53:23,876
I can't believe that captain
remembered my birthday!

898
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:25,796
He really does care!

899
00:53:34,856 --> 00:53:36,206
Happy Birthday.

900
00:53:40,896 --> 00:53:42,415
Firelord ozai,

901
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:43,816
here we come.

902
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,950
Azula, we heard what happened.

903
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:05,340
Why have you banished all your servants?

904
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,029
Or your dai Lee agents?

905
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:09,280
And the imperial firebenders?

906
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,320
None of the mcould be trusted.

907
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,890
Sooner or later they all
would have betray me.

908
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:16,070
Just like mai and ty Lee did.

909
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:20,130
Azula, we are concerned about
you and your well-being,

910
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:24,300
mine father asked you to come
here, and talk to me didn't he?

911
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,050
He thinks I can't handle the
responsiblity of being firelord.

912
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,790
But I will be the greatest leader
in the fire nation history.

913
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,090
I'm sure you will.

914
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,470
But considering everything
that happened today,

915
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,920
perhaps it's best for you to
postpone your coronation.

916
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,010
What?

917
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,690
Which one of you just said that?

918
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:44,930
What a shame.

919
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,150
There's only one way to resolve this.

920
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,300
You two must duel each other.

921
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,950
I order you to fight in a agni kai.

922
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,270
But..

923
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,100
We're not firebenders.

924
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,800
All right, fine.

925
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:58,669
Lo, you're banished.

926
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,010
Li. You can stay.

927
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:00,970
But,

928
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:01,990
I'm Lee.

929
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,420
So who is banished?

930
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:18,710
Ba sing se,

931
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,170
the order of the white lotus is here.

932
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,520
Here, to set you free.

933
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,950
Only once every hundred years,

934
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,630
can a firebender epxerience
this kind of power.

935
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:06,370
All right hair, it's
time to face your doom.

936
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:10,890
What a shame,

937
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,730
you always had such a beatiful hair.

938
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,510
What are you doing here?

939
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,600
I didn't want to miss mine
daughter's coronation.

940
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,610
Don't pretend to act proud.

941
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,300
I know what you're really think of me.

942
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:24,970
You think I'm a monster.

943
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,950
I think you're confused.

944
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,080
All your life you used
fear to control people.

945
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,410
Like your friends, mai and ty Lee.

946
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,740
But what choice do I have?

947
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,970
Trust is for fools.

948
00:57:35,971 --> 00:57:37,900
Fear is the only reliable way.

949
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,320
Even you fear me.

950
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:41,820
No,

951
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,870
I love you, azula.

952
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,160
I do.

953
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,880
We're not gonna catch up to him in time.

954
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,190
No.

955
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:50,930
Momo,

956
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:52,170
time for you to go.

957
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,750
What just happened?

958
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:54,820
It's aang!

959
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,380
He's back!

960
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,510
After a generations of

961
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,480
firelords failed to find you,

962
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,800
now the universe

963
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,780
delivers you to me as a

964
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,190
act of providence.

965
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,020
Please listen to me.

966
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,390
We don't have to fight.

967
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:26,190
You have the power to end it here

968
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,650
and stop what you're doing.

969
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,110
You are right.

970
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,260
I do have the power/

971
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,670
I have all the power in the world!

972
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,840
Go, aang! Airbending slice!

973
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,780
Shouldn't we be helping him?

974
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,320
The firelord is aang's fight,

975
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,190
we need to stay focused
in stopping that fleet,

976
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,670
for burning down the earth kingdom.

977
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:09,160
And how do we do that, captain boomerang?

978
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,790
I can't see outside of this
honking side of metal.?

979
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,600
Airship slice!

980
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,250
Wow...

981
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,980
That's a lot of fire, isn't it?

982
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,730
That's gonna be a rough ride.

983
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,810
We need to get on the top
of this thing, fast.

984
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:22,840
Then what?

985
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,180
Watch each other's back,

986
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,640
and if we would make it that far...

987
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,930
I'll let you know.

988
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,480
Suki!

989
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,360
I'm okay!

990
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,970
Just finish the mission.

991
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:06,690
No.

992
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:08,719
Sokka I think we gotta

993
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,600
jump!

994
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,830
By decree of phoenix king ozai,

995
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,430
I now crown you firelord...

996
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,260
What are you waiting for?

997
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:30,820
Do it!

998
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:36,900
Sorry.

999
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,270
But you're not gonna become firelord today.

1000
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,070
I am.

1001
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,350
You're hilarious.

1002
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,570
And you're going down.

1003
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:49,870
Wait.

1004
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:51,510
You want to be firelord?

1005
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,479
Fine, let's settle this.

1006
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,290
Just you and me, brother,

1007
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,500
the showdown that was always meant to be...

1008
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,240
agni kai!

1009
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,210
You're on.

1010
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,200
What are you doing?

1011
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,360
She's playing you.

1012
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,800
She know she can't take out us both,

1013
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,589
so she's trying to separate us.

1014
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:10,440
I know.

1015
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,190
But I can take her this time.

1016
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:13,550
Even you admitted to your

1017
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,700
Uncle that would need help facing azula.

1018
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,340
There's something off about her.

1019
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,470
I can't explain it, but she is slipping.

1020
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,010
And this way,

1021
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,550
noone else has to get hurt.

1022
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,790
I'm sorry it has to end this way, brother.

1023
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,230
No, you're not.

1024
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,550
No lightning today?

1025
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,450
Afraid I'll redirect it?

1026
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,520
Oh, I'll show you lightning!

1027
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,720
No-o-o-o!

1028
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,580
Zuko!

1029
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,660
You're weak!

1030
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,410
Just like the rest of your people!

1031
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,330
Fated not deserve to exist in this world,

1032
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,160
in mine world!

1033
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:25,010
Prepare to join them.

1034
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,280
Prepare to..

1035
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,060
Die!

1036
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:55,049
Come on out, avatar!

1037
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:57,819
You can't hide in there forever!

1038
01:10:05,019 --> 01:10:06,949
Toph, metallbend the rudder, so it's change

1039
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,219
in the turnining position.

1040
01:10:08,339 --> 01:10:10,579
The ship will spiral and
slam into the others.

1041
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:11,559
Got it.

1042
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:29,769
Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is,

1043
01:10:29,889 --> 01:10:31,359
that you invented metallbending?

1044
01:10:31,479 --> 01:10:33,179
You can stand to mention it more.

1045
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:56,459
My leg.

1046
01:10:57,479 --> 01:10:58,809
Hang on, toph.

1047
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:00,529
Aye-aye, captain.

1048
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:20,959
Bye... space sword!

1049
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,709
I don't think boomerang
is coming back, toph.

1050
01:11:31,229 --> 01:11:33,039
It's looks like this is the end.

1051
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:45,889
How did that happened?

1052
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:47,509
Did boomerang come back?

1053
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:48,579
No,

1054
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,139
suki did.

1055
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,139
Come on out, little boy.

1056
01:12:42,499 --> 01:12:44,149
You're about to be...

1057
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,949
I would really rather our family physician

1058
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:30,139
look after little zuzu,

1059
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,499
if you don't mind.

1060
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:47,419
Zuzu, you don't look so good.

1061
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:21,249
There you are, filthy peasant.

1062
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:27,909
Thank you, katara.

1063
01:17:29,029 --> 01:17:31,189
I think I am the one who
should be thanking you.

1064
01:19:48,146 --> 01:19:50,126
Firelord ozai.

1065
01:19:50,246 --> 01:19:51,656
You and your forefathers

1066
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:53,846
have devastated the balance of this world.

1067
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:55,466
And now, you shall

1068
01:19:55,586 --> 01:19:57,236
pay the ultimate price.

1069
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:32,606
No.

1070
01:20:32,726 --> 01:20:34,516
I am not going to end like this.

1071
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:38,176
Even with all power in the world,

1072
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:40,566
you are still weak...

1073
01:21:06,786 --> 01:21:10,266
In the era before the avatar,

1074
01:21:10,386 --> 01:21:13,165
we bent not the elements,

1075
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:17,036
but the energy within ourselves.

1076
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:58,056
To bend another's energy,

1077
01:21:58,176 --> 01:21:59,786
your own spirit

1078
01:21:59,906 --> 01:22:02,246
must be unbendable,

1079
01:22:02,676 --> 01:22:04,916
or you will be corrupted

1080
01:22:05,036 --> 01:22:06,876
and destroyed.

1081
01:22:44,346 --> 01:22:45,196
What?

1082
01:22:45,316 --> 01:22:47,146
What did you do to me?

1083
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:49,086
I took away your firebending.

1084
01:22:49,376 --> 01:22:52,896
You can't use it to hurt or
threaten anyone else ever again.

1085
01:23:55,036 --> 01:23:56,116
You did it!

1086
01:23:56,236 --> 01:23:57,146
You should have seen yourself!

1087
01:23:57,266 --> 01:23:58,356
It was amazing!

1088
01:23:58,476 --> 01:23:59,436
You were all like...

1089
01:24:02,676 --> 01:24:03,876
And the fire lord was all like ...

1090
01:24:08,456 --> 01:24:09,466
So did you...

1091
01:24:10,006 --> 01:24:11,476
You know...

1092
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:12,746
Finished the job?

1093
01:24:13,236 --> 01:24:16,036
I'm still alive...

1094
01:24:17,276 --> 01:24:20,396
I've learn another way to
defeat him and restore balance.

1095
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:22,116
I took his bending away.

1096
01:24:22,236 --> 01:24:24,526
Wow, who taught you that?

1097
01:24:24,646 --> 01:24:26,096
A giant lion-turtle.

1098
01:24:26,386 --> 01:24:29,346
You have the craziest
adventures when you disappear.

1099
01:24:30,026 --> 01:24:31,916
Well, look at you, buster.

1100
01:24:32,286 --> 01:24:33,526
Now that your firebending is gone,

1101
01:24:33,646 --> 01:24:34,806
I guess we should call you

1102
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:36,666
the "loser lord".

1103
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:40,406
I am the phoenix king...

1104
01:24:42,196 --> 01:24:43,425
Oh, sorry,

1105
01:24:43,426 --> 01:24:44,866
didn't mean to offend you phoenix

1106
01:24:44,986 --> 01:24:46,656
king of getting his butt-whooped.

1107
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:49,426
Ye-eah, or how about "king of the

1108
01:24:50,036 --> 01:24:51,146
guys who...

1109
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:52,536
Don't win"?

1110
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:54,936
Leave the nicknames to us, honey.

1111
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:18,146
You need some help with that?

1112
01:25:21,396 --> 01:25:22,126
Mai. You're ok.

1113
01:25:24,506 --> 01:25:25,586
They let you out of prison?

1114
01:25:25,706 --> 01:25:27,376
My Uncle pulled some strings.

1115
01:25:27,726 --> 01:25:30,665
And it doesn't hurt when a new
fire lord is your boyfriend.

1116
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,666
So is this mean you don't hate me anymore?

1117
01:25:32,966 --> 01:25:34,086
I think it means

1118
01:25:34,756 --> 01:25:36,426
I actually kind of like you.

1119
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,195
But don't ever

1120
01:25:42,196 --> 01:25:44,036
break up with me again.

1121
01:26:01,076 --> 01:26:01,616
Dad!

1122
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:02,446
Dad!

1123
01:26:06,226 --> 01:26:08,086
I heard what you two did.

1124
01:26:08,386 --> 01:26:10,956
I am the proudest father in the world.

1125
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:14,766
And your mother would be proud too.

1126
01:26:17,426 --> 01:26:19,196
There is my favorite warriors.

1127
01:26:19,316 --> 01:26:21,196
I have to admit, I kinda
have missed the face paint.

1128
01:26:21,316 --> 01:26:23,826
So how is it feel to be
back in uniform again?

1129
01:26:23,946 --> 01:26:25,576
It feels great!

1130
01:26:27,486 --> 01:26:28,636
Careful, suki!

1131
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:31,366
Ty Lee is pretending to be
a kyoshi warrior again.

1132
01:26:31,606 --> 01:26:32,766
It's okay.

1133
01:26:32,886 --> 01:26:34,226
She is one of us now.

1134
01:26:35,986 --> 01:26:38,785
Yeah, the girls and I
really bonded in prison

1135
01:26:38,786 --> 01:26:40,724
and after a few chi-blocking lessons,

1136
01:26:40,725 --> 01:26:42,216
they said I can join their group.

1137
01:26:42,217 --> 01:26:44,736
We are gonna be best friends forever.

1138
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,726
I can't believe the year ago mine
purpose in life was hunting you down.

1139
01:26:57,266 --> 01:26:58,136
And now,

1140
01:26:58,256 --> 01:26:59,796
and now... we're friends.

1141
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:01,476
Yeah.

1142
01:27:02,076 --> 01:27:03,276
We are friends.

1143
01:27:03,816 --> 01:27:06,976
I can't believe a year ago I was
still frozen in block of ice.

1144
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:08,946
The world so different now.

1145
01:27:09,546 --> 01:27:11,066
And it's gonna be even more different.

1146
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,896
We'll rebuild it together.

1147
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:33,666
Please,

1148
01:27:34,396 --> 01:27:36,716
the real hero is the avatar.

1149
01:27:50,086 --> 01:27:51,186
Today,

1150
01:27:51,306 --> 01:27:53,726
this war is finally over.

1151
01:27:57,716 --> 01:28:01,366
I promised my Uncle that I will
restore the honour of the fire nation

1152
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:02,736
and I will.

1153
01:28:02,856 --> 01:28:04,926
The road ahead of us is challenging,

1154
01:28:05,586 --> 01:28:07,056
a hundred years of fighting

1155
01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:09,586
has left the world scarred and divided.

1156
01:28:10,476 --> 01:28:12,125
But with the avatar's help,

1157
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:14,256
but we can get a back on the right path.

1158
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:16,225
And begin a new era

1159
01:28:16,226 --> 01:28:18,186
of love and peace.

1160
01:28:24,586 --> 01:28:27,726
All hail firelord zuko!

1161
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,736
I should count myself lucky...

1162
01:29:08,856 --> 01:29:10,006
the new firelord

1163
01:29:10,126 --> 01:29:11,216
has graced me with his presence

1164
01:29:11,336 --> 01:29:13,006
in mine lonely prison cell.

1165
01:29:13,406 --> 01:29:16,546
You should count yourself lucky that
the avatar has spared your life.

1166
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:19,646
Banishing me was the best

1167
01:29:19,766 --> 01:29:21,196
thing you could have done for mine life.

1168
01:29:22,096 --> 01:29:23,746
It put me on the right path.

1169
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,286
Perhaps your time in here
can do the same for you.

1170
01:29:28,536 --> 01:29:31,086
Why are you really here?

1171
01:29:31,206 --> 01:29:33,406
Because you are gonna tell me something.

1172
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:36,166
Where...

1173
01:29:36,286 --> 01:29:36,646
Is...

1174
01:29:36,766 --> 01:29:38,006
My mother?..

1175
01:30:08,706 --> 01:30:10,296
Zuko, stop moving!

1176
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:12,666
I'm trying to capture the moment.

1177
01:30:13,686 --> 01:30:14,996
I wanna to do a painting.

1178
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:17,116
So we will always remember
a good times together.

1179
01:30:17,456 --> 01:30:19,396
That's very thoughtful of you, sokka.

1180
01:30:20,086 --> 01:30:22,426
Wait, why did you gave me momo's ears?

1181
01:30:22,546 --> 01:30:24,346
Those are your hair loopies.

1182
01:30:25,306 --> 01:30:27,196
At least you don't look like a porcupine.

1183
01:30:27,197 --> 01:30:29,176
My hair is not that spiky.

1184
01:30:29,436 --> 01:30:30,806
I look like a man.

1185
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,906
And why did you painted me firebending?

1186
01:30:33,326 --> 01:30:35,356
I thought it look more exciting that way.

1187
01:30:36,586 --> 01:30:38,816
Oh, you think you could
do a better job, momo?

1188
01:30:41,276 --> 01:30:43,926
Hey, mine belly is not that big anymore...

1189
01:30:44,046 --> 01:30:45,916
I really trimmed down.

1190
01:30:46,036 --> 01:30:48,136
Well, I think you all look perfect!
