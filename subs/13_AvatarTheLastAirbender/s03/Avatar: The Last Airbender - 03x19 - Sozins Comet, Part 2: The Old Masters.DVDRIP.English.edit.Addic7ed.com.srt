1
00:00:01,122 --> 00:00:01,892
Water.

2
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:04,062
Earth.

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:06,232
Fire.

4
00:00:07,622 --> 00:00:08,382
Air.

5
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:12,972
Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:17,302
Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked

7
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:22,412
Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.

8
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:25,012
But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:29,712
A hundred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar.

10
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,382
An airbender named Aang.

11
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:36,592
And although his airbending skills are great, he
has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

12
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:40,652
But I believe, Aang can save the world.

13
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:28,211
Hey, I remember her!

14
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:30,101
She helped you attack us!

15
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:30,881
Yep.

16
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:32,421
Back in the good old days.

17
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,521
Oh, great, it's Prince Pouty.

18
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,231
Where's your creepy grandpa?

19
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,591
He's my Uncle,

20
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,941
and he's not here.

21
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,111
I see you worked things 
out with your girlfriend.

22
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:45,491
- She's not my girlfriend!
- I'm not his girlfriend!

23
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,921
Ok, ok....sheesh.

24
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,441
I was only teasing.

25
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:50,771
So what do you want?

26
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:53,041
I need your help finding the Avatar.

27
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,211
Hm...doesn't sound too fun.

28
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:59,561
Does the end of the
world sound like more fun?

29
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,161
Nyla!

30
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:14,201
Who's my little Snuffly-Wuffly?

31
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:15,921
Whoa! Careful there!

32
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:16,951
Okay,

33
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,271
so who's got something with
the Avatar's scent on it?

34
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:20,751
I have Aang's staff.

35
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,751
Well, what does that mean?

36
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,801
Means your friend's gone.

37
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:45,961
We know he's gone!

38
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,261
That's why we're trying to find him!

39
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:50,621
No, I mean he's <i>gone</i> gone.

40
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,271
He doesn't exist.

41
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,441
Where are we, Momo?

44
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,351
We could both be in the Spirit World.

45
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,401
Nope,

46
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:18,331
my bending works.

47
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:20,581
Maybe if we climb to
the top of the island,

48
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,981
we can figure it out where we are.

49
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:25,721
What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?

50
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:27,301
Do you mean he's...

51
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:28,931
you know, dead?

52
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,241
Nope, we could find him if he were dead.

53
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,351
Wow, it's a real head-scratcher.

54
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:34,221
See ya.

55
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,181
Helpful. Real helpful.

56
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,191
Wait, I have another idea.

57
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,891
There's only one other
person in this world

58
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,781
who can help us face the Fire Lord.

59
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:45,841
I'll be right back 
with a smell sample.

60
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:50,781
You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal?

61
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,461
I think it's kind of sweet.

62
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:57,261
Let's do this.

63
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,521
Hey, wait up!

64
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,351
We're going to Ba Sing Se?

65
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,381
Your uncle's somewhere beyond the wall.

66
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:33,811
Nyla's getting twitchy 
so he can't be too far.

67
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:34,911
Good luck.

68
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:40,991
It's been a long day.

69
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,051
Let's camp and start
our search again at dawn.

70
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:52,791
It's a hexagon.

71
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:57,271
It doesn't seem like normal rock.

72
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,321
It's not made of earth.

73
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,281
This is so strange.

74
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,371
I wish some help right now.

75
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,121
I wish I had Roku.

76
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:11,641
I do have Roku!

77
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,431
You're right, Aang.

78
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,301
All the past Avatars,

79
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:30,241
all their experience and wisdom

80
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,041
is available to you,

81
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:35,341
if you look deep inside yourself.

82
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:37,501
So where am I, Roku?

83
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,011
What is this place?

84
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,531
I....don't know, Aang.

85
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:44,451
But I see that you are lost

86
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,781
in more ways than one right now.

87
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,111
I am.

88
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,891
I need to figure out what
to do once I face the Fire Lord.

89
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,691
Well, look who's here!

90
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:26,023
Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life,

91
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:27,933
but I just don't know if I can do that.

92
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:29,833
In my life,

93
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,223
I tried to be disciplined

94
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:33,433
and show restraint.

95
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:34,993
But it backfired

96
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,613
when Fire Lord Sozin took advantage

97
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,773
of my restraint and mercy.

98
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,073
If had been more decisive

99
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,783
and acted sooner,

100
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:46,533
I could have stopped Sozin

101
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,553
and stopped the war before it started.

102
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:52,783
I offer you this wisdom, Aang.

103
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,923
You must be decisive.

104
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:03,873
What's going on?

105
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:05,683
We're surrounded by old people.

106
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,883
Not just any old people.

107
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:10,553
These are great masters and friends of ours.

108
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:11,723
Pakku.

109
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,923
It is respectful to
bow to an old master,

110
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,763
but how about a hug

111
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,293
for your new grandfather?

112
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:21,393
That's so exciting!

113
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:24,553
You and Gran-Gran must be so
happy to have found each other again.

114
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:27,973
I made her a new betrothal
necklace and everything.

115
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,323
Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp.

116
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:33,323
You can still just call me Pakku.

117
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:34,483
How about...

118
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:35,983
Grand-Pakku?

119
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:38,143
No.

120
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:41,543
And this was Aang's
first firebending teacher.

121
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:42,963
Jeong-Jeong.

122
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,463
Master Piandao.

123
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,023
Hello, Sokka.

124
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,123
So wait,

125
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,933
how do you all know each other?

126
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,363
All old people know each other.

127
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:53,473
Don't you know that?

128
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,093
We're all part of the same
ancient secret society.

129
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:01,573
A group that transcends the
divisions of the four nations.

130
00:08:02,543 --> 00:08:04,323
The Order of The White Lotus.

131
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,433
That's the one.

132
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:10,933
The White Lotus has always been about
philosophy and beauty and truth.

133
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:12,663
But about a month ago,

134
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,253
a call went out that we were all
needed for something important.

135
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:19,063
It came from a Grand Lotus: your Uncle.

136
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,113
Iroh of the Fire Nation.

137
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,903
Well, that's who we're looking for.

138
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:25,163
Then we will take you to him.

139
00:08:25,283 --> 00:08:25,683
Wait!

140
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,993
Someone's missing from your group.

141
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:29,973
Someone very important...

142
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,673
Where's Momo?

143
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,393
He's gone.

144
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:36,713
And so is Aang.

145
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,993
Oh well, so long as they have each other

146
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,403
I'm sure we have
nothing to worry about.

147
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:42,293
Let's go!

148
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,603
Avatar Kyoshi,

149
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,443
I need your wisdom.

150
00:09:02,313 --> 00:09:03,333
In my day,

151
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:07,303
Chin The Conqueror threatened to
throw the world out of balance.

152
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,233
I stopped him.

153
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:13,473
And the world entered
a great era of peace.

154
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:16,033
But you really didn't kill Chin.

155
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:17,443
Technically, he fell to his own doom

156
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,593
because he was too stubborn
to get out of the way.

157
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:22,143
Personally, I don't
really see the difference.

158
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:23,313
But I assure you,

159
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:25,413
I would have done whatever it took

160
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,953
to stop Chin.

161
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,223
I offer you this wisdom, Aang.

162
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:32,453
Only justice will bring peace.

163
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,523
I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.

164
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:41,063
So Bumi,

165
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,093
how did you end up escaping

166
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,563
your imprisonment in Omashu?

167
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:44,943
Escape?

168
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,353
I didn't escape.

169
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,203
Everybody else escaped.

170
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:50,573
There I was back in Omashu,
waiting for just the right

171
00:09:52,973 --> 00:09:55,843
moment. I didn't know what or when,

172
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:59,043
but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.

173
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:00,653
An eclipse.

174
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:01,803
That'll do it.

175
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,203
What do you think you're doing?

176
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,823
Taking back my city.

177
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,873
You've got no fire power

178
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,483
and it's payback time!

179
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:15,023
Wow!

180
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:17,733
You took back your whole
city all by yourself!

181
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,673
So what about you guys?

182
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:23,313
Did you do anything interesting
on the day of the eclipse?

183
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:24,863
Nah.

184
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,063
No, not really.

185
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,213
I need to look deep inside myself.

186
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,873
I am Avatar Kuruk.

187
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:42,563
When I was young,

188
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,053
I was always a

189
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:46,573
"go with the flow" kind of Avatar.

190
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:50,833
People seemed to work
out their own problems,

191
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,633
and there was peace and
good times in the world.

192
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:59,653
But then, I lost the
woman I loved to Koh,

193
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:01,923
the Face Stealer.

194
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:04,833
It was my fault.

195
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:07,903
If I had been more 
attentive and more active,

196
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:09,483
I could have saved her.

197
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,123
Aang,

198
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:14,593
you must actively shape your own destiny

199
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,743
and the destiny of the world.

200
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,293
Well, here we are.

201
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,823
Welcome to old people camp.

202
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,363
Where...

203
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:37,013
Where is he?

204
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,213
Your Uncle's in there, Prince Zuko.

205
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,543
Are you okay?

206
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:53,413
No, I'm not okay.

207
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:55,493
My Uncle hates me, I know it.

208
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:58,283
He loved me and supported
me in every way he could

209
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,543
and I still turned against him.

210
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:02,653
How can I even face him?

211
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:03,783
Zuko,

212
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:05,893
you're sorry for what you did, right?

213
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,873
More sorry than I've been about
anything in my entire life.

214
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,583
Then he'll forgive you.

215
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:11,853
He will.

216
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:21,603
Uncle?

217
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,093
All these past Avatars,

218
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:41,323
they keep telling me
I'm gonna have to do it.

219
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:42,523
They don't get it.

220
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,383
You're right.

221
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,243
Maybe an Air Nomad Avatar

222
00:13:46,363 --> 00:13:48,103
will understand where I'm coming from.

223
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,533
I know you can't really talk.

224
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,433
Pretending you can just helps me think.

225
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:57,373
I'm going to pretend I
didn't pretend to hear that.

226
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:09,353
I am Avatar Yangchen, young airbender.

227
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,003
Avatar Yangchen,

228
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:13,173
the monks always taught
me that all life is sacred.

229
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:16,523
Even the life of the tiniest
spider-fly caught in its own web.

230
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:18,253
Yes,

231
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,133
all life is sacred.

232
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,393
I know, I'm even a vegetarian.

233
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,633
I've always tried to solve my
problems by being quick or clever,

234
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:28,743
and I've only had to use
violence for necessary defence.

235
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,163
And I've certainly never
used it to take a life.

236
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,873
Avatar Aang,

237
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:35,363
I know that you're a gentle spirit,

238
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:37,463
and the monks have taught you well,

239
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:39,883
but this isn't about you.

240
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,193
This is about the world.

241
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:43,233
But the monks taught me

242
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:45,113
that I had to detach myself from the world

243
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,813
so my spirit could be free.

244
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:50,953
Many great and wise Air Nomads
have detached themselves

245
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:53,553
and achieved spiritual enlightenment.

246
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:56,163
But the Avatar can never do it,

247
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:59,263
because your sole duty is to the world.

248
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:01,993
Here is my wisdom for you.

249
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:07,403
Selfless duty calls you to
sacrifice your own spiritual needs

250
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:12,843
and do whatever it takes
to protect the world.

251
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,943
I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.

252
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,113
I have to kill the Fire Lord.

253
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:39,718
Uncle,

254
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:43,428
I know you must have mixed
feelings about seeing me.

255
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,338
But I want you to know,

256
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,548
I am so,

257
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,428
so sorry, Uncle.

258
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,818
I am so sorry and ashamed of what I did.

259
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,888
I don't know how I can ever make it up to you.

260
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,898
But I...

261
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,348
How can you forgive me so easily?

262
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:06,718
I thought you would be furious with me.

263
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:09,708
I was never angry with you.

264
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:11,728
I was sad

265
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:14,748
because I was afraid you lost your way.

266
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,688
I did lose my way.

267
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:20,048
But you found it again.

268
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,518
And you did it by yourself.

269
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:26,848
I am so

270
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:29,418
happy you found your way here.

271
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:31,778
It wasn't that hard, Uncle.

272
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,458
You have a pretty strong scent.

273
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:47,778
Wait.

274
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,518
Is it just me

275
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,848
or are those mountains getting bigger?

276
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:03,458
They're not getting larger,

277
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:04,858
they're getting closer.

278
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:09,318
The whole island is moving!

279
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:37,328
It's amazing, Momo.

280
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,158
The biggest animal in the world!

281
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:41,388
I've got to swim around
and find its face.

282
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,748
Uncle,

283
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,468
you're the only person
other than the Avatar

284
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,538
who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.

285
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:00,478
You mean the Fire Lord.

286
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,098
That's what I just said.

287
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:06,018
We need you to come with us.

288
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,868
No, Zuko.

289
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,898
It won't turn out well.

290
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,368
You can beat him.

291
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:12,718
And we'll be there to help.

292
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:15,458
Even if I did defeat Ozai,

293
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,798
and I don't know that I could,

294
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,898
it would be the wrong way to end the war.

295
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,958
History would see it as just
more senseless violence,

296
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:28,028
a brother killing a
brother to grab power.

297
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,088
The only way for this war to end peacefully

298
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,708
is for the Avatar

299
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,388
to defeat the Fire Lord.

300
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:36,618
And then...

301
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:39,608
then would you come and take
your rightful place on the throne?

302
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:41,048
No.

303
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,758
Someone new must take the throne.

304
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:46,518
An idealist with pure heart

305
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:49,068
and unquestionable honour.

306
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:52,628
It has to be you, Prince Zuko.

307
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,338
Unquestionable honour?

308
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,388
But I've made so many mistakes.

309
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,488
Yes, you have.

310
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:01,768
You've struggled; you've suffered,

311
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,158
but you have always followed your own path.

312
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,678
You restored your own honour,

313
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,168
and only you can restore the honour

314
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:11,908
of the Fire Nation.

315
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,208
I'll try, Uncle.

316
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,758
Well, what if Aang doesn't come back?

317
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,338
Sozin's Comet is arriving

318
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,638
and our destinies are upon us.

319
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:24,718
Aang will face the Fire Lord.

320
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,318
When I was a boy,

321
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:29,468
I had a vision that I would one day

322
00:19:29,588 --> 00:19:30,868
take Ba Sing Se.

323
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:33,638
Only now do I see that

324
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:36,178
my destiny is to take it back

325
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,858
from the Fire Nation,

326
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:41,528
so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.

327
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,928
That's why you gathered the
members of the White Lotus.

328
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,038
Yes.

329
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:47,968
Zuko,

330
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:50,698
you must return to the Fire Nation,

331
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,568
so that when the Fire Lord falls,

332
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:54,418
you can assume the throne

333
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,108
and restore peace

334
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,278
and order.

335
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,908
But Azula will be there,

336
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,028
waiting for you.

337
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:02,838
I can handle Azula.

338
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:03,978
Not alone.

339
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:05,608
You'll need help.

340
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:07,578
You're right.

341
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:08,548
Katara,

342
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:11,238
how would you like to help
me put Azula in her place?

343
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:13,308
It would be my pleasure.

344
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:14,548
What about us?

345
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:16,128
What's our destiny today?

346
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:18,908
What do you think it is?

347
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,268
I think that...

348
00:20:20,508 --> 00:20:22,098
even though we don't know where Aang is,

349
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,858
we need to do everything we
can to stop the airship fleet.

350
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:27,818
And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord,

351
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,108
we'll be right there if he needs us.

352
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:38,398
Nothing runs faster over
land or swims quicker

353
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:40,298
than a giant eel-hound.

354
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,528
The airship base is on a small island

355
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:44,498
just off the Earth Kingdom shore.

356
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,668
You should be able to intercept
the fleet within a day's journey.

357
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,248
Thank you, Master.

358
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:58,678
So if I'm going to be Fire Lord
after the war is over,

359
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:00,898
what are you going to do?

360
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,058
After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se,

361
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:07,128
I'm going to re-conquer my tea shop,

362
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:10,888
and I'm going to play Pai Sho every day.

363
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:16,988
Goodbye, General Iroh.

364
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:19,198
Goodbye, everyone.

365
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:22,018
Today, destiny is our friend.

366
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:24,288
I know it.

367
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:07,318
A lion turtle!

368
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:12,048
Maybe you can help me.

369
00:22:12,468 --> 00:22:13,368
Everyone,

370
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,498
even my own past lives,

371
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:18,398
are expecting me to end someone's life.

372
00:22:20,108 --> 00:22:21,748
But I don't know if I can do it.

373
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,828
The true mind can weather

374
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:26,078
all the lies and illusions

375
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,878
without being lost.

376
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:30,418
The true heart can tough

377
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:31,868
the poison of hatred

378
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:33,648
without being harmed.

379
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,178
Since beginningless time,

380
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,578
darkness thrives in the void

381
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:40,278
but always yields

382
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,228
to purifying light.

383
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:54,258
Wait for him.

384
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:55,858
He will come.

385
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:10,858
It's time for this world to end in fire

386
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:15,938
and for a new world to
be born from the ashes.
