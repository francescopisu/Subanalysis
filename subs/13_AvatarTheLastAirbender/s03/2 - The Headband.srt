1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,240
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:03,043
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:05,145
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:07,581
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:10,547
<i>Long ago...</i>

6
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:12,682
<i>The four nations lived
together in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:12,683 --> 00:00:17,588
<i>Then everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

8
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:21,792
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:23,642
<i>But when the world
needed him most</i>

10
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:25,596
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:29,366
<i>100 years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

12
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:31,201
<i>an airbender named aang.</i>

13
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:33,636
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great</i>

14
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:36,773
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:41,078
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

16
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,855
I am proud of you, prince zuko.

17
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,391
I am proud because when your
loyalty was tested

18
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,660
by your treacherous uncle

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,161
you did the right thing

20
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,197
and captured the traitor.

21
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:03,487
Why did you tell father
that I was the one who killed the avatar?

22
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,002
Please, zuko...

23
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,437
What ulterior motive
could I have

24
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:11,675
unless somehow the avatar
was actually alive?

25
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:14,778
All that glory would
suddenly turn to shame.

26
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:57,821
Who's there?

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,302
I think I see a cave below.

28
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:15,239
Shh... keep quiet.

29
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:24,281
Great job with the cloud camo,
but next time...

30
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:28,471
Let's disguise ourselves as the kind of
cloud who knows how to keep its mouth shut.

31
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:32,035
Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to
hear us chatting up there and turn us in.

32
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:34,625
Hey, we're in enemy territory.

33
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:37,227
Those are enemy birds.

34
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,378
Well, this is it.

35
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,046
This is how we'll be living
until the invasion begins.

36
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,516
Hiding in cave after cave...

37
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,286
After cave after cave...

38
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:05,489
Sokka, we don't need
to become cave people.

39
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,858
What we need
is some new clothes.

40
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,360
Yeah, blending in
is better than hiding out.

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,129
If we get fire nation disguises

42
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,599
we'll be just as safe as we
would be hiding in a cave.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,366
Plus, they have
real food out there.

44
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,737
Does anyone wanna sit in the
dirt and eat cave-hoppers?

45
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:30,747
Looks like we
got outvoted, sport.

46
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,316
Let's get some new clothes.

47
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,086
I don't know about this.

48
00:03:36,186 --> 00:03:37,936
These clothes
belong to somebody.

49
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:40,524
I call the silk robe.

50
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:45,262
But if it's essential
to our survival

51
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,631
then I call the suit.

52
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:02,446
Ta-dah... normal kid.

53
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,883
Hmm... I should
probably wear shoes

54
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,585
but then I won't
be able to see as well.

55
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,587
Sorry shoes...

56
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:17,728
Finally, a stylish shoe
for the blind earthbender.

57
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,229
How do I look?

58
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,435
Uh, your mom's necklace.

59
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:28,205
Oh... oh, yeah.

60
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:31,808
I guess it's pretty obviously
water tribe, isn't it?

61
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:51,228
I used to visit my friend
kuzon here 100 years ago.

62
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:53,997
So everyone just follow
my lead and stay cool.

63
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:55,999
Or as they say
in the fire nation

64
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,102
"stay flamin'".

65
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,805
Greetings, my good hotman.

66
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,540
Oh, hi...

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,009
I guess?

68
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,978
Oh, we're going
to a meat place?

69
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,448
Come on, aang,
everyone here eats meat...

70
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:12,598
Even the meat.

71
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,086
You guys go ahead.

72
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,522
I'll just get some lettuce
out of the garbage.

73
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,995
Hotman, hotman.

74
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,897
Hotman.

75
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:28,665
Hotmanhotman.

76
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:31,434
It's over, we caught you.

77
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:32,636
Who me?

78
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,439
It couldn't be more obvious
that you don't belong here.

79
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,774
Next time you play hooky

80
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,744
you might want to take off
your school uniform.

81
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:43,313
Ah!

82
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:54,658
Oh...

83
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:57,628
Is this a new mind
ready for molding?

84
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,628
That's right.

85
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:00,797
Let the molding begin.

86
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:01,898
Wait a minute.

87
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,635
You're not
from the fire nation.

88
00:06:07,571 --> 00:06:09,806
Clearly you're
from the colonies.

89
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:13,043
Yeah, the colonies, of course.

90
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:16,213
The fire nation colonies
in the earth kingdom.

91
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,282
Your etiquette is terrible.

92
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,450
In the homeland,
we bow to our elders...

93
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:24,154
Like so.

94
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:25,522
Sorry ma'am.

95
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:34,398
And we don't wear
head coverings indoors.

96
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:36,533
Um, I have a scar.

97
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,302
It's really embarrassing.

98
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:39,302
Very well.

99
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:41,104
What is your name?

100
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:45,042
Or should we just call you
mannerless colony slob?

101
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,878
Just "slob" is fine.

102
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:50,814
Or, uh... kuzon.

103
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:05,295
We made it through
the day, momo...

104
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:06,730
And it was pretty fun.

105
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:09,799
Don't let the headmaster
catch you with that monkey.

106
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,868
What monkey?

107
00:07:10,968 --> 00:07:13,237
Don't worry,
I'm not a tattletale.

108
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,370
My name's on ji.

109
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:16,206
I like your headband,
by the way.

110
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,978
On ji, you don't have
to baby-sit the new kid.

111
00:07:21,078 --> 00:07:22,613
Wow.

112
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:25,548
You must be one of those popular
kids I've been hearing about.

113
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:26,449
That's right.

114
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,500
Now listen, friend...

115
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:29,219
I know you're from the colonies

116
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,854
so I'll say this slowly.

117
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:34,124
On ji is my girlfriend.

118
00:07:34,224 --> 00:07:36,193
Don't forget it.

119
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,334
It was nice meeting you.

120
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,502
I don't believe it.

121
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:46,770
He didn't beat you up.

122
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,038
Not even a little.

123
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:49,606
I guess I'm just lucky.

124
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,842
We were on our way to play
hide and explode.

125
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:53,010
You wanna come?

126
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,478
I'd love to.

127
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,185
Where have you been?

128
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:03,587
We've been worried sick.

129
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:06,157
I got invited to play
with some kids after school.

130
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,059
After what?

131
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,161
I enrolled in
a fire nation school

132
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,295
and I'm going back tomorrow.

133
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,865
Enrolled in what?

134
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,458
You again?

135
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,911
Stop where you are.

136
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,247
Prince zuko?

137
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:32,716
Ah!

138
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,318
I'm going in for a visit.

139
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:35,885
You're gonna stand guard here

140
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:39,289
and no one is going
to know about this.

141
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:54,938
Uncle... it's me.

142
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:05,883
Aang, I'm trying to be mature and
not immediately shoot down your idea.

143
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:08,452
But it sounds...
Really terrible.

144
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:10,621
Yeah, we got our outfits.

145
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,856
What do you need
to go to school for?

146
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,825
Every minute
I'm in that classroom

147
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:17,761
I'm learning new things
about the fire nation.

148
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,031
I already have a picture
of fire lord, ozai.

149
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:22,147
And here's one that
I made out of noodles.

150
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:24,101
Impressive, I admit.

151
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:25,835
But I still think
it's too dangerous.

152
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:29,740
I guess we'll never find out
about the secret river, then.

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,476
It goes right to
the fire lord's palace.

154
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,546
We were supposed to learn
about it in class tomorrow...

155
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:40,317
Hmm... I am a fan
of secret rivers.

156
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,020
Fine, let's stay
a few more days.

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,122
Flamey-o, hotman.

158
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,194
Flamey-o?
Um-um.

159
00:09:51,995 --> 00:09:54,064
You brought this
on yourself, you know.

160
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,866
We could have returned together.

161
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,734
You could have been a hero.

162
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,305
You had no right
to judge me, uncle.

163
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:04,274
I did what I had to do
in ba sing se

164
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:06,184
and you're a fool
for not joining me.

165
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,815
You're not gonna say anything?

166
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:12,983
Oh!

167
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,820
You're a crazy old man.

168
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,970
You're crazy,
and if you weren't in jail

169
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:21,658
you'd be sleeping in a gutter.

170
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:29,166
Good morning, class.

171
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:31,969
Recite the fire nation oath.

172
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:35,672
My life, I give to my country.

173
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,340
With my hands,
I fight for fire lord...

174
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,109
Fire lord...

175
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,477
Forefathers...

176
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:43,080
With my mind, I seek
ways to better my country

177
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,882
and with my feet...

178
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:46,032
Firebenders...

179
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,651
Fire lord.

180
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:50,387
Wha, bah, blah, blah.

181
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,062
Since it's obviously hilarious
to mock our national oath

182
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:02,292
we'll begin with a pop quiz on
our great march of civilization.

183
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:06,737
Question one.

184
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:10,841
What year did fire lord sozin
battle the air nation army?

185
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,077
Kuzon?

186
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:16,046
Is that a trick question?

187
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:19,216
The air nomads didn't
have a formal military.

188
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:23,120
Sozin defeated them by ambush.

189
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:27,356
Well, I don't know how you could possibly
know more than our national history book

190
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:30,160
unless you were there
a hundred years ago.

191
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,896
I'll just write down
my best guess.

192
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:46,410
Kuzon?

193
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:51,481
I know, I'm a terrible
tsungi hornist.

194
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:52,548
No, child.

195
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,584
That hullabaloo going
on with your feet.

196
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:56,620
Is that a nervous disorder?

197
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,423
I was just dancing.

198
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,859
You do dances here in the
homeland, right?

199
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,927
Not really, no.

200
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:07,831
Dancing is not conducive to
a proper learning environment.

201
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,634
Young people must have rigid
discipline and order.

202
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,769
But what about
expressing yourself?

203
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,760
I know sometimes we're so moved
by our love for our nation

204
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:19,810
that we can't control
our own bodies.

205
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,345
If you must

206
00:12:21,445 --> 00:12:26,316
you may march in place quietly
next time the urge hits you.

207
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:43,500
Oh, hi, kuzon.

208
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:46,336
I really liked that crazy
dance you were doing.

209
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:47,486
Thanks, on ji.

210
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,338
I could show it to you
again if you'd like.

211
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,389
Ah!

212
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,142
What'd you say, colo trash?

213
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:53,944
You're gonna show her something?

214
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,546
Just some dance movements.

215
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,581
Nobody sho my on ji anything

216
00:12:57,681 --> 00:12:59,550
especially movement.

217
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:12,812
Ah!

218
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,581
Ha!

219
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:17,233
Yah!

220
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,368
Ah.

221
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:31,481
Picking fights
on your second day?

222
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:34,150
We need to have a conference
to discuss your punishment.

223
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:36,118
Bring your parents
to my office after school.

224
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,921
Parents, but...

225
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,023
Don't be late.

226
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,601
Thank you for coming

227
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:51,734
Mr. and Mrs...

228
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:54,371
Fire... wang fire.

229
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:56,940
This is my wife, sapphire.

230
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,009
Sapphire fire,
nice to meet you.

231
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:01,411
Mr. and Mrs. fire...

232
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,741
Your son has been enrolled
here for two days

233
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:05,624
and he's already
causing problems.

234
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,250
He's argued with
his history teacher

235
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,952
disrupted music class

236
00:14:09,052 --> 00:14:10,621
and roughed up my star pupil.

237
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,222
My goodness.

238
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,023
That doesn't sound
like our kuzon.

239
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,758
That's what any mother
would say, ma'am.

240
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,895
Nonetheless, you're forewarned.

241
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,930
If he acts up one more time

242
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,065
I'll have him sent
to reform school...

243
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,701
By which I mean the coal mines.

244
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:25,969
Are we clear?

245
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,205
Don't you worry,
Mr. headmaster

246
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:31,308
I'll straighten this boy
out something fierce.

247
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:34,977
Young man, as son as we get home, you're
gonna get the punishment of a lifetime.

248
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:37,381
That's what I like to hear.

249
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:45,622
Orange is such an awful color.

250
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,626
You're so beautiful
when you hate the world.

251
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:51,028
I don't hate you.

252
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:53,764
I don't hate you, too.

253
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,835
Zuko, could I have
a word with you?

254
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:01,738
Can't you see we're busy?

255
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:06,376
Oh, mai, ty Lee needs your help
untangling her braid.

256
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:09,046
Sounds pretty serious.

257
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:18,488
So I hear you've been to visit your
uncle fatso in the prison tower.

258
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,823
That guard told you.

259
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:23,694
No, you did... just now.

260
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:26,830
Ok, you caught me.

261
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,599
What is it that
you want, azula.

262
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,068
Actually, nothing.

263
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:34,104
Believe it or not,
I'm looking out for you.

264
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:36,372
If people find out
you've been to see uncle

265
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:39,042
they'll think you're
plotting with him.

266
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:42,346
Just be careful dum-dum.

267
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,683
That settles it.

268
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,753
No more school for you,
young man.

269
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,003
I'm not ready to leave.

270
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:52,923
I'm having fun for once

271
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,658
just being a normal kid.

272
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,160
You don't know
what it's like, sokka.

273
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,962
You get to be normal
all the time.

274
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:01,031
Ha, ha.

275
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:04,267
Listenguys, those kids at school
are the future of the fire nation.

276
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:06,498
If we wanna change
this place for the better

277
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,972
we need to show them
a little taste of freedom.

278
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:13,043
What could you possibly do for a country
of depraved little fire monsters?

279
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:16,146
I'm gonna throw them
a secret dance party.

280
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,649
Go to your room.

281
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:28,725
I can't believe we're
having a dance party.

282
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:30,427
It seems so... silly.

283
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:32,396
Don't think of it
as a dance party

284
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:36,033
but as a cultural event
celebrating the art of fancy footwork.

285
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,635
They're coming.

286
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,772
Everyone stop bending.

287
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:43,574
Sorry, buddy.

288
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:45,909
You should probably
wait out back.

289
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,114
I know, you've got
fancier feet than anybody...

290
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:53,150
And six of 'em.

291
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:03,927
Ladies and gentlemen.

292
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:06,563
The flamey-os!

293
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:10,167
Yeah, this ought to get
everybody moving.

294
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:15,138
Now what do we do?

295
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,207
This is when you start dancing.

296
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:20,811
I don't think
my parents want me dancing in a cave.

297
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:24,848
Yeah, what if someone
finds out?

298
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,848
Oh, boy.

299
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,899
Listen, guys...

300
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:29,286
Dancing isn't something
you think about.

301
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:31,021
It's a form of self-expression

302
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:33,257
that no one can ever
take away from you.

303
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:37,227
Maybe it was different in the colonies,
kuzon, but we don't do that here.

304
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:38,395
Sure you do.

305
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,564
You have for generations.

306
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:43,799
It just so happens that I know
several classic fire nation dances.

307
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,636
A hundred years o

308
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:47,203
this was known as
"the Phoenix flight."

309
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,439
Ooh... wow.

310
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,510
And this was
the "camelephant strut".

311
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:04,388
Who knew twinkle toes
could dance?

312
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,960
I brought you some
komodo-chicken.

313
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,728
I know you don't care for it

314
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:14,097
but I figure
it beats prison food.

315
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:15,248
I admit it.

316
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,668
I have everything
I always wanted

317
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:20,070
but it's not at all how
I thought it would be.

318
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,639
The truth is

319
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,775
I need your advice.

320
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,945
I think the avatar
is still alive.

321
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,913
I know he's out there.

322
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,683
I'm losing my mind.

323
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:36,053
Please, uncle, I'm so confused,
I need your help.

324
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,556
Forget it.

325
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:40,796
I'll solve this myself.

326
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:42,993
Waste away in here
for all I care.

327
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:04,515
And this is how they do it in
the ballrooms of ba sing se.

328
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,523
Wow, they look pretty
good together.

329
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:15,292
Eh, if that's what you like.

330
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:18,494
Yeah, that's it.

331
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,265
That's the sound of happy feet.

332
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:27,037
All right, go with that.

333
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:29,039
Everybody, freestyle.

334
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:47,758
I don't know, aang.

335
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,026
These shoes aren't
really right for dancing

336
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:52,129
and I'm not sure
that I know how to...

337
00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:53,279
Take my hand.

338
00:19:53,297 --> 00:19:55,465
Ok.

339
00:20:15,986 --> 00:20:17,855
Aang, everyone's watching.

340
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,095
Don't worry about them.

341
00:20:19,189 --> 00:20:21,959
It's just you and me right now.

342
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,187
Wow.

343
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,038
It is a dancing party.

344
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:10,308
You did the right thing by
telling me, hide.

345
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:12,109
Anytime, headmaster, sir.

346
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,546
This is incredible.

347
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,981
It's like my inhibitions
just disappear.

348
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,056
Ok, they're back again.

349
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,206
He's the one we want.

350
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:30,294
The boy with the headband.

351
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:31,444
Uh-oh.

352
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:38,000
Got ya.

353
00:21:38,001 --> 00:21:39,269
Looking for me?

354
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:42,406
That's not the one.

355
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:43,907
He's here somewhere.

356
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,387
Don't let him leave the cave.

357
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:51,364
Yes?

358
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,888
Hi there.
How we doing?

359
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,430
Looking for someone?

360
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:09,532
Who are you looking for?

361
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,801
Do you need something?

362
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:11,951
Over here.

363
00:22:25,582 --> 00:22:28,318
Stop that.

364
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:30,420
Stop that.

365
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,358
We're safe, sokka.

366
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,092
You can take off
the moustache, now.

367
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:37,794
Oh, no, I can't.

368
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:40,464
It's permanently
glued to my skin.

369
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,766
Way to go, dancy pants.

370
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:45,369
I think you really
did help those kids.

371
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:46,770
You taught them to be free.

372
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:47,904
I don't know.

373
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:49,775
It was just
a dance party, that's all.

374
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:52,576
Well, that was some
dance party, aang.

375
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:54,011
Mwah.

376
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,780
Flamey-o, sir...

377
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,550
Flamey-o.

378
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,263
You're sure
you weren't followed?

379
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:16,567
I've heard about you.

380
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,802
They say you're good
at what you do

381
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:21,471
and even better
at keeping secrets.

382
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:23,774
The avatar's alive.

383
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:25,943
I want you to find him

384
00:23:26,043 --> 00:23:27,878
and end him.
