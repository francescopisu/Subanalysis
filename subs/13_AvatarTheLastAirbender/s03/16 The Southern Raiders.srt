00:00:00,788 --> 00:00:01,788
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,203
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:05,749
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,089
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:12,859
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:16,891
<i>Then, everything changed when
the Fire nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:21,781
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:24,743
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:29,282
<i>A handred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,915
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,314
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,181
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,384
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:51,698
You have no idea what this
war has put me through.

15
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:52,996
Me personally.

16
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:56,254
The Fire nation took my
mother away from me.

17
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,465
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,934
You might have everyone else here
buying your "transformation",

19
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:06,941
but you and I both know you've struggled
with doing the right thing in the past.

20
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:09,642
So let me tell you something right now.

21
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:15,072
You make one step backward, one slip up, give
me one reason to think you might hurt Aang,

22
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,121
and you won't have to worry
about your destiny anymore.

23
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,477
Watch out!

24
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,720
What are you doing?!

25
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,171
Keeping rocks from crushing you.

26
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:17,172
Okay, I’m not crushed.
You can get off me now.

27
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,592
I’ll take that as a thank you.

28
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:24,748
Come on,
we can get out through here!

29
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:28,135
What are you doing?

30
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:32,856
Go ahead, I’ll hold them off.
I think this is a family visit.

31
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,223
Zuko, no!

32
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:36,699
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

33
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:53,443
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,853
You mean it’s not obvious yet?

35
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:59,185
I’m about to celebrate
becoming an only child!

36
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,025
I can’t get him to go in there.
Appa hates tunnels.

37
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:40,087
Aang, there’s no way
we can fly out of here.

38
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:42,017
We’ll have to find a way.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,700
We need to split up.
Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.

40
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:52,022
No, the fire nation
can’t separate our family again.

41
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:54,723
It’ll be okay,
it’s not forever.

42
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:13,044
I can clear that away
and we can fly out through there.

43
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,509
Umm, there’s an awful
lot of fire in that general direction.

44
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,380
We’ll get through, let’s go.

45
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,602
She’s not going to make it.

46
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,699
Of course she did.

47
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:57,068
Wow, camping. It really seems
like old times again, doesn’t it?

48
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,656
If you really want to
feel like old times, I could, uhh…

49
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,160
chase you around a
while and try to capture you.

50
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:05,722
Haha.

51
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:13,605
To zuko. Who knew after all those times he
tried to snuff us out, today, he be our hero.

52
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,053
Here, here.

53
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,150
I’m touched.
I don’t deserve this.

54
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,782
Yeah, no kidding.

55
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,375
- What’s with her?
- I wish I knew.

56
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,207
What’s with him?

57
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:40,656
This isn’t fair. Everyone else seems
to trust me now. What is it with you?

58
00:06:40,794 --> 00:06:42,694
Oh, everyone trust you know?

59
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:46,801
I was the first person to
trust you, remember? Back in ba sing se.

60
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:50,775
And you turned around and
betrayed me. Betrayed all of us.

61
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,031
What can I do to make it up to you?

62
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,601
You really want to know?

63
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:58,718
Hmm, maybe you could re-conquer
ba sing se in the name of the earth king.

64
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,819
Or, I know.
You could bring my mother back.

65
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,333
Opps, wrong tent.

66
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:15,348
Sorry.
Do you need to talk to sokka too?

67
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,601
Nope. Not me.

68
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:22,964
Well, hellooo.

69
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:28,502
Uh, zuko. Yes, why would
I be expecting any one different?

70
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,900
So what’s on your mind?

71
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:35,686
Your sister, she hates
me and I don’t know why!

72
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,672
But I do care
what she thinks of me.

73
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:41,359
Nah, she doesn’t hate you.
Katara doesn’t hate anyone.

74
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,790
Except maybe some
people in the fire nation.

75
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:49,211
No, I mean, uh, not people who are good
but used to be bad. I mean, bad people.

76
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:53,281
Fire nation people who are so bad, who have
never been good and probably won’t be ever!

77
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:58,382
Stop. Okay, listen.
I know this may seem out of nowhere,

78
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:01,242
but I want you to tell me
what happened to your mother.

79
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,643
What?
Why would you want to know that?

80
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:07,608
Katara mentioned it before when we were
imprisoned together in ba sing se...

81
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:10,115
And again just now
when she was yelling at me.

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,860
I think somehow… she’s connected
her anger about that to her anger at me.

83
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,105
It’s not a day
I like to remember.

84
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,033
I’m going to find mum.

85
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:43,046
Many of the warriors have seen the black
snow before and they knew what it meant.

86
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,571
A fire nation raid.

87
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:59,712
We were badly outnumbered.
But somehow, we managed to drive them off.

88
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,742
As quickly as they came,
they just left.

89
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,904
I was so relieved
when it was over but,

90
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,634
that’s because I didn’t
know yet what have happened.

91
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,434
I didn’t know
we lost our mother.

92
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:22,122
Wait. Can you remember any details
about the soldiers who raided your village?

93
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,528
Like,
what the lead ship looked like?

94
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Yeah… sea ravens. The main ship had
flags with sea ravens on them.

95
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:34,094
The symbol of the Southern raiders.
Thanks, sokka.

96
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:37,195
No problem.
Thanks for stopping by.

97
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:40,932
Thought he never leave.

98
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,375
Suki.

99
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
You look terrible.

100
00:09:57,775 --> 00:09:59,095
I waited out here all night.

101
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,483
What do you want?

102
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:04,303
I know who killed your mother.
I’m going to help you find him.

103
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,555
I need to borrow appa.

104
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,349
Why? Is it your turn to
take a little fieldtrip with zuko?

105
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,011
Yes, it is.

106
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,502
Oh. What’s going on?

107
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,539
We’re going to find the
man who took my mother from me.

108
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:32,708
Sokka told me the story of what happened.
I know who did it. And I know how to find him.

109
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,310
Umm… and what exactly
do you think this would accomplish?

110
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,750
I knew you wouldn’t understand.

111
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:44,496
Wait, stop, I do understand.
You’re feeling unbelievable pain and rage.

112
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:48,273
How do you think I felt about
the sandbenders when they stole appa?

113
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:52,779
How do you think I felt about the fire nation
when I found out what happened to my people?

114
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,780
She needs this, aang.
This is about getting closure and justice.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,900
I don’t think so.
I think it’s about getting revenge.

116
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:05,001
Fine! Maybe it is. Maybe that’s what I need.
Maybe that’s what he deserves.

117
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,683
Katara, you sound like jet.

118
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:10,732
It’s not the same.
Jet attacked the innocent.

119
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,567
This man, he’s a monster.

120
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:16,804
Katara, she was my mother too.
But I think aang might be right.

121
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,319
Then you didn’t
love her the way I did.

122
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,820
Katara…

123
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:25,678
the monks used to say that
revenge is like a two-headed ratviper.

124
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,788
While you watch your enemy go down,
you’re being poisoned yourself.

125
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,089
That’s cute. But this isn’t
air temple pre-school. It’s the real world.

126
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:38,535
Now that I know he’s out there,
now that I know we could find him,

127
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,144
I feel like I have no choice.

128
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,600
Katara, you do have a choice.
Forgiveness.

129
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,048
That’s the same as doing nothing.

130
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:52,164
No it’s not. It’s easy to do nothing.
But it’s hard to forgive.

131
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:55,318
It’s not just hard,
it’s impossible.

132
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,672
So you were just
going to take appa anyway?

133
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:10,198
Yes.

134
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:15,947
It’s okay, because I forgive you.
That give you any ideas?

135
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:17,524
Don’t try to stop us.

136
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:21,407
I wasn’t planning to.
This is a journey you need to take.

137
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,376
You need to face this man.

138
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,738
But when you do,
please don’t choose revenge.

139
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:33,599
Let your anger out
and then let it go. Forgive him.

140
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:37,064
Okay, we’ll be sure
to do that guru-goody-goody.

141
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,510
Thanks for understanding aang.
Yip yip.

142
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,471
You know,
you’re pretty wise for a kid.

143
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,099
Thanks, sokka.

144
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,900
Usually it’s annoying but right now,
I’m just impressed.

145
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,101
I appreciate that.

146
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,521
So…
can I borrow momo for a week?

147
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,790
Why do you need momo?

148
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,724
We need to find the
fire navy communication tower.

149
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:04,145
All the navy’s movements
are coordinated by messenger hawk.

150
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:07,396
And every tower has to be
up to date on where everyone is deployed.

151
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:11,778
So once we find the communication tower, we
bust in and take the information we need.

152
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,289
Not exactly. We need to be
stealthy and make sure no one spots us.

153
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:20,853
Otherwise, they’ll warn the Southern raiders.
Long before we reach them.

154
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:48,088
Okay, Southern raiders.

155
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:53,935
There.
On patrol near whale tail island.

156
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,663
Whale tail island, here we come.

157
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,645
You should get some rest.
We’ll be there in a few hours.

158
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,270
You’ll need all your strength.

159
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,809
Now, don’t you worry
about my strength. I have plenty.

160
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:16,485
I’m not the helpless
little girl I was when they came.

161
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,199
I’m going to find mum.

162
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,003
Mum!

163
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:33,949
Just let her go
and I’ll give you the information you want.

164
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,682
You heard your mother, get out of here!

165
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:38,283
Mum, I’m scared.

166
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,190
Go find your dad, sweetie.
I’ll handle this.

167
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,152
I ran as fast as I could.

168
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,259
Dad! Dad! Please, I think mum’s
in trouble! There’s a man in our house.

169
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,487
Kya!

170
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:07,106
But, we were too late. When we got there,
the man was gone. And so was she.

171
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,995
Your mother was a brave woman.

172
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:12,936
I know.

173
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,136
There! See those sea raven flags?

174
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:26,512
It’s the Southern raiders.

175
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,373
Let’s do this.

176
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,230
So there I was and
I was like, you know, you could…

177
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:13,915
this is it, katara.
Are you ready to face him?

178
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,557
Who are you?

179
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,220
You don’t remember her?
You will soon. Trust me.

180
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:39,998
What?

181
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,253
What’s happening to me?

182
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:54,822
Think back. Think back to your
last raid on the Southern water tribe.

183
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:58,772
I don’t know what you’re
talking about. Please, I don’t know!

184
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:04,113
Don’t lie! You look her in the eye and you
tell me you don’t remember what you did.

185
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:14,861
It’s not him.

186
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,450
He’s not the man.

187
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:23,503
What?! What do you mean he’s not?
He’s a leader of the Southern raiders!

188
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,068
He has to be the guy!

189
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,367
If you’re not the man
we’re looking for, who is?

190
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:38,144
You must be looking for yon rha.
He retired 4 years ago.

191
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:53,496
Yon rha,
you lazy piece of work, I need something.

192
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:57,033
Yes mother, what is it?

193
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,841
The tomato-carrot
from your garden are too hard for my gums.

194
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,942
I need something soft and juicy.

195
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:07,571
Would you like something else
from the garden? I would be happy to…

196
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,138
forget your stupid garden!

197
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:13,329
Get your grimy hind to the
market and buy me some real food!

198
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:32,311
Hello?
Did you see someone?

199
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,637
Hello? Is someone there?

200
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,590
That was him.
That was the monster.

201
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:07,031
Nobody sneaks up
on me without being burned.

202
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:29,428
We weren’t behind the bush.
And I wouldn’t try firebending again.

203
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:34,988
Whoever you are, take my money.
Take whatever you want, I’ll cooperate.

204
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,057
Do you know who I am?

205
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,838
No, I’m not sure.

206
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:45,962
Oh you better remember me like your life depends on it!
Why don’t you take a closer look.

207
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:53,576
Yes, yes. I remember you now.
You’re the little water tribe girl.

208
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,491
Just let her go and I’ll
give you the information you want.

209
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,196
You heard your mother,
get out of here!

210
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:03,303
Mum, I’m scared.

211
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,535
Go find your dad, sweetie.
I’ll handle this.

212
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:15,299
Now, tell me. Who is it?
Who’s the waterbender?

213
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:21,210
There are no waterbenders here. The fire
nation took them all away a long time ago.

214
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:27,632
You’re lying. My source says there’s one
waterbender left in the Southern water tribe.

215
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,758
We’re not leaving until
we find the waterbender.

216
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,060
If I tell you, do you promise
to leave the rest of the village alone?

217
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,854
It’s me.
Take me as your prisoner.

218
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:44,193
I’m afraid
I’m not taking prisoners today.

219
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:52,588
She lied to you.
She was protecting the last waterbender.

220
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,718
What? Who?

221
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:56,924
Me!

222
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:31,121
I did a bad thing.
I know I did and you deserve revenge.

223
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,269
So why don’t you take my mother?
That would be fair.

224
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,900
I always wonder what kind
of person could do such a thing.

225
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:41,282
But now that I see you,
I think I understand.

226
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:47,894
There’s just nothing inside you. Nothing at all.
You’re pathetic and sad and empty.

227
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:49,837
Please spare me.

228
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:56,247
But as much as I hate you…
I just can’t do it.

229
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:25,255
Katara! Are you okay?

230
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:27,191
I’m doing fine.

231
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:34,467
Zuko told me what you did.
Or… what you didn’t do, I guess. I’m proud of you.

232
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:40,104
I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out
all my anger at him but, I couldn’t.

233
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:45,697
I don’t know if it’s because I’m too weak to do
it or if it’s because I’m strong enough not to.

234
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:51,181
You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the
first step you have to take to begin healing.

235
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,110
But I didn’t forgive him.
I’ll never forgive him.

236
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,111
But I am ready to forgive you.

237
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:12,573
You were right about what
katara needed. Violence wasn’t the answer.

238
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,941
It never is.

239
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,415
Then I have a question for you.

240
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:20,821
What are you going
to do when you face my father?
