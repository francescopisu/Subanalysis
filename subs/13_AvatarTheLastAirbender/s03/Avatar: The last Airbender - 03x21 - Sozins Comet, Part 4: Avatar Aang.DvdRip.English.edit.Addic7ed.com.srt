1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,850
Water,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,120
Earth,

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,250
Fire,

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:08,510
Air.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,940
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,490
Then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,310
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,510
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,580
100 years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,550
an Airbender named Aang.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,970
And although his airbending skills are great

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,140
He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

13
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,820
But I believe Aang can save the world.

14
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:49,421
<i>Previously on Avatar</i>

15
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:52,422
Everyone, even my own past lives,

16
00:00:52,623 --> 00:00:55,023
are expecting me to end someone's life.

17
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:56,723
But I don't know if I can do it.

18
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:00,924
Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus is here.

19
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,425
Here to set you free.

20
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:05,426
Sukki!

21
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:08,727
I'm okay, just finish the mission!

22
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:11,728
Sorry, but you're not gonna become Fire Lord today.

23
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:15,729
I am.

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,830
Zuko!

25
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:23,731
You're weak, just like the rest of your people.

26
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:24,932
Prepare to die!

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,730
Come on out, Avatar! You can't hide in there forever!

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,600
Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position.

29
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,120
The ship will spiral and slam into the others.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,690
Got it

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,720
Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metal bending?

32
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,780
You can stand to mention it more

33
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,540
Aaaaaargh!

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,080
My leg! Hang on Toph!

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,960
Aye-aye Captain!

36
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,530
Bye space sword...

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,650
I don't think boomerang's coming back Toph, It looks like this is the end.

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,040
How did that happen? Did boomerang come back?

39
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,860
No! Sukki did!

40
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,290
Come on out little boy. You are about to be...

41
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,210
I'd really rather our family physician look after little Zuzu if you don't mind!

44
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,690
Thank you Katara.

45
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,060
I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.

46
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,020
Fire Lord Ozai, You and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world!

47
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,170
And now, you shall pay the ultimate price!

48
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,550
No, I'm not gonna end it like this.

49
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,800
Even with all the power in the world, You are still weak!

50
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:04,890
In the era before the Avatar we bent not the elements, but the energy within ourselves.

51
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:49,970
To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable,

52
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:54,971
or you will be corrupted and destroyed.

53
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,240
What... What did you do to me?

54
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,150
I took away your fire bending.

55
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,870
You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.

56
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,050
You did it! You should have seen yourself. It was amazing!

57
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,170
You are all like...

58
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,580
And the Fire Lord are like...

59
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,200
So did you, you know, finish the job?

60
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,660
I'm still alive...

61
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,070
I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance

62
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,740
I took his bending away

63
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,130
Wow, who taught you that?

64
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,640
A giant lionturtle

65
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,900
You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.

66
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,480
Well, look at you buster. Now when your fire bending is gone we should call you...

67
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,280
The Loser Lord

68
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,620
I am the Phoenix King!

69
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>Oh sorry, Did me to offend you Phoenix King of getting butt whooped!</i>

70
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:43,010
Yeah, or how about... king of the... guys who don't win?

71
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,230
Leave the nicknames to us, honey.

72
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,880
You need some help with that?

73
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,070
Mai! You're okay!

74
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,380
They let you out of prison?

75
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,020
My uncle pulled some strings.

76
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,670
And it doesn't hurt the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend.

77
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,270
So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?

78
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,440
I think this means I actually kind of like you.

79
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,540
But don't ever break up with me again!

80
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,260
Dad!

81
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,040
Dad!

82
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,650
I heard what you two did.

83
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,740
I am the proudest father in the world.

84
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,290
And your mother would be proud too

85
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,830
There's my favorite warriors, I have to admit I kind missed the face paint.

86
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,500
So how's it feel to be back in uniform again?

87
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,340
It feels great!

88
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,890
Careful Sukki! Ty Lee's pretending to be a Kyoshi warrior again!

89
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,890
It's OK. She's one of us now

90
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,440
Yeah. The girls and I really bonded in prison.

91
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,660
And after a few chi-blocking lessons, they said I could join their group!

92
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,220
We gonna be best friends forever!

93
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,360
I can't believe a year ago, my purpose in life was hunting you down.

94
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,790
And now...

95
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,040
And now we're friends.

96
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,810
Yeah. We are friends.

97
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,590
I can't believe a year ago, I was still frozen in a block of ice.

98
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,490
The world is so different now.

99
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,100
And it's gonna be even more different.

100
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,330
We'll rebuild it together.

101
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,830
Please, the real hero is the Avatar.

102
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,400
Today, this war is finally over!

103
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,420
I promised my uncle that I would restore the honor of the Fire Nation.
And I will!

104
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,180
The road ahead of us is challenging.
A hundred years of fighting has left the world scared and divided.

105
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,720
But with the Avatar's help,

106
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,910
we can get it back on the right path.
And begin a new era of Love, and Peace.

107
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:18,570
All Hail Fire Lord Zuko!

108
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,290
I should count myself lucky.

109
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,700
The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lonely prison cell.

110
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,300
You should count yourself lucky the Avatar spared your life.

111
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,140
Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life.

112
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
It put me on the right path.

113
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,090
Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.

114
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,780
Why you really here?

115
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,560
Because you gonna tell me something.

116
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,620
Where is my mother?

117
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,170
Zuko stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment.

118
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,710
I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together.

119
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,040
That's very thoughtful of you Sokka.

120
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,190
Wait, why you get me Momo's hair?

121
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,070
Those are your hair's loopies.

122
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,660
At least you don't look like a porcupine. My hair is not that spiky!

123
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,370
I look like a man.

124
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,630
And why did you paint me fire bending?

125
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,340
I thought it looked more exciting that way.

126
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,220
<i>[Momo chattering]</i>

127
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,540
Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?

128
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,710
<i>[Momo chattering]</i>

129
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,560
Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I really trimmed down.

130
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,980
Well, I think you all look perfect!
