1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,606
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:01,973
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:01,974 --> 00:00:04,042
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:05,877
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:13,705
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:17,843
<i>Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:22,114
<i>Only the avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:25,617
<i>But when the world
needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:31,089
<i>100 years passed, and my brother and I discovered
the new avatar, an airbender named aang</i>

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,492
<i>and although his
airbending skills are great</i>

11
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,194
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,666
<i>But I believe aang
can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:50,175
I need you, zuko.

14
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:56,248
I've plotted every move of this day,
and the only way we win is together.

15
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,351
We've done it, zuko.

16
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:02,254
The fire nation
has conquered ba sing se.

17
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:03,495
I betrayed uncle.

18
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:06,091
No, he betrayed you.

19
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:10,796
When you return home, father
will welcome you as a war hero.

20
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:12,331
But I don't have the avatar.

21
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:15,967
What if father
doesn't restore my honor?

22
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:43,395
What happened?

23
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,400
Oh, no!

24
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:01,179
You hear something?

25
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,201
He's awake.

26
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:09,237
Stop, wait!

27
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:17,496
Momo?

28
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:25,103
Twinkle-toes, that's got
to be you.

29
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:27,673
Aang, you're awake.

30
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:28,824
Are you sure?

31
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:31,309
I feel like I'm dremaing.

32
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,144
You're not dreaming.

33
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:33,879
You're finally awake.

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,882
Aang, good to see you
back with the living, buddy.

35
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,317
Sokka?

36
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,686
Uh-oh, somebody catch him.

37
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:42,220
He's gonna...

38
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,402
Aren't you cold?

39
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,538
I've got a lot on my mind.

40
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,306
It's been so long.

41
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,576
Over three years
since I was home.

42
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:06,878
I wonder what's changed.

43
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,814
I wonder how I've changed.

44
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,916
I just asked if you were cold.

45
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:15,921
I didn't ask
for your whole life story.

46
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:21,994
Stop worrying.

47
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,601
Why are we on
a fire nation ship?

48
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:32,371
Why is everyone
dressed this way?

49
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:35,474
And why am I the only one
who's completely out of it?

50
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,309
You need to take it easy, o.K.?

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,479
You got hurt pretty bad.

52
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,447
I like your hair.

53
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:45,017
I have hair?

54
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,168
How long was I out?

55
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:47,919
A few weeks.

56
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,254
Everything ok?

57
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:50,389
We're fine, dad.

58
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,458
I'm hakoda, katara
and sokka's father.

59
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,593
He knows who you are.

60
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:56,228
I just called you "dad,"
didn't I?

61
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:58,096
I guess you're right.

62
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:02,200
Nice to officially
meet you, chief hakoda.

63
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,501
It's an honor to meet you.

64
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,137
Great, great.

65
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:08,040
Now you guys have finally met, so would
you mind giving us a little privacy?

66
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,476
Of course.

67
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:14,346
Are you mad at
your dad or something?

68
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,014
What?

69
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:16,848
Not at all.

70
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:17,883
Why would you say that?

71
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,051
Mmm-mmm.

72
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:22,120
Maybe we should go upstairs.

73
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,690
You need a healing session.

74
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,730
Tell me where your pain
feels most intense.

75
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:33,999
A little higher.

76
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,125
Wow.

77
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,977
You're definitely in
the right area there.

78
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,114
I can feel a lot of energy
twisted up around there.

79
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:55,187
Let me just see if I can...

80
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,760
I went down.

81
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:03,729
I didn't just get hurt, did I?

82
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,364
It was worse than that.

83
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:08,333
I was gone,
but you brought me back.

84
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:11,536
I just used the spirit water
from the north pole.

85
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:13,138
I don't know
what I did, exactly.

86
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,574
You saved me.

87
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:19,077
You need to rest.

88
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:24,850
Your princess azula,
clever and beautiful

89
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:30,722
disguised herself as the enemy and
entered the earth kingdom's capital.

90
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:36,795
In ba sing se, she found her brother
zuko, and together, they faced the avatar.

91
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:44,569
And the avatar fell,
and the earth kingdom fell.

92
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:49,141
Azula's agents quickly
overtook the entire city.

93
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:52,878
They went to ba sing se's
great walls...

94
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,950
And brought them down.

95
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:07,759
The armies of the fire nation
surged through the wall

96
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,532
and swarmed over ba sing se,
securing our victory.

97
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:28,680
Now the heroes
have returned home.

98
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:31,283
Your princess, azula.

99
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:40,859
And after three long years,
your prince has returned.

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,894
Zuko.

101
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,273
After what happened
in ba sing se, we had to get you to safety.

102
00:06:55,375 --> 00:07:00,912
We flew back to chameleon bay, where we found
my father and the other water tribe men.

103
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:06,251
The earth king decided he wanted to travel
the world in disguise, so he set off alone.

104
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,732
Well, not completely alone.

105
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,526
Soon, the bay was overrun
with fire nation ships.

106
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:18,363
Rather than fight them all, we captured
a single ship and made it our disguise.

107
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,599
Since then,
we've been traveling west.

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,934
We crossed through
the serpent's pass a few days ago.

109
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:25,804
We've seen a few fire nation ships,
but none have bothered us.

110
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:27,673
So, what now?

111
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:30,904
We've been working on
a modified version of the invasion plan.

112
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,278
It's sokka's invasion plan.

113
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,848
Yes, sokka's plan.

114
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,419
We won't be able to mount a massive
invasion without the earth king's armies

115
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,790
but the solar eclipse will still
leave the fire nation vulnerable.

116
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:46,158
So we're planning
a smaller invasion.

117
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,695
Just a ragtag team of our friends
and alls from around the earth kingdom.

118
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,496
We already ran into
pipsqueak and the Duke.

119
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,732
Good to see you again, aang.

120
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:57,602
And the best part is, the eclipse
isn't even our biggest advantage.

121
00:07:57,704 --> 00:08:00,672
We have a secret.

122
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:01,373
You.

123
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:02,341
Me?

124
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,876
Yep, the whole world
thinks you're dead.

125
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:07,846
Isn't that great?

126
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:12,050
The world thinks I'm dead?

127
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,319
How is that good news?

128
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,354
That's terrible.

129
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:16,655
No, it's great.

130
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,991
It means the fire nation
won't be hunting us anymore.

131
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:22,361
And even better, they won't be
expecting you on the day of black sun.

132
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:23,595
No, no, no, no, no.

133
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,530
You have no idea.

134
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,265
This is so messed up.

135
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,770
I'll handle this.

136
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:33,405
The avatar is back.

137
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:35,924
Aang, wait.

138
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:41,813
Remember, they don't know
we're not fire nation.

139
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,483
Everyone, just stay calm.

140
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:50,555
Bato and I
will take care of this.

141
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:54,793
I hate not being able
to do anything.

142
00:08:54,894 --> 00:09:00,866
Hopefully, you won't need to.

143
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,942
Commander, why are you
off course?

144
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:13,578
All Western fleet ships
are supposed to be moving

145
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,248
toward ba sing se to support
the occupation.

146
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:19,284
Actually, we're from
the eastern fleet.

147
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:21,119
We have orders
to deliver some cargo.

148
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,889
Ah, eastern fleet.

149
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,893
Well, nice of admiral chan to let us know
he was sending one of his ships our way.

150
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:30,829
I'm sure admiral chan
meant no disrespect, sir.

151
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,366
I mean, how hard is it to write a
quick note and send a hawk our way?

152
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:40,272
Next time, we'll send two hawks,
to be sure you get the message.

153
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:44,142
Sir, admiral chan has been
on leave for two months at ember island.

154
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,210
What?

155
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,346
Why doesn't anyone
ever tell me anything?

156
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:48,647
Something's not right.

157
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:50,068
They should've known that.

158
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,584
I think this is a captured ship.

159
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:55,320
Just stay quiet until
we're safely across the ramp.

160
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,723
Then we'll sink this ship.

161
00:09:57,824 --> 00:10:01,827
They know!

162
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:35,427
You seem so downcast.

163
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,095
Has mai gotten to you already?

164
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:40,799
Though actually, mai has been in
a strangely good mood lately.

165
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,701
I haven't seen dad yet.

166
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:46,438
I haven't seen him
in three years, since I was banished.

167
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,589
So what?

168
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:49,941
So, I didn't capture the avatar.

169
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:51,176
Who cares?

170
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:54,913
The avatar's dead.

171
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:59,851
Unless you think he somehow
miraculously survived.

172
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,955
This is water from
the spirit oasis at the north pole.

173
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:08,627
It has special properties, so I've been
saving it for something important.

174
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,762
No.

175
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:15,834
There's no way
he could've survived.

176
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,342
Well, then I'm sure you
have nothing to worry about.

177
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:23,502
I'm gonna give us some cover.

178
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:43,855
I can't just stand by
and do nothing.

179
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,557
Aang, no!

180
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:48,593
You're still hurt,
and you have to stay secret.

181
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:50,996
Just let us handle this.

182
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:53,999
Fine.

183
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,276
How we doing?

184
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:07,245
Things couldn't get much worse.

185
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:12,584
The universe just loves
proving me wrong, doesn't it?

186
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,386
You make it too easy.

187
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:32,404
Thank you, the universe.

188
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:41,880
Hey, aang.

189
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,091
We're going into town
to find some dinner.

190
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,552
Well, I am pretty hungry.

191
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,221
Maybe dinner's a good idea.

192
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:51,023
Here, tie this around your head.

193
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:53,225
It'll cover your arrow.

194
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:56,395
I'm not going out if
I can't wear my arrow proudly.

195
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,562
Aang, come on.

196
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:58,697
Be practical.

197
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:00,799
You guys go ahead without us.

198
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,135
We'll catch up with you.

199
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:08,407
I think I understand why being
a secret bothers you so much.

200
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:10,042
You don't want people
to think you failed.

201
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,677
You're right, I don't.

202
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,079
But the problem is, I did fail.

203
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,481
Aang, that's not true.

204
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:18,050
It is true.

205
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:19,685
I was in ba sing se.

206
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:22,721
I was there, but I lost.

207
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:25,357
And now, the earth kingdom
has fallen for good.

208
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,326
It's not for good.

209
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:29,094
Remember, there's still a plan.

210
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,062
The invasion.

211
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:31,763
And I hate
the invasion plan, too.

212
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:36,768
I don't want you or anyone else
risking your lives to fix my mistakes.

213
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:39,905
I've always known that I would
have to face the fire lord

214
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:41,973
but now, I know I need
to do it alone.

215
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,009
Aang.

216
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,177
Katara, please.

217
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,182
Just go, please.

218
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:53,418
Is there anything you need?

219
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,854
I need to redeem myself.

220
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:58,457
I need my honor back.

221
00:15:24,617 --> 00:15:28,520
I brought you some food.

222
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,221
Oh, no.

223
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:49,107
You have been away
for a long time.

224
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,077
I see the weight of your travels
has changed you.

225
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:58,150
You have redeemed yourself,
my son.

226
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:04,189
Welcome home.

227
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:24,109
I'll leave you two alone.

228
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,610
What's wrong, katara?

229
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,012
He left.

230
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:27,546
What?

231
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:28,647
Aang.

232
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:31,149
He just took his glider
and disappeared.

233
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,153
He has this ridiculous notion
that he has to save the world alone

234
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,089
that it's all
his responsibility.

235
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,691
Maybe that's his way
of being brave.

236
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:40,525
It's not brave.

237
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:42,527
It's selfish and stupid.

238
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,230
We could be helping him,
and I know the world needs him

239
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:48,100
but doesn't he know how much
that we need him too?

240
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,634
How could he just
leave us behind?

241
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,839
You're talking about me too,
aren't you?

242
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,842
How could you leave us, dad?

243
00:16:56,943 --> 00:17:01,913
I mean, I know we had gran gran, and she loved us, but.
.. But we were just so lost without you.

244
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm so sorry, katara.

245
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,456
I understand why you left.

246
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:17,529
I really do, and I know that you had
to go, so why do I still feel this way?

247
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:23,101
I was so sad and angry,
and hurt.

248
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:26,238
I love you more than anything.

249
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,740
You and your brother
are my entire world.

250
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:34,079
I thought about you every day I was gone,
and every night when I went to sleep

251
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,151
I would lie awake missing you
so much, it would ache.

252
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:44,289
I am proud of you, prince zuko.

253
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,460
I am proud because you
and your sister conquered ba sing se.

254
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:53,965
I am proud because, when your loyalty
was tested by your treacherous uncle

255
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:57,769
you did the right thing
and captured the traitor

256
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,574
and I am proudest of all of your
most legendary accomplishment.

257
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:06,144
You slayed the avatar.

258
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:07,145
What did you hear?

259
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:10,082
Azula told me everything.

260
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:12,250
She said she was
amazed and impressed

261
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:18,323
with your power and ferocity
at the moment of truth.

262
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:26,932
Blockade.

263
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,148
Why'd you do it?

264
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:20,352
You're going to have to be
a little more specific.

265
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:24,289
Why did you tell father
that I was the one who killed the avatar?

266
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,058
Can't this wait until morning?

267
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,326
It can't.

268
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:29,728
Fine.

269
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:33,231
You seemed so worried
about how father would treat you

270
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:35,267
because you hadn't captured
the avatar.

271
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:39,004
I figured, if I gave you the credit,
you'd have nothing to worry about.

272
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:40,238
But why?

273
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,140
Call it a generous gesture.

274
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:46,445
I wanted to thank you for your help,
and I was happy to share the glory.

275
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,280
You're lying.

276
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,582
If you say so.

277
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,417
You have another motive
for doing this.

278
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,853
I just haven't figured out
what it is.

279
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,254
Please, zuko.

280
00:19:56,356 --> 00:19:58,757
What ulterior motive
could I have?

281
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:03,628
What could I possibly gain by letting you
get all the glory for defeating the avatar?

282
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,866
Unless, somehow,
the avatar was actually alive.

283
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:13,238
All that glory would suddenly
turn to shame and foolishness.

284
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:18,543
But you said yourself,
that was impossible.

285
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:24,616
Sleep well, "zuzu."

286
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:48,907
I'm not gonna make it.

287
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:50,058
I failed.

288
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:53,578
Roku?

289
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,580
You haven't failed, aang.

290
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:58,216
But everyone thinks
I'm dead again.

291
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:02,988
They think I've abandoned them,
and I'm losing this war.

292
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:04,956
I'm letting
the whole world down.

293
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:10,195
If anyone is to blame
for the state of the world, it is me.

294
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:13,432
I should've seen
this war coming, and prevented it.

295
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:18,637
You inherited my problems
and my mistakes

296
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:24,009
but I believe you are destined
to redeem me, and save the world.

297
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,511
I don't know.

298
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:31,750
You already saved the world.

299
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,618
And you'll save the world again.

300
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,690
But you can't give up.

301
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:41,960
You're right.

302
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:48,033
I won't give up.

303
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:38,317
You're ok.

304
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:46,124
I have so much to do.

305
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,293
I know,
but you'll have our help.

306
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,028
You didn't think
you could get out of training

307
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:52,030
just by coming to
the fire nation, did you?

308
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,900
What about the invasion?

309
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:58,970
We'll join up with my dad and the
invasion force on the day of the eclipse.

310
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,139
Hey, what's...?

311
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,077
Oh, it's your glider.

312
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:06,278
That's ok.

313
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:11,350
If someone saw it,
it would give away my identity.

314
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:17,422
It's better for now
that no one knows I'm alive.
