1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:03,169
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,169
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,969
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,377
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:13,855
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:17,383
<i>then everything changed when
the fire nation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,742
<i>Only the avatar mastered all
four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,354
<i>but when the world needed
him most he vanished</i>

9
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:30,065
<i>100 years passed, my brother and
I discovered the new avatar</i>

10
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,086
<i>an airbender named Aang</i>

11
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,510
<i>And although his airbending
skill is great,</i>

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,199
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,432
<i>But I believe...
...Aang can save the world</i>

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,958
You and Sokka have to go
with Aang somewhere safe

15
00:00:51,053 --> 00:00:53,161
it's the only way to keep hope alive.

16
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,992
I'm going to join the Avatar,
and I'm going to help him defeat you.

17
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:01,626
Since you're a full blown traitor now
and you want me gone, why wait?

18
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,234
Because I know my own destiny.

19
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:05,749
Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny.

20
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:08,775
I know just the place for us to go
where we'll be safe for a while.

21
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:10,792
The Western Air Temple.

22
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:21,234
Book Three: Fire
Chapter Twelve: The Western Air Temple

23
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:37,129
This is humiliating.

24
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:39,253
Do you mean getting thoroughly
spanked by the Fire Nation,

25
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:42,053
or having to walk all the way
to the Western Air Temple?

26
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:43,865
Both.

27
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:47,888
Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired
carrying all these people.

28
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,242
I wonder how the rest of the troops are.

29
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:54,156
They're probably on their way to a prisson.

30
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,381
Seems like my dad just got out,
now he's going back in.

31
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,199
I miss Pipsqueak.

32
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:02,834
I miss not having blisters on my feet.

33
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:08,064
Hey! We're here! I can feel it.

34
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,311
Uhh... I think your feet
need their eyes checked...

35
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:16,525
No, she's right. We're here.

36
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:22,562
Wow! It's amazing!

37
00:02:59,028 --> 00:03:01,347
What a stunning view!

38
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,052
The only view I'm interested in seeing
is the Avatar in chains.

39
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:11,117
You know the Avatar hasn't been seen
for a hundred years.

40
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:15,568
The chances of finding
him here are very slim.

41
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,570
First we'll check each of the Air Temples.

42
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:18,674
Then we'll scour the world,

43
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:21,729
searching even the most remote
locations until we find him.

44
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,096
Prince Zuko,

45
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,716
it's only been a week
since your banishment.

46
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,899
You should take some time to heal and rest.

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,339
What else would I expect to hear from
the laziest man in the Fire Nation.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,280
The only way to regain my honor is
to find the Avatar...

49
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,704
so I will.

50
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,516
It's so different from
the Nothern Air Temple.

51
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,923
I wonder if there are any secret rooms.

52
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,109
Let's go check it out.

53
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:20,354
You guys go. I think we need to talk
about some things.

54
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,210
I'll race you Duke.

55
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:26,034
I told you, is The Duke!

56
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:27,557
Why can't I go?

57
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,894
We need to decide what we're gunna do now,

58
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,695
and since you're the Avatar
maybe you should be a part of this.

59
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,280
Fair enough.

60
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,394
So, what's the new plan?

61
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,998
Well, if you ask me,

62
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:43,137
the new plan... is the old plan.

63
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:47,666
You just need to master all four elements and
confront the Fire Lord before the commet comes.

64
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,469
Oh, yeah. That's great.

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,006
No problem. I'll just do that.

66
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,894
Aang, no one said it's gunna be easy.

67
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,218
Well, it's not even going to be possible.

68
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,034
Where am I supposed to get
a firebending teacher?

69
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:02,349
We could look for Jeong Jeong.

70
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,146
Yeah, right. Like we'll ever
run into Jeong Jeong again.

71
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:08,149
Who's...

72
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:11,765
Oh... never mind.
If it's important I'll find out.

73
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:14,802
Oh well, guess we can't
come up with anybody.

74
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,821
Why don't we just take a nice tour
around the temple?

75
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:22,481
What's up with him?

76
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:26,921
There's got to be someone who
can teach him firebending.

77
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,613
Hello,

78
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:32,610
Zuko here.

79
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,719
But I guess you probably already know me,

80
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,633
sort of... uh.

81
00:05:36,654 --> 00:05:40,873
So, the thing is, I have a lot of
fire-bending experience

82
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,710
and I'm considered to be pretty good at it.

83
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,955
Well you've seem me...

84
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,602
you know, when I was attacking you...

85
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:49,211
Uh, yeah, I guess I should
apologize for that.

86
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,324
B...but anyway... I'm good now.

87
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:52,936
I mean I thought I was good before

88
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,462
but now I realize I was bad...

89
00:05:55,869 --> 00:06:01,396
But anyway... I think it's time I joined your
group and taught the Avatar firebending.

90
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:09,626
Well, what's your answer!

91
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,733
Yeah, that's what I'd say too.

92
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:18,274
How am I supposed to convince
these people I'm on their side!?

93
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:19,979
What would uncle do?

94
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:26,936
Zuko, you have to look within yourself
to save yourself from your other self.

95
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:32,563
Only then will your true
self reveal itself.

96
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,391
Even when I'm talking for him I
can't figure out what he means.

97
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,911
What would Azula do?

98
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,154
Listen Avatar, I can join your group or I can do
something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends.

99
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:50,054
Your choice.

100
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,290
I guess I'm not that
good at impersonations.

101
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,580
Aang, can we talk about you
learning firebending now?

102
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,510
What? The wind is too loud in my ears.
Check out this loop.

103
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:23,549
Aang, I think we should be making
some plans about our future.

104
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:28,058
Okay. We can do that while I show you
the giant Pai Sho table.

105
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:31,071
Oh, your gunna love the
all-day echo chamber.

106
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,989
I think that'll have to wait.

107
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:42,123
Hello, Zuko here.

108
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,413
Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there so...
I just thought I'd wait for you here.

109
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:06,202
I know you must be
surprised to see me here.

110
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:09,214
Not really, since you followed
us all over the world.

111
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:13,656
Right... Well, uh, anyway...

112
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,082
What I wanted to tell you...
about is that I've changed.

113
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,605
And I, uh, I'm good now.

114
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,338
And, well I think I should join your group.

115
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:25,761
Oh, and I can teach firebending, to you.

116
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:29,481
See, I, uh...

117
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,193
You wanna what now?

118
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,313
You can't possibly think that any
of us would trust you, can you!?

119
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,321
I mean how stupid do you think we are?

120
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,540
Yeah, all you've ever done is try to hunt
us down and capture Aang.

121
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,733
I've done some good things.

122
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:45,800
I mean, I could have stolen your bison
in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free.

123
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,127
That's something.

124
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:51,551
Appa does seem to like him.

125
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:56,683
He probably just covered himself in honey or something
so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it.

126
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,694
I could understand why you wouldn't trust me, and
I know I've made some mistakes in the past...

127
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,322
Like when you attacked our village.

128
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:07,235
Or when you stole my mother's necklace and
used it to track us down and capture us.

129
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:10,750
Look, I admit I've done some awful things.

130
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:15,353
I was wrong to try to capture you, and
I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe.

131
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,746
And I never should have sent that
Fire Nation assassin after you.

132
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,523
I'm gunna try to stop...

133
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,824
Wait! You sent Combustion Man after us!

134
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,029
Well, that's not his name, but...

135
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,244
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to insult your friend.

136
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:28,853
He's not my friend.

137
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:32,784
That guy locked me and Katara in
jail and tried to blow us all up!

138
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,211
Why aren't you saying anything?

139
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,527
You once said you thought
we could be friends.

140
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:42,751
You know I have good in me.

141
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,687
There's no way we can trust you
after everything you've done.

142
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,702
We'll never let you join us.

143
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:55,558
You need to get out of here, now!

144
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,813
I'm trying to explain that
I'm not that person anymore.

145
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:04,022
Either you leave, or we attack.

146
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:09,945
If you won't accept me as a friend, then
maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.

147
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,500
No, we won't!

148
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,438
Get out of here and don't come back.

149
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:20,280
And if we ever see you again...
well, we'd better not see you again.

150
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,180
Ugh. I can't believe how stupid I am.

151
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:42,891
I mean, what was I thinking, telling them
I sent an assassin after them.

152
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:47,646
Why didn't I just say Azula did that?
They would have believed that. Stupid.

153
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,078
Why would he try to fool us like that?

154
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,709
Obviously he wants to lead
us into some kind of trap.

155
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,133
This is just like when we were in
prison together in Ba Sing Se.

156
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:07,951
He starts talking about his mother and making it
seem like he's an actual human being with feelings.

157
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:13,283
He wants you to trust him and feel sorry for him
so you let your guard down. Then he strikes.

158
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:17,795
The thing is, it worked.
I did feel sorry for him.

159
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,000
I felt like he was really
confused and hurt.

160
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:26,515
But, obviously when the time came he
made his choice, and we paid the price.

161
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,822
We can't trust him.

162
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,744
I kind of have a confession to make.
Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao?

163
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,349
And you made us suck on frozen frogs.
How could I forget?

164
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,561
I had a wart on the flap that hangs down
from the back of my throat for a month.

165
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,978
Sokka, I looked at it and told
you there was nothing there.

166
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:48,590
I could feel it. It's my throat-hole flap.

167
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:52,913
Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up it
was Zuko who came in and got me out.

168
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,222
He risked his life to save me.

169
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,230
No way. I'm sure he only did it so he
could capture you himself.

170
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,589
Yeah, face it Aang.
You're nothing but a big prize to him.

171
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,790
You're probably right.

172
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,880
And what was all that crazy stuff
about setting Appa free? What a liar.

173
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,897
Actually, he wasn't lying.

174
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:15,720
Oh, hurray. In a lifetime of evil at least
he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.

175
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,944
I'm just saying... that considering his messed up family and
how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse.

176
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:26,188
You're right Toph.
Let's go find him and give him a medal.

177
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,387
The not as much of a jerk as
you could have been award.

178
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,219
All I know is that while he was
talking to us he was sincere.

179
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:37,218
Maybe you're all just letting your hurt
feelings keep you from thinking clearly.

180
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:40,926
Easy for you to say! You weren't there
when he had us attacked by pirates...

181
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,189
Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island...

182
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,449
Or when he tried to capture me
at the fire temple.

183
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:48,171
Why would you even try to defend him!?

184
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:52,196
Because, Katara, you're all
ignoring one crucial fact.

185
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:55,196
Aang needs a firebending teacher.

186
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:58,322
We can't think of a single person
in the world to do the job,

187
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:02,491
now one shows up on a silver platter
and you won't even think about it!

188
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:07,157
I'm not having Zuko as my teacher.

189
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,164
You're darn right you're not buddy.

190
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:12,194
Well, I guess that's settled.

191
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,497
Urrg! I'm beginning to wonder who's
really the blind one around here.

192
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:27,730
Who's there? Stay back!

193
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,694
It's me.

194
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,738
You burned my feet!

195
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:36,860
I'm sorry! It was a mistake!

196
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,372
Get away from me!

197
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,892
Let me help you. I'm sorry.

198
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:49,809
Get off me! Get off me!

199
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:56,715
I didn't know it was you. Come back!

200
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,447
Gaww! Why am I so bad at being good!?

201
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,623
Has anyone seen Toph?

202
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:16,331
I haven't seen her since
she stormed off yesterday.

203
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:18,834
Maybe she's just exploring the air temple.

204
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:21,551
There are some pretty fun spots
to practice earthbending.

205
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,145
I think we should go look for her.

206
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,158
Aah, let her have fun with her rocks.

207
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,478
I'm in no rush to have
her yelling at us again.

208
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,796
We can go check for her.

209
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:33,410
Yeah, I want to ride that tunnel
down at the hall of statues again.

210
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,526
It'll work a lot better now
that I fixed my breaks.

211
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,056
Toph, what happened?

212
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,769
My feet got burned.

213
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,882
Oh, no! What happened?

214
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:55,608
I just told you, my feet got burned.

215
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,309
I meant how.

216
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:59,812
Well, I kind of went to
see Zuko last night.

217
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:01,212
You what!

218
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:02,049
Zuko!

219
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:02,717
Aah!

220
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:05,710
I just thought he could
be helpful to us, and,

221
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:08,671
if I talked to him maybe we
could work something out.

222
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:10,297
So he attacked you.

223
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,855
Well, he did and he didn't.

224
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,697
It was sort of an accident.

225
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:16,547
But he did firebend at you.

226
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,371
Yes.

227
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,534
See, you trusted Zuko and you got burned.
Literally.

228
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:27,682
It's gunna take a while for your feet to get better.
I wish I could've worked on them sooner.

229
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:28,902
Yeah, me too.

230
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:33,342
Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone.
We're gunna have to go after him.

231
00:15:33,403 --> 00:15:36,017
I hate to go looking for a
fight, but you're right.

232
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,059
After what he did to Toph, I don't think
we have a choice.

233
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,069
He's crafty but we'll find
a way to capture him.

234
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:43,986
Maybe just invite him back here.

235
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,592
He's already offered himself
up as a prisoner once.

236
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:50,910
Yeah... Get him to come back,
and say he'll be our prisoner,

237
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:55,441
then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner.
He'll never suspect it.

238
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,143
You are a master of surprise Sokka.

239
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,088
Aah, that's the stuff.

240
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,678
Now I know how the rest of you guys feel.

241
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,066
Not being able to see
with your feet stinks.

242
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:44,099
Stop! I don't want you
hunting the Avatar anymore.

243
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:48,627
The mission is off.
I'm ordering you to stop.

244
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,767
If you keep attacking, I won't pay you.

245
00:16:57,864 --> 00:17:00,274
Aah. Alright, I'll pay you double to stop.

246
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,892
He's going to blast this whole
place right off the cliff side.

247
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:14,845
I can't step out to waterbend at
him without getting blown up.

248
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:17,333
And I can't get a good enough angle on
him from down here.

249
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,885
I know how to get an angle on him.

250
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:39,473
Alright buddy, don't fail me now.

251
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,708
Yeah, boomerang!

252
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:01,043
Aww, boomerang.

253
00:19:43,324 --> 00:19:47,056
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...
thanks Zuko.

254
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:49,888
Hey, what about me?
I did the boomerang thing.

255
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,589
Listen. I know I didn't explain
myself very well yesterday.

256
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,112
I've been through a lot in the past
few years, and it's been hard.

257
00:19:57,606 --> 00:20:01,723
But I'm realizing that I had to go through
all those things to learn the truth.

258
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:06,131
I thought I had lost my honor, and that
somehow my father could return it to me.

259
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:10,050
But I know now that no one
can give you your honor.

260
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,661
It's something you earn for yourself
by choosing to do what's right.

261
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:16,680
All I want now is to play my part in
ending this war.

262
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:21,596
And I know my destiny is to help
you restore balance to the world.

263
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:26,515
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
It was an accident.

264
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,620
Fire can be dangerous and wild.

265
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:33,238
So as a firebender, I need to be
more careful and control my bending,

266
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,742
so I don't hurt people unintentionally.

267
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:41,010
I think you are supposed to
be my firebending teacher.

268
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:48,862
When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara,
and after that I never wanted to firebend again.

269
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:54,389
But now I know you understand how easy
it is to hurt the people you love.

270
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,114
I'd like you to teach me.

271
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:05,142
Thank you. I'm so happy you've
accepted me into your group.

272
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:09,697
Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends
if it's okay with them.

273
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:13,959
Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned.
What do you think?

274
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:20,304
Go ahead and let him join. It'll give me plenty
of time to get back at him for burning my feet.

275
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,314
Sokka?

276
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,454
Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord.

277
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:30,329
If you think this is the way
to do it, then I'm all for it.

278
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,630
Katara?

279
00:21:41,264 --> 00:21:43,823
I'll go along with whatever
you think is right.

280
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:47,186
I won't let you down, I promise.

281
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,543
So, here you go. Home sweet home.

282
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,544
I guess, you know, for now.

283
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:06,557
Unpack. Lunch, soon.

284
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:09,068
Uhh. Welcome aboard.

285
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,126
Yeah.

286
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:17,514
Okay. This is really, really weird.

287
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:31,149
If I have to, I will spend every day of
the rest of my life hunting the Avatar.

288
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,253
I know it's my destiny to capture him.

289
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:38,069
You know, prince Zuko,
destiny is a funny thing.

290
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:41,376
You never know how things
are going to work out.

291
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:46,422
But if you keep an open
mind and an open heart

292
00:22:46,423 --> 00:22:50,051
I promise you will find
your own destiny someday.

293
00:22:58,314 --> 00:23:02,061
You might have everyone else here
buying your "transformation",

294
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:06,195
but you and I both know you've struggled
with doing the right thing in the past.

295
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:09,423
So let me tell you something right now.

296
00:23:09,584 --> 00:23:12,785
You make one step backward, one slip up,

297
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:15,310
give me one reason to think
you might hurt Aang...

298
00:23:15,321 --> 00:23:18,172
and you won't have to worry
about your destiny anymore.

299
00:23:18,243 --> 00:23:23,671
Because I will make sure your destiny
ends, right then and there. Permanently.
