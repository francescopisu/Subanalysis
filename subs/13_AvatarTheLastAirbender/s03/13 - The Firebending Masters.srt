1
00:00:00,635 --> 00:00:01,435
<i>Water</i>

2
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:04,071
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:05,824
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:12,797
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:16,948
<i>Then, everything changed when
the Fire nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:21,772
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,789
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:29,162
<i>A hundred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:30,948
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,281
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great, ...</i>

12
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:36,130
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,273
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:50,308
So, what's the new plan?

15
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:53,111
The new plan, is the old plan.

16
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:57,777
You just need to masters all four element and
confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.

17
00:00:57,778 --> 00:01:00,278
Where am I supposed
to get a firebending teacher.

18
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:05,005
Hello. Zuko here,
I think it's time I join your group...

19
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:07,092
and taught the avatar firebending.

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,670
And I know my destiny is to help you
restore balance to the world.

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,290
I think you're supposed to be
my firebending teacher.

22
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:28,969
Zuko: I know you're nervous, but remember… firebending
in and of itself is not something to fear.

23
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:33,498
Ok. Not something to fear.

24
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:38,613
But if you don't respect it, it'll chew you up
and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino!

25
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:43,373
Now show me what you've got.
Any amount of fire you can make.

26
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:54,852
Maybe I need a little more instruction.
Perhaps a demonstration?

27
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:58,565
Zuko: Good idea.
You might want to take a couple steps back.

28
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:08,823
What was that!? That was the worst
firebending I've ever seen!

29
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:11,306
I thought it was, nice.

30
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,079
Why is this happening?

31
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:23,143
- Maybe it's the altitude.
- Yeah, could be.

32
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:38,179
- Just breathe, and...
- That one kind of felt hot.

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,244
Don't patronize me.
You know what it's supposed to look like!

34
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,545
Sorry Sifu Hotman.

35
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,585
And stop calling me that!

36
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,610
Sokka: Hey, jerks. Mind if I watch
you two jerks do your jerk bending?

37
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,436
Get out of here!

38
00:02:54,551 --> 00:03:01,551
Ok, take it easy. I was just kidding around.
Jerk bending, still got it.

39
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:17,432
Listen everybody; I've got some pretty bad news.
I've lost my stuff.

40
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,469
Don't look at me.
I didn't touch your stuff.

41
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:24,476
I'm talking about my firebending.
It's gone.

42
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,176
I'm sorry.
I'm just laughing at the irony.

43
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:35,577
You know… how it would have been nice for us
if you lost your firebending a long time ago?

44
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:39,578
Zuko: Well it's not lost.
It's just weaker for some reason.

45
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,671
Maybe you're just
not as good as you think you are.

46
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,369
Toph: Ouch.

47
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:48,713
I bet it's because I changed sides.

48
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,334
That's ridiculous.

49
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:55,966
Aang: I don't know. Maybe it isn't.
Maybe your firebending comes from rage...

50
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:59,501
..and you just don't have enough anger
to fuel it the way you used to.

51
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:04,133
So, all we need to do is make Zuko angry…
easy enough.

52
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:10,986
Ok, cut it out! Look…
even if you're right...

53
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:15,506
I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore.
There has to be another way.

54
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:19,119
You're gonna need to learn to draw
your firebending from a different source.

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,620
I recommend the original source.

56
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:25,485
How's he supposed to do that?
By jumping into a volcano?

57
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:30,532
No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever
the original source of firebending is.

58
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,723
So is it jumping into a volcano?

59
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:37,631
I don't know. For earthbending,
the original benders were badgermoles.

60
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:41,493
One day, when I was little,
I ran away and hid in a cave.

61
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:47,078
That's where I met them.

62
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,391
They were blind, just like me...

63
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:03,816
so we understood each other.
I was able to learn earthbending...

64
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,916
not just as a martial art,
but as an extension of my senses.

65
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:11,346
For them, the original earthbenders,

66
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,439
it wasn't just about fighting.
It was their way of interacting with the World.

67
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:23,683
Aang: That's amazing, Toph. I learned from the monks,
but the original airbenders were the Sky Bison.

68
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:27,328
Maybe you can give me a
lesson sometime buddy.

69
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,186
Well, this doesn't help me.

70
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,746
The original firebenders were the dragons,
and they're extinct.

71
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:38,923
Aang: What do you mean? Roku had a dragon, and
there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid.

72
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,047
Well, they aren't around anymore, okay?

73
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,700
Ok, ok. I'm sorry.

74
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,403
Zuko: But maybe there's another way...

75
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:49,432
The first people to learn from the dragons
were the ancient Sun Warriors.

76
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:54,221
Sun Warriors? Well, I know they
weren't around when I was a kid.

77
00:05:54,313 --> 00:06:01,313
No, they died off thousands of years ago, but their
civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.

78
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:04,248
Maybe we can learn something
by poking around their ruins.

79
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:09,815
It's like the monks used to tell me.
Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.

80
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,067
So, what?

81
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,579
Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy
just by standing here they stood 1000 years ago?

82
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:22,726
Zuko: More or less. Either I find a new way to
firebend, or the Avatar has to find a new teacher.

83
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:34,645
We've been riding for hours. I don't know why,
but I thought this thing would be a lot faster.

84
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:41,184
Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start
out our missions with a more upbeat attitude.

85
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,934
Zuko: I can't believe this.

86
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,763
Aang: Don't worry.
You'll get the hang of it.

87
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:54,571
Whoa!

88
00:06:54,572 --> 00:07:03,081
Zuko: Even though these buildings are ancient,
there's something eerily familiar about them.

89
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:06,682
I can tell the Fire Sages’ temples
are somehow descended from these.

90
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,486
Ok, we learned something
about architecture.

91
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:14,577
Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too.
The past can be a great teacher.

92
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:23,931
Zuko, I think the past
is trying to kill me.

93
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:28,059
I can't believe it. This booby trap
must be centuries old, and it still works.

94
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:32,234
Aang: There's probably a lot more.
Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.

95
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,788
Where's that upbeat attitude
you were talking about?

96
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:44,836
Besides, people don't make traps unless
they've got something worth protecting.

97
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,176
Look. This seems promising.

98
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:53,246
Though I'm not sure what this tells us
about the original source of firebending.

99
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:55,934
They look pretty angry to me.

100
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,514
Aang: I thought the dragons were
friends with the Sun Warriors.

101
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,735
Zuko: Well, they had a
funny way of showing it.

102
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:10,701
Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last 100 years.
Something you're not telling me.

103
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,959
My great-grandfather Sozin happened.

104
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,778
Zuko: He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory.
They were the ultimate firebenders.

105
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:22,809
And if you could conquer one, your firebending
talents would become legendary...

106
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,860
and you'd earn the
honorary title "Dragon".

107
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:31,282
The last great dragon was conquered
long before I was born, by my Uncle.

108
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:36,373
But I thought your Uncle
was, I don't know, good?

109
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:44,551
He had a complicated past.
Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on.

110
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,669
It's locked up.

111
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:07,135
Wait. It's a celestial calendar.
Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples.

112
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,230
I bet that Sun Stone opens the door, but only when
sunlight hits it at just the right angle, on the solstice.

113
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:17,725
Monkey feathers! The solstice again?
We can't wait here that long.

114
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,259
No we can't.

115
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:24,474
But we might be able to speed time up.
Let's see if we can outsmart the Sun Stone.

116
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:30,312
Nothing's happening.

117
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,730
Come on...

118
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:41,395
You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone
else says about you, you're pretty smart.

119
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:51,194
Relax. They're just statues.

120
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,775
It says this is something
called The Dancing Dragon.

121
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:16,286
Zuko, get over here.
I want you to dance with me.

122
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,816
- What?
- Just do it.

123
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:23,114
Let's follow the steps of the statues.

124
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,489
Aang: Don't you see? These aren't dance moves.
These statues are giving us a lesson.

125
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:35,073
I think this is some kind
of Sun Warrior firebending form.

126
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:38,804
This better teach us
some really good firebending.

127
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:50,915
Hurray! Wait.
What exactly is that?

128
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,456
It's some kind of mystical gem stone.

129
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:55,882
- Well, don't touch it!
- Why not?

130
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,506
Remember what happened
out there with those spikes?

131
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:02,507
I'm just very suspicious of giant,
glowing gems sitting on pedestals.

132
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:06,877
It feels almost alive.

133
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,588
Oh, no, it's another trap!

134
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:19,151
Ugh, I can't pull free.
It's like some kind of glue.

135
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,714
I can't move. Zuko, do something!

136
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,188
Me? I can't move either.

137
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,729
It stopped.

138
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:55,821
At least we have air. Maybe if we
stay calm we can figure a way out of this.

139
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,670
You had to pick up the glowing egg,
didn't you?

140
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:10,505
At least I made something happen. If it were up to
you, we'd never have made it pass the courtyard.

141
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,556
Help!

142
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,220
Who are you yelling to?
Nobody's lived here for centuries.

143
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:19,005
Well, what do you think we should do?

144
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:22,423
Think about our place in the Universe?

145
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:30,132
Sun Warrior Chief:
Who is down there?

146
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:46,626
For trying to take our Sun Stone,
you must be severely punished!

147
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,430
We didn't come here to take your Sun Stone.
We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending.

148
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,720
Ham Gao: Yeah, right. They are obviously
thieves, here to steal Sun Warrior treasures.

149
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:03,141
Aang: Please, I don't normally
play this card, but... I'm the Avatar.

150
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,335
Just hear us out.

151
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:15,507
My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation.
Or at least, I used to be.

152
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:18,348
I know my people have distorted
the ways of firebending...

153
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:22,756
to be fueled by anger and rage.
But now I want to learn the true way...

154
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,468
the original way.
When we came here, I never imagined

155
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:31,971
the Sun Warrior civilization was secretly alive.
I am truly humbled to be in your presence.

156
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Please, teach us.

157
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:42,296
If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you
must learn them from the masters Ran and Shao.

158
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,858
Ran and Shao? There are two of them?

159
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:54,479
When you present yourselves to them, they will examine you.
They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry.

160
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:58,578
If they deem you worthy,
they'll teach you. If they don't,

161
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,671
you'll be destroyed on the spot.

162
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:11,890
Sun Warrior Chief:
If you're going to see the masters,

163
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:15,391
you must bring them a piece
of the eternal flame.

164
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:22,637
This fire is the very first one.
It was given to Man by the dragons.

165
00:14:22,665 --> 00:14:26,165
We have kept it going
for thousands of years.

166
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,991
I don't believe it.

167
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,439
Sun Warrior Chief: You will each
take a piece of it to the masters...

168
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:36,039
to show your commitment to
the sacred art of firebending.

169
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:41,398
Um, Mister Sun Chief, sir?
Yeah... I'm not a firebender yet.

170
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:43,658
Couldn't my friend here
carry my fire for me?

171
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:44,947
No.

172
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:57,639
This ritual illustrates the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy.
You must maintain a constant heat.

173
00:14:58,074 --> 00:15:05,574
The flame will go out if you make it too small.
Make it too big, and you might lose control.

174
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:11,409
I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.

175
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,422
It's like a little heartbeat.

176
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:22,782
Fire is life, not just destruction.
You will take your flames up there.

177
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:26,334
The cave of the masters
is beneath that rock.

178
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,976
- Hurry up.
- I can't.

179
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:40,614
If I walk too fast, my flame will go out.

180
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:45,133
Your flame's gonna go out because it's too small.
You're too timid. Give it more juice.

181
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:47,281
But what if I can't control it?

182
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,379
You can do it.
I know you can. You're a talented kid.

183
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:11,967
Facing the judgment of the firebending masters
will be very dangerous for you. Your ancestors

184
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:19,990
are directly responsible for the dragon's disappearance.
The masters might not be so happy to see you.

185
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:21,852
Ham Gao: I know I wouldn't be.

186
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,511
But once they find out I'm the Avatar...

187
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:33,685
Have you forgotten that you vanished allowing the Fire Nation to wreak
havoc on the world? The decline of the dragons is your burden too.

188
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,963
We could turn back now. We've already
learned more about fire than we hoped.

189
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:57,144
No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet
these masters and find out what's so great about them.

190
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,199
What if they judge us and attack us?

191
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,190
Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar.
I think we can take these guys in a fight, whoever they are.

192
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,970
- Bring 'em out.
- Chanters!

193
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:05,641
Sun Warrior: Those who wish to meet the masters
Ran and Shao will now present their fire.

194
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,739
Sun Warrior Chief: Sound the call.

195
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:22,128
What's happening?

196
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:30,371
- Zuko, my fire went out.
- What do you want me to do?

197
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,921
Give me some of yours.

198
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,789
- No, just make your own.
- I can't.

199
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:39,099
Get some from one of those warriors.
Hurry. Stop cheating off me!

200
00:18:39,406 --> 00:18:40,806
Quit being stingy!

201
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:10,476
- These are the masters.
- You still think we can take 'em?

202
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,174
Shh. I never said that.

203
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:24,301
Oh, here it comes.
Any moment now… dinner for the masters.

204
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,466
- Quiet, Ham Gao.
- What? Everyone's thinking it.

205
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,630
Zuko, I think we're supposed
to do The Dragon Dance with them.

206
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:44,719
What? What about this situation
that you think they want us to dance?

207
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:49,343
Well, I think they want us
to do something. Let’s just try it.

208
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:50,964
Fine.

209
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:18,718
Judgment time.

210
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,430
I understand.

211
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:12,271
Their fire was beautiful.
I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined.

212
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,325
Aang: Like firebending harmony.

213
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:22,071
Sun Warrior Chief: Yes. They judged you, and
gave you visions of the meaning of firebending.

214
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:27,803
I can't believe there are still living dragons.
My Uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it.

215
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,252
So, your Uncle lied.

216
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:41,505
Actually, it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters.
They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well.

217
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:46,216
He must have lied to protect them,
so no one else would hunt them.

218
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:50,892
All this time,
I thought firebending was destruction.

219
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:59,436
Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant.
But now I know what it really is… it's energy, and life.

220
00:21:59,793 --> 00:22:05,093
Zuko: Yeah. It's like the Sun, but inside of you.
Do you guys realize this?

221
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:11,303
Well, our civilization is
called the Sun Warriors… so yeah.

222
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:17,637
That's why my firebending was so weak before.
Because for so many years, hunting you was my drive…

223
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:23,225
it was my purpose. So when I joined
you, I lost sight of my inner fire.

224
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:30,886
But now, I have a new drive. I have to help you
defeat my father and restore balance to the world.

225
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:47,757
Now that you have learned the secrets,
and you know about our tribe's existence,

226
00:22:47,806 --> 00:22:59,806
we have no choice but to imprison you here forever.
Just kidding. But seriously, don't tell anyone!

227
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,972
Aang: With this technique the dragons
showed us, Zuko and I would be unstoppable.

228
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:14,059
Sokka: Yeah, that's a great
dance you two learned there.

229
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,641
It's not a dance. It's a firebending form.

230
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:20,432
We'll just tap-dance our
way to victory over the Fire Lord.

231
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:24,172
It's a sacred form that happens
to be thousands of years old!

232
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:30,875
- Oh yeah? What's your little form called?
- The Dancing Dragon.
