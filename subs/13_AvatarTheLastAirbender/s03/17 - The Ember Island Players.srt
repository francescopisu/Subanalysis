1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,319
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,689
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,649
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:07,819
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:12,119
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:16,449
<i>Then, everything changed
when the fire nation attacked</i>

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,559
<i>only the avatar, master of
all four elements could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,159
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,859
<i>A hundred years passed and my brother
and I discovered the new avatar.</i>

10
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:30,529
<i>An airbender named aang.</i>

11
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:35,739
<i>And although his airbending skills are great, he has
a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,799
<i>But I believe, aang
can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,229
Ember island is a magical place.

14
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,739
Doesn't you family have a
house on ember island?

15
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:57,449
We used to come every
summer when we were kids.

16
00:00:58,209 --> 00:00:59,749
That was a long time ago.

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,679
Like waves washing away

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,649
footprints on the sand,

19
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:08,719
ember island gives everyone a clean slate.

20
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:11,649
Ember island reveales a true "you".

21
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:35,469
Does it seem kinda weird that we're
hiding from a firelord in his own house?

22
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,809
I told you, my father
hasn't come there since

23
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,499
mine family was actually happy.

24
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,339
And that was a long time ago.

25
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,269
It's a last place everyone
will think to look for us.

26
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,309
You, guys, are not gonna believe this!

27
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,219
There is a play about us.

28
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,869
We were just in town
when found this poster.

29
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:53,639
What? How is that possible?

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,048
Listen to this:

31
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,129
"The boy in the iceberg" is a new production
from acclaimed playwriter pu wang ten.

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,238
He scattered the globe gathering
information on the avatar.

33
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,889
From the icy south pole
to the heart of ba sing se.

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,738
The sources include singing nomads,

35
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,099
pirates, prisoners of war

36
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,919
and a surprisingly knowledgable
merchant of cabbage.

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,758
Brought you by the critically-acclaimed

38
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,149
ember island players.

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,459
My mother used to take me to see them.

40
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:20,459
They butchered "love amongst
the dragons" every year.

41
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,639
Sokka do you really think

42
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,609
it's a good idea for us
to attend a play about ourselves?

43
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,559
Come on! A day in a theater?

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,688
It's the kind of wacky,
time-wasting nonsense

45
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,939
I've been missing!

46
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:43,549
Hey, ehm...

47
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,219
I wanted to sit there.

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,348
Just sit next to me.

49
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:47,399
What's the big deal?

50
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,859
I was just a... I wanted to...

51
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,299
Okay...

52
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,169
Why are we sitting in a nose-bleed section?

53
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,399
My feet can't see a thing from up here!

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,498
Don't worry,

55
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,359
I'll tell your feet what's happening.

56
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,968
Sokka,

57
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:12,259
my only brother!

58
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:13,938
We constantly roam these

59
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,749
icy south pole seas

60
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,959
and yet never do we find anything...

61
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,249
Fulfilling.

62
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,449
All I want is fullfiling in my stomach

63
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,719
- I'm starving!..

64
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,889
Is food the only thing on your mind?

65
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,509
Well, I kinda try to get it out of my mind

66
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,919
and into in my nouth

67
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,089
- I'm starving!..

68
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,159
This is pathetic!..

69
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,499
My jokes are way better than this!

70
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,029
I think he's got your paint!

71
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,739
Everyday the world awaits
a beacon to guide us.

72
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,459
Yet none appears.

73
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,839
Still, we cannot give up hope

74
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,289
- for hope is all we have!

75
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,129
We must never relinquish it

76
00:03:57,249 --> 00:04:00,509
it, even to our dying breath...

77
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,149
Well, that's just silly.

78
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,659
I don't sound like that.

79
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,719
Oh, man this writer is a genius!

80
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,909
It appears to be someone frozen in ice...

81
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,679
Perhaps for a hundred years.

82
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:20,859
But who?

83
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,699
Who is the boy in the iceberg?

84
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,289
Waterbend! Hiya!..

85
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,209
Who are you, frozen boy?

86
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,279
I am the avatar, silly!

87
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,579
And I am here to spread is joy and fun!

88
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,559
Wait, is that a woman playing me?

89
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,499
An airbender...

90
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:59,749
My heart is so full of hope,

91
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:02,159
so it makes me tearbend!

92
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:07,619
My stomach is so empty,

93
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,899
so it's making me tearbend!

94
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,869
I need meat!

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,168
But wait,

96
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,659
is that a platter of meaty-dumpling?

97
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,329
Oh, where, where?

98
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,319
Did I mention that I am
an incurable prankster?

99
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,099
I don't do that!

100
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,499
That's not what I am like!

101
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,439
And I am not a woman!

102
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,809
Oh, they nailed you, twinkletoes!

103
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,979
Prince zuko, you must try this cake.

104
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:46,669
I don't have to time to stuff my face.

105
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:49,829
- I must capture the avatar
and regain mine honour!

106
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,849
Maybe while you do that,

107
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,969
maybe I'll capture another slice?

108
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,319
You're sickening me!

109
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,049
They make me look totally
stiff and humorless.

110
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,049
Actually I think that
this actor is pretty spot-on.

111
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,669
How could you say that?..

112
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,899
Let's forget about the
avatar and get massages!

113
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,009
How could you say that?..

114
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,809
Hey, look. I think I found something.

115
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,159
It's flying rabbit-monkey!

116
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,419
I think I'll name it - momo!

117
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,649
Hi, everybody! I luv u!

118
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:44,139
Does this dress make my butt look fat?

119
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:51,029
Riddles and challenges must you face,

120
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,629
if you're ever to leave this place!

121
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,889
Why did you had to steal
that waterbending scroll?

122
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:16,549
It just gave me so much hope!

123
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,069
The avatar is mine!

124
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,099
Wait, who's coming?

125
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:31,918
I am the blue spirit,
scourge of the fire nation

126
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,079
to save the avatar!

127
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,569
My hero!

128
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,219
Don't cry, baby!

129
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,139
Jet will wipe out this nasty town for you!

130
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,599
Oh, jet you're so-o ba-ad.

131
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,789
Look, it's the great divide

132
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,849
- the biggest canyon in the earth kingdom!

133
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,129
Eh, let's keep flying!

134
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,899
Don't go yue,

135
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,339
you're the only woman who's
ever taking my mind out of food!

136
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,119
Wait, did you ate pickle-fish at dinner?

137
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:33,599
Goodbye, sokka.

138
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,879
I have important moon
duties to take care of.

139
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,329
And yes.

140
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,939
And yes I did had pickle-fish...

141
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,659
You never told that you
made out with the moon spirit.

142
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:47,239
Shh!.. I am trying to watch.

143
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:59,919
The avatar is back to save the day!

144
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,019
Yay!...

145
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:23,195
So far, this intermission
is the best part of the play.

146
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:27,874
Apparently the playwriter thinks I'm an idiot
who tells bad jokes about meat all the time.

147
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,735
Yeah, you tell bad jokes
about plenty of other topics.

148
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:33,095
I know.

149
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:35,565
At least this sokka actor
kinda looks like you.

150
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:38,655
But that woman playing avatar
doesn't resemble me at all.

151
00:09:39,005 --> 00:09:42,805
I don't know. You are more in touch
with your feminine side than most guys.

152
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:44,895
Relax, aang,

153
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:46,815
they're not accurate portrayals.

154
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:49,284
It's not like I am a preachy cry-baby

155
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,865
who can't resist giving emotional
speeches about hope all the time.

156
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:58,575
Yeah, that's not you at all.

157
00:09:58,945 --> 00:09:59,995
Listen, friends.

158
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,735
It's obvious that this
playwriter did his research.

159
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:04,075
I know it must hurt.

160
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,835
What are you seeing up there
on that stage is the truth.

161
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:10,965
Well, here we are in the earth kingdom.

162
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:15,475
I better have a look around to see
if I can find an earthbending teacher

163
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,295
this is it.
This is must be where I come in.

164
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,915
I flew all over town

165
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:28,175
but couldn't find a single
earthbending master.

166
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,495
Here it comes.

167
00:10:29,615 --> 00:10:32,605
You can't find an earthbending
master in the sky,

168
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:35,785
you have to look underground.

169
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,215
Who're you?

170
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,345
My name is toph.

171
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:41,235
Because it sounds like 'tough'.

172
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:42,725
And that's just what I am.

173
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,965
Wait a minute - I sound like

174
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,305
a guy,

175
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:49,665
a really buff guy.

176
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,325
Well, toph, what you here
up there is the truth.

177
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,545
It hurts, doesn't it?

178
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:54,775
Are you kidding me?

179
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:57,085
I wouldn't have casted it any other way!

180
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,275
At least it's not a flying bulb lady.

181
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:03,815
So,

182
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:05,285
you're blind?

183
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:08,625
I can see you doing that.

184
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:10,485
I see everything that you see.

185
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:12,835
Except I don't see like you do.

186
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,715
I release a sonic wave from my mouth.

187
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,454
There,

188
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:25,075
I've got a pretty good look at you.

189
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,365
Zuko, it's time we had a talk.

190
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,785
About your hair!

191
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,145
It's going too far!

192
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:39,695
Maybe it's best if we split up.

193
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,435
Azula, my sister, what are you doing here?

194
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,935
You caught me,

195
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,924
wait, what's that?

196
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,835
I think it's your honour!

197
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:53,005
Where?

198
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:55,815
She escaped,

199
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,485
but how?

200
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,855
If she continues drilling.

201
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:06,465
This wall will come down for sure.

202
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,295
Yes, continue drilling.

203
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,225
The city of ba sing se
can't hide no longer.

204
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:35,555
Oh, jet, what have they do to you?

205
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:39,385
Must. Server. Earth. King.

206
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:44,295
Must. Destroy!

207
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,515
Did jet just ... die?

208
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,025
You know it was really unclear.

209
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,285
I have to admit, prince zuko.

210
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,895
I really find you attractive.

211
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:06,965
You don't have to make fun of me.

212
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,064
I mean it.

213
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:13,235
I had eyes at you, since
the day you first captured me.

214
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:18,085
Wait! I thought you were the avatar's girl.

215
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:24,315
The avatar, why, he's
like a little brother to me!

216
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:28,755
I certainly don't think
of him in a romantic way.

217
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:32,555
Besides, how can he ever find out about...

218
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,945
This!

219
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,105
Oh, you're getting up.

220
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,925
Can you get me some fire-flakes?

221
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,755
Oh, and fire-gummies.

222
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:47,995
Well, my brother.

223
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:49,515
What it's going to be?

224
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:50,624
Your nation,

225
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,755
or life of treachury?

226
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:58,285
Choose treachury - it's more fun!

227
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,505
No way!

228
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,485
I hate you, Uncle!

229
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,945
You smell!

230
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,095
And I hate you for all time!

231
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:16,565
You didn't really said that, did you?

232
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:18,235
I might as well have.

233
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:41,495
Avatar state, yip-yip!

234
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:52,645
No, if my lightning can help it!

235
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:06,365
The avatar is no more!

236
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:13,274
It seems everytime there is a big

237
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,374
battle you, guys, barely make it out alive.

238
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,115
I mean, you guys, lose a lot.

239
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:18,785
You wanted to talk, suki.

240
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,545
Didn't azula take you captive?

241
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:22,055
That's right - she did.

242
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,355
Are you're trying to get on mine bad side?

243
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:26,765
I am just saying.

244
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,695
Does anyone know where aang is?

245
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,294
You left to get me fire-
gummies, like ten minutes ago.

246
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:32,865
I am still waiting!

247
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:35,205
I am gonna check outside.

248
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:46,615
Are you allright?

249
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:48,135
No, I am not!

250
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,955
I hate this play!

251
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,025
I know it's upsetting.

252
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:54,054
But it sounds like you're overreacting.

253
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:55,345
Overreacting?

254
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,585
If hadn't blocked my chakra I would
probably been in a avatar state right now!

255
00:16:04,106 --> 00:16:05,884
Suki!

256
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:07,974
What are the chance that
you can get me backstage?

257
00:16:07,975 --> 00:16:10,194
I got some jokes I want
to give to the actor 'me'.

258
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,885
I am an elite warrior, who's trained

259
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,775
many years in a art of stealth.

260
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,315
I can get you backtsage.

261
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:23,395
Jeez, everyone been so
upset about their characters.

262
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,425
Even you seem down more than usual.

263
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:26,985
And that's saying something.

264
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:33,044
You've got a muscly version of yourself
taking down a ten bad guys at once,

265
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,075
making sassy remarks.

266
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,835
Yeah, that's pretty great.

267
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,005
But for me,

268
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:40,304
it takes all the mistakes
I made in my life,

269
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,145
and shoves them back in my face.

270
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:43,645
Mine Uncle.

271
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,315
His always been on mine side,

272
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,785
even when things were bad.

273
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,035
He was there for me.

274
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,985
He taught me so much.

275
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,565
And how do I repay him?

276
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,445
With a knife in his back!

277
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:55,235
It's my greatest regret.

278
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,795
And I may never get to redeem myself.

279
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,555
You have redeemed yourself to your Uncle.

280
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:03,345
You don't realise it, but you already have.

281
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:04,645
How do you know?

282
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,435
Because I once had a long
conversation with the guy,

283
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:09,725
and all he would talk about was you.

284
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,155
Really?

285
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:11,934
Yeah,

286
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,375
and it was kind of annoying.

287
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:14,835
Sorry.

288
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,915
But it was also very sweet.

289
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,175
All your Uncle wanted,

290
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:19,985
was for you to find your own path,

291
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,315
and see the light.

292
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,705
Now you're here with us.

293
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,415
He'd be proud.

294
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,425
What was that for?

295
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,075
That's how I show affection.

296
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:34,215
Your zuko costume is pretty good.

297
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,245
But the scar is on the wrong side.

298
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,465
The scar is not on the wrong side!

299
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:49,165
He's coming this way.

300
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:52,705
Can I help you?

301
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,545
Actually, I think I can help you.

302
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:57,335
I am a big sokka fan, but I don't

303
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:59,865
think you represent him
just as well as you could be.

304
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:02,465
Oh, no - another fan with ideas...

305
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:03,635
Just hear me out.

306
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:06,575
Here is something I think
real sokka would say:

307
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:10,705
"What does the cabbage merchant
use to fix his cabbages?"

308
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,075
A cabbage patch!

309
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:16,665
That's actually pretty good,

310
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:17,915
let me see those.

311
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,155
Rocky relationship?..

312
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,345
Not bad!

313
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,525
Also, don't be afraid to
make up some phrases.

314
00:18:26,645 --> 00:18:28,085
Especially before an attack.

315
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,305
Something like ...

316
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,314
Fliyng kick-a-pow!

317
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,995
Who are you, anyway?

318
00:18:33,235 --> 00:18:34,975
I'm just a guy who likes comedy.

319
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:37,034
Katara,

320
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,124
did you really mean what you said in there?

321
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:40,175
Where?

322
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,665
What are you talking about?

323
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,264
On stage.

324
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,785
When you said I was just like a

325
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,434
brother to you.

326
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,375
And you don't have feelings for me.

327
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,785
I didn't say that.

328
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,244
Actor said that.

329
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:52,765
Bit it's true, isn't it?

330
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,765
We kissed at the invasion.

331
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,954
And I thought we're gonna be together.

332
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,115
But we're not.

333
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,675
Aang,

334
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,365
I don't know.

335
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,825
Why don't you know?

336
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,984
Because we're in the middle of the war.

337
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:07,555
And we have other things to worry about.

338
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:08,955
This isn't the right time.

339
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,085
Well, when is the right time?

340
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:13,475
Aang, I'm sorry, but

341
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,795
right now I'm just a little confused.

342
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,155
I just said I'm confused.

343
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,335
I'm going inside.

344
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,735
Argh, I'm such an idiot.

345
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:39,415
Here is what you missed.

346
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,604
We went to the fire nation,
and you got better,

347
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:44,275
katara was a painted lady,
and I got a sword, and

348
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,085
I think combustion man died.

349
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,395
Oh, look - the invasion is about to start.

350
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,805
I just wanted to let you know, aang,

351
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,095
that I'll always love you...

352
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,125
Like a brother.

353
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:00,845
I wouldn't wanted any other way.

354
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:12,074
Hey, toph.

355
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:13,815
Would you say you and aang have a

356
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:15,435
"rocky relationship"?

357
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,965
I told him to that!

358
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:23,795
I hope everyone's ready for the invasion.

359
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,645
Slop-a-pow!

360
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:36,055
We finally made it to the royal palace.

361
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:38,085
But noone's home.

362
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,155
Actually I am home.

363
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,845
And I want to join you!

364
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:45,285
I guess we have no choice.

365
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,925
I guess that's it. The play's
caught up to the present now.

366
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:53,155
Wait, the play is not over.

367
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,545
It is over... unless...

368
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,625
This is the future!

369
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:02,945
With the energy harnesses from that comet.

370
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:05,655
Noone will be able to stop

371
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,555
the fire nation!

372
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:10,924
Father, zuko and the
avatar are at the palace!

373
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:12,765
They are trying to stop you!

374
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,535
You take care of zuko,

375
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:17,905
I shall face the avatar

376
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,385
myself.

377
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,435
Aang,

378
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,215
you fight the firelord,

379
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:28,775
I'll hold her off!

380
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:32,175
You are no longer my brother!

381
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:33,925
You are an enemy.

382
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:38,705
No-o, I am the rightful heir to the throne!

383
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,705
Will see.

384
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,755
Honour!!!

385
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:12,565
So, you have mastered all four elements?

386
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:15,565
Yeah, and now you're going down!

387
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:20,335
No, it is you who are going down.

388
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:23,395
You see you are too late...

389
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:25,945
the comet is already here,

390
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:29,125
and I am unstoppable!

391
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:56,195
No-o-o-o!

392
00:23:01,995 --> 00:23:03,375
It is over, father.

393
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:04,875
We've done it.

394
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,024
Yes,

395
00:23:06,025 --> 00:23:08,065
we have done it!

396
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:12,095
The dream of mine father
and mine father's father

397
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:14,625
have now been realised.

398
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:18,335
A world... is... mine...

399
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,525
That wasn't a good play.

400
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:32,824
All say.

401
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:33,734
No kidding.

402
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:34,634
Horrible.

403
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:35,835
You said it.

404
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:37,334
But the effects were decent.
