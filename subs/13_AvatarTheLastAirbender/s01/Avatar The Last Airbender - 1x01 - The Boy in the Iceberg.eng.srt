1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,795
<i>Water...</i>

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,006
<i>Earth...</i>

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,592
<i>Fire...</i>

4
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:12,094
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:16,557
<i>My grandmother used to
tell me stories about the old days.</i>

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,226
<i>A time of peace,</i>

7
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,978
<i>when the Avatar kept balance
between Water Tribes,</i>

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation,</i>

9
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,482
<i>and Air Nomads.</i>

10
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,485
But that all changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.

11
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:34,992
<i>Only the Avatar
mastered all four elements.</i>

12
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,538
<i>Only he could stop
the ruthless firebenders.</i>

13
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,415
<i>But when the world needed him most,
he vanished.</i>

14
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>A hundred years have passed,</i>

15
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:48,923
<i>and the Fire Nation
is nearing victory in the war.</i>

16
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,426
<i>Two years ago, my father
and the men of my tribe</i>

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,930
<i>journeyed to the Earth Kingdom
to help fight against the Fire Nation,</i>

18
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:58,808
<i>leaving me and my brother
to look after our tribe.</i>

19
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,854
<i>Some people believe that the Avatar
Was never reborn into the Air Nomads,</i>

20
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>and that the cycle is broken.</i>

21
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,608
<i>But I haven't lost hope.</i>

22
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,610
<i>I still believe that somehow</i>

23
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,863
<i>the Avatar will return to save the world.</i>

24
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,036
It's not getting away from me this time.

25
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:01,495
Watch and learn, Katara.

26
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,331
This is how you catch a fish.

27
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:15,301
Sokka, look!

28
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,219
Shh, Katara.

29
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,305
You're gonna scare him away.

30
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:21,307
Mmm. I can already smell it cooking.

31
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,226
But, Sokka, I caught one.

32
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,355
Hey!

33
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,689
Aah!

34
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,775
Why is it that every time

35
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,485
you play with magic water,

36
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:33,944
I get soaked?

37
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:37,615
Oh. It's not magic. It's waterbending.

38
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:38,783
And it's...

39
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:41,243
Yeah, yeah. An ancient art
unique to our culture,

40
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,328
Blah, blah, blah...

41
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,747
Look, I'm just saying that
if I had weird powers,

42
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,374
I'd keep my weirdness to myself.

43
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,250
You're calling me weird?

44
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,628
I'm not the one
who makes muscles at myself

45
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,339
every time I see my reflection
in the water.

46
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,481
Watch out!

47
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,650
- Aah!
- Go left!

48
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:13,818
Go left!

49
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,532
Aah!

50
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:20,908
Aah!

51
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,039
You call that left?

52
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,541
You don't like my steering.

53
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:31,794
Well, maybe you should have
waterbended us out of the ice.

54
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,630
- So it's my fault.
- I knew I should have left you home.

55
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,966
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.

56
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:43,431
You are the most sexist, immature,
nutbrained...

57
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,142
Ah! I'm embarrassed to be related to you!

58
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,897
Ever since mom died, I've been doing
all the work around camp,

59
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,816
while you've been off playing soldier.

60
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:55,526
Ah... Katara...

61
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,570
I even wash all the clothes!

62
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,364
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?

63
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,615
Let me tell you.

64
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,992
Not pleasant!

65
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:05,119
Katara! Settle down!

66
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,038
No! That's it. I'm done helping you.

67
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,624
From now on, you're on your own!

68
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,794
Oh!

69
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,391
Okay. You've gone from weird
to freakish, Katara.

70
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,185
You mean, I did that?

71
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,812
Yep. Congratulations.

72
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,636
Ah!

73
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,472
He's alive. We have to help.

74
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,599
Katara! Get back here!

75
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,518
We don't know what that thing is.

76
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,447
Ahh!

77
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,719
Finally.

78
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,347
Uncle, do you realize what this means?

79
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,850
I won't get to finish my game?

80
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:53,644
It means my search
is about to come to an end.

81
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,396
Ah...

82
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,567
That light came from
an incredibly powerful source.

83
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,901
It has to be him.

84
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,029
Or it's just the celestial lights.

85
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,949
We've been down this road before,
Prince Zuko.

86
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:10,578
I don't want you
to get too excited over nothing.

87
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:13,330
Please, sit.

88
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,002
Why don't you enjoy
a cup of calming jasmine tea?

89
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,170
I don't need any calming tea!

90
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,047
I need to capture the Avatar!

91
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,842
Helmsman, head a course for the light.

92
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,529
Stop!

93
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:03,088
Stop it!

94
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,471
Mmm...

95
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:11,639
Ah!

96
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,269
I need to ask you something.

97
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,520
What?

98
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,814
Please, come closer.

99
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:22,191
What is it?

100
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,319
Will you go penguin-sailing with me?

101
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,613
Uh... Sure.

102
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,073
I guess.

103
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,159
- Uh!
- What's going on here?

104
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,369
You tell us!

105
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,037
How did you get in the ice?

106
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,413
And why aren't you frozen?

107
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,873
I'm not sure.

108
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,630
Ah!

109
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,633
Appa, are you all right?

110
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,469
Wake up, buddy.

111
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,398
Ha ha! You're okay.

112
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,530
What is that thing?

113
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,198
This is Appa, my flying bison.

114
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:14,243
Right. And this is Katara,
my flying sister.

115
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:20,624
Look out!

116
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,046
Ugh! Ugh!

117
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,132
Don't worry. It'll wash out.

118
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,300
Ugh!

119
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,511
So, do you guys live around here?

120
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,514
Don't answer that.
Did you see that crazy bolt of light?

121
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,850
He was probably trying
to signal the Fire Navy.

122
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:40,227
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.

123
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,230
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.

124
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,359
The paranoid one is my brother Sokka.

125
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,111
You never told us your name.

126
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,447
I'm... Ah! Ah!

127
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,742
Ah! Ah! Ah!

128
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,244
Ah-choo!

129
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,045
I'm Aang.

130
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,299
You just sneezed
and flew ten feet in the air.

131
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,967
Really? It felt higher than that.

132
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,178
You're an airbender.

133
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,637
Sure am.

134
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,307
Giant light beams,
flying bison, airbenders...

135
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,225
I think I got midnight sun madness.

136
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,519
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.

137
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,110
Well, if you guys are stuck,
Appa and I can give you a lift.

138
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,990
We'd love a ride, thanks.

139
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,619
Oh, no! I am not getting
on that fluffy snot monster.

140
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,622
Are you hoping some other
kind of monster will come along

141
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:42,998
and give you a ride home?

142
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,542
You know, before you freeze to death.

143
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,544
Ah...

144
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,467
Okay! First-time flyers, hold on tight.

145
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,886
Appa, yip yip!

146
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,730
Come on, Appa, yip yip.

147
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,109
Wow, that was truly amazing.

148
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,485
Appa's just tired.

149
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:14,696
A little rest and he'll
be soaring through the sky. You'll see.

150
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,327
Why are you smiling at me like that?

151
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,371
Oh. I was smiling?

152
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,597
I'm going to bed now.

153
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,562
Yep. A man needs his rest.

154
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:51,483
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.

155
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,777
Even if you're right,

156
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,614
and the Avatar is alive,
you won't find him.

157
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:04,288
Your father, grandfather, and
great-grandfather all tried and failed.

158
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,167
Because their honor
didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.

159
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,793
Mine does.

160
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,129
This coward's hundred years
in hiding are over.

161
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,725
Hey.

162
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,394
Hey. What are you thinking about?

163
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,229
I guess I was wondering.

164
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,148
Your being an airbender and all...

165
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,650
If you had any idea
what happened to the Avatar.

166
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:37,446
Uh... No. I didn't know him.

167
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,698
I mean, I knew people that knew him.

168
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,825
But I didn't. Sorry.

169
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,452
Okay. Just curious.

170
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:46,413
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

171
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,085
<i>Aang. Aang, wake up!</i>

172
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,169
Ah!

173
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,713
It's okay. We're in the village now.

174
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,131
Come on, get ready.

175
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,716
Everyone's waiting to meet you.

176
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,638
Oh!

177
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:48,517
Ahh!

178
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,484
Aang, this is the entire village.

179
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,570
Entire village, Aang.

180
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:06,576
Uh... Why are they all
looking at me like that?

181
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,495
Did Appa sneeze on me?

182
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:11,707
Well, no one has seen an airbender
in a hundred years.

183
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,333
We thought they were extinct.

184
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,128
Until my granddaughter
and grandson found you.

185
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,213
Extinct?

186
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,756
Aang, this is my grandmother.

187
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,675
Call me Gran Gran.

188
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,636
What is this, a weapon?

189
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,513
You can't stab anything with this.

190
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,766
It's not for stabbing.
It's for airbending.

191
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,310
Ah!

192
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,186
Magic trick, do it again!

193
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,522
Not magic, airbending.

194
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,026
It lets me control the air currents
around my glider and fly.

195
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,153
You know, last time I checked,

196
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,904
humans can't fly.

197
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,740
Check again!

198
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,409
Ah!

199
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,328
Wow, he's flying.

200
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,416
He's amazing!

201
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,089
Unh!

202
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,472
Oh! My watchtower.

203
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,518
That was amazing.

204
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,190
Uh!

205
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,317
Great.

206
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,611
You're an airbender,
Katara's a waterbender.

207
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,072
Together you can just
waste time all day long.

208
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,740
You're a waterbender!

209
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,117
Well, sort of. Not yet.

210
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,869
All right. No more playing.

211
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,789
Come on, Katara. You have chores.

212
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,666
I told you.
He's the real thing, Gran Gran.

213
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,835
I finally found a bender to teach me.

214
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:42,506
Katara, try not to put
all your hopes in this boy.

215
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,633
But he's special. I can tell.

216
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,136
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.

217
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,057
See? Now my wand is stuck to my tongue.

218
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,399
Again.

219
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,235
Ah! Hiya!

220
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,738
No!

221
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,825
Power and firebending
come from the breath,

222
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,952
not the muscles.

223
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,164
The breath becomes energy in the body.

224
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,836
The energy extends past your limbs
and becomes fire!

225
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,921
Get it right this time.

226
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,466
Enough. I've been drilling
this sequence all day.

227
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,760
Teach me the next set.
I'm more than ready.

228
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,387
No! You're impatient.

229
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,473
You have yet to master your basics.

230
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,975
Drill it again!

231
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,560
Ahh! Hiya!

232
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:43,024
The sages tell us that the Avatar
is the last airbender.

233
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,819
He must be over
a hundred years old by now.

234
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,196
He's had a century
to master the four elements.

235
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,491
I'll need more
than basic firebending to defeat him.

236
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,119
You will teach me the advanced set!

237
00:15:55,662 --> 00:16:00,667
Very well. But first,
I must finish my roast duck.

238
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:02,919
Yum, yum, yum.

239
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,883
Now, men, it's important
that you show no fear

240
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:09,468
when you face a firebender.

241
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,971
In the Water Tribe,
we fight till the last man's standing.

242
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:16,057
For without courage,
how can we call ourselves men?

243
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,353
I gotta pee.

244
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,315
Listen! Until your fathers
return from the war,

245
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:26,026
they're counting on you
to be the men of this tribe.

246
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:28,153
And that means no potty breaks.

247
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,571
But I really gotta go.

248
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:33,283
Okay. Who else has to go?

249
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:36,953
Oh!

250
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,206
Have you seen Aang?

251
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,583
Gran Gran said
he disappeared over an hour ago.

252
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,920
Wow! Everything freezes in there.

253
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,381
Ah! Katara, get him out of here.

254
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,842
This lesson is for warriors only.

255
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,927
Wee!

256
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,887
Ha! Ha! Ha!

257
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,892
Stop! Stop it right now!

258
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,977
What's wrong with you?

259
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,730
We don't have time for fun and games
with a war going on!

260
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,232
What war?

261
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,691
What are you talking about?

262
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,026
You're kidding, right?

263
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,904
Penguin!

264
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,204
He's kidding, right?

265
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,420
Aang!

266
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,298
Ha! Ha! Hey, come on, little guy.

267
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,467
Wanna go sledding? Unh!

268
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,388
I have a way with animals.

269
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,355
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin,
if you teach me waterbending.

270
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,983
You got a deal.

271
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,818
Just one little problem.

272
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,820
I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.

273
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,447
Isn't there someone
in your tribe who can teach you?

274
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:59,494
No. You're looking at the only waterbender
in the whole South Pole.

275
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,121
This isn't right.

276
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,956
A waterbender needs to master water.

277
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,959
What about the North Pole?

278
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,253
There's another water tribe
up there, right?

279
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,714
Maybe they have waterbenders
who could teach you.

280
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,591
Maybe, but we haven't had contact

281
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,176
with our sister tribe in a long time.

282
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:18,179
It's not exactly turn right
at the second glacier.

283
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,015
It's on the other side of the world.

284
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,517
But you forget. I have a flying bison.

285
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,104
Appa and I can personally
fly you to the North Pole.

286
00:18:26,187 --> 00:18:28,231
Katara, we're gonna find you a master.

287
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,650
That's... I mean...

288
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,570
I don't know. I've never left home before.

289
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:34,988
Well, you think about it.

290
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:38,450
But in the meantime, can you teach me
to catch one of these penguins?

291
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,704
Okay. Listen closely, my young pupil.

292
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,832
Catching penguins
is an ancient and sacred art.

293
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,126
Observe.

294
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,549
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

295
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,519
Ha! Ha! Yeah!

296
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,691
Whoo!

297
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:18,865
- I haven't done this since I was a kid.
- You still are a kid!

298
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,180
Whoa...

299
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,641
What is that?

300
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:46,518
A Fire Navy ship,

301
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,229
and a very bad memory for my people.

302
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,900
Aang, stop.

303
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,527
We're not allowed to go near it.

304
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,237
The ship could be booby-trapped.

305
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,989
If you want to be a bender,
you have to let go of fear.

306
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,665
This ship has haunted my tribe
since Gran Gran was a little girl.

307
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,334
It was part of
the Fire Nation's first attacks.

308
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,962
Okay. Back up.

309
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,922
I have friends all over the world,

310
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,299
even in the Fire Nation.

311
00:20:59,382 --> 00:21:00,800
I've never seen any war.

312
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,344
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?

313
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,473
I don't know. A few days maybe...

314
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:09,476
I think it was more like a hundred years.

315
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:11,644
What? That's impossible.

316
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,314
Do I look like a 112-year-old man to you?

317
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,607
Think about it.

318
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,400
The war is a century old.

319
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:20,570
You don't know about it, because somehow

320
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:22,864
you were in there that whole time.

321
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:24,949
It's the only explanation.

322
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,661
A hundred years.

323
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,705
I can't believe it.

324
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,582
I'm sorry, Aang.

325
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:35,543
Maybe, somehow,
there's a bright side to all this.

326
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,253
I did get to meet you.

327
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:40,799
Come on. Let's get out of here.

328
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,266
Aang, let's head back.
This place is creepy.

329
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,851
Huh?

330
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,606
What's that you said about booby traps?

331
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:02,487
Ah!

332
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,990
Uh-oh...

333
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:11,996
Hold on tight!

334
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,832
Ahh!

335
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,635
The last airbender.

336
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:28,096
Quite agile for his old age.

337
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:33,393
Wake my uncle!
Tell him I found the Avatar.

338
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,276
As well as his hiding place.
