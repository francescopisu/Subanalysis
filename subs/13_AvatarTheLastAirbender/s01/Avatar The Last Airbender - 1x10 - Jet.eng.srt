1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,003
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,297
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,341
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,259
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:14,972
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:19,143
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,605
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

8
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>could stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,274
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,859
<i>he vanished.</i>

11
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>100 years passed, and my brother and I</i>

12
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:32,573
<i>discovered the new Avatar,
an airbender named Aang.</i>

13
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:34,742
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

14
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:37,703
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

15
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,996
Unh!

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,041
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

17
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:02,937
Unh!

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,568
Unh!

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,652
Huh.

20
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,287
Where's Momo?

21
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:24,959
Hang on, Momo!

22
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,970
Uhh!

23
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,808
All right, you too.

24
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,144
This is going to take forever.

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,690
That works.

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,690
These are Fire Nation traps.

27
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:55,615
You can tell from the metalwork.

28
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,575
We'd better pack up camp
and get moving.

29
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,662
Uh-uh! No flying this time.

30
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,539
What? Why wouldn't we fly?

31
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,749
Think about it.

32
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,209
Somehow Prince Zuko
and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

33
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:09,962
It's because they spot Appa,
he's just too noticeable.

34
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,423
What? Appa's not too noticeable.

35
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:15,259
He's a gigantic fluffy monster
with an arrow on his head!

36
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:16,570
It's kind of hard to miss him.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,431
Sokka's just jealous
because he doesn't have an arrow.

38
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,932
I know you all want to fly,

39
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,100
but my instincts tell me

40
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,852
we should play it safe
this time and walk.

41
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,604
Who made you the boss?

42
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:28,272
I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.

43
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,608
You're the leader?

44
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,652
But your voice still cracks.

45
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,695
I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior!

46
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,572
So I'm the leader.

47
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,491
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang.

48
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,451
I mean, he is the Avatar.

49
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,620
Are you kidding?
He's just a goofy kid.

50
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,914
He's right.

51
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,833
Why do boys always think
someone has to be the leader?

52
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,836
I bet you wouldn't be so bossy
if you kissed a girl.

53
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,338
I've kissed a girl!

54
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,547
You just haven't met her.

55
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,758
Who? Gran-Gran?

56
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,301
I've met Gran-Gran.

57
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,803
No, besides Gran-Gran.

58
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:00,930
Look, my instincts tell me

59
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,824
we have a better chance
of slipping through on foot,

60
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,600
and a leader has to
trust his instincts.

61
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,104
Ok, we'll try it your way,
O wise leader.

62
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:10,022
Who knows? Walking might be fun.

63
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,525
Walking stinks!

64
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,111
How did people go anywhere
without a flying bison?

65
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,654
I don't know, Aang.

66
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:18,364
Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts?

67
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,366
They seem to know everything.

68
00:03:20,574 --> 00:03:21,909
Ha ha, very funny.

69
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,036
I'm tired of carrying this pack.

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,539
You know who you should
ask to carry it for a while?

71
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:27,998
Sokka's instincts!

72
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,750
That's a great idea.

73
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,961
Hey, Sokka's instincts,
would you mind...

74
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,754
Ok, ok, I get it!

75
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,506
Look, guys, I'm tired, too.

76
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,592
But the important thing is that
we're safe from the Fire Nation.

77
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:44,807
Run!

78
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,227
Huh!

79
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:50,312
We're cut off!

80
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,564
Sokka, your shirt!

81
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,648
Aah!

82
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,242
If you let us pass,
we promise not to hurt you.

83
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,952
What are you doing?

84
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:06,370
Bluffing.

85
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,831
You, promise not to hurt us?

86
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:09,915
Unh.

87
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:12,084
Uhh...

88
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,545
Nice work, Sokka. How did you do that?

89
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,422
Uh... Instinct?

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,840
Look!

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,431
Uhh!

92
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,185
Unh!

93
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,895
Down you go.

94
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,483
Uhh!

95
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,444
They're in the trees!

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,528
Ha ha ha!

97
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,213
Hah!

98
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,297
Unh!

99
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,507
Hey, he was mine.

100
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,258
Gotta be quicker next time.

101
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,684
Unh!

102
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,737
Uhh.

103
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,280
Man!

104
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,999
Hey.

105
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,084
Hi.

106
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:41,298
You just took out a whole army
almost single-handed.

107
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,716
Army?!

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,010
There were only, like, 20 guys.

109
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,846
My name is Jet,

110
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,289
and these are my freedom fighters.

111
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:51,851
Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee,

112
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,978
The Duke, and Pipsqueak.

113
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:56,689
Pipsqueak, that's a funny name.

114
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,193
You think my name is funny?

115
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,945
It's hilarious!

116
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:08,659
Unh!

117
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:23,257
Um, thanks for saving us, Jet.

118
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,800
We're lucky you were there.

119
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,510
I should be thanking you.

120
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:29,013
We were waiting to ambush
those soldiers all morning.

121
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,740
We just needed the right distraction.

122
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:32,349
And then you guys stumbled in.

123
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,476
We were relying on instincts.

124
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:36,448
You'll get yourself
killed doing that.

125
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,528
Hey, Jet, these barrels are filled
with blasting jelly.

126
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,071
That's a great score.

127
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,949
And these boxes are filled
with jellied candy.

128
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,701
Also good.

129
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,036
Let's not get those mixed up.

130
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,969
We'll take the stuff
back to the hideout.

131
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,623
You guys have a hideout?

132
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:56,999
You want to see it?

133
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,083
Yes, we want to see it!

134
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,255
We're here.

135
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,965
Where? There's nothing here.

136
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,216
Hold this.

137
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,509
Why? What's this do?

138
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,470
Aah!

139
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:10,596
Aang?

140
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,847
I'll get up on my own.

141
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,311
Grab hold of me, Katara.

142
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,826
Nice place you got!

143
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,626
It's beautiful up here.

144
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:42,836
It's beautiful, and more importantly,

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,463
the Fire Nation can't find us.

146
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,215
They would love to find you,

147
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,591
wouldn't they, Jet?

148
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,385
It's not going to happen, Smellerbee.

149
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,571
Why does the Fire Nation
want to find you?

150
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,972
I guess you could say

151
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,615
I've been causing them
a little trouble.

152
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,684
See, they took over a nearby
Earth Kingdom town

153
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,768
a few years back.

154
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,462
We've been ambushing their troops,

155
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,105
cutting off their supply lines,

156
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:03,565
and doing anything we can
to mess with them.

157
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,401
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation

158
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,485
out of here for good,

159
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:07,569
And free that town.

160
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,446
That's so brave.

161
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,282
Yeah, nothing's braver
than a guy in a tree house.

162
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,243
Don't pay any attention to my brother.

163
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:16,745
No problem. He probably
had a rough day.

164
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,372
So, you all live here?

165
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,456
That's right.

166
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,916
Longshot over there,

167
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,419
His town got burned down
by the Fire Nation.

168
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,546
And we found The Duke
trying to steal our food.

169
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,923
I don't think he ever
really had a home.

170
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,508
What about you?

171
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,970
The Fire Nation killed my parents.

172
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,556
I was only eight years old.

173
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:37,641
That day changed me forever.

174
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,644
Sokka and I lost our mother
to the Fire Nation.

175
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,730
I'm so sorry, Katara.

176
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,617
Today, we struck another blow

177
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,036
against the Fire Nation swine.

178
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,792
I got a special joy
from the look on one soldier's face,

179
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,395
when The Duke dropped down
on his helmet

180
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,880
and rode him like a wild hog-monkey!

181
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,262
Now, the Fire Nation
thinks they don't have to worry

182
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,723
about a couple of kids
hiding in the trees.

183
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,683
Maybe they're right.

184
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,232
Or maybe, they're dead wrong.

185
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,906
Hey, Jet, nice speech.

186
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:35,157
Thanks.

187
00:09:35,657 --> 00:09:36,658
By the way,

188
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,178
I was really impressed
with you and Aang.

189
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,162
That was some great bending
I saw out there today.

190
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:43,040
Well, he's great. He's the Avatar.

191
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,833
I could use some more training.

192
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,087
Avatar, huh? Very nice.

193
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,588
Thanks, Jet.

194
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,006
So I might know a way

195
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,567
that you and Aang
can help in our struggle.

196
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:54,843
Unfortunately,
we have to leave tonight.

197
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:56,929
Sokka, you're kidding me.

198
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:59,556
I needed you on an important
mission tomorrow.

199
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,058
What mission?

200
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,573
What are you doing?

201
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,575
Shh. It amplifies vibrations.

202
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,827
Good trick.

203
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:21,995
Nothing yet.

204
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:23,372
Wait, yes!

205
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:24,456
Someone's approaching.

206
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,624
How many?

207
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:26,875
I think there's just one.

208
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,838
Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.

209
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,136
Wait! False alarm.

210
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,428
He's just an old man.

211
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,686
What are you doing
in our woods, you leech?

212
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,564
Please, sir, I'm just a traveler.

213
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,648
Uhh!

214
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,152
Ohh! Unh!

215
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,157
Uhh!

216
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,992
Do you like destroying towns?

217
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,618
Do you like destroying families?

218
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,203
Do you?!

219
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,748
Oh, please, let me go. Have mercy.

220
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,834
Does the Fire Nation let people go?

221
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,586
Does the Fire Nation have mercy?

222
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,754
Uhh!

223
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,256
Jet, he's just an old man!

224
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,966
He's Fire Nation! Search him!

225
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,885
But he's not hurting anyone.

226
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,345
Have you forgotten that
the Fire Nation killed your mother?

227
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,097
Remember why you fight!

228
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,724
We got his stuff, Jet.

229
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:25,601
This doesn't feel right.

230
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,020
It's what has to be done.
Now let's get out of here.

231
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:33,817
Come on, Sokka!

232
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,074
Sokka, look what The Duke gave me.

233
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,000
Ow, quit it!

234
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,461
Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?

235
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,546
Yeah, he's back. But we're leaving.

236
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,714
What?

237
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:57,507
But I made him this hat.

238
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,968
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

239
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,053
What?!

240
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,346
No, he's not.

241
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,056
He's messed up, Katara.

242
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,265
He's not messed up.

243
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,017
He's just got a different way of life.

244
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,560
A really fun way of life.

245
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,020
He beat and robbed

246
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,271
a harmless old man.

247
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,274
I want to hear
Jet's side of the story.

248
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,735
Sokka, you told them what happened,

249
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:19,279
but you didn't mention
that the guy was Fire Nation?

250
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,907
No, he conveniently
left that part out.

251
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,201
Fine, but even if he was Fire Nation,

252
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,577
he was a harmless civilian.

253
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,204
He was an assassin, Sokka.

254
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,834
See? There's a compartment
for poison in the knife.

255
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,419
He was sent to eliminate me.

256
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,421
You helped save my life, Sokka.

257
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,382
I knew there was an explanation.

258
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,175
I didn't see any knife.

259
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,074
That's because he was concealing it.

260
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,637
See, Sokka?

261
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,847
I'm sure you just
didn't notice the knife.

262
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,641
There was no knife!

263
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,017
I'm going back to the hut

264
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,435
and packing my things.

265
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,854
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet.

266
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,398
I really need your help.

267
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:55,524
What can we do?

268
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,059
The Fire Nation is planning
on burning down our forest.

269
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,380
If you both use waterbending
to fill the reservoir,

270
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,697
we could fight the fires.

271
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,323
But if you leave now,

272
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,033
they'll destroy the whole valley.

273
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,497
We can't leave now

274
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,874
with the Fire Nation
about to burn down a forest!

275
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,376
I'm sorry, Katara.

276
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,461
Jet's very smooth,
but we can't trust him.

277
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,463
You know what I think?

278
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,258
You're jealous that he's a better
warrior and a better leader.

279
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:23,510
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet.

280
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:24,779
It's just that my instincts...

281
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,388
Well, my instincts tell me

282
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,557
we need to stay here a little longer
and help Jet.

283
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,225
Come on, Aang.

284
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,643
Sorry, Sokka.

285
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:42,946
Let's go.

286
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,031
Huh?

287
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:06,762
Now listen.

288
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,972
You're not to blow the dam
until I give the signal.

289
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,766
If the reservoir isn't full,

290
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,642
the Fire Nation troops could survive.

291
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,103
But what about the people in the town?

292
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,022
Won't they get wiped out, too?

293
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,774
Look, Duke, that's the price

294
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,859
of ridding this area
of the Fire Nation.

295
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,795
Now don't blow the dam
until I give the signal.

296
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:23,820
Got it?

297
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,075
Ow!

298
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:31,244
Where do you think
you're going, ponytail?

299
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,667
Sokka.

300
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm glad you decided to join us.

301
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,507
I heard your plan
to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

302
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,009
Our plan is to rid the valley
of the Fire Nation.

303
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,803
There are people living there, Jet,

304
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,638
mothers and fathers and children.

305
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,724
We can't win without
making some sacrifices.

306
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,102
You lied to Aang and Katara
about the forest fire.

307
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,437
Because they don't understand
the demands of war.

308
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,939
Not like you and I do.

309
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,482
I do understand.

310
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,126
I understand that
there's nothing you won't do

311
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,318
to get what you want.

312
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:06,113
I was hoping you'd have an open mind.

313
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,073
But I can see you've made your choice.

314
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,993
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang.

315
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,328
Take him for a walk.

316
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,663
A long walk.

317
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,498
You can't do this!

318
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:17,916
Cheer up, Sokka.

319
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,668
We're going to win a great victory

320
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,951
against the Fire Nation today.

321
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,883
Jet, I'm sorry about how
Sokka's been acting.

322
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,344
No worries. He already apologized.

323
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,930
Really? Sokka apologized?

324
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,890
Yeah, I was surprised, too.

325
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,743
I got the sense that maybe you.

326
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:36,828
Talked to him or something.

327
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,978
Yeah, I did.

328
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:39,861
I guess something you said
got through to him.

329
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,065
Anyhow, he went out
on a scouting mission

330
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,775
with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

331
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,943
I'm glad he cooled off.

332
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,987
He's so stubborn sometimes.

333
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,071
Uhh!

334
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,282
All right, we're here.

335
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,819
Underground water's trying
to escape from these vents.

336
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,661
I need you guys to help it along.

337
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,747
I've never used bending
on water I can't see.

338
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,207
I don't know...

339
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,877
Katara, you can do this.

340
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,378
What about me?

341
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,547
I know the Avatar can do this.

342
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,737
Yes! Good job.

343
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,572
This river empties into the reservoir.

344
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,365
A few more geysers
and it will be full.

345
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,035
Look, there's another steam vent.

346
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,871
Ok, you two keep it up,

347
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,554
I'll go check on things
at the reservoir.

348
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,019
When we're done,
we'll meet you over there.

349
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,170
Actually, probably better
if you meet me

350
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,733
back at the hideout when you're done.

351
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,517
I bet that's enough.

352
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
And I'm not just
saying that to be lazy.

353
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:02,187
Let's catch up with Jet
at the reservoir.

354
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,582
I thought we agreed
to meet Jet back at the hideout.

355
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,149
Well, we finished early.

356
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:07,926
I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

357
00:17:11,112 --> 00:17:13,156
Come on, move along!

358
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,783
How can you stand by and do nothing

359
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,701
while Jet wipes out a whole town?

360
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,329
Hey, listen, Sokka,
Jet's a great leader.

361
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:23,083
We follow what he says,
and things always turn out ok.

362
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:29,339
If that's how Jet leads,

363
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:30,956
Then he's got a lot to learn!

364
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,008
Hey!

365
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,011
Unh!

366
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:37,514
While you two are up there,

367
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,683
you might want to practice
your knot work.

368
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,143
Hey, Smellerbee.

369
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,145
You going to eat your lychee nuts?

370
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,355
Ooh.

371
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,613
What are they doing?

372
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,073
Hey, those are the red barrels

373
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:56,324
he got from the Fire Nation.

374
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,368
Why would they need blasting jelly?

375
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,037
Because Jet's going to
blow up the dam.

376
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:02,455
What?

377
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,332
No, that would destroy the town.

378
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,001
Jet wouldn't do that.

379
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,627
I've got to stop him!

380
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,421
Jet wouldn't do that.

381
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:10,964
Unh!

382
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,633
Yes, I would.

383
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,968
Jet, why?

384
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,596
Katara, you would, too,
if you just stop to think.

385
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,890
Think about what the Fire Nation
did to your mother.

386
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,518
We can't let them do that
to anyone else ever again.

387
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,520
This isn't the answer.

388
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,772
I want you to understand me, Katara.

389
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,317
I thought your brother
would understand, but...

390
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,235
Where's Sokka?

391
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,320
Katara.

392
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,407
Unh!

393
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,286
I need to get to the dam.

394
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:45,206
You're not going anywhere
without your glider.

395
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,708
Unh! Uhh! Unh!

396
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,253
I'm not going to fight you, Jet.

397
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,213
You'll have to
if you want your glider back.

398
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,390
Hah!

399
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,187
Unh!

400
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,736
Hah!

401
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,084
Aah!

402
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,169
Unh!

403
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:32,253
Aah!

404
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,193
Unh!

405
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,413
Aah!

406
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,497
Unh!

407
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,379
Ohh...

408
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:15,505
Unh!

409
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,855
Why, Jet?

410
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:34,190
I can't believe I trusted you.

411
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,025
You lied to me!

412
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,069
You're sick, and I trusted you!

413
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,161
What are you doing?

414
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:47,245
You're too late.

415
00:20:47,328 --> 00:20:48,329
No!

416
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,751
Unh!

417
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,545
Sokka's still out there.

418
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,338
He's our only chance.

419
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,090
Come on, Sokka.

420
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,092
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

421
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,177
Please...

422
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,852
No.

423
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,165
Sokka didn't make it in time.

424
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:33,583
All those people.

425
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,127
Jet, you monster!

426
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,837
This was a victory, Katara.

427
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,088
Remember that.

428
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,548
The Fire Nation is gone,

429
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,792
and this valley will be safe.

430
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,426
It will be safe,

431
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,261
without you.

432
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,013
Sokka!

433
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,657
I warned the villagers of your plan,

434
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:49,682
Just in time.

435
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,101
- What?!
- At first, they didn't believe me.

436
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,771
The Fire Nation soldiers
assumed I was a spy.

437
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:56,147
But one man vouched for me,

438
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,274
the old man you attacked.

439
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,486
He urged them to trust me,
and we got everyone out in time.

440
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,827
Mrs. Pretty!

441
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:10,954
Sokka, you fool!

442
00:22:11,037 --> 00:22:12,181
We could have freed this valley!

443
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,373
Who would be free?

444
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:14,874
Everyone would be dead.

445
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,334
You traitor!

446
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,211
No, Jet. You became the traitor

447
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:20,171
when you stopped
protecting innocent people.

448
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:23,091
Katara, please, help me.

449
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,843
Good-bye, Jet.

450
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,803
Yip, yip.

451
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,238
We thought
you were going to the dam.

452
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,871
How come you went to the town instead?

453
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,187
Let me guess.

454
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,856
Your instincts told you.

455
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,440
Hey, sometimes they're right.

456
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,192
Um, Sokka?

457
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,111
You know we're going
the wrong way, right?

458
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,321
And sometimes they're wrong.
