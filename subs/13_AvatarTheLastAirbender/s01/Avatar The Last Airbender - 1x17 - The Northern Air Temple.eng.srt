1
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:06,714
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:10,092
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,264
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,643
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:23,606
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

6
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

7
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,901
<i>he vanished.</i>

8
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:31,113
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,782
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

10
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,159
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

11
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,912
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:42,166
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,140
So, travelers,
the next time you think you hear

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,560
a strange large bird talking,

15
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:07,358
take a closer look. It might not be
a giant parrot, but a flying man,

16
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:12,488
a member of a secret group
of airwalkers who laugh at gravity

17
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,950
and laugh at those
bound to the earth by it.

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,996
Aren't airbender stories the best?

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,790
Was it realistic?
Is that how it was back then?

20
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,834
I laugh at gravity all the time.

21
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,044
Ha ha! Gravity.

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,629
Jingle, jingle.

23
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,969
Sorry.

24
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,013
Aw. Cheapskates.

25
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,889
Hey, thanks for the story.

26
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,683
Tell it to the cap, boy.

27
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,024
Aw. Much obliged, little bat thing.

28
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,401
It means a lot
to hear airbender stories.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,194
It must have been a hundred years ago

30
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,696
your great-grandpa met them.

31
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,115
What are you prattling about, child?

32
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,576
Great-grandpappy
saw the airwalkers last week.

33
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,170
We're almost
to the Northern Air Temple.

34
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,339
This is where
they had the championships

35
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,590
for sky bison polo.

36
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,469
Do you think
we'll really find airbenders?

37
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:18,638
You want me to be like you
or totally honest?

38
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,181
Are you saying I'm a liar?

39
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:22,808
I'm saying you're an optimist.
Same thing, basically.

40
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,061
Hey, guys, look at this!

41
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,905
They really are airbenders!

42
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,949
No, they're not.

43
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,177
What do you mean, they're not?

44
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,410
Those guys are flying!

45
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,954
Gliding maybe, but not flying.

46
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,223
You can tell by the way they move

47
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:48,250
they're not airbending.
Those people have no spirit.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,046
Oh! Oh!

49
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:57,468
I don't know, Aang.
That kid seemed pretty spirited.

50
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,855
Ow!

51
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,608
We'd better find some solid ground
before it finds us.

52
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:18,114
Ha ha!

53
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,535
Go, Teo!

54
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:25,204
Show that bald kid how it's done!

55
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,847
Hey there. You're pretty good.

56
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,016
Yeah, I know.
But I can do more than fancy gliding.

57
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:04,285
Wow! I don't think I can do that.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,953
But here's a good one.

59
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,351
What do you think?

60
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,561
It's great.

61
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,371
Hey, you're a real airbender.

62
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,916
You must be the Avatar.

63
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:55,252
That's amazing!
I've heard stories about you.

64
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,629
Thanks.

65
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:59,048
Wow! This glider chair is incredible.

66
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,175
If you think this is good,
wait until you see

67
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,427
the other stuff my dad designed.

68
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:26,617
Wow!

69
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,744
Yeah, my dad is the mastermind

70
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,329
behind this whole place.

71
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,331
Everything is powered by hot air.

72
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,018
It even pumps hot air currents outside

73
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,626
to give us a lift when we're gliding.

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,378
This place is unbelievable.

75
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,171
Yeah. It's great, isn't it?

76
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,298
No. Just unbelievable.

77
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,926
Aang used to come here
a long time ago.

78
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,929
I think he's a little shocked
it's so different.

79
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,389
So better!

80
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,981
This is supposed to be
the history of my people.

81
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:10,786
Ugh!

82
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,957
I'm sure some parts of the temple
are still the same.

83
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,523
It's nice to see at least
one part of the temple

84
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,715
that isn't ruined.

85
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,644
What the doodle? Don't you know enough

86
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,105
to stay away from construction sites?

87
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:40,482
We have to make room
for the bathhouse.

88
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,067
Do you know what you did?

89
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,320
You just destroyed something sacred

90
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,113
for a stupid bathhouse.

91
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,574
Well, people around here
are starting to stink.

92
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,659
This whole place stinks.

93
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,952
Hyah!

94
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,547
This is a sacred temple.
You can't treat it this way.

95
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,275
I've seen it when the monks were here.

96
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,693
I know what it's supposed to be like.

97
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:10,262
The monks? But you're 12.

98
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,015
Dad, he's the Avatar.

99
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,142
He used to come here
a hundred years ago.

100
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,978
What are you doing?
Who said you could be here?

101
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,356
Doing here...

102
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,651
A long time ago,
but not a hundred years,

103
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,986
my people became refugees

104
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,947
after a terrible flood.

105
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,450
My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt

106
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,743
and lost his mother.

107
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,455
I needed somewhere to rebuild,

108
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,415
and I stumbled across this place.

109
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,708
Couldn't believe it.

110
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,837
Everywhere pictures of flying people,
but empty.

111
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,130
Nobody home.

112
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,550
Then I came across
these fan-like contraptions.

113
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,802
Our gliders.

114
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,471
Yes, little light flying machines.

115
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:53,973
They gave me an idea...

116
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,309
Build a new life for my son
in the air.

117
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,312
Then everyone would be
on equal ground,

118
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,189
so to speak.

119
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:05,943
We're just in the process of
improving upon what's already here.

120
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:10,197
And after all,
isn't that what nature does?

121
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,074
Nature knows where to stop.

122
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,659
I suppose that's true.

123
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:19,123
Unfortunately, progress has a way
of getting away from us.

124
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,416
Look at the time!

125
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,671
Come. The pulley system
must be oiled before dark.

126
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:28,173
Wait. How can you tell the time
from that thing?

127
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,009
The notches all look the same.

128
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,386
The candle will tell us. Watch.

129
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,598
You put spark powder in the candle!

130
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,436
Four flashes. So it's exactly
four hours past midday,

131
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,646
or as I call it, four o'candle.

132
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,772
Ha ha!

133
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,024
If you liked that,

134
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,110
wait till you see
my finger-safe knife sharpener.

135
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:51,030
It only took me three tries
to get it right.

136
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,699
Aah!

137
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,034
Follow me.

138
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,327
Hey, Aang,
I want to show you something.

139
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,663
I just can't get over it.

140
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,749
There's not a single thing
that's the same.

141
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,333
I don't know about that.

142
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,617
The temple might be different,

143
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:07,838
but the creatures that live here are
probably direct descendants

144
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,007
of the ones that lived here
a long time ago.

145
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,635
You're right. They're kind of keepers
of the temple's origins.

146
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,097
Besides, there is
one part of the temple

147
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,390
that hasn't changed at all.

148
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:20,350
Hey...

149
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,561
It's just like the one
in the other air temple.

150
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:24,480
Only an airbender can open it.

151
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,690
So inside, it's completely untouched.

152
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,108
Just the way the monks left it.

153
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,986
I've always wondered
what it was like in there.

154
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,446
Aang?

155
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,032
I'm sorry.
This is the last part of the temple

156
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,658
that's the same as it was.

157
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,368
I want it to stay that way.

158
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,080
I completely understand.

159
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,831
I just wanted you to know it was here.

160
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,208
Thanks.

161
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:53,425
These lanterns are terrible.
I can't see.

162
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,345
Why would you
want to use fireflies for light?

163
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,348
Hey! Close that up. They'll get loose.

164
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,851
Fireflies are
a nonflammable light source.

165
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:11,110
Cover your nose and hold your breath.

166
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,656
Ok. So you brought me
all the way down here

167
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:16,949
to see an empty room.

168
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,283
Wrong.

169
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,411
It's filled to the brim
with natural gas.

170
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,455
I came across it my first time here.

171
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,458
Unfortunately, I was
carrying a torch at the time.

172
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,379
Nearly blew myself and the whole place
even more sky-high.

173
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,048
I thought my eyebrows
would never grow back.

174
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,718
Anyway, there's a vital problem
that needs solving.

175
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,013
From time to time, we have gas leaks.

176
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,599
And they're nearly impossible to find.

177
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,227
So this place is an explosion
waiting to happen.

178
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:48,230
Yes. Until I figure out how to locate

179
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:52,317
something I can't see,
hear, smell, or touch.

180
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,069
The wind will carry you.

181
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,654
It supports something inside you,

182
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,322
something even lighter than air.

183
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,200
And that something
takes over when you fly.

184
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:02,870
I've changed my mind.

185
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,080
I think I was born
without that something.

186
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,125
Ha! Impossible. Everybody has it.

187
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,334
Spirit.

188
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,711
What?

189
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,546
That's the something
you're talking about.

190
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,922
Yeah. I suppose it is.

191
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,050
Are you ready?

192
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,845
No! Aah!

193
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,147
I can't believe I'm flying!

194
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,857
Just make sure
you keep your mouth closed

195
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,192
so you don't swallow a bug.

196
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:37,738
Teo was right about the air.

197
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,489
All I had to do was trust it,

198
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,241
let it carry me.

199
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,202
Even though Teo's not an airbender,

200
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,329
he really does have the spirit of one.

201
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,333
I've been thinking.

202
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,668
If you want to see
what's in that room,

203
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,921
I'd be happy to open the door for you.

204
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,089
- Great.
- Wait!

205
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,591
How do I land this thing?

206
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,384
What if I land over in the...

207
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,639
Blech! Bug. Bug.

208
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,349
That was a bug.

209
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,772
I said, don't touch anything.

210
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:12,856
Oh!

211
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,775
Oh, don't worry.

212
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,276
That experiment is old,

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,780
and that egg was just
part of last week's lunch.

214
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:21,073
Ugh!

215
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,991
Week-old egg smell.

216
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,117
Quick, find that egg.

217
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:29,206
I can't believe I'm finally
going to see what's inside.

218
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,763
How could something that's so small,
you can't even see it,

219
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,431
make such a big stink?

220
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,268
That's the solution to our problem.

221
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,229
Yeah. If we put a whole mess
of rotten eggs

222
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,147
in the cellar
where the gas seeps up...

223
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,526
The gas will mix
with the smell of rotten eggs.

224
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:58,902
Then if there's a leak...

225
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,821
You smell rotten eggs.

226
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,614
Then you just follow your nose

227
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,075
to the place where the smell
is coming from...

228
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:07,411
And plug up the hole
where the gas is escaping.

229
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,721
- You're a genius!
- You're a genius!

230
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,582
Something is wrong. I've got to go.

231
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:27,931
This is a nightmare.

232
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,933
You don't understand.

233
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,811
You're making weapons
for the Fire Nation.

234
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,989
You make weapons for the Fire Nation?

235
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,868
Explain all this... Now!

236
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:50,787
It was about a year
after we moved here.

237
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,374
Fire Nation soldiers
found our settlement.

238
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,252
You were too young
to remember this tale.

239
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,087
They were going to destroy everything,

240
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,672
burn it to the ground.

241
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,051
I pleaded with them.
I begged them to spare us.

242
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,011
They asked what I had to offer.

243
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,889
I offered my services.

244
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,517
You must understand.
I did this for you.

245
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,029
When are they coming?

246
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,908
Soon, very soon.

247
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,369
You can't give them more weapons.

248
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,079
If I don't give them what they want,

249
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,872
they will destroy this place.

250
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,751
How can I be proud of you

251
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,545
when your inventions
are being used for murder?

252
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,964
I need some time to think.

253
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,009
You need to leave. Go.

254
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,594
We're not leaving.

255
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,679
Then hide quickly.

256
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,435
You know better
than to keep me waiting.

257
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,188
Give me what you owe us
so I can be on my way.

258
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,484
Well? Is there a problem?

259
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,112
No. Right this way.

260
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,491
The deal is off.

261
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:10,742
The Avatar.

262
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,702
Aang, don't get involved.

263
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,704
If I don't get what I came for,

264
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,707
the Fire Nation
will burn this place to rubble.

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,209
Get out of here.

266
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,836
Uh!

267
00:15:21,044 --> 00:15:22,712
You're leaving empty-handed.

268
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,383
Then the destruction of this temple
will be on your head.

269
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,478
This is bad, very bad.

270
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,021
Aang, what are we gonna do?

271
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,357
How can we possibly
keep them all away?

272
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,608
I'll tell you how.

273
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,152
We have something they don't...

274
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,528
Air power.

275
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,238
We control the sky.

276
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,490
That's something
the Fire Nation can't do.

277
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,033
We can win.

278
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,285
I want to help.

279
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,997
Good. We'll need it.

280
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,459
We finally got
the war balloon working,

281
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,918
thanks to Sokka.

282
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,503
This boy is a genius.

283
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,297
Thank you. You're a genius.

284
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:06,715
Thank you.

285
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,426
See, the problem
with the old war balloon was,

286
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,844
you could get it airborne,

287
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,263
but once you did, it just kept going.

288
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:14,723
You could put a hole in the top,

289
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,725
but then all the hot air would escape.

290
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:20,812
So the question became,
how do you keep a lid on hot air?

291
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,522
Ugh. If only we knew.

292
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,651
A lid is actually the answer.

293
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,821
If you control the hot air,
you control the war balloon.

294
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,908
Hmm, that's actually pretty smart.

295
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,951
Ok. We got four kinds of bombs...

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,412
Smoke, slime, fire, and...

297
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,663
Stink.

298
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,249
Never underestimate
the power of stink.

299
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,341
They're coming!

300
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:50,717
Are we ready?

301
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,220
Yes, but where's Sokka
with the war balloon?

302
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,305
We'll have to start without it.

303
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,004
- Uhh!
- Uh!

304
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,089
Ooh!

305
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,015
Take them out of the sky now!

306
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,623
We've got them on the run.

307
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,292
We need more slime.

308
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,550
Aah!

309
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:39,159
Huh!

310
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:41,369
Uhh... Uh!

311
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,082
Whoa!

312
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,704
Uh! Huh!

313
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,831
Uh! Huh! Yaah!

314
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,513
Those things are unstoppable.

315
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,431
I think I know how they work.

316
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,559
I remember my dad tinkering with
a counterbalancing system,

317
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,061
something to do with water.

318
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,562
Works great, huh?

319
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:52,190
Water? Can you get me close to one?

320
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,274
No problem.

321
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,552
Huh!

322
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:21,886
Huh!

323
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,817
We're out of bombs.

324
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,112
Come on, Sokka.
Where's that war balloon?

325
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,790
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

326
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,167
The insignia.

327
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,252
They think we're on their side.

328
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:56,379
Then I guess
they won't see this coming.

329
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,465
Bombs away.

330
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,509
Uh! Hey! Aah!

331
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,932
Oh, no. That was the last one.

332
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:10,810
Wait a second.

333
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,061
You smell that?

334
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,022
Rotten eggs. There.

335
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,857
That's where the gas is escaping.

336
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:25,158
What are you doing?
That's our fuel source.

337
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,076
It's the only bomb we've got.

338
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:50,058
Look. They're retreating.

339
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,643
Yeah!

340
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:52,811
We're going down!

341
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:55,104
No! Sokka, hold on!

342
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:57,649
Get ready.

343
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,031
Oh!

344
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,331
You know what?

345
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,667
I'm really glad
you guys all live here now.

346
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,962
I realized it's like the hermit crab.

347
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,880
Maybe you weren't born here,

348
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,842
but you found this empty shell
and made it your home,

349
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,885
and now you protect each other.

350
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,012
That means a lot coming from you.

351
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,849
Aang, you were right about air power.

352
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,392
As long as we've got the skies,

353
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,352
we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.

354
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,913
This defeat is the gateway
to many victories.
