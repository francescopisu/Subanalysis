1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,797
<i>Water, earth,</i>

2
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>fire, air...</i>

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,348
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

4
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,689
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all
four elements, could stop them.</i>

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,608
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

7
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,984
<i>he vanished.</i>

8
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,197
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar,</i>

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

10
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,243
<i>And although his
airbending skills are great,</i>

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,995
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

13
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,659
Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

14
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:17,994
A couple of more years,

15
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,329
and you might be ready
to fight a sea sponge.

16
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:23,874
Whoa!

17
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,295
Would anyone care for
a rematch with Katara?

18
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,924
Katara, you've
advanced more quickly

19
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,010
than any student I've ever trained.

20
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,929
You have proven
that with fierce determination,

21
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,764
passion, and hard work,

22
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,975
you can accomplish anything.

23
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,145
Raw talent alone is not enough.

24
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:45,354
Pupil Aang!

25
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,647
Yes, Master Pakku?

26
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,317
Care to step into
the sparring circle?

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,194
I figure since you've found time
to play with house pets,

28
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,156
you must have
already mastered waterbending.

29
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,782
I wouldn't say mastered,

30
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,242
but check this out!

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,963
So, they don't have palaces
in the Southern Tribe?

32
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,214
Are you kidding?

33
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,674
I grew up in a block of ice.

34
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,718
It's not exactly a cultural hub.

35
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,848
Sokka, this is wrong.

36
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,016
What's wrong?

37
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,476
We're taking a walk!

38
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:24,810
I'm engaged.

39
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,937
It just feels...

40
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,148
I know what you need.

41
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,858
You need to meet my good friend Appa.

42
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,276
Who?

43
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,613
Appa and I go way back,
don't we, boy?

44
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,782
Aagh! Easy!

45
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:38,908
Down, boy!

46
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,034
No, up!

47
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,995
Looks like you haven't been
giving Appa enough attention.

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,333
So, how does this work?

49
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,876
You hanging on tight?

50
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,211
Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,796
Yip, yip.

52
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,007
Oh, my goodness!

53
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:57,885
Wow!

54
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,805
I can't believe you do this every day.

55
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,265
Yeah, we pretty much live up here.

56
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,060
Is it always this cold in the sky?

57
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,688
Not when you're with someone.

58
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,857
It's beautiful up here.

59
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,983
Yeah.

60
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,906
Whoo, yeah!

61
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,118
Good times, good times.

62
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,578
Hey, look.

63
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,789
What's happening?

64
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,208
Oh, no.

65
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,900
Soot. YUE: What?

66
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,485
I've seen it before.

67
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,404
Right before my village was attacked.

68
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,406
It's soot mixed with snow.

69
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,574
But why?

70
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:03,325
It's the Fire Nation.

71
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,202
They've closed in on the North Pole.

72
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,954
And from the looks of this stuff,

73
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:09,039
I'd say there's a lot of them.

74
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,464
This will truly be one for
the history books, General Iroh.

75
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,091
Just think. Centuries from now,

76
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,302
people will study
the Great Admiral Zhao,

77
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:22,636
who destroyed the last

78
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,889
of the Water Tribe civilization.

79
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,099
You're lucky you're here to see it.

80
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,019
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral.

81
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:33,272
History is not always kind
to its subjects.

82
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:36,150
I suppose you speak from experience.

83
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,153
But, rest assured,
this will be nothing like

84
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:42,656
your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,075
I hope not, for your sake.

86
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,287
Tell the captains to prepare
for first strike.

87
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,005
We'll be landing soon.

88
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,590
Do you have a plan?

89
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,133
I'm working on it, Uncle.

90
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:13,437
What's wrong? We have to go!

91
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,563
No, Sokka.

92
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,689
Wait.

93
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,316
I can't see you anymore.

94
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,442
Not at all.

95
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,319
What? We're just friends.

96
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:22,613
I wish we could just be friends.

97
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,198
But I like you too much,

98
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,617
and it's too confusing
to be around you.

99
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,744
I'm marrying someone else.

100
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,330
You don't love him, do you?

101
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,249
You don't even seem to like him.

102
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,000
But I do love my people.

103
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,419
You're not marrying them!

104
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,255
You don't understand.

105
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,923
I have duties to my father,

106
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,216
to my tribe.

107
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:43,717
I have to do this.

108
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,094
Good-bye.

109
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,475
The day we have feared
for so long has arrived.

110
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,562
The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

111
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,189
It is with great sadness

112
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,984
I call my family here before me,

113
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,195
knowing well that some of these faces

114
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,282
are about to vanish from our tribe.

115
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,744
But they will never vanish
from our hearts.

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,832
Now, as we approach
the battle for our existence,

117
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:18,043
I call upon the great spirits.

118
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,130
Spirit of the ocean,

119
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:24,925
spirit of the moon, be with us!

120
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,054
I'm going to need volunteers
for a dangerous mission.

121
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:31,515
- Count me in.
- Sokka...

122
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,975
Be warned.

123
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,728
Many of you will not return.

124
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,730
Come forward to receive my mark

125
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:40,316
if you accept the task.

126
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,137
The stillness before battle
is unbearable.

127
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,723
Such a quiet dread.

128
00:07:12,806 --> 00:07:15,726
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation
attacked my people.

129
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm gonna make a difference this time.

130
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,609
Yip, yip!

131
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,824
Katara!

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,056
I'll take it from here, boy.

133
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,252
Appa!

134
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,257
Thanks for the rescue, buddy.

135
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,781
You've gotta be kidding me.

136
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,870
Men, you'll be infiltrating
the Fire Nation navy.

137
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,166
That means you'll all need
one of these uniforms.

138
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,215
What's your problem?

139
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,759
Fire navy uniforms
don't look like that.

140
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,469
Of course they do.

141
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,056
These are real uniforms captured
from actual fire navy soldiers.

142
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:43,600
When, like, 100 years ago?

143
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,435
85.

144
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,855
The Fire Nation doesn't wear
shoulder spikes anymore.

145
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,024
The newer uniforms
are more streamlined.

146
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,943
How do we know we can trust this guy?

147
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,529
Such bold talk for a new recruit.

148
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,739
Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn.

149
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:02,077
He is a capable warrior,
and I value his input.

150
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,205
Now, our first objective
is to determine

151
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,125
the identity
of their commanding officer.

152
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,918
His name is Zhao.

153
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,589
Middle-aged, big sideburns,
bigger temper...

154
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,718
Sokka, I want you to tell
everything you know to Hahn.

155
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,595
He's leading this mission.

156
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,889
Hahn, show Sokka your respect.

157
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,684
I expect nothing less
from my future son-in-law.

158
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,897
Princess Yue's marrying you?

159
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,565
Yeah. What of it?

160
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,775
Nothing. Congratulations.

161
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,159
Stop those fireballs!

162
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,462
It's almost twilight, Admiral.

163
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:54,838
As your military consultant,

164
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,674
I must advise you to halt your attack.

165
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,761
The waterbenders draw their power
from the moon,

166
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:02,930
and it is nearly full tonight.

167
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,141
You should wait
and resume the attack at daybreak.

168
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
Oh, I am well aware
of the moon problem.

169
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,104
And I'm working on a solution.

170
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,774
But for now, daybreak it is.

171
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:22,449
They've stopped firing.

172
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:23,575
Aang!

173
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,583
I can't do it.

174
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,876
I can't do it.

175
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,294
What happened?

176
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,755
I must have taken out
a dozen fire navy ships,

177
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,549
but there's just too many of them.

178
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,176
I can't fight them all!

179
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,053
But you have to.

180
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:44,554
You're the Avatar.

181
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm just one kid.

182
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:58,735
If you are fishing
for an octopus, my nephew,

183
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,238
you need a tightly woven net,

184
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:05,033
or he will squeeze through
the tiniest hole and escape.

185
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,119
I don't need your wisdom
right now, Uncle.

186
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:10,622
I'm sorry, I just nag you because...

187
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,042
Well, ever since I lost my son...

188
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,920
Uncle, you don't have to say it.

189
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,464
I think of you as my own.

190
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,093
I know, Uncle.

191
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,344
We'll meet again.

192
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,973
After I have the Avatar.

193
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,103
Remember your breath of fire.

194
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,771
It could save your life out there.

195
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,897
I will.

196
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,816
And put your hood up.

197
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,609
Keep your ears warm.

198
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,986
I'll be fine!

199
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,912
Let me tell you, Sokka,

200
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,166
I've courted a lot of girls,
but Yue is the finest.

201
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,251
And she comes with the most perks.

202
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,587
Perks?! What does that mean?

203
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,964
I mean,
Yue's nice and everything,

204
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,192
but the points I'll gain
with the chief aren't bad either.

205
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:06,845
Princess Yue is wasted
on a self-absorbed weasel like you!

206
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,555
Whoa, hang on!

207
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:09,806
What do you care?

208
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,309
You're just a simple rube
from the Southern Tribe.

209
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,395
What would you know of the political
complexities of our life?

210
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,688
No offense.

211
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,236
You're just a jerk without a soul!
No offense!

212
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,157
That's enough!

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,910
Sokka, you're off the mission.

214
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,287
All right, fall in, men!

215
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,164
Everybody listen to what I say,

216
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,250
and we'll take out this Admiral Cho
in no time!

217
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,127
It's Admiral Zhao!

218
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,748
Where are they going?

219
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,836
They're coming up for air somewhere.

220
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:33,098
The legends say the moon
was the first waterbender.

221
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:35,767
Our ancestors saw how it pushed
and pulled the tides,

222
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,769
and learned how to do it themselves.

223
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,273
I've always noticed
my waterbending is stronger at night.

224
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,234
Our strength comes from
the spirit of the moon,

225
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,695
our life comes from the spirit
of the ocean.

226
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:49,364
They work together to keep balance.

227
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,824
The spirits.

228
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,660
Maybe I can find them
and get their help.

229
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:55,120
How can you do that?

230
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,746
The avatar is the bridge

231
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,832
between our world
and the spirit world.

232
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:00,292
Aang can talk to them!

233
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,336
Maybe they'll give you the wisdom
to win this battle.

234
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,880
Or maybe they'll unleash

235
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,466
a crazy-amazing spirit attack
on the Fire Nation!

236
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,178
Or wisdom. That's good, too.

237
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,971
The only problem is,

238
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:15,474
the last time you got
to the spirit world by accident.

239
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,267
How are you going
to get there this time?

240
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,603
I have an idea. Follow me.

241
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,445
So, is this the way
to the spirit world?

242
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,613
Ha ha ha. No.

243
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,574
You'll have to get there on your own.
But I can take you

244
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,827
to the most spiritual place
in the entire North Pole.

245
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:55,597
I never thought
I'd miss grass this much!

246
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,475
It's so warm here!
How is that possible?

247
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:01,853
It's the center
of all spiritual energy in our land.

248
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,781
You're right, Yue.

249
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,449
I can feel...

250
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,617
Something.

251
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,910
It's so...

252
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,411
Tranquil.

253
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,305
Be quiet!

254
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,494
Is something wrong, Sokka?

255
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,704
Oh, no.

256
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,431
Hahn's out there
on the top-secret mission,

257
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,332
while I'm here
sharpening my boomerang.

258
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,709
Everything's fine.

259
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,252
Listen to me.

260
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:10,046
I took you off the mission
for selfish reasons.

261
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,133
I have a special task in mind for you.

262
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:14,926
What, you want me
to scrub the barracks?

263
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,888
I want you to guard my daughter,
Princess Yue.

264
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,308
Oh. Sure.

265
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,184
That shouldn't be too hard.

266
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,156
Why is he sitting like that?

267
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,532
He's meditating.

268
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,826
Trying to cross over
into the spirit world.

269
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,079
It takes all his concentration.

270
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,206
Is there any way we can help?

271
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,957
How about some quiet?!

272
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,169
Come on, guys,
I can hear every word you're saying.

273
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,774
Is he ok?

274
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:54,651
He's crossing into the spirit world.

275
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,112
He'll be fine as long as
we don't move his body.

276
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,531
That's his way back
to the physical world.

277
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:00,949
Maybe we should get some help?

278
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,575
No. He's my friend.

279
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,953
I'm perfectly capable
of protecting him.

280
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:08,248
Well, aren't you a big girl now?

281
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:09,374
No...

282
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes.

283
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,044
Hand him over
and I won't have to hurt you.

284
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,965
Hyah!

285
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,599
I see you've learned a new trick.

286
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,560
But I didn't come this far
to lose to you.

287
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,874
You little peasant.

288
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:53,001
You've found a master, haven't you?

289
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,006
Hyah!

290
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,512
Hyah! Hyah...

291
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,311
Aah! Uh!

292
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,897
Hyah! Hyah...

293
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,329
It's daybreak at last.

294
00:21:29,704 --> 00:21:31,706
Let's write history.

295
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:57,398
You rise with the moon,
I rise with the sun.

296
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:12,497
The Water Tribe can try
to resist the inevitable,

297
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,834
but their city will fall today.

298
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,009
Aang?!

299
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:28,805
What happened?! Where's Zuko?!

300
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:30,014
He took Aang.

301
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,433
He took him right out from under me.

302
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,894
Where did they go?
