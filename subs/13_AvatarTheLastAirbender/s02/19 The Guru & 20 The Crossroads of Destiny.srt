when the fire nation attacked.</i>

four elements, could stop them.</i>

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,829
There's a man living at
the Eastern Air Temple.

16
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:53,454
He says he can teach me to
control the Avatar state.

17
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:57,900
In the Avatar state, you're
at your most powerful...

18
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:01,635
but you're also at
your most vulnerable.

19
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:03,204
What do you mean?

20
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:08,932
If you are killed in the Avatar state, the
reincarnation cycle will be broken...

21
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:13,133
and the Avatar will cease to exist.

22
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:14,746
What's happening?

23
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,867
You are going though a
metamorphosis, my nephew.

24
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:22,273
The Dai Li remains loyal
to you, Long Feng, sir.

25
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:24,277
Hello?

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,187
It's with the highest honor
that I welcome the Kyoshi warriors.

27
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:34,632
We are the Earth King's humble servants.

28
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:50,948
What's that smell?

29
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:54,818
It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.

30
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,229
Actually, it smells delicious.
I'd love a bowl, Uncle.

31
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:08,023
Now that your fever is gone,
you seem different somehow.

32
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:12,363
It's a new day. We've got
a new apartment, new furniture,

33
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,639
and today's the grand opening
of your new tea shop.

34
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,054
Things are looking up Uncle.

35
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,082
You haven't seen your
Dad in over two years.

36
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,842
You must be so excited.

37
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:29,632
I know i should be,
but i just feel sick to my stomach.

38
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:32,616
Don't be nervous, he's going to be
so happy to see you.

39
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:36,202
So what about you?
Are you nervous to meet this Guru?

40
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:40,790
Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State.
I'll do whatever it takes.

41
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:45,754
See you in a week. Yip Yip!

42
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:04,017
Sokka, good to see you.

43
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,839
Sokka.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,622
Hi Dad

45
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:40,154
Look Bosco, the Kyoshi Warriors
are here to protect us. Aren't you excited?

46
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:46,090
It's been a difficult week for me.
My most trusted advisor, Long Feng,

47
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,637
and his Dai Li agents tried
to take control of Ba Sing Se from me.

48
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:53,213
It's terrible when you can't trust
the people who are closest to you.

49
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:54,723
But there is good news.

50
00:03:54,724 --> 00:04:00,777
As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to
plan an invasion of The Fire Nation this summer.

51
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:03,122
On the day of a solar eclipse.

52
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:08,442
Really? Now that sounds like
a fascinating and brilliant plan.

53
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:24,226
General Fong's base will serve as the launching point of the attack.
In exactly two months, the Army and Navy will invade the Fire Nation on The Day of Black Sun.

54
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:27,868
Or we could send in Momo to do some damage.

55
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:32,188
Cause the...
... sorry.

56
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:39,475
All we need is the Earth King's
seal in order to execute the plan.

57
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:45,135
I'll get these scrolls to him right away.
Thank you, General How.

58
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:11,020
Um, hello? You're Guru Pathik, right?
The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?

59
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:17,895
Indeed. i was a spiritual brother of your
people, and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.

60
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:23,873
In your note, you said you could teach me
to gain control of the Avatar State. How?

61
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:29,372
You must gain balance within yourself
before you can bring balance to the world.

62
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:33,277
And the first step to gaining
balance begins with this.

63
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:36,315
Drink up!

64
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,227
Ugh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!

65
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:45,565
That's because it is.
Yum yum!

66
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:51,518
I believe we need to go right!

67
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,911
What are you talking about?
The Bei Fong Estate's this way.

68
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:57,496
I'm quite certain you're mistaken.

69
00:05:57,497 --> 00:06:03,027
Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering
for a second? i gotta go to the bathroom!

70
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:07,491
Oh. Okay, but make it quick.

71
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,880
What's wrong with you!

72
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:16,732
Oh very sneaky Toph! Nice
try, but you can't trick me.

73
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:20,024
Let me out of here, so
i can kick both your butts!

74
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:27,049
Quit your banging. You might think you're the greatest
earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal.

75
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,821
We have been presented with
an extraordinary opportunity, girls.

76
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:44,415
Mai finally gets to wear makeup
that's not totally depressing?

77
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,382
Ha. Ha.

78
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:49,981
I'm talking about conquering
the whole Earth Kingdom.

79
00:06:49,982 --> 00:07:00,670
For a hundred years the fire nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside.
But now we are on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves.

80
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:05,542
Gosh, you're so confident.
I really admire that about you.

81
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:10,746
From the inside we're in the perfect position to
organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King.

82
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:17,088
The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls
the Dai Li, controls Ba Sing Se.

83
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:27,235
In order to master the Avatar State,
you must open all of the chakras.

84
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:31,300
Aang, tell me everything
you know about chakras.

85
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:32,301
What are chakras?

86
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:37,817
Oh, i see.
I guess we'll start with the basics.

87
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:43,746
The water flows through this creek much
like the energy flows through your body.

88
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:52,228
As you see there are several pools where the water swirls
around before flowing on. These pools are like our charkas.

89
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,203
So chakras are pools of
spiraling energy in our bodies?

90
00:07:56,204 --> 00:08:02,571
Exactly! If nothing else were around,
this creek would flow pure and clear.

91
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:08,587
However, life is messy, and things tend to
fall in the creek, and then what happens?

92
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,725
The creek can't flow?

93
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:15,433
Yes. But if we open the
paths between the pools...

94
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:18,283
The energy flows!

95
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:25,347
There are seven chakras
that go up the body.

96
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:26,348
Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be
blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.

97
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:27,349
Be warned... opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once
you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open.

98
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,350
Are you ready?

99
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:47,334
I'll do whatever it takes.

100
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:57,065
First we will open the Earth chakra, located at the base of the spine.
It deals with survival and is blocked by fear.

101
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:03,099
What are you most afraid of?
Let your fears become clear to you.

102
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,936
Ahhhhh!

103
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:23,976
Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for
your survival, but you must surrender those fears.

104
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:27,414
Let your fears flow down the creek.

105
00:09:30,924 --> 00:09:33,687
You have opened your Earth chakra.

106
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:45,920
Next is the...
Water chakra?

107
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:50,162
Brilliant! Maybe one day
you will be a Guru too.

108
00:09:50,163 --> 00:10:00,471
This chakra deals with pleasure, and is blocked by guilt.
Now, look at all the guilt which burdens you so.

109
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:03,992
What do you blame yourself for?

110
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,143
I ran away.

111
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,224
I hurt all of those people.

112
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:30,253
Accept the reality that these things happened, but
do not let them cloud and poison your energy.

113
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:37,467
If you are to be a positive influence
on the world, you need to forgive yourself.

114
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:51,423
This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using
these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through.

115
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:54,638
You're father invented
tangle mines himself.

116
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:02,536
Destructive, buoyant, and
terrible smelling.

117
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:07,391
Very perceptive. The mines are
filled with skunk-fish and seaweed.

118
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:15,257
When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the
propeller, and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship.

119
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,205
I call it the stink' n' sink.

120
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:20,893
Ha ha! Good one Dad!

121
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:21,894
You are definitely your father's son.

122
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:28,122
Hakoda, our scouts have
spotted four fire nation ships.

123
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:31,663
Bato, get these mines loaded up.
The rest of you men, prepare for battle!

124
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:37,062
Uh, what should i do, Dad?

125
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,469
Aren't you listening? i said the
rest of you men get ready for battle.

126
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:56,953
Who thought when we came to this city as refugees,
that I'd end up owning my own tea shop.

127
00:11:56,954 --> 00:12:02,207
Follow your passion Zuko,
and life will reward you.

128
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,111
Congratulations Uncle.

129
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:06,553
I'm very thankful.

130
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:11,133
You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon
will be the best tea shop in the city.

131
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:19,204
No, I'm thankful because you decided to share this
special day with me. It means more than you know.

132
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:23,402
Now let's make these people some tea.

133
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:28,187
Yes! Let's make some tea!

134
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:36,679
Third is the Fire chakra,
located in the stomach.

135
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,442
My Fire chakra would like to eat
something other than onion-banana juice.

136
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:43,940
He he. Good one.
Moving on.

137
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:49,490
This chakra deals with will
power and is blocked by shame.

138
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:55,999
What are you ashamed of? What are
your biggest disappointments in yourself?

139
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,279
I'm never going to fire bend again.
I can't.

140
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:13,606
You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life.
You are the Avatar, and therefore, you are a firebender.

141
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:26,457
Hmm, that chakra opened less like a flowing
creek, and more like a burping bison.

142
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:34,193
Urrp! Tastes like onion and bananas,
but strangely something else. Pickles?

143
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:47,088
I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise.
I don't know how anyone can fight in this.

144
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,191
Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat
the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes.

145
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:58,842
How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King?
If i have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm gonna throw up.

146
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:06,171
Princess Azula promised we would go back to the fire nation as
soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient.

147
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:09,758
Shush up! Do you want the whole
palace to know we're Fire Nation?

148
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,394
Sorry.

149
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:24,602
Good work girls. i am sure the
Dai Li will deliver the message.

150
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:33,487
The fourth chakra is located in the heart.
It deals with love, and is blocked by grief.

151
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:37,890
Lay all your grief out in front of you.

152
00:15:02,408 --> 00:15:12,625
You have indeed felt a great loss.
But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us.

153
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:17,457
The Air Nomads love for
you has not left this world.

154
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:24,514
It is still inside of your heart,
and is reborn in the form of new love.

155
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:33,464
Let the pain flow away. Very good.

156
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,785
Can i have some onion banana juice please?

157
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:52,146
The fifth in the chain is the Sound chakra, located in the throat.
It deals with truth, and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves.

158
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,872
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?

159
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:56,934
Because i never wanted to be.

160
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:04,336
You cannot lie about your own nature.
You must accept that you are the Avatar.

161
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:21,612
Very good Aang.
You have opened the chakra of Truth.

162
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:34,846
The sixth pool of energy is the Light chakra, located in the center
of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion.

163
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:45,918
The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation.
Things you think are separate and different are actually one and the same.

164
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,292
Like the four nations.

165
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:54,021
Yes. We are all one people,
but we live as if divided.

166
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:57,939
We're all connected.
Everything is connected.

167
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,336
That's right. Even the separation
of the four elements is an illusion.

168
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:10,886
If you open your mind, you will see that all the
elements are one. Four parts of the same whole.

169
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:14,307
Even metal is just a part of Earth,
that has been purified and refined.

170
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,684
Come on metal... budge.

171
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:32,980
Whoo! Toph, you rule!

172
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:41,065
What do you say Momo? A cup of
tea before we get back to the king?

173
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,208
Table for two please.

174
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:50,592
Uncle, i need 2 jasmine,
one green and one lychee!

175
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:53,061
I'm brewing as fast as i can!

176
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,426
This is the last chakra isn't it?

177
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:12,517
Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be
able go in and out of the Avatar State at will.

178
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:19,971
And when you are in the Avatar State, you will have
complete control and awareness of all your actions.

179
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,665
Let's do this.

180
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,665
The Thought chakra is located
at the crown of the head.

181
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:35,980
It deals with pure cosmic energy and is blocked by earthly attachment.
Meditate on what attaches you to this world.

182
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:50,751
Now, let all of those attachments go.
Let them flow down the river. Forgotten.

183
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:55,723
What? Why would i let go of Katara? I.
.. I.. i love her.

184
00:18:55,724 --> 00:19:02,901
Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the
pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe.

185
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:06,042
Why would i choose cosmic
energy over Katara?

186
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:11,372
How could it be a bad thing that i feel an attachment to her?
Three chakras ago, that was a good thing.

187
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,068
You must learn to let go.

188
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:23,671
Thank goodness you are here Suki. Something terrible is going on.
The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city.

189
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:27,926
I just saw Prince Zuko and his Uncle!
We have to tell the Earth King right away!

190
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:30,027
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be sure to let him know.

191
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:46,118
So, Zu Zu's in the city too. i
think it's time for a family reunion.

192
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:50,764
I'm sorry, but i can't let go of Katara.

193
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:59,443
Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must
open all the chakras. Surrender yourself.

194
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,581
Okay, I'll try.

195
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:11,229
Now, think of your
attachments and let them go.

196
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,790
Let the pure cosmic energy flow.

197
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:03,564
Katara is in danger! i have to go.

198
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:08,443
No Aang! By choosing attachment,
you have locked the chakra!

199
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:11,744
If you leave now you won't be able
to go into the Avatar State at all!

200
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,861
It's another one of her tricks!

201
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:31,334
There's a giant whole in the box.
How's that a trick?

202
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:34,784
It's not! It's the real deal!

203
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,984
I am the greatest earthbender in the world!
Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it!

204
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,701
I'm going to be stuck in
here forever with you, aren't I?

205
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:06,278
I have to go to the bathroom.

206
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,477
Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?

207
00:22:11,478 --> 00:22:17,366
You don't know how much this means to me dad. I'll make you
proud, and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior i am.

208
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:18,367
Sokka, you don't have to
prove anything to me.

209
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:25,374
I'm already proud of you, and I've
always known you were a great warrior.

210
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,244
Really?

211
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:30,437
Why do you think i trusted you
to look after our tribe when i left?

212
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:43,100
This can't be good news.

213
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:58,740
What is this about? Your agents show up in the
middle of the night and drag me down here?

214
00:22:58,775 --> 00:23:01,402
You will not treat a
Kyoshi Warrior this way!

215
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:07,521
But you are not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you?
Princess Azula of the Fire Nation!

216
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:08,623
What do you want?

217
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:15,908
I want to make a deal. It's time that i regain control
of Ba Sing Se. And you have something i need.

218
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,567
Oh?

219
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:18,926
The Earth King's trust.

220
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:21,208
Why should i help you?

221
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:25,053
Because i can get you the Avatar.

222
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,677
I'm listening.

223
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:34,232
A message from the royal palace.

224
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:40,150
I... i can't believe it.

225
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,151
What is it Uncle?

226
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:48,495
Great news! We've been invited
to serve tea to the Earth King!

227
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:14,071
So, what kind of trouble is Katara in?

228
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:17,482
I don't know. In my vision,
i just knew she needed help.

229
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:22,170
It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be
just a little more specific from time to time.

230
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,141
What is that?!

231
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:30,765
Need a ride?
Ahhh!

232
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:32,126
Oooo!

233
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:40,420
The Earth King and The Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li.
They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng.

234
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:46,943
Soon they will turn on all of you, and eliminate you.
Seizing power today is a matter of life and death.

235
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:54,968
The coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King, and
each of the five generals, must be taken out simultaneously.

236
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:59,231
Long Feng has placed you in my command
while we overthrow the government.

237
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:10,723
If i sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any
weakness at all, i will snuff it out. That is all.

238
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:18,412
Nice speech Azula. It was pretty
and poetic, but also scary in a good way.

239
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:22,221
Yeah, i thought you were gonna
make that one guy pee his pants.

240
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:27,250
There are still a few loose ends.
The Avatar, and my brother and Uncle.

241
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:28,251
Many times, i imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace.
But i always thought i would be here as a conqueror... instead,

242
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:44,804
we are the Earth Kings personal guests, here
to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing.

243
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:46,370
It sure is Uncle.

244
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:51,054
So how did it go with the Guru?
Did you master the Avatar State?

245
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:56,679
If you leave now, you won't be able
to go into the avatar state at all!

246
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,028
Aang, are you ok?

247
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:06,212
I'm great. It went great with the Guru.
I completely mastered the avatar state.

248
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,722
What's taking so long?

249
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:17,979
Maybe the Earth King overslept.

250
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,965
Something's not right.

251
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:27,490
It's tea time.

252
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:29,032
Azula!

253
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:37,117
Have you met the Dai Li? They're Earthbenders, but they have
a killer instinct that is so Firebender, i just love it!

254
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:42,694
Did i ever tell you how i got
the nickname the "Dragon of the West"?

255
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:45,942
I'm not interested in a
lengthy anecdote, Uncle.

256
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:48,439
It's more of a demonstration really.

257
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:13,328
Come on. You'll be fine.

258
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:18,001
No. I'm tired of running.
It's time i faced Azula!

259
00:27:22,158 --> 00:27:27,358
You're so dramatic. What, are you
going to do, challenge me to an Agni Kai?

260
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,717
Yes! i challenge you!

261
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:30,831
No thanks.

262
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:49,650
Katara's fine.
You have nothing to worry about.

263
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,651
But, in my vision. i felt
so sure that she was in trouble.

264
00:27:50,652 --> 00:28:00,619
Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion.
And since then she's been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors.

265
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,913
See Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our
apartment right now, talking about make up or something.

266
00:28:05,914 --> 00:28:08,247
Ok, maybe you're right.

267
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:13,515
Believe me, if there was any danger at all,
Bosco's animal instinct would sense it.

268
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,409
You've got company.

269
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,442
Zuko!

270
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:43,265
Momo!

271
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:48,283
There's no one else here.

272
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:50,660
Katara is in trouble! i knew it!

273
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,030
Oh no.

274
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:55,774
Wait, someone's at the door.

275
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:01,575
Actually, i know who it is. It's an old friend of mine.
Glad to see you're okay.

276
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,244
I need your help.

277
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,827
Huh uh?!

278
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:12,148
You guys know each other!

279
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:16,751
I met him in the woods once and knocked him down.
Then he gave me tea and very good advice.

280
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:19,594
May i come in?

281
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:24,655
Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se.

282
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,119
She must have Katara.

283
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,684
She has captured my nephew as well.

284
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:32,484
Then we'll work together to fight
Azula, and save Katara and Zuko.

285
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:35,554
Woah there. You lost me at, "Zuko".

286
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:42,573
I know how you must feel about my nephew.
But believe me when i tell you there is good inside him

287
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:47,219
Good inside of him isn't enough.
Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay?

288
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,199
Katara is in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble.
Working together is our best chance.

289
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,685
I brought someone along
who might be able to help us.

290
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:12,030
Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup.
They're going to overthrow the Earth King.

291
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:15,183
My sister! Where are they keeping Katara

292
00:30:15,184 --> 00:30:18,758
In the crystal catacombs of old
Ba Sing Se, deep beneath the palace.

293
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:25,362
The movements of all the generals and the Earth
King have been plotted out step by step.

294
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:29,476
Good. And the Fire Nation
Princess is cooperating?

295
00:30:29,477 --> 00:30:39,497
Oh yes! More than cooperating, she's really taken charge.
She's terrifying and inspirational all at the same time. It's hard to explain.

296
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:49,470
Why did they throw you in here?
Oh wait. Let me guess. It's a trap.

297
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:54,221
So when Aang shows up to rescue me, you can finally
have him in your little Fire Nation clutches.

298
00:30:57,143 --> 00:31:04,302
You're a terrible person, you know that? Always following us, hunting
the Avatar, trying to capture the world's last hope for peace!

299
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:11,320
But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son.
Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood.

300
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,939
You don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:23,429
I don't?! How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through.
Me personally. The Fire Nation took my mother away from me.

302
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:30,569
I'm sorry.
That's something we have in common.

303
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:39,414
Well whaddya know. There is an
ancient city down there, but it's deep.

304
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:47,747
We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to
look for Katara and the angry jerk... no offense.

305
00:31:47,748 --> 00:31:49,005
None taken.

306
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:52,066
And I'll go with Toph to warn
the Earth King about Azula's coup.

307
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:05,513
So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice.
And great tea.

308
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:09,651
The key to both is proper aging.
What's on your mind?

309
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:19,539
Well, i met with this Guru who was supposed to help me
master the avatar state, and control this great power.

310
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
But to do it, i had to let go
of someone i love, and i just couldn't.

311
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:32,359
Perfection and power are overrated.
I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love.

312
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:40,348
What happens if we can't save everyone and beat Azula?
Without the Avatar State, what if i am not powerful enough?

313
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:53,307
I don't know the answer. Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel.
You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving...

314
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:59,951
You will come to a better place.

315
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,663
Arghh! What's going on here?!

316
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:24,700
You're under house arrest.

317
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:28,299
The coup is happening right now!
We've got to warn the Earth King!

318
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:50,683
Thank goodness we're in time!

319
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,070
In time for what?

320
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:57,786
Yeah, what are you in time for...
cutie?

321
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,872
Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki.

322
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,923
Who?

323
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:06,474
They're not the real Kyoshi Warriors!

324
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:09,536
Sorry to disappoint you.

325
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:22,622
Ooo, it's like we're dancing together.

326
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:25,836
This fight... is over.

327
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:38,073
Get them all out of my sight.

328
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:57,968
Now comes the part where i double-cross you.
Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation Princess.

329
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:03,540
I said, arrest her. What is wrong with you?

330
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:08,221
It's because they haven't made up their minds.
They're waiting to see how this is going to end.

331
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:10,130
What are you talking about?

332
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:14,331
I can see your whole history in your eyes.
You were born with nothing.

333
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:24,347
So you had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power. But true power.
.. the divine right to rule... is something you're born with.

334
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:31,359
The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be
sitting on that thrown and which one is going to be bowing down.

335
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,110
But i know. And you know.
Well?

336
00:35:41,702 --> 00:35:46,257
You've beaten me at my own game.

337
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:50,338
Don't flatter yourself.
You were never even a player.

338
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,257
I'm sorry i yelled at you before.

339
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,616
It doesn't matter.

340
00:35:55,617 --> 00:36:01,849
It's just that for so long now, whenever i would
imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face.

341
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:04,281
My face. i see

342
00:36:04,282 --> 00:36:06,621
No, no, that's not what i meant.

343
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,921
It's ok. i used to think
this scar marked me.

344
00:36:09,922 --> 00:36:13,932
The mark of the banished prince,
cursed to chase the Avatar forever.

345
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:21,181
But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my
own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark.

346
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:23,955
Maybe you could be free of it.

347
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:24,801
What?

348
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:26,176
I have healing abilities.

349
00:36:26,177 --> 00:36:28,827
It's a scar. It can't be healed.

350
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:40,542
This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so
i have be saving it for something important. i don't know if it would work, but...

351
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:53,703
Aang!

352
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:07,000
Aang, i knew you would come.

353
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,001
Uncle, i don't understand.
What are you doing with the Avatar

354
00:37:08,002 --> 00:37:12,614
Saving you, that's what.

355
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:19,307
Zuko, it's time we talked. Go help your other friends.
We'll catch up with you.

356
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:28,407
Why Uncle?

357
00:37:28,408 --> 00:37:36,390
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko.
You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been.

358
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:45,351
And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny.
It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good!

359
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:59,142
I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle, but Zuko, Prince Zuko.
.. you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you?

360
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,136
Release him immediately!

361
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:05,395
It's not too late for you Zuko.
You can still redeem yourself.

362
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:08,849
The kind of redemption she
offers is not for you.

363
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:15,884
Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? i need you Zuko.
I've plotted every move of this day.

364
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:21,182
This glorious day in Fire Nation history.
And the only way we win is together.

365
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:24,685
At the end of this day,
you will have your honor back.

366
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:29,168
You will have your father's love.
You will have everything you want.

367
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:37,021
Zuko, i am begging you, look into your heart
and see what it is that you truly want.

368
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,682
You are free to choose.

369
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,220
We've got to find Sokka and Toph.

370
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:52,178
See any Dai Li agents near by?

371
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:54,226
Nope. All clear.

372
00:39:57,949 --> 00:40:00,885
Let's go!

373
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:02,446
I'm not leaving without Bosco!

374
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:26,750
I thought you had changed!

375
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,626
I have changed.

376
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:03,894
Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front
paws instead of your rear ones. Like this.

377
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,683
That is a nice trick.

378
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:13,074
Just take the bear.

379
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:15,147
Bosco!

380
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:11,785
There's too many.

381
00:43:11,786 --> 00:43:16,309
The only way, is to let her go.

382
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,804
I'm sorry Katara.

383
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:37,466
You've got to get out of here!
I'll hold them off as long as i can!

384
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:42,659
We've done it Zuko. It's taken a hundred years,
but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se.

385
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:44,222
I betrayed Uncle.

386
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:52,823
No, he betrayed you. Zuko, when you return
home, father will welcome you as a war hero.

387
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:56,865
But i don't have the Avatar.
What if Father doesn't restore my honor?

388
00:45:56,866 --> 00:46:03,667
He doesn't need to Zuko. Today,
you restored your own honor.

389
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:15,927
The Earth Kingdom... has fallen.
