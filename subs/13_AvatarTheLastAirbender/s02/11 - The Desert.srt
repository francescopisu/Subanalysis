1
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,684
How could you let them take
Appa? Why didn't you stop them?

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:21,684
I couldn't! The library was sinking!
You guys were still inside and...

3
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:24,684
You could have come to
get us! I could have saved him!

4
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:27,184
I can hardly feel any vibrations out here.

5
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:30,096
The sandbenders snuck up on
me and there wasn't time for...

6
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,528
You just didn't care! You never
liked Appa! You wanted him gone!

7
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:38,185
Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could.
She saved our lives.

8
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:41,684
Who's going to save our lives
now? We'll never make it out of here.

9
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,684
That's all any of you guys
care about yourselves!

10
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:47,485
You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!

11
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:51,185
We're all concerned, but we
can't afford to be fighting now.

12
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,585
I'm going after Appa.

13
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:56,185
Aang, wait!

14
00:00:56,186 --> 00:01:02,684
We'd better start walking. We're the only
people who know about the solar eclipse.

15
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,685
We have to get that
information to Ba Sing Se.

16
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:10,185
You think if we dig out the
giant owl, he'll give us a ride?

17
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:19,945
Maybe we should make camp.

18
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:23,586
No, please, don't stop just for me!

19
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:37,185
What now?

20
00:01:44,685 --> 00:01:49,685
Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise!

21
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:54,685
If you're surprised we're here then the
Dragon of the West has lost a few steps.

22
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,685
You know these guys?

23
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:08,185
Sure. Colonel Mongke and
the Rough Riders are legendary.

24
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:11,684
Each one is a different
kind of weapons specialist.

25
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:15,685
They are also a very capable singing group.

26
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:20,185
We're not here to give a concert.
We're here to apprehend fugitives!

27
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:26,184
Would you like some tea first?
I'd love some. How about you, Kachi?

28
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:30,627
I make you as a jasmine man. Am I right?

29
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:33,287
Enough stalling! Round 'em up!

30
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,184
It's nice to see old friends.

31
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:19,485
Too bad you don't have any old
friends that don't want to attack you.

32
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,185
Hmm... Old friends that
don't want to attack me...

33
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:38,684
Can't you watch where you're...

34
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,684
No.

35
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,184
Right. Sorry.

36
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:43,225
Come on guys, we've got to stick together.

37
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:47,184
If I sweat any more, I don't think
sticking together will be a problem.

38
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,653
Katara, can I have some water?

39
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:52,561
Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.

40
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,410
We're drinking your bending water?

41
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,685
You used this on the swamp guy!

42
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:06,185
It does taste swampy.

43
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,394
I'm sorry, it's all we have.

44
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,685
Not anymore! Look!

45
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:19,813
Sokka, wait! You shouldn't
be eating strange plants!

46
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,184
There's water trapped inside these!

47
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:25,184
I don't know...

48
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:28,166
Suit yourself. It's very
thirst-quenching, though.

49
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:36,309
Drink cactus juice.

50
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,309
It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier.

51
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,266
It's the quenchiest!

52
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,068
Okay, I think you've had enough.

53
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,285
Who lit Toph on fire?

54
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:51,685
Can I get some of that cactus?

55
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:55,364
I don't think that's a good idea.
Come on, we need to find Aang.

56
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:02,184
How did we get out here
in the middle of the ocean?

57
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,235
Uhhh...

58
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:14,685
Appa!

59
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:20,735
Appa!

60
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,746
No...

61
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:33,378
No!

62
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:43,172
What is that?

63
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,761
What? What is what?

64
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:48,253
It's a giant mushroom!

65
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:50,582
Maybe it's friendly!

66
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,402
Let's just keep moving.
I hope Aang's okay...

67
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:58,291
Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!

68
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,149
Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her
friends passed through here a few days ago.

69
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,831
Did they give you any indication
where they were headed?

70
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,455
Maybe you could give me a little incentive?

71
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,762
You suggesting I break your fingers?

72
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:21,272
They went in the desert! Too bad
there's almost no chance they survived.

73
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,407
That's okay, since she's
wanted dead or alive.

74
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:30,151
No she's not! I'm certain
her father wants her alive.

75
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:33,766
Hey, look... Fire Nation wanted posters!

76
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,065
So?

77
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,079
So, look who's here.

78
00:06:57,206 --> 00:07:00,820
I'm sorry, Aang. I know
it's hard for you right now, ...

79
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,830
but we need to focus
on getting out of here.

80
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,134
What's the difference?

81
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:06,030
We won't survive without Appa.

82
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,170
We all know it.

83
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,263
Come on, Aang! We can
do this if we work together.

84
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,197
Right Toph?

85
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:15,394
As far as I can feel, we're trapped
in a giant bowl of sand pudding.

86
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,124
I got nothin'.

87
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:19,633
Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?

88
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:23,435
Why don't we ask the circle birds?

89
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,719
Ugh... We're getting out of this desert,
and we're going to do it together!

90
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:47,952
Aang, get up. Everybody hold hands.
We can do this.

91
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,517
We have to.

92
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,784
I think we should stop for the night.

93
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,460
Is there any more water?

94
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:18,820
This is the last of it.
Everyone can have a little drink.

95
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:25,654
Momo, no! You've killed us all!

96
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,562
No, he hasn't.

97
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,081
Oh, right. Bending.

98
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:36,616
Sokka, let me see the things
you got from the library.

99
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:40,080
What!? I didn't steal
anything! Who told you that?

100
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,208
It was you! You ratted me out!

101
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:47,217
Sokka, I was there.

102
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,144
It doesn't matter. None of
those will tell us where Appa is.

103
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:56,664
No, but we can find out
which way Ba Sing Se is.

104
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,979
We can use the stars to guide us.

105
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,999
That way we can travel at night
when it's cool and rest during the day.

106
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:09,831
Just try to get some sleep.
We'll start again in a few hours.

107
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:17,408
No one here is going to help us. These
people just look like filthy wanderers.

108
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,116
So do we.

109
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:23,247
Ah, this is interesting.

110
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:27,055
I think I've found our friend.

111
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,873
You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho?

112
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:34,084
I don't think this is a gamble.

113
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,011
Let's take them now!

114
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:40,741
This place is full of desperate characters.

115
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:42,942
If they find out we're
collecting a bounty, ...

116
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:48,960
we might have to fight them
all just to keep our prize. Patience.

117
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,179
May I have this game?

118
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:55,390
The guest has the first move.

119
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,005
I see you favor the white lotus gambit.

120
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:04,994
Not many still cling to the ancient ways.

121
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:09,203
Those who do can always find a friend.

122
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:11,114
Then let us play.

123
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:32,758
Welcome, brother. The White Lotus
opens wide to those who know her secrets.

124
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,585
What are you old gasbags talking about?

125
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:40,880
I always tried to tell you that
Pai Sho is more than just a game.

126
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:46,915
I'm not waiting all night for
these geezers to finish yapping!

127
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:52,612
It's over! You two fugitives
are coming with me!

128
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:57,943
I knew it! You two are wanted criminals
with a giant bounty on your heads!

129
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,566
I thought you said he would help!

130
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,970
He is. Just watch.

131
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,411
You think you're going to capture
them and collect all that gold?

132
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,098
Gold?

133
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:14,729
Uh... Maybe we shouldn't.

134
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:47,701
Come on, get up. We need to go.

135
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:56,743
Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud.
Now it just tastes like sand.

136
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:59,757
I never thought I'd miss
the taste of mud so much.

137
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,110
I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.

138
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:06,837
Well, we need to get moving if
we want to get out of this sand pit.

139
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,464
Appa!

140
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,383
Appa? But why would Princess Yue need him?

141
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:16,508
She's the moon! She flies by herself!

142
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,474
It's just a cloud.

143
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,492
Wait! A cloud!

144
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:27,409
Here, fly up and bend the water
from that cloud into my pouch.

145
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:47,377
Wow... there's hardly any in here.

146
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:51,172
I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud.
I did all I could!

147
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,453
What's anyone else doing!
What are you doing?

148
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:59,448
Trying to keep everyone together.
Let's just get moving.

149
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:01,170
We need to head in this direction.

150
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,951
Ow! Crud! I am so sick
of not feeling where I'm going!

151
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:13,150
And what idiot buried a
boat in the middle of the desert?

152
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:14,180
A boat?

153
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:17,798
Believe me, I kicked it hard
enough to feel plenty of vibrations.

154
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,599
It's one of the gliders
the sandbenders use!

155
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:34,260
And look! It's got some
kind of compass on it!

156
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,010
I bet it can point us out of here!

157
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:42,348
Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it.
We're going to make it!

158
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:57,541
It is an honor to welcome
such a high-ranking member...

159
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,654
of the Order of the White Lotus.

160
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,782
Being a Grand Master,
you must know so many secrets.

161
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:07,799
Now that you played Pai Sho, are
you going to do some flower arranging, ...

162
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,321
or is this club going
to offer some real help?

163
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:13,056
You must forgive my nephew.

164
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:18,890
He is not an initiate and has little
appreciation for the cryptic arts.

165
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,204
Who knocks at the guarded gate?

166
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:27,433
One who has eaten the
fruit and tasted its mysteries.

167
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm afraid it's members only.
Wait out here.

168
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:57,072
The needle on this compass doesn't seem to
be pointing north according to my charts.

169
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,866
Take it easy little lady.

170
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:03,509
I'm sure the sand folks who built
this baby know how to get around here.

171
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:09,042
That's what the compass
is pointing to! That giant rock!

172
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:11,155
It must be the magnetic
center of the desert.

173
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:14,498
A rock? Yes! Let's go!

174
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,277
Maybe we can find some water there!

175
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:19,574
Maybe we can find some sandbenders.

176
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:34,435
Ahhh... Finally! Solid ground!

177
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:45,609
I think my head is starting to
clear out the cactus juice. And look!

178
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:52,911
This tastes like rotten penguin meat!

179
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:55,206
Awww I feel woozy.

180
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:58,133
You've been hallucinating
on cactus juice all day and then...

181
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:01,646
you just lick something you
find stuck to the wall of a cave?

182
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,958
I have a natural curiosity.

183
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:08,976
I don't think this is a normal cave.
This was carved by something.

184
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:12,088
Yeah... look at the shape.

185
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:16,108
There's something buzzing in here.
Something that's coming for us!

186
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:44,374
What are you doing?
That rock almost crushed me!

187
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,993
Sorry, I can't tell where
they are in the air!

188
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,705
I got this one.

189
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,929
Sokka, there's nothing there.

190
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:56,749
I guess my head's not
as clear as I thought.

191
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,110
We have to get out of here!
I'm completely out of water to bend!

192
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,767
Momo!

193
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:05,594
I'm not losing anyone else out here.

194
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:10,827
Come on, we're going down.

195
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,723
Toph, shoot a rock right there.

196
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:17,231
Fire!

197
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,734
Yeah! You got it! She got it, right?

198
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,642
Yes. Now let's move.

199
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,299
On your left!

200
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:31,229
What's going on? Is the club meeting over?

201
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:36,255
Everything is taken care of.
We're heading to Ba Sing Se.

202
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,780
Ba Sing Se? Why would we
go to the Earth Kingdom capital?

203
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:43,892
The city is filled with refugees.
No one will notice two more.

204
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:46,423
We can hide in plain sight there.

205
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:50,350
And it's the safest place
in the world from the Fire Nation.

206
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:53,570
Even I couldn't break through to the city.

207
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:56,448
I have the passports for our guests, ...

208
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,209
but there are two men out
on the streets looking for them.

209
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,905
You seen these guys?

210
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,588
What are you doing in our
land with a sandbender sailer?

211
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,496
From the looks of it, you
stole it from the Hami tribe.

212
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,843
We found the sailer
abandoned in the desert.

213
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:16,967
We're traveling with the Avatar.

214
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:20,874
Our bison was stolen and
we have to get to Ba Sing Se.

215
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:25,798
You dare accuse our people of theft
while you ride in on a stolen sand sailer?

216
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,614
Quiet, Gashuin. No one
accused our people of anything.

217
00:19:30,013 --> 00:19:33,625
If what they say is true,
we must give them hospitality.

218
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:35,329
Sorry, father.

219
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:40,381
I recognize the son's voice.
He's the one that stole Appa.

220
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,766
Are you sure?

221
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,578
I never forget a voice.

222
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:47,792
You stole Appa! Where
is he? What did you do to him?

223
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:50,410
They're lying! They're the thieves!

224
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,072
Where is my bison?

225
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:09,029
Hey you, where are these men?

226
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,073
I got a tip that they're in your shop.

227
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,739
As you can see, no one is here but us.

228
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,172
We know all about your secret back room.

229
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,124
Kick it down.

230
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,833
Hey! That room is for flowers only!

231
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:32,368
Some unlucky soul has an
incomplete Pai Sho set.

232
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:36,286
Let's go back to finding the girl.

233
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,788
You tell me where he is now!

234
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:52,844
What did you do?

235
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,452
I... It wasn't me!

236
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,254
You said to put a muzzle on him!

237
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:58,691
You muzzled Appa?

238
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:08,270
I'm sorry! I didn't know
that it belonged to the Avatar!

239
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,088
Tell me where Appa is!

240
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:15,223
I traded him! To some merchants!
He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now!

241
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:17,130
They were going to sell him there!

242
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:22,251
Please! We'll escort you out of
the desert! We'll help however we can!

243
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:26,433
Just get out of here! Run!

244
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,750
