1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:03,121
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:04,995
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,104
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,396
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,675
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>Only the Avatar, master of
all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,148
<i>But when the world needed
him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother
and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,356
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before
he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>But I believe Aang
can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,326
I can't believe it. I
know the war has spread far, ...

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,338
but Omashu always seemed... untouchable.

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:10,434
Up until now, it was. Now Ba Sing Se is the
only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left.

17
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:14,771
This is horrible, but we have to move on.

18
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,758
No. I'm going in to find Bumi.

19
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:21,446
Aang, stop.
We don't even know if Bumi's still...

20
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:24,130
What? If he's still what?

21
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:25,538
Around.

22
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,433
I know you had your heart set on Bumi, ...

23
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:30,691
but there are other people
around who can teach you earthbending.

24
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:36,558
This isn't about finding a teacher.
This is about finding my friend.

25
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,217
A secret passage?

26
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:45,988
Why didn't we just use this last time?

27
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,623
Does that answer your question?

28
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,250
That wasn't as bad as I thought.

29
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:29,079
They won't let go! Help!

30
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:35,017
Stop making so much noise.
It's just a purple pentapus.

31
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:45,634
Hey!

32
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,356
What are you kids doing out past curfew?

33
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:55,029
Sorry. We were just on our way home.

34
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,961
Wait! What's the matter with him?

35
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:04,104
Uh... he has pentapox, Sir.

36
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,943
Um... it's highly contagious!

37
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:13,076
Ahhhhh... It's so awful... I'm dyiiiing...

38
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,325
and deadly...

39
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:18,863
Wait, I think I've heard of pentapox.
Didn't your cousin Chang die of it?

40
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:23,038
We'd better go wash our hands.
.. and burn our clothes!

41
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:26,616
Thank you, sewer friend!

42
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,675
When tracking your brother and uncle, ...

43
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:35,789
traveling with a royal procession
may no longer be an option.

44
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:41,306
May no longer be wise... if you
hope to keep the element of surprise.

45
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:44,450
You're right. The royal
procession is dead weight.

46
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:48,185
If I want to catch my prey,
I must be agile... nimble.

47
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:55,153
I need a small, elite team.
It's time to visit some old friends.

48
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,699
Let's find Bumi and get out of here.

49
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:08,374
Where would they be keeping him?

50
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:13,767
Somewhere he can't earthbend.
Somewhere made of metal.

51
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:24,215
There really is no fathoming the
depths of my hatred for this place.

52
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,209
Mai, your father was appointed governor.

53
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:32,021
We're like royalty here.
Be happy, and enjoy it.

54
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,768
The targets are approaching.

55
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,087
Take them out.

56
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:41,093
I thought my life was
boring in the Fire Nation.

57
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:47,580
But this place is unbearably bleak.
Nothing ever happens.

58
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,996
The resistance!

59
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:52,495
Ty Lee, could that possibly be you?

60
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:54,728
Azula!

61
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,685
It is so good to see you!

62
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:05,817
Please, don't let me interrupt your.
.. whatever it is you were doing.

63
00:06:05,837 --> 00:06:09,116
Tell me, what is the daughter
of a nobleman doing here?

64
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,965
Certainly our parents didn't send
us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls...

65
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,463
to end up in... places like this.

66
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:21,798
I have a proposition for you.
I'm hunting a traitor.

67
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:25,183
You remember my old fuddy
duddy uncle, don't you?

68
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,801
Oh yeah. He was so funny.

69
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,610
I would be honored if you
would join me on my mission.

70
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:38,769
Oh... I... uh... would love to.
But the truth is, I'm really happy here.

71
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,832
I mean, my aura has never been pinker!

72
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:44,044
I'll take your word for it.

73
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,183
Well, I wouldn't want you to give
up the life you love just to please me.

74
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,441
Thank you, Azula.

75
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,778
Of course, before I leave,
I'm going to catch your show.

76
00:06:55,797 --> 00:07:01,638
Huh? Uh... yeah... sure...
uh... of course...

77
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:07,760
So, is King Bumi with you
guys? Is he leading the resistance?

78
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:12,329
Of course not! The day of the invasion,
we readied ourselves for battle.

79
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:16,994
We were prepared to defend our city...
To fight for our lives and for our freedom.

80
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:23,659
But before we even had a
chance, King Bumi surrendered.

81
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:32,477
The day of the invasion, I asked
King Bumi what he wanted to do.

82
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:35,278
He looked me in the eye and said...

83
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:39,354
I'm going to do... nothing!

84
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:45,720
It doesn't matter now. Fighting the
Fire Nation is the only path to freedom.

85
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,008
And freedom is worth dying for.

86
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:52,970
Actually there's another path to freedom.
You could leave Omashu.

87
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:56,148
You're directing all your
energy to fight the Fire Nation.

88
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,885
But you're outnumbered. You can't win.

89
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:02,474
Now's the time to retreat, so
you can live to fight another day.

90
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:05,280
You don't understand.
They've taken our home, ...

91
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:07,717
and we have to fight them at any cost!

92
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:12,672
I don't know, Ya, living to fight another
day is startin' to sound pretty good to me.

93
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,477
Yeah, I'm with the kid!

94
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:23,245
Fine. But there's thousands
of citizens that need to leave.

95
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:25,270
How're we going to get them all out?

96
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,177
Suckers!

97
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,504
You're all about to come down
with a nasty case of pentapox.

98
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:54,919
The marks make ya look sick, but you
gotta act sick, too. Ya gotta sell it!

99
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:00,874
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.

100
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,884
Years of practice.

101
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:08,258
Okay everyone! Into sick formation.

102
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:11,747
Aang, what are you doing?
Aren't you coming with us.

103
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:15,856
No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi.

104
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:19,859
Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later.

105
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,339
Plague! Plague!

106
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,847
What is going on down there?

107
00:09:56,857 --> 00:10:01,070
I saw some kids yesterday who were
sick with pentapox. It must have spread!

108
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,780
Pentapox! Hm, I'm pretty
sure I've heard of that.

109
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,854
Oh, this is terrible.

110
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:08,253
What should we do?

111
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:11,436
Drive them out of the city.
.. but don't touch them!

112
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,669
We have to rid the city of this disease!

113
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:18,024
Fire flakes, Dad?

114
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,599
Oh! How awful!

115
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,090
Flopsie!

116
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,781
Come on, Flopsie.
You gotta help me find Bumi.

117
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:58,477
Yip Yip! Oh... I guess that
doesn't work with you. Let's go!

118
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:16,226
We're deeply honored to have the Fire
Lord's daughter at our humble circus.

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,446
Uh... tell us if there is anything
we can do to make the show more enjoyable.

120
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,474
I will.

121
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:31,228
Incredible. Do you think she'll fall?

122
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,512
Of course not.

123
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:36,447
Then wouldn't it make it more
interesting if you removed the net?

124
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:39,392
Uh... the thing is... the performers...

125
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:43,476
You're right, you're right.
That's been done.

126
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,480
I know. Set the net on fire.

127
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:49,943
Of course, Princess.

128
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:02,495
Brilliant, just brilliant! Oooo, what
kind of dangerous animals do you have?

129
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,565
Well, our circus boasts
the most exotic assortment...

130
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,417
Release them all!

131
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:24,722
We looked everywhere. No Bumi.

132
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,238
We've got a problem.
We just did a head count.

133
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:32,984
Oh no. Did someone get left behind?

134
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:36,055
No, we have an extra.

135
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:48,198
So, the resistance has kidnapped my son.

136
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:52,975
Everything so clever, so tricky.
Just like their King Bumi.

137
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:55,283
What do you want to do, Sir?

138
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,722
What an exquisite performance.

139
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,682
I can't wait to see how
you'll top yourself tomorrow.

140
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,425
I'm sorry Azula, but unfortunately
there won't be a show tomorrow.

141
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:11,142
Really?

142
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:15,759
The universe has given me strong
hints that it's time for a career change.

143
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:18,955
I want to join you on your mission.

144
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:32,596
No! Bad Fire Nation baby!

145
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,849
Oh... alright.

146
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:44,108
Ooo, you're so cute. Mmmmm...

147
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:48,621
Sure he's cute now, but when he's
older, he'll join the Fire Nation army.

148
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,451
You won't think he's so cute then.
He'll be a killer.

149
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:56,426
Does that look like the
face of a killer to you?

150
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,698
A messenger hawk!

151
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:08,315
It's from the Fire Nation governor.
He thinks we kidnapped his son.

152
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:15,398
So... he wants to make a trade.
His son for King Bumi.

153
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,716
You realize we're probably
walking right into a trap?

154
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:29,798
I don't think so. I'm sure the Governor
wants his son back as much as we want Bumi.

155
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,625
It's a new day.
I have a good feeling about this.

156
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,870
Please tell me you're here to kill me.

157
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,844
It's great to see you, Mai.

158
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:54,172
I thought you ran off and joined
the circus? You said it was your calling.

159
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:57,301
Well, Azula called a little louder.

160
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,986
I have a mission and I need you both.

161
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:04,412
Count me in. Anything
to get me out of this place.

162
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:06,338
I apologize.

163
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,908
You've come to Omashu at a difficult time.

164
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:13,357
At noon we're making a trade with
the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.

165
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:17,321
Yes, I'm so sorry to hear
about your son, but really, ...

166
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:21,817
what did you expect by just
letting all the citizens leave?

167
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:25,850
My father has trusted you with this
city and you're making a mess of things!

168
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,928
Forgive me, Princess.

169
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,545
You stay here. Mai will
handle the hostage trade...

170
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,926
so you don't have a chance to mess it up.
And there is no more "Omashu".

171
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:40,920
I'm renaming it in honor of
my father, the City of New Ozai.

172
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:57,920
Hi, everybody!

173
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,223
You brought my brother?

174
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,811
He's here. We're ready to trade.

175
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:08,147
I'm sorry, but a thought
just occurred to me. Do you mind?

176
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:10,344
Of course not, Princess Azula.

177
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:16,518
We're trading a two year old for a king.
A powerful, earthbending king?

178
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,953
It just doesn't seem like
a fair trade, does it?

179
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,651
You're right.

180
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:27,853
The deal's off.

181
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,249
Whhhoa! See you all later!

182
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:34,781
Bumi!

183
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:44,543
The Avatar!

184
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:48,647
My lucky day.

185
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,013
Aang, is that you? Where did you come from?

186
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:00,965
Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here.

187
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,985
We've got to get the baby out of here!

188
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,189
Way ahead of ya!

189
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:43,324
Aang, stop your blowing for a minute.

190
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,795
Now hold on just a duahhh!!!

191
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,249
Just like old times, isn't it, Bumi?

192
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:11,560
Aang, I need to talk to you!

193
00:19:11,576 --> 00:19:14,424
It's good to see you too!

194
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:13,766
How are you gonna fight
without your bending?

195
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,600
I seem to manage!

196
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:26,371
There's Aang!

197
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,426
We can catch him!

198
00:20:32,573 --> 00:20:36,164
Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!

199
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,045
You could earthbend all along!?

200
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:18,048
Well, they didn't cover my face.

201
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:23,729
I don't understand.
Why didn't you free yourself?

202
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:26,172
Why did you surrender
when Omashu was invaded?

203
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:28,062
What's the matter with you, Bumi!?

204
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:32,291
Listen to me, Aang. There are
options in fighting, called jin.

205
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:35,642
It's a choice of how you
direct your energy.

206
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:37,970
I know! There's positive
jin when you're attacking, ...

207
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:40,130
and negative jin when you're retreating.

208
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:43,150
And neutral jin when you do nothing!

209
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,727
There three jins?

210
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,837
Well, technically there are eighty five.

211
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:52,448
But, let's just focus on the third.
Neutral jin is the key to earthbending.

212
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:57,579
It involves listening and waiting
for the right moment to strike.

213
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:59,693
That's why you surrendered, isn't it?

214
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:03,739
Yes, and it's why I can't leave now.

215
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:07,473
I guess I need to find someone
else to teach me earthbending.

216
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:11,419
Your teacher will be someone
who has mastered neutral jin.

217
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:17,113
You need to find someone who
waits and listens before striking.

218
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,268
Hey, Momo!

219
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:22,245
Momo's mastered a few jins himself!

220
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:29,229
Goodbye, Aang. I'll see
you when the time is right.

221
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,840
So, we're tracking down
your brother and Uncle, huh?

222
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,326
It'll be interesting seeing
Zuko again, won't it, Mai?

223
00:22:43,344 --> 00:22:50,348
It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore.
We have a third target now.

224
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,104
Tom-Tom!
