00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,713
You know fans just
make flames stronger.

15
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:56,788
I am Long Feng, head of the Dai Li.

16
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,628
Why won't you let us talk to the King?

17
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:02,059
The Earth King has no time to get
involved with political squabbles.

18
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,275
So the King is just a figurehead.

19
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:06,053
He's your puppet!

20
00:01:06,506 --> 00:01:12,701
Itâ€™s time for you to look inward, and
begin asking yourself the big questions.

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,348
Who are you and what do you want.

22
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:18,578
I can handle you by myself!

23
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:23,161
I missed you, buddy.

24
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:37,682
I missed you more than
you'll ever know, buddy.

25
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:46,210
Look, we escaped from the Dai
Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you,

26
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:49,412
we should go to the Earth King now
and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.

27
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,972
One good hour after weeks
of trouble isn't much of a roll.

28
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:54,418
We can build on it.

29
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:58,364
If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the
eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support.

30
00:01:58,365 --> 00:02:00,682
What makes you think we'll get it?

31
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:05,389
I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't
usually go that smoothly for our little gang.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,267
I know, but I've got a good feeling about this.
This time will be different.

33
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:11,876
Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city.

34
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:14,492
His conspiracy with the
Dai Li is too powerful.

35
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:17,829
I think we should just keep flying
and leave this horrible place behind us.

36
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,798
I'm with sweetness. I've
seen enough of Ba Sing Se,

37
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,662
and I can't even see!

38
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:30,753
But now that we have Appa back, there is nothing stopping us from
telling the Earth king the truth about the conspiracy and the war.

39
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,542
See, Aang's with me.

40
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:36,975
It's the whole reason we came here
in the first place, we have to try.

41
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:42,155
Well, I guess if the Earth King
knew the truth, things could change.

42
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:48,722
I don't trust the new positive Sokka.
Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!

43
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:56,540
That's probably the Dai Li searching
for us. So?

44
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,087
Let's fly!

45
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:08,082
Can we please buy a new saddle?
Riding bareback is terrifying!

46
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:13,614
There it is.
That whole thing is the palace.

47
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,792
The Earth King's chambers
should be in the center.

48
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:19,592
We have to be careful. Long Feng's
probably warned the King that we're coming.

49
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:23,898
Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I
think we're just gonna sail right in?.Ahhh!

50
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:26,010
What was that?!

51
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:29,765
Surface to air rocks! More incoming! Ahhh!

52
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:24,489
Sorry!

53
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:36,467
Sorry! We just need to get
through to see the Earth King.

54
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,276
Seriously, we're actually
on your guys' side. Sorry.

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,486
In there.

56
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,327
Toph, which way to the Earth King?

57
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:57,558
How should I know? I'm still
voting that we leave Ba Sing Se.

58
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,599
Burglar!

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,749
Sorry, wrong door.

60
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:21,263
You did the right thing, letting
the Avatar's bison go free.

61
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:23,147
I don't feel right.

62
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,755
Zuko!

63
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:43,642
Now that's an impressive door.
It's gotta go somewhere.

64
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:56,769
A little warning next time!

65
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:07,252
We need to talk to you!

66
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,958
They're here to overthrow you.

67
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,942
No, we're on your side. We're here to help.

68
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:14,266
You have to trust us.

69
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:19,122
You invade my palace, lay waste to
all my guards, break down my fancy door,

70
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:21,845
and you expect me to trust you?

71
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:23,248
He has a good point.

72
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:27,788
If you're own my side, then
drop your weapons and stand down.

73
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:37,147
See, we're friends, your Earthiness.

74
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,716
Detain the assailants.

75
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:58,295
But we dropped our weapons.
We're your allies.

76
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:02,746
Make sure the Avatar and his
friends never see daylight again.

77
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:06,349
The Avatar? You're the Avatar?

78
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,774
Uh, no, him.

79
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,116
Over here.

80
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:13,355
What does it matter Your Highness?
They're enemies of the state.

81
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:15,386
Perhaps you're right.

82
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:23,967
Though Bosco seems to like him.
I'll hear what he has to say.

83
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:31,251
Well, sir, there is a war going on right now.
For the past 100 years, in fact.

84
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:33,361
The Dai Li's kept it secret from you.

85
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:37,113
It's a conspiracy to control
the city, and to control you.

86
00:08:37,114 --> 00:08:40,107
A secret war? That's crazy!

87
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,923
Completely!

88
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:46,348
Long Feng didn't want us to tell you,
so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us.

89
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:50,165
And blackmail is the least of
his crimes, he brain washed our friend!

90
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,430
All lies. I've never even
seen a Sky Bison Your Majesty.

91
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:56,531
Frankly, I thought they were extinct.

92
00:08:56,532 --> 00:09:00,940
Your claim is difficult
to believe, even from an Avatar.

93
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:06,231
These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell
that my agents have been tracking for weeks.

94
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:11,349
If you listen to them, you're playing
right into your own destruction.

95
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,330
I have to trust my advisor.

96
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,872
Wait, I can prove he's lying.

97
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:26,795
Long Feng said he's never seen
a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.

98
00:09:26,796 --> 00:09:29,471
What? I am not disrobing!

99
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,903
Right there! Appa bit him.

100
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:40,348
Never met a Sky Bison, huh?

101
00:09:40,349 --> 00:09:45,972
That happens to be a large birthmark.
Thanks for showing everyone.

102
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:49,598
Well, I suppose there's no way
to prove where those marks came from.

103
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,768
Of course there is!

104
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:58,642
Yup, that pretty much proves it.

105
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:02,203
Yeah! Woo!

106
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,144
But it doesn't prove
this crazy conspiracy theory.

107
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,951
Awww.

108
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:09,857
Though, I suppose this
matter is worth looking into.

109
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:13,700
Uh, ok, we'll take it. Yeah.

110
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:27,079
You're burning up.
You have an intense fever.

111
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,584
This will help cool you down.

112
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,071
So thirsty.

113
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:39,757
Here's some clean water to drink.
Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out.

114
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:06,433
So, this is what a train is like? I
didn't realize it would be this... public.

115
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:09,933
So you've never been outside
the upper ring before?

116
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:14,360
I've never been outside of the palace.
Now that's the way to travel.

117
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,621
So, may I ask where we're going?

118
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:22,612
Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness.

119
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,573
To the Dai Li's secret headquarters.

120
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:28,340
You're about to see where all the
brainwashing and conspiring took place.

121
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:40,559
It's gone!

122
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,382
Oh, don't tell me?
That's ok, still got my positive attitude.

123
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:49,639
The Dai Li must have known we
were coming and destroyed the evidence.

124
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,413
Hmm. That seems awfully convenient.

125
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:57,721
Hey, if anything, this proves
the conspiracy exists even more.

126
00:11:57,722 --> 00:12:01,218
Long Feng was right, this
was a waste of time.

127
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:05,014
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to the palace.

128
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,937
The wall! They'll never
be able to cover that up in time!

129
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,403
Oh yeah.

130
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,041
If you come with us to the outer wall, we can
prove to you that the secret war is real!

131
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,120
No Earth King has ever
been to the outer wall.

132
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:23,178
I don't have anymore
time for this nonsense.

133
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:28,324
If you come with us, this
time you can ride on Appa.

134
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:32,497
Ahhhh!

135
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:35,046
First time flying?

136
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,939
Its both thrilling and terrifying.

137
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,668
Yeah, I hate it too.

138
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,254
I have to be honest with you.

139
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:47,253
Part of me really hopes that what you are
telling me about this war... isn't true.

140
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:49,274
I wish it wasn't.

141
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:14,195
It's getting late. Are you
planning to retire soon, my Lord?

142
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,095
I'm not tired.

143
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:24,058
Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go, give into it.
Shut your eyes for awhile.

144
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:29,362
No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do
not listen to the Blue Dragon.

145
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:34,568
You should get out of here right now.
Go! Before it's too late!

146
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:40,077
Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.

147
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:55,320
Sleep, just Like MOTHER!

148
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:59,603
Zuko, help me!

149
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,126
It's still there!

150
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,017
What is that?

151
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:17,417
It's a drill. A giant drill made by the
Fire Nation, to break through your walls.

152
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,605
I can't believe I never knew.

153
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:29,150
I can explain this, Your Majesty.

154
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:32,576
This is nothing more than.
.. a construction project.

155
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:39,332
Really? Then perhaps you can explain why there's a
Fire Nation insignia on your construction project.

156
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:45,794
Well, it's imported of course. You
know you can't trust domestic machinery.

157
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:52,693
Surely you don't believe these children,
instead of your most loyal attendant?!

158
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,928
Dai Li, arrest Long Feng.

159
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:05,524
I want him to stand trial for
crimes against the Earth Kingdom.

160
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:19,514
You can't arrest me. You
all need me more than you know!

161
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:24,398
Looks like Long Feng is "long gone"!
Ha... Oh,

162
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,401
yeah, I've been waitin' to use that one.

163
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:34,877
I want to thank you, young
heroes for opening my eyes.

164
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:37,569
All this time, what I
thought was a great metropolis,

165
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,327
was merely a city of fools,
and that makes me the king fool.

166
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,118
We're at war, with the Fire Nation.

167
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,431
That's why we came to Ba
Sing Se, Your Highness.

168
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:53,046
Because we think you can
help us end the war.

169
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:56,820
We don't have much time. There's
a comet coming this summer.

170
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:01,979
Its energy will give the fire benders
unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.

171
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,331
But there is hope. Before the comet
comes, we have a window of opportunity.

172
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,265
A solar eclipse is coming.

173
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:13,470
The sun will be entirely blocked out by the
moon, and the fire benders will be helpless.

174
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:15,327
What are you suggesting, Sokka?

175
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:20,723
That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation.
The Day of Black Sun.

176
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,985
I don't know. That would require
moving troops out of Ba Sing Se.

177
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,259
We'd be completely vulnerable.

178
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,135
You're already vulnerable. The Fire
Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls.

179
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:38,691
You can either sit back and wait for
that to happen, or take the offensive,

180
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,173
and give yourself a fighting chance.

181
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,737
Very well. You have my support.

182
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:51,801
Woo! Alright! Good work team!

183
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:57,479
Your Majesty.
I apologize for the interruption.

184
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:02,101
This is General How, He's
the leader of The Council of Five.

185
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:03,987
My highest- ranking generals.

186
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:10,386
We searched Long Feng's office.
I think we found something that will interest everybody.

187
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:17,430
There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se.
Including you kids.

188
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,935
Secret files?

189
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:20,828
Toph Bei Fong.

190
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:29,145
It's a letter from your mom. You mom's
here in the city, and she wants to see you.

191
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:34,142
Long Feng intercepted our
letters from home? That's just sad.

192
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,111
Aang.

193
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:40,003
This scroll was attached to the horn
of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.

194
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:42,210
It's from the Eastern Air Temple.

195
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:47,215
Is there a letter for me
and Sokka by any chance?

196
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,781
I'm afraid not.

197
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:52,505
Oh.

198
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:56,042
But there is an intelligence
report that might interest you.

199
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,676
A small fleet of water tribe ships?

200
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,875
What? That could be Dad.

201
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:05,862
Protecting the mouth of Chameleon
Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!

202
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:12,451
You should know this is
not a natural sickness.

203
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:15,714
But that shouldn't stop
you from enjoying tea.

204
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,999
What, what's happening?

205
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,980
You're critical decision,
what you did beneath that lake...

206
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:26,436
it was in such conflict
with your image of yourself,

207
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:31,818
that you are now at war
within your own mind and body.

208
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,293
What's that mean?

209
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:40,187
You're going through a
metamorphosis, my nephew.

210
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:45,625
It will not be a pleasant experience,
but when you come out of it,

211
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,828
you will be the beautiful
Prince you were always meant to be.

212
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:55,647
I can't believe it. There's a
man living at the Eastern Air Temple.

213
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:57,017
He says he's a Guru.

214
00:18:57,018 --> 00:19:00,056
What's a Guru?
Some kind of poisonous blowfish?

215
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,382
No, a spiritual expert.

216
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:05,447
He wants to help me take the
next step in the Avatar journey.

217
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,214
He says he can teach me
to control the Avatar State.

218
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,154
And I can't believe we
know where our Dad is now.

219
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:14,307
I know what you mean. My Mom's in the city,

220
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,850
and from her letter it sounds
like she finally understands me.

221
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:21,473
This is all such big news.
Where do we even start?

222
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:25,150
I hate to say it, but...
we have to split up.

223
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:29,183
Split up? We just found Appa
and got the family back together.

224
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,372
Now you want us to separate?

225
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:34,299
You have to meet this Guru, Aang.

226
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,299
If we're gonna invade the
Fire Nation, you need to be ready.

227
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,365
Well, if I'm going to
the Eastern Air Temple.

228
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,517
Appa and I can drop you
at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.

229
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:48,049
Someone has to stay here with the Earth
King and help him plan for the invasion.

230
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,580
I guess that's me

231
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:52,599
No Sokka, I know how badly
you want to help Dad.

232
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,359
You go to Chameleon Bay,
I'll stay here with the king.

233
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,815
You are.. the nicest.. sister.. ever.

234
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:06,918
Easy there, big brother.
Though you're right, I am.

235
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:16,951
Katara, I need to tell you something.

236
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:20,054
I've been wanting to say
it for a long time.

237
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:20,910
What is it Aang?

238
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:23,379
Katara, I...

239
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,496
Alright! Who's ready to get going
on our little men-only man trip?

240
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,187
Aang and Sokka, I wish you good journey.

241
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:36,910
Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks,
and we look forward to your return.

242
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,745
Your Majesty.

243
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,160
There are three female
warriors here to see you,

244
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,842
they're from the island of Kyoshi.

245
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,213
That's Suki!

246
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:48,807
You know these warriors?

247
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:54,051
Oh yeah. The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled
group of fighters, trust worthy too.

248
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,594
They're good friends of ours.

249
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:00,178
Then we shall welcome
them as honored guests.

250
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,359
Wait, Aang.

251
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,915
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

252
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,428
Me too.
Yeah.

253
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:20,382
Ahhh! Great! That's enough!
Ok, we love each other.

254
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:21,792
Seriously.

255
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:28,641
Ahhhh!

256
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:02,727
You see Aang, a little positive
thinking works wonders.

257
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:05,162
We got the King on our side,
we got Long Feng arrested,

258
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:08,301
and when we get back,
Suki's waiting for me.

259
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:13,889
Yeah, girls are waiting for us.
Thanks 'positive attitude'.

260
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,504
Everything's gonna work out
perfectly, from now on and forever.

261
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:32,613
Dinner. The Council of Five and
the military are loyal to the Earth King,

262
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:37,324
but the Dai Li remains
loyal to you, Long Feng, sir.

263
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:56,584
Hello? Mom? Anyone home?

264
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:05,837
Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with?!

265
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:10,999
One loud mouth little brat
who strayed too far from home.

266
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:22,703
In our hour of need,

267
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:26,159
it is with the highest honor
that I welcome our esteemed allies,

268
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,736
the Kyoshi warriors.

269
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:32,246
We are the Earth King's humble servants.
