00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:01,722
<i>Water</i>

00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:04,195
<i>Earth</i>

3
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:06,439
<i>Fire</i>

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:08,481
<i>Air</i>

5
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:12,617
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony</i>

6
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:16,945
<i>then everything changed
when the firenation attacked</i>

7
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:21,891
<i>Only the avatar mastered
all four elements could stop them</i>

8
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,971
<i>but when the world needed
him most he vanished</i>

9
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:29,027
<i>100 years passed, my brother
and I discovered the new avatar</i>

10
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,040
<i>airbinder named Aang</i>

11
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,581
<i>And although his airbinding
skill is great,</i>

12
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,413
<i>he has a lot to learn before
he is ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,043
<i>But I believe...
... Aang can save the world</i>

14
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:51,050
I can't believe we finally
made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.

15
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:56,809
I just want our new place to look nice,
in case someone brings home a lady friend.

16
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:59,468
I don't want to make a life here.

17
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:02,420
Here we are, your new home.

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,546
We need to talk to the King about the war.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,146
Your request for an audience with the Earth King is being
processed, and should be put through in about a month.

20
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:14,642
If we are going to be here for a month,
we should spend our time looking for Appa.

21
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,959
Toph, aren't you gonna to
get ready for the day?

22
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:54,783
I'm ready.

23
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,002
You're not gonna wash up?
You've got a little dirt on your...

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
everywhere actually.

25
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:04,373
You call it dirt. I call
it a healthy coating of earth.

26
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,660
Hmmm. You know what we need?

27
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,640
A girl's day out!

28
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,404
Do I have to?

29
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,036
It'll be fun.

30
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,841
The Fancy Lady Day Spa?
Sounds like my kinda place.

31
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:23,242
Are you ready for some serious pampering?

32
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,045
Sure Katara,

33
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,899
whatever you say. As long
as they don't touch my feet.

34
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:06,093
Well, that wasn't so bad.

35
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:09,265
I'm not usually into that
stuff, but I actually feel...

36
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,066
girly

37
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,067
I'm glad,

38
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,348
it's about time we did
something fun together.

39
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:21,484
Great makeup.

40
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,633
Thanks.

41
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,268
For a clown!

42
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:30,093
Don't listen to them,
let's just keep walking.

43
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:34,314
I think she looks cute. Like that time we
put that sweater on your pet poodle monkey.

44
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,485
Good one, Star!

45
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,543
Let's go Toph.

46
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,610
No, no. That was a good
one! "Like your poodle-monkey"?

47
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,224
You know what else is a good one?

48
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,958
Now that was funny.

49
00:03:56,188 --> 00:04:00,707
Those girls don't know
what they're talking about.

50
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,214
It's ok. One of the good
things about being blind is ...

51
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:07,035
I don't have to waste my
time worrying about appearances.

52
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:11,345
I don't care what I look like.
I'm not looking for anyone's approval.

53
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:12,956
I know who I am.

54
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:16,356
That's what I really
admire about you, Toph.

55
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:19,508
You're so strong and confidant
and self assured. And ...

56
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:24,273
I know it doesn't matter, but.
..you're really pretty.

57
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:26,541
I am?

58
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:27,869
Yeah. You are.

59
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,599
I'd return the compliment, but
I have no idea what you look like.

60
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,921
Thank you, Katara.

61
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:57,774
If this is for a romantic picnic,
may I suggest this lavender one?

62
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,714
No, it is not a romantic picnic,

63
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,884
but it is a special occasion.

64
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:14,391
The moonflower likes partial shade.

65
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,479
It's ok... It's ok...

66
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,989
Leaves from the vine,

67
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:37,578
falling so slow.

68
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:44,167
Like fragile, tiny shells,
Drifting in the foam.

69
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:48,246
Little soldier boy,

70
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,822
come marching home.

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,944
Brave soldier boy,

72
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,628
comes marching home.

73
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:27,022
It is usually best to
admit mistakes when they occur,

74
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,765
and to seek to restore honor.

75
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:36,464
When I am through with you kids, the window
won't be the only thing that's broken!

76
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,886
But not this time. Run!

77
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:48,235
You.

78
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:49,965
Give me all your money!

79
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:54,986
What are you doing?

80
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,464
I'm mugging you!

81
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,861
With that stance?

82
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,141
What? What are you talking about?

83
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:01,928
Just give me your money, old man!

84
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:08,002
With a poor stance you are unbalanced,
and you can be easily knocked over.

85
00:07:16,443 --> 00:07:20,960
With a solid stance, you
are a much more serious threat.

86
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:26,486
Much better!

87
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:30,739
But to tell you the truth, you
do not look like the criminal type.

88
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:34,381
I know. I'm...I'm just confused.

89
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,743
So you really think I
could be a good masseur?

90
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:40,899
Of course!

91
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:45,594
This is so great!
No one has ever believed in me.

92
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:49,298
While it is always best
to believe in one's self,

93
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,885
a little help from others
can be a great blessing.

94
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,229
Happy Birthday my son.

95
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,009
If only I could have helped you.

96
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,392
Leaves from the vine,

97
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,876
falling so slow.

98
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:39,225
Like fragile, tiny shells,
Drifting in the foam.

99
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:45,501
Little soldier boy, come marching home.

100
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:52,813
Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.

101
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:35,148
Hey there, fella. You look hungry.

102
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,378
Hm! They are hungry.

103
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:47,077
The Dai Li won't give me any money
because the kids stopped coming.

104
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:50,591
And the kids won't come
because my zoo's nasty and broke.

105
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:52,717
What kind of animal is that?

106
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:56,962
Oh, that's rabbiroo. I wish I could
get her a big open prairie like she likes.

107
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,432
I'd let her hop her way to happiness.

108
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,993
Let's do it!

109
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:04,044
Say again?

110
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,170
There's a big open space right
outside the walls of the city.

111
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:10,253
But how are you gonna transport
all these wild critters?

112
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:12,254
Don't worry. I'm great with animals.

113
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:34,494
My cab...

114
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,943
oh, forget it!

115
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,758
This was so much easier in my head!

116
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,305
But you have to open this gate!

117
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:26,817
Or what?

118
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,033
Or that!

119
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:32,404
Open the gate!

120
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:32,973
Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how
do you like your new facilities?

121
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,193
Excellent job, Avatar.

122
00:12:35,425 --> 00:12:38,245
You should think about working
with animals for a living.

123
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:41,330
Mommy, Ms. Snowflake got
out of the house again.

124
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,640
Fluffykins?

125
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,191
What are you doing down there?

126
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,370
On second thought, you should
probably stick to saving people.

127
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,279
What's this?

128
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,607
Through all the long night,

129
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:19,450
winter moon glows with bright love,

130
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:22,636
sleet her silver tears.

131
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,324
Poetry.

132
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:31,886
I am so sorry.

133
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:35,111
Something struck me in the rear.

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
I just "wound up" here?

135
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:50,520
Five seven then five,
syllables mark a Haiku,

136
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,877
remarkable oaf.

137
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,060
They call me Sokka,

138
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,636
that is in the water tribe,

139
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,871
I am not an oaf.

140
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:10,335
Chittering monkey, in the spring he
climbs treetops, and thinks himself tall.

141
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,780
You think you're so smart, with your
fancy little words, this is not so hard.

142
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:23,153
Whole seasons are spent mastering the form,

143
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,154
the style, none calls it easy!

144
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:31,003
I calls it easy! Like I paddle
my canoe, I'll paddle yours too!

145
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:42,334
There's nuts and there's fruits, in fall the
clinging plumb drops, always to be squashed.

146
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:51,888
Squish-squash, sling that slang. I'm always
right back at ya, like my... Boomerang.

147
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:05,414
That's right I'm Sokka, it's pronounced
with an "okka", young ladies, I rocked ya!

148
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,376
That's one too many syllables there, bub.

149
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,430
Poetry.

150
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,530
Uncle, we have a problem.

151
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,419
One of the customers is on to us.

152
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:43,441
Don't look now, but there is a
girl over there at the corner table.

153
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,485
She knows we're fire nation.

154
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,449
Didn't I say don't look!

155
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:48,935
You're right Zuko.

156
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
I've seen that girl in here quite a lot.

157
00:15:52,414 --> 00:15:55,414
Seems to me she has quite
a little crush on you.

158
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:56,862
What?

159
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,087
Thank you for the tea.

160
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:01,588
What's your name?

161
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,060
My name's Lee.
My Uncle and I just moved here.

162
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,115
Hi Lee, my name is Jin.

163
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,994
Thank you and, well,

164
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:13,364
I was wondering if you
would like to go out sometime?

165
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,104
He'd love to!

166
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:18,505
Great! I will meet you in
front of the shop at sundown.

167
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:35,213
Hey. Well, look at you. You look so cute!

168
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
It took my Uncle ten minutes to do my hair.

169
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:46,409
So, how do you like the city so far?

170
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:47,663
It's ok.

171
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:50,123
What do you like to do for fun?

172
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:51,174
Nothing

173
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,320
Excuse me sir. Would you and
your girlfriend care for dessert?

174
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,614
She is not my girlfriend!

175
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:06,282
You have... quite an appetite for a girl.

176
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:07,718
Thanks...

177
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:13,738
So, Lee, where were you and your
Uncle living before you came here?

178
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,727
Well, we've been traveling
around for a long time.

179
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,174
Why were you traveling so much?

180
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,244
We were uh, apart of this traveling circus.

181
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,843
Really? What did you do? Wait, lemme guess,

182
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:30,820
you juggled!

183
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,530
Yes. I juggled.

184
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:37,101
I've always wanted to learn how to juggle.
Can you show me something?

185
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,247
I haven't practiced for awhile.

186
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,492
It's alright.

187
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:53,155
Hey, I want to show you one
of my favorite places in the city.

188
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:57,578
I'm so excited for you
to see the firelight fountain.

189
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,863
The lamps make the water sparkle and reflect
in the pool in the most beautiful way.

190
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,405
I can't believe it! They arn't lit.

191
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:12,681
Close your eyes and don't peak.

192
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,853
Ok. Now you can look.

193
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:42,245
What happened? How did they light?
What did you..

194
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:54,994
I brought you something.

195
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:57,281
It's a coupon for a free cup of tea.

196
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,564
Lee, this is so sweet.

197
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:06,008
Don't thank me. It was my Uncle's idea.
He thinks you're our most valuable customer.

198
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:07,389
Your Uncle is a good teacher.

199
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:12,857
I have something for you too.
Now it's your turn to close your eyes.

200
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:22,814
What's wrong?

201
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:23,865
It's complicated.

202
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,713
I have to go.

203
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,364
How was your night Prince Zuko?

204
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,600
It was nice.
