1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,339
Don't worry about Jerry.
He's gonna be fine.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,591
You hear me, Jerry?
You're gonna be fine.

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,259
- Whoa!
- Ooh, watch out for that stuff.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,928
It'll stain
if it gets on your clothes,

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,596
and it'll send you
into a murderous rage

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,264
if it gets
in your eyes or mouth.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,933
Why would you keep
mutant bacteria

8
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,601
in a pint of Cherry Garcia?

9
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,103
I know this isn't the time,
but, you know,

10
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,521
technically, the second freezer
drawer is mine.

11
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,855
- Not anymore.
- You're overreacting!

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,232
We're losing him.
All right, fine.

13
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,525
But you're
not touching my crisper.

14
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,193
- Is he going to die?
- Don't worry.

15
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,278
Dr. Glip Glop
is the best in the galaxy.

16
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,197
Hello, I'm Dr. Glip Glop.

17
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,991
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

18
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,368
Aah!

19
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,912
What?

20
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,289
Every hospital claims to have
the best doctor in the galaxy.

21
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,083
It's like those pizza places

22
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,835
that claim to have
the best pizza in the world.

23
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,545
What do you think,
they have pizza contests?

24
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,088
Have you ever been
to a pizza contest?

25
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,840
- Go in the waiting room, Dad.
- Fine!

26
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,967
Excuse me.

27
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,552
Coming through.
What are you here for?

28
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,594
Just kidding. I don't care.

29
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,306
Well, this won't do.

30
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,684
- Hey, what are you doing?
- A sequel.

31
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,186
- I don't understand.
- Yeah, me, neither.

32
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,397
We pretty much nailed it
the first time.

33
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,691
# Bounce that ass,
drop it down to the floor #

34
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,860
# Freak that nigga
'til his shit get sore #

35
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,487
# Bounce that ass
drop it down to the floor #

36
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,156
# Shake that shit
'til you can't no more #

37
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,490
# Biatch! #

38
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,832
Ooh! Ooh!

39
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,500
Ow!

40
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,670
"Man vs. Car,"
the newest hit show,

41
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:31,048
- Where it pits a man...
- Yeah!

42
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,592
Versus a car.

43
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,427
On tonight's episode,

44
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,512
Michael Jenkins fights
a regular old car.

45
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,431
Here we go.

46
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,266
Oh, he's pushing
his way through.

47
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,601
He's trying to fight that car,

48
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,352
but the car seems to have
the upper hand.

49
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,980
Oh, he's got a little bit
of pushback there.

50
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,316
Oh, no. He just got ran over...

51
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,443
and chewed up by the tires.

52
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,446
I guess that's another one
for the cars.

53
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,325
I mean,
wouldn't the cars always win?

54
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:02,371
Samantha, I need to know
that you understand

55
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,625
that I have a couple
of eyeholes.

56
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,627
I do. I do understand
about your eyeholes.

57
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,296
Here, look at my eyeholes.

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,300
Oh, my god.
You have eight eye ho... holes.

59
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,720
Ohh, I'm looking through
your eyeholes.

60
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,722
Yes, look through my eyeholes.

61
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,022
I'm the Eyehole... Man.

62
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:32,443
I'm the only one that's
allowed to have Eyeholes.

63
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,905
Get up on out of here
with my Eyeholes.

64
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,907
Eyeholes. Get them today.

65
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,617
You gotta be careful, Morty.

66
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,452
If that guy catches you
with a box of his Eyeholes,

67
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,120
he comes bursting in
through a window

68
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,789
and just starts
kicking the shit out of you.

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,457
But it's worth the risk.

70
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,125
They melt in your mouth, Morty.
They're delicious.

71
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,044
Dad, I can't believe
you're explaining alien cereal.

72
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,505
- We're worried about Jerry.
- Well, you're 39 years too late,

73
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,382
or, you know, however old he is.

74
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,967
Is he... Is he 50?

75
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,844
Jesus Christ, Beth,
is... Is Jerry 50?

76
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,471
Where am I?

77
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,850
Relax, Mr. Smith.
You're in an alien hospital.

78
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,685
I mean, to you,
it's an alien hospital.

79
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,353
To me,
you're just in a hospital.

80
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,688
There's another matter
we need to discuss with you.

81
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,772
Okay.

82
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,607
An hour ago, Shrimply Pibbles,

83
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,360
the galaxy's most influential
civil rights leader,

84
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,737
was brought to this hospital's
emergency room,

85
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,073
where he is currently fighting
for his life.

86
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,199
My god.

87
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:24,078
Mr. Smith, Shrimply Pibbles'
life can be saved

88
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,957
if we replace
his heart with your human penis.

89
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,500
I see. Wait, what?

90
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,377
It's perfect.

91
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,962
The configuration of veins,

92
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,423
the ratio of thickness
to elasticity,

93
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,717
the delicate asymmetry
of what you call your balls,

94
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,595
and with relatively
few adjustments,

95
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,264
your genitals can be molded
into a functioning heart

96
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,142
for the most important man
in the universe.

97
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,060
- Yeah, but... I mean...
- Oh, forget it!

98
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,021
I told you this was
a waste of time!

99
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,606
Have respect, Yarp.

100
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,608
The Earth man's world
is tiny and undeveloped.

101
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,860
He knows nothing
of the genocides of Clorgon

102
00:03:56,111 --> 00:04:00,740
or the tragic events
of 65.3432.23/14.

103
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,660
And even if he did,
he wouldn't comprehend them.

104
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,871
I've dwelt among the humans.

105
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,917
Their entire culture
is built around their penises.

106
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,044
It's funny to say
they are small.

107
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,379
It's funny to say they are big.

108
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,881
I've been at parties

109
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:21,052
where humans have held
bottles, pencils, thermoses

110
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,763
in front of themselves
and called out,

111
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,642
"Hey, look at me.
I'm Mr. So-And-So-Dick.

112
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,436
I've got such-and-such
for a penis."

113
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,939
I never saw it fail
to get a laugh.

114
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,482
All right! That's enough!

115
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,233
You guys are talking
about my species.

116
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,236
We understand genocide.
We do it sometimes.

117
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,905
Then you would give your penis

118
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,490
so that Shrimply Pibbles
might live?

119
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,492
- Stop asking!
- Yes, I will!

120
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,160
That's right, assholes.

121
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,703
Take my penis. Take it all!

122
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,038
And tell Shrimply Pibbles

123
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,374
that when the galaxy
came calling,

124
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,668
Jerry Smith from Earth
didn't flinch!

125
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,798
Hey, w-what's wrong, Morty?

126
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,341
Oh, you're worried
about your dad, huh?

127
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,634
Huh? Oh, no, no, no.

128
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,344
I'm just... I'm just looking

129
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,346
at that lady over there
getting coffee.

130
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,639
What's up with her face?

131
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,058
Is she human,
or is she like Worf?

132
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,476
You know, Worf from "Star Trek,"

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,812
how he has all that shit
all over his face,

134
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,064
but he's just a human
in a costume, you know?

135
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,732
Morty, uh, let's see
what else is on, huh?

136
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,109
Okay.

137
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,111
And now we're back
to "How Did I Get Here?"

138
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,905
the only show
that makes you ask yourself,

139
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,865
"How did I get here?"

140
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,910
Here's our first person.

141
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,996
Oh. Oh, my god.

142
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,914
How did I get here?

143
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,666
Hello?!

144
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,626
How did I get here?!
Somebody, help me, please!

145
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,670
All right!

146
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,172
Holy crap! Look, it's that lady
with the shit on her face

147
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,842
like Worf from "Star Trek"
that was getting coffee!

148
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,593
How did she get there?!

149
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,429
Oh, my god, Morty,
how did she get there?

150
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,681
How did she get there?

151
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,517
Is that something
we should be concerned about?

152
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,811
Just stay away
from the coffee machine.

153
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,355
Calling all
Jan Michael Vincents.

154
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,482
Calling all
Jan Michael Vincents.

155
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,859
In a world

156
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,610
where there's eight
Jan Michael Vincents...

157
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,696
We need one Jan Michael Vincent

158
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
to Quadrant "C."

159
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,115
We need two Jan Michael Vincents

160
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,491
to Quadrant "E."

161
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,410
and 16 Quadrants,

162
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,996
There's only enough time
for a Jan Michael Vincent

163
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,748
to make it to a quadrant.

164
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,333
He can't be at two quadrants
at once.

165
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,711
Hey, Rick, who...
Who is Jan Michael Vincent?

166
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,713
Oh, man, I'm trying to
remember, Morty.

167
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,716
Jan Michael Vincents
are used up.

168
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,136
I need a goddamn
Jan Michael Vincent.

169
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,264
Is it important that we know
who Jan Michael Vincent was...

170
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,807
- In order to get this?
- Nope.

171
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,685
I refuse to send the legislation
that allows more

172
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,064
than eight Jan Michael Vincents
to a precinct.

173
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,232
This Jan-Uary,

174
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,611
it's time to Michael down
your Vincents.

175
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,364
"Jan Quadrant Vincent 16."

176
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,532
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

177
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,909
That's Jan Michaels.

178
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,702
Excuse me, nurse,
can you take my temperature

179
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,204
because I think I have

180
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,748
Jan Quadrant Vincent fever
over here.

181
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,917
All right, Morty!
You've done it.

182
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,419
So, we'll be detaching
your sexual organ at the base

183
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,339
by making incisions
here, here, and here.

184
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,465
Got it.

185
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,258
Leaving a partial length
of severed urethra

186
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,177
To be threaded through...

187
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,013
Oh, you know what, I gotta...
I gotta laugh at myself here.

188
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,807
I'm having a little laugh
at myself

189
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,600
because I just realized
I haven't run

190
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,227
this whole decision
past my wife.

191
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,437
Oh. Do you think
she'll be okay with this?

192
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,772
Oh, absolutely.

193
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,774
Beth's automatically
on board always

194
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,901
with every decision I make.

195
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,402
Hey, I'm Stealy.

196
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,072
Follow me on my adventure
through this office.

197
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,909
All right, here we go.

198
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,786
We're gonna just steal
a couple of things.

199
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,204
Excuse me. Can I help you?

200
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,331
Starting with common
office objects.

201
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,916
Hey, hey, hey! That's my stuff!

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,543
Such as staplers and pins

203
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,545
and all sorts of things like...
Such as that.

204
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,296
That's it. I'm calling security.

205
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,132
No!

206
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,597
All right, okay,
now we're in the quiet safe room

207
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,975
where none of the people
whose stuff I stole

208
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,309
can get to us.

209
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,395
Now, let's look
at all the stuff we got.

210
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,981
We got a bag of bobbish.

211
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,567
That's eight brapples.

212
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,318
We got a plumbus.

213
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,904
That's 61/2 brapples.

214
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,158
We got, uh, a...
Crushed red party cups.

215
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,368
151/2 brapples.

216
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,997
Welcome back to "Funny Songs."

217
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,874
It's all improvised.
It's very funny.

218
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,168
I need a volunteer
from the audience.

219
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,336
Um, longtime fan
of the show. Uh...

220
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,839
What do you do?
What's your profession?

221
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,966
I am a tax attorney.

222
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,510
Okay, here we go.
Hit... Hit the music.

223
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,097
# I'm a tax attorney #

224
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,765
# Oh, geez, oh #

225
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,767
# Forget about everybody else #

226
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,644
# Forget about Jesus Christ #

227
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,271
# Forget about Muhammad #

228
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,025
# Forget about, uh...
all those religions #

229
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,861
# Ba-Da-Ba-Ba-Da-Ba-Bop #

230
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,154
The end.

231
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,031
Oh, my god.
Oh, that was so, so funny.

232
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

233
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,326
Hey, um, security guards,
take him out.

234
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,952
- Get him out of here.
- What?

235
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,370
Get the orthodontist
out of here.

236
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,039
No! Why?

237
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,375
Take him out of the audience.
Kill him. Sic him.

238
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,710
Demons...

239
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,712
Suck his life out.
I don't give a shit.

240
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,839
- Smith family?
- Yes?

241
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,884
I wanted to let you all know
that Jerry is doing just fine.

242
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,886
- Yay! Called it!
- Whoo-hoo! That's good news!

243
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,472
But, uh, Mrs. Smith,
could you come with me?

244
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,434
Hi, honey,
so, here's the thing...

245
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,144
These guys...
They want to completely

246
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,897
remove my penis and use it
as an alien's heart.

247
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,066
And we just need you
to sign off on it.

248
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,651
- What?!
- Uh-Oh.

249
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,862
Maybe we got a problem here
after all, guys. Yikes.

250
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,698
His penis will be replaced
with a sophisticated prosthetic.

251
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,117
Now, there's a wide range
of options to choose from.

252
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,827
They're all in this catalogue.

253
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,080
I don't care about prosthetics.
This is insane.

254
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,998
What do you people
think you're doing?

255
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,000
I understand your feelings,
Mrs. Smith.

256
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,335
Oh, I don't think you do.

257
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,337
I bring my husband in
for emergency treatment.

258
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,005
He's gone an hour.

259
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,633
And now you want his penis,
and you hand me some... catalog.

260
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,677
It's... It's...
It's... It's... I mean...

261
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,679
Sheesh. Well, there you go.
Sorry.

262
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,931
I know it's hard to understand,

263
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,809
but on Earth, love comes first.

264
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,936
There are those that believe,
Mr. Smith,

265
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,772
that Shrimply Pibbles represents
love between all life.

266
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,816
His fate will determine

267
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,652
the fate of hundreds of billions
of sentient life-forms.

268
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,030
Whoa! Whoa.
So, billions of life-forms?

269
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,824
Hundreds of billions.

270
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,785
I mean, Jerry,
y-you didn't explain

271
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,538
the full gravity
of the situation.

272
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,373
Uh, well, Beth,
I don't think your decision

273
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,208
should be based on politics.

274
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,210
Who could argue
with a wife's decision

275
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,212
to keep her lover intact?

276
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,881
Well, I don't think that's
fair at all, Jerry. At all.

277
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,884
In fact, the whole paradigm
has sexist overtones.

278
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,970
Beth, can we talk
about this privately?

279
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,972
You know, I think
the bottom line is, Jerry,

280
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,142
if you want to keep your penis,
you should say, out loud,

281
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,144
"I prefer to keep my penis."

282
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,980
But, Beth, what kind of man
would say something like that

283
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,316
if the universe needed
his penis?!

284
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,318
Well, Jerry,
what kind of wife would I be

285
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,487
if I did anything
to stand in your way?

286
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,161
Hey, listen,
is your mouth tiny and small?

287
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,871
Then why don't you come
to Lil' Bits...

288
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,247
Lil' Bits!

289
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,999
Where the food is tiny.

290
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,751
It looks like regular food,
but really tiny.

291
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,336
You can put it in your mouth
and eat it.

292
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,795
Nothing gets stuck in your lips.

293
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,714
It's just tiny and tiny
and fits right...

294
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,716
- Fits right in.
- Lil' Bits!

295
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,720
We got tiny lasagna,
tiny pizza, tiny pie.

296
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,015
Mmm! Little, tiny fried eggs.

297
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,559
Oh, shit. We got tiny people.

298
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,685
Lil' Bits!

299
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,145
You hungry? Come on down.

300
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,730
Lil' Bits.

301
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,358
Eat some fucking shit,
you fucking stupid bitch.

302
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,068
Just kidding.

303
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,195
You've got some time to kill
before the procedure,

304
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,697
so I assume you'd like to, uh,

305
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,240
use your penis one last time.

306
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,700
Here's my computer.

307
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,577
It's got the alien internet
on it.

308
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,580
Here's some porn.

309
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,831
And there's an alien towel.

310
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,458
I actually got that
on another planet.

311
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,043
So it is an alien towel to me.

312
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,961
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

313
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,223
What is this?

314
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,224
Hmm.

315
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,393
Hey, wait a minute.

316
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,560
Oh, uh, Mr. Smith?

317
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,187
Uh, yeah, just masturbating!

318
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,980
I forgot to mention,

319
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,400
there are extensive medical
records open on my desktop,

320
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,944
and I trust you to confine
your activities...

321
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,238
- to the purely pornographic.
- Absolutely!

322
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,781
Good luck.

323
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,868
My god!

324
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,788
Mr. Pibbles,
you just wrote my penis

325
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,166
a one-way ticket
to staying on my body town.

326
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,962
It's the opposite news
with Michael Thompson.

327
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,089
Hey, everybody.
It's me, Michael Thompson.

328
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,967
Today the Pope
didn't get killed.

329
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,137
He's perfectly fine.
And he's on vacation in Aruba.

330
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,139
In other opposite news,
information...

331
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,974
Hey, Rick,
what's the deal with this guy?

332
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,976
W-Why is his body,
like, sloping off

333
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,978
to the right side
of the screen like that?

334
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,813
I don't know, Morty.
See what else is on, huh?

335
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,815
Hey, welcome
to "Cooking Things."

336
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,191
I'm Pichael Thompson.

337
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,651
Hey, wait a minute, Rick.

338
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,069
This guy's body
is, like, sloping down

339
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,654
and leaning off to screen left.

340
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,197
Oh, my god,
and his name's Pichael.

341
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,866
I'm cooking
a little bit of this.

342
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,659
I'm gonna cook
a little bit of that.

343
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh, oh, hey!
Stop tugging, Michael!

344
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,538
Oh, my god! Siamese twins!

345
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,248
They're...
They're Siamese twins!

346
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,459
You quit tugging.
I-I'm in the middle of my news.

347
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,377
Oh, oh, it's always about you,
isn't it?

348
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,546
Can you believe this guy,
ladies and gentlemen?

349
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,007
He's got his own news show.
He's got a normal name.

350
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,967
- Hey, flip back to the news.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

351
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,969
You could tell our parents
started with naming with him.

352
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,847
It's like, "oh, Michael."
They had that one planned...

353
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,557
before they even got
pregnant, I bet.

354
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't want to be that girl,

355
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,602
but maybe there would be
less conflict

356
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,145
if they didn't shoot their shows
at the same time.

357
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,313
Oh, Summer, you have no idea

358
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,981
how much money
that must save production.

359
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,816
And then they found out
I was attached,

360
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,568
along for the ride,
and they said, "ah, shit."

361
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,445
Well, just fuck it,
call him Pichael."

362
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,864
Fuck you, Pichael.
You're a fucking piece of shit.

363
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,993
Good afternoon.

364
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,703
I know all of you are wondering

365
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,331
about the condition
of our dear, beloved Pibbles.

366
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,918
Which would you prefer between
the XP-20 and the XP-20 XS?

367
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,420
I prefer my own penis,
and so should you!

368
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,881
The brave Earth man
whose sacrifice

369
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,717
is going to allow
Shrimply Pibbles to live...

370
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,843
Mr. Jerry Smith.

371
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,846
Hello, everyone!

372
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,182
Let's hear it again
for Shrimply Pibbles, huh?

373
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,934
He's a good guy, isn't he?

374
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,062
I've only just been learning
about his accomplishments,

375
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,272
from his march
on Flirk Blirk Square

376
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,067
to his ongoing battle
with heroin dependency.

377
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,068
He's the best.

378
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,365
Um, yeah.

379
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,243
Well, I-it occurs to me
that his heroin addiction

380
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,912
may not have been
a matter of public record.

381
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,249
You realize heroin makes up
10% of the atmosphere

382
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,876
on Shrimply Pibbles'
home planet.

383
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,212
His planet was destroyed
by Clorgon death squads.

384
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,923
He can't live outside of it
without breathing heroin.

385
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,384
Right. I know that.
I just think...

386
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,179
This guy's trying to get out of
giving away his penis!

387
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,519
Today on "How They Do It"...

388
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,187
Plumbuses.

389
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,481
Everyone has a plumbus
in their home.

390
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,318
First, they take the dinglebop,

391
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:07,114
and they smooth it out
with a bunch of schleem.

392
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,952
The schleem is then repurposed
for later batches.

393
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,161
They take the dinglebop,

394
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,163
and they push it
through the grumbo,

395
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,249
where the fleeb
is rubbed against it.

396
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,334
It's important that the fleeb
is rubbed

397
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,504
because the fleeb
has all of the fleeb juice.

398
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,965
Then a schlami shows up,

399
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,676
and he rubs it and spits on it.

400
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,219
They cut the fleeb.

401
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,930
There's several hizards
in the way.

402
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:35,017
The blamfs rub
against the chumbles.

403
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,520
And the ploobis and grumbo
are shaved away.

404
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,274
That leaves you
with a regular, old plumbus.

405
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,360
I always wondered how,
uh, plumbuses got made.

406
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,114
Hey, welcome back
to "Personal Space."

407
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,991
I'm your host Phillip Jacobs,

408
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,328
and let me tell you,
I care about my personal space.

409
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,289
Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Who's around me right now?

410
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,249
Who's around me?

411
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,461
Now, why don't we step up here
and everybody get stepped up

412
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,589
and let's get
some stepped-up personal space

413
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,007
up in this place.

414
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,133
Here we go.

415
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,385
We get a one, personal space.

416
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,179
Two, personal space.

417
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,306
Three,
stay out of my personal space.

418
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,059
Four, keep away
from my personal space.

419
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,895
Five...
get out of that personal space.

420
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,313
Six...

421
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,981
Stay away
from my personal space.

422
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,399
Seven...

423
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,817
keep away
from that personal space.

424
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,445
Eight, personal space.

425
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,114
Nine, personal space.

426
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,201
You know, I take personal space
pretty seriously,

427
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,204
up to the point that I don't
even care about this...

428
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,206
I'm not even interested
in having this skin

429
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,583
on my personal space.

430
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,752
Oh, my god!

431
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,422
Oh, it hurts!

432
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,632
Gross!

433
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,217
What an asshole!

434
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,510
Ohh, tune in next week...

435
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,262
to the best show ever,

436
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,056
the show we all grew and love...

437
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,183
"The Personal Space Show."

438
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,185
More "Personal Space"
next Tuesday at 8:00.

439
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,770
Up next, the heat is turning up

440
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,356
with Samantha and the Boys
on "The Northsiders."

441
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,794
If you could all just stop
screaming and chanting

442
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,380
and making whatever
that gesture means...

443
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,173
Excuse me. Come on.

444
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,676
Please, everyone, I have news
about Shrimply Pibbles.

445
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,011
Word of Jerry Smith

446
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,013
trying to weasel out
of his penis donation

447
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,224
has spread across the galaxy.

448
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,685
Beings everywhere
have come together

449
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,105
to offer what little they have
to help save Shrimply's life.

450
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,151
Enough to pay for a brand-new,
state-of-the-art synthetic heart

451
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,696
that will be even better
than Mr. Smith's pathetic penis.

452
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,240
Wait! That was an option
the whole time?!

453
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,742
You guys suck!

454
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,703
Yeah. We suck.
Are you still here?

455
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,455
Okay, Jerry. Let's head home.

456
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,498
I can't leave now.
Everyone hates me.

457
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,667
Unfortunately,
there's no surgical procedure

458
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,378
that can fix that.

459
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,839
Or is there?

460
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,759
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

461
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,594
- Nano-Doctor.
- Nano-Doctor.

462
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,263
- Nano-Scalpel.
- Nano-Scalpel.

463
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,723
Okay. We're ready.

464
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,308
Not so fast!

465
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,351
Mr. Smith? What are you doing?
Are you insane?!

466
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,644
I'm a good person,

467
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,522
and I demand
that you cut off my penis

468
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,025
and put it in that man's chest.

469
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,234
That's not how it works!

470
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,069
Well, you're gonna make it work.

471
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,369
I'm Octopus Man!

472
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,748
I'm Octopus Man!

473
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:49,503
I'm a marine biologist
who was bitten by an octopus.

474
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,299
And now I'm... I help people.

475
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,301
I save people.

476
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,137
I'm a troublesome
octopus person.

477
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,473
Uh-Oh. I gotta save some trouble

478
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,018
'cause here comes
a trouble mite.

479
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,770
Gross!

480
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:10,190
Does all interdimensional TV
have to rely on juvenile violence?

481
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,983
Well, Summer, maybe people that
create things aren't

482
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,694
concerned with your delicate
sensibilities, you know?

483
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,530
Maybe the species
that communicate with each other

484
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,323
through the filter
of your comfort

485
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,325
are less evolved than
the ones that just communicate!

486
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,160
Maybe your problems
are your own to deal with,

487
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,829
and maybe the public giving
a shit about your feelings

488
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,330
is a one-way ticket
to extinction!

489
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,790
Geez, Morty.

490
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,209
I take it Cathrine Hefflefinger
hasn't texted you back yet.

491
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,794
I don't want to talk about it.

492
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,546
- Okay, guys, let's go home.
- Where's Dad?

493
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,631
Breaking news...
Shrimply Pibbles is being

494
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,133
held hostage by the human
known as Jerry Smith.

495
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,927
Remove my penis!

496
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,929
- Holy crap!
- It's cool. It's fine.

497
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,931
It's gotta be from
an alternate reality, right?

498
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,684
- Are you sure?
- I don't know.

499
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,311
Do it! Do it! Remove my penis!

500
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,938
Sir, put the gun down

501
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,690
and step away from Mr. Pibbles!

502
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,525
- Jerry!
- Dad, what are you doing?!

503
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,694
I'm a good person.
I'm a good person.

504
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,696
Where did he get a gun?
Who gave him a gun?

505
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,198
That's not a gun.
That's the XP-20 XS.

506
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,492
Ah!

507
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,956
Oh, my god.

508
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,791
I'm a good person.

509
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,757
No!

510
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,969
Nooooo!

511
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,476
Hey, how's it going?

512
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,395
This is
my butthole ice cream parlor.

513
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,898
I got all kinds of ice cream...
Peanut butter and jelly...

514
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,441
vanilla...

515
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,775
chocolate...

516
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,527
and every flavor

517
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,862
served out of a butthole...

518
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,739
just like you're back home.

519
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:41,823
- Dad!
- Dad!

520
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,992
What happened? Where am I?

521
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,577
Was it all a dream?

522
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,454
No, you were shot like 50 times.

523
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,998
57. Thankfully,
you're in a super-sophisticated

524
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,583
alien hospital,

525
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,710
so it was basically like
getting a splinter removed.

526
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,879
All... All I wanted
was for everyone to like me.

527
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,631
Jerry, remember that time
you left a comment

528
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,591
underneath that YouTube video
and someone replied

529
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,635
and called you a dumbass,
so you replied and told them,

530
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,720
"it takes one to know one,"
and you stayed up all night

531
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,430
hitting "refresh"
on your browser

532
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,140
waiting for them to reply
and then you fell asleep crying?

533
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,017
I remember it differently.

534
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,561
This is like that.
You can't make people like you.

535
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,855
You just have to wait
for hating you to bore them.

536
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,065
You know, you're right.

537
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,566
I shouldn't be motivated

538
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,443
by other people's
opinions of me.

539
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,736
All right, guys, let's go home.

540
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,112
If it's all the same
to you, Rick,

541
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,656
I'd like to go to the zoo...

542
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,324
- With my family.
- What?!

543
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,159
- What are you talking about?!
- Why would we do that?!

544
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,494
It's a stupid idea!
What's the matter with you!?

545
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,162
Don't be a piece of shit, Jerry!

546
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,497
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll go home.

547
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,706
What the hell
is he talking about?!

548
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,664
- Aah!
- I'm the Eyehole Man!

549
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,499
What is going on? Aah!

550
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,960
Give me my Eyeholes!
I'm Eyehole Man!

551
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,628
That part of the cupboard
is mine, Jerry!

552
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,213
Why do you even have those?!

553
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,548
- Give me my Eyeholes!
- Help me, please!

554
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,091
Get up on out of here
with my Eyeholes!

555
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,094
Did you get any of that?

556
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,179
It's-a good-a show!
