1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,544
- Bye, mom! Bye, Dad!
- Drive carefully!

2
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:03,797
Have fun, you two.

3
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:06,467
Yes, we will have as
much fun as possible on our...

4
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:08,596
Titanic-themed getaway.

5
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,474
Let's lose the 'tude, please.

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:12,268
It's supposed to be romantic.

7
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:14,594
Speaking of disasters, Dad,
we are leaving you in charge.

8
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:16,274
I know, c-can we wrap
this up?

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,612
Morty and I have some
synthetic laser eels

10
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:19,822
oxidizing in the garage.

11
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:21,491
Hey, don't blow me off.

12
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,327
I am drawing a line, okay?

13
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:25,540
Any damage to this house
or these children

14
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,584
when we get back, and...

15
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,629
n-no more
adventures with Morty.

16
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,799
Aw, geez, Rick, if my mom's
the one saying it,

17
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:33,803
then you know it's pretty
serious this time.

18
00:00:33,887 --> 00:00:35,347
- That's right.
- Wait. What?

19
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,350
Listen, you have
my word as a caregiver,

20
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:39,270
everything's gonna be fine.

21
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:41,983
And if not, like you say, no
more adventures or whatever.

22
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,777
It's like that old song

23
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:45,822
"Blomp Blomp-a Noop Noop
A-Noop Noop Noop."

24
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:48,075
Y-You guys know that song?
From Tiny Rogerts?

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,661
You never heard of it?

26
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:52,124
You know, the black effeminate
guy from the '50s?

27
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:53,626
No-Nobody?

28
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,671
A-All right, whatever.
Look, who cares?

29
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,799
Just go on your stupid trip.

30
00:00:57,884 --> 00:01:00,219
Not one thing out of place.

31
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,188
Not a single thing.

32
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,457
Well, we're past
the point of no return.

33
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,918
I'm going to have a party.

34
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,473
I found jello. Can you
sneak your mom's vodka?

35
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,810
Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

36
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,648
Listen, you can't both be
in denial about it.

37
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,317
Okay, bye.
Summer!

38
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:03,445
You can't throw a party!
Remember what mom said?

39
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,906
Yeah, if anything
gets messed up,

40
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,312
you and Grandpa Rick get
punished.

41
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:07,569
I'm only a human being, Morty.

42
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,539
Rick, tell Summer
she can't have a party!

43
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:11,458
Uh, Summer, you can't
have a party.

44
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:13,128
Because

45
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:14,797
I'm having
a party, b-i-i-i-itch!

46
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,675
Oh, what?!
Rick, you can't!

47
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,721
What do you mean
you're having a party?

48
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,765
Are some Glip Glops
from the third dimension

49
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,894
going to come over
and play cards or something?

50
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,104
"Glip Glop?"

51
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,773
You're lucky a Traflorkian
doesn't hear you say that.

52
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,401
Is that like their
N-word?

53
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,070
It's like the N-word
and the C-word had a baby

54
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,073
and it was raised by
all the bad words for Jews.

55
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:32,951
Listen, I think the
three of us could just,

56
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,871
you know, have a nice
time, like, just hanging out,

57
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,676
and, you know, doing
a little bonding and...

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,418
Screw that.
This is my chance...

59
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:40,254
to gain some footing
with the cool kids.

60
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,717
That's why you party?
Boy, you really are 17.

61
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,887
- Why do you party?
- To get...

62
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,057
wr-wriggedy
wriggedy wrecked, son!

63
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:49,937
Just keep your sci-fi friends
away from my awesome ones.

64
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:52,232
Yeah, and you keep your
awesome friends away

65
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:54,611
from my canapes.

66
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:57,741
After dinner, Titanic2will
attach to the rail system

67
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,118
near our replica iceberg,

68
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:00,996
and the hydraulics
encased in these tubes

69
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,834
will execute a controlled sink
into the icy depths.

70
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,879
A rail system seems archaic

71
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,466
for an attraction this
impressive.

72
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,344
Are you sure the ship will sink?

73
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:12,013
I can assure you the ship
will sink,

74
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,934
as it has a thousand
times before.

75
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:17,648
It is UN-unsinkable.
Ooh!

76
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,901
Look, it's the line for the bow!

77
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:21,779
Jerry, I'd love to just
kick back

78
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,615
with a margarita and read.

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,577
Do you mind if I skip the whole
"King of the World" bit?

80
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,664
Well, it's not
the "King of the World" bit.

81
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:28,916
That's Jack and Fabrizio.

82
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,211
This is where Rose says,
"I'm flying, Jack!"

83
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,630
But whatever.

84
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:33,841
I can be the only one
to do it alone.

85
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:36,011
Well, what about her?
Excuse me, ma'am.

86
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,097
Would you like to take
my place in line?

87
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:40,475
I, uh... I could get
into trouble.

88
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:42,271
We won't tell.

89
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,400
So...
you're a Titanic fanatic?

90
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,738
Oh, yes. I've worked here
since it opened,

91
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,949
but I've never been able
to participate.

92
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,869
Happy to help... Rose.

93
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,625
I love watching bukkake.

94
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,837
I mean, like, I don't know if I
personally would ever do it...

95
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:59,882
- Brad! Hey!
- Yo.

96
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,428
Brad is here! Quick, make
my hair look drunk.

97
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:04,931
Check it out.
Tammy's already drunk.

98
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:07,644
Cool.

99
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,689
The beacon was activated.

100
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:12,527
Who is in danger?
Ugh! Grandpa!

101
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:14,072
Birdperson!

102
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,824
I am pleased there is
no emergency.

103
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,577
Oh, there's an emergency,
all right.

104
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,121
A pussy emergency!

105
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:20,999
When's the last time
you got laid, 'Pers?

106
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:24,463
It has been a... challenging
mating season for Birdperson.

107
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:26,591
Then it's time to get
your beak wet tonight, player.

108
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,756
Go have some fun out there
Birdp... Bird... Birdperson.

109
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:30,765
Oh, man, how many
people did you invite, Rick?

110
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:35,230
Uh... people?
Mm, six.

111
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,484
Yo! What up,
my Glip Glops?!

112
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,028
Oh, man!

113
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,953
Oh!

114
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:46,832
Y-Y-You know there's
a garbage, right?

115
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,129
Hey, uh, what the hell?!

116
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,923
Ooh. That's why you never
invite a Floopy Doop

117
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:55,178
and a Shmoopy Doop
to the same party.

118
00:04:58,143 --> 00:04:59,936
Oh, oh, g...
oh, that's disgusting!

119
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,301
You guys are in my parents' bed!

120
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:03,275
Oh. Sorry.
I'm not feeling too well.

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,403
I just needed to lie down
for a bit.

122
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,782
Oh. Okay. S-S-Sorry.

123
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,496
Oh, my god!
Are you kidding me?!

124
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:15,127
The thing people don't
realize about the gear wars

125
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:18,424
is that it was never really
about the gears at all.

126
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,260
Uh-huh. Yeah.
No, no, to-totally.

127
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:21,762
Rick, you gotta stop...

128
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,473
Morty!
Have you met Gearhead?

129
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,101
- Hey, how's...
- Morty here, he...

130
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,987
he would love to hear
all about the Gear Wars.

131
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:29,901
How familiar are you
with the gear wars, exactly?

132
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,820
Uh... not at all.

133
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:33,823
Oh, boy.
I envy you.

134
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:38,164
Okay, it was about
754 years ago...

135
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,596
Oh, hey, Morty! H-Have you met
my buddy Scropon?

136
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,931
Not again, Rick.

137
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,018
That last guy droned on for
20 minutes, you know?

138
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,854
And meanwhile, the whole house
is being destroyed!

139
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,690
Whoa, Morty, this guy's
entire planet was destroyed.

140
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,318
Have a little perspective.

141
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,613
Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!

142
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:00,074
Aw! Squanchy!

143
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,285
Is there a good place for me
to squanch around here?

144
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,623
Squanchy, you can
squanch wherever you want, man.

145
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:06,668
Mi casa es su casa, dawg!

146
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:09,172
All right!
I like your squanch!

147
00:06:09,257 --> 00:06:11,467
Uh, Rick, what exactly
is "squanching"?

148
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:13,303
Morty, listen...
we've had a lot

149
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,056
of really cool adventures
over the last year,

150
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,767
but it's time to relax.

151
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:18,186
Yeah, if I relax now,
there might not

152
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,647
even be any more adventures!

153
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,275
Jesus, Morty, you're
bumming me out.

154
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,944
Can't we just pretend like
everything's fine

155
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:24,655
for a few hours,
enjoy ourselves,

156
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,616
and then worry
about all this later?

157
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:28,494
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say, Rick.

158
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:30,497
You know, you like not
caring about stuff.

159
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:34,129
You know, wh-wh-what's
in this for me?

160
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:42,433
Jessica.

161
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:44,228
Knock it off, Slow Mobius!

162
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,064
Ha ha! Sorry, dude!

163
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,154
I'm just trying to show off
my powers, bro!

164
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,823
I can't believe she's here.

165
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,492
Well, what are you
doing standing here, Morty?

166
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,162
Go. Talk to her.

167
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:56,497
Tonight, the only adventure
you're on

168
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,334
is your cusping manhood.

169
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,300
Oh, Rose.

170
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:06,847
Whee!

171
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,308
Is that what I think it is?

172
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:10,393
Yes, every couple gets
to re-create Jack's drowning

173
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,272
at the end of the movie.

174
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:13,358
It's so romantic.

175
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:15,277
I can't wait to do
that with Beth.

176
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:17,155
I don't know, Jerry.
With all due respect...

177
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,241
it seems like your wife
may not be that interested.

178
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:20,660
Look!

179
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:26,295
Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.

180
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,132
Uh, sir?
There's not a problem.

181
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:31,512
What do you mean
there's not a problem?

182
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,473
The guidance system
isn't putting us

183
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,226
on a direct collision course.

184
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,231
This ship is about to completely
miss the giant iceberg!

185
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:40,442
Well, do something!
Steer into it!

186
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,696
I'm trying!

187
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:47,328
It's too late.
Ladies and gentlemen...

188
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:48,997
don't brace yourselves.

189
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,919
No! What happened?!

190
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,215
Their rail system must have failed.

191
00:07:57,429 --> 00:07:59,807
Totally gonna get laid tonight.

192
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,476
I like your feathers.

193
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,396
They are designed to attract
the attention of the female.

194
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,023
It's working.

195
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,693
Tammy, I should let you know

196
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,029
I just got out of a highly
intense soul bond

197
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,699
with my previous spirit mate.

198
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:13,245
I'm not looking to get
into a soul bond.

199
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,582
I'm just looking for...

200
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,253
I believe Birdperson can
arrange that.

201
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,924
Hey, Summer, haven't seen you
at flute practice in a while.

202
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,927
Summer, don't tell me
you're friends with her.

203
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,597
Are you kidding me?

204
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,600
I don't even know
what she's doing here.

205
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,603
Whoa. Not cool, Summer.
This is a party.

206
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,314
Everybody should be welcome.

207
00:08:32,944 --> 00:08:34,946
Oh, great. Who invited
Abradolph Lincoler?

208
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,241
I thought everyone was welcome.

209
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:38,911
It's not the same, Summer.

210
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:40,455
Lincoler is a crazed maniac...

211
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,374
just a misguided effort
of mine to create

212
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:44,100
a morally neutral
superleader by combining

213
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,048
the DNA of Adolf Hitler
and Abraham Lincoln.

214
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:50,012
Turns out it just adds
up to a lame, weird loser.

215
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,683
Rick, you brought me
into this world,

216
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:54,520
a suffering abomination

217
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:57,357
tortured by the duality
of its being.

218
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,486
But I shall finally know peace

219
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,031
when I watch the life drain
from your wretched body!

220
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:03,408
Whoa. What's up, man?

221
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,328
I have no quarrel with you, boy.

222
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,164
"Boy"?
What's that supposed to mean?

223
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,583
It's just... l-look,

224
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,463
I-I don't know how you thought
I meant it, but...

225
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't look at me, dude.

226
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:15,302
Look, I'm
half-Abraham Lincoln, so...

227
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:17,556
So I should get on my knees
and kiss your ass?!

228
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,225
Well, no, but...

229
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,229
You know?
What do I know?

230
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:23,941
That the Third Reich will reign
for a thousand years?

231
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,153
- Leave him alone, Brad.
- Stay out of this, Jessica!

232
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:28,490
Kick his ass, Brad!
Kick his ass!

233
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,745
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

234
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,706
Brad!

235
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,249
Stupid!

236
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,960
Rick!

237
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:38,256
I just did you a favor, Morty.

238
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,926
Sorry about all that.

239
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,554
Rick has some really
strange friends.

240
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:45,100
Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

241
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,103
He's always trying to prove
what a man he is.

242
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,650
I just want to find somebody
nice and sweet.

243
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,780
Jessica, can I show
you something?

244
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:57,912
- Wow! Look at all this stuff.
- Yeah.

245
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,333
This is me and my grandpa Rick's
sci-fi workshop.

246
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,918
Check this out.

247
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,424
It's beautiful.

248
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:07,427
You know, Jessica,
there's something

249
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,598
I've always wanted to tell you.

250
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,560
- What's that, Morty?
- I think you're the most...

251
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,439
No, that...
those weird sounds

252
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:18,111
coming from the closet
over there.

253
00:10:22,077 --> 00:10:23,286
- Oh, my god!
- Aah!

254
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,955
Hey, I'm squanching in here!

255
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,917
Oh, my god!
Oh, that is so disgusting!

256
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,505
Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

257
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,202
Huh.
Big star in the sky.

258
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:52,207
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

259
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,210
Giant testicle monsters.

260
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:55,629
We'll be fine! Let's party!

261
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:06,355
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

262
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,233
♪ Just shake that ass... ♪

263
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,653
I swear to god, Morty,
if it weren't for the fact

264
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:12,539
that everyone's still
having a blast in there,

265
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,492
I would be so furious
with you right now.

266
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:16,371
Oh, man.
Y-You hear that, Morty?

267
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,337
You really lucked out
with Summer o-on that one.

268
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:20,461
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?!

269
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:23,090
T-The whole house is sitting
in another dimension!

270
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,343
I-I mean, w-what the hell
are we supposed to do?!

271
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,221
M-M-Mom and Dad are gonna
kill us!

272
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:29,684
I'm losing it here, Rick!
Relax, Morty, relax!

273
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:31,270
It's gonna be fine.

274
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,565
All we have to do is go out
and find us

275
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,067
some Kalaxian crystals.

276
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,070
Oh, shit, motherfucker!

277
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,698
Kalaxian crystals, Morty,

278
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,159
just a few miles south of here.

279
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:41,703
Okay. Let's go, then.

280
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,623
W-W-We got to go get those
crystals right now, Rick.

281
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:45,626
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Morty, l-I can't go with you.

282
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,295
I got to hang back

283
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,591
and make sure everything stays
cool here, you know?

284
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,762
I mean, who knows what... what
if somebody breaks something?

285
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,724
Yeah. Me too.
I should stay.

286
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,142
You guys have any aspirin?

287
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:57,895
Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect!

288
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,816
You can take Lincoler with you.

289
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,501
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm injured.

290
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,196
Shut up, Lincoler.

291
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,491
It's the least you can do
for wrecking the living room.

292
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,995
Yeah! And, Nancy,
you should go, too.

293
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,915
What? Why... why me?

294
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:12,252
Because, uh, you're...

295
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:15,423
you're so good
at playing the flute.

296
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,429
Sorry for the inconvenience, folks.

297
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:21,600
We should resume sinking shortly.

298
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,603
In the meantime, please,
stay on the ship

299
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:26,483
and enjoy a complimentary plate
of James Cameronion rings.

300
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,653
Great. Not only is
the ship not sinking,

301
00:12:28,737 --> 00:12:30,531
but now the fourth wall
has been broken.

302
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,661
I am gonna go back
to the room to finish my book.

303
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:35,455
You should find that Lucy woman.

304
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,666
But... but...

305
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,669
You see, Jerry?

306
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,338
May I show you something?

307
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:41,966
Had everything gone as planned,

308
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,677
this entire area
would be underwater.

309
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,972
I would have liked to see it.

310
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,643
This trip has been a "Titanic"
failure.

311
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:50,730
Get it?
Ooh!

312
00:12:50,814 --> 00:12:52,983
- Draw me, Jerry.
- Oh, boy.

313
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,695
Lucy, wow.

314
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,407
Uh, this isn't
what I had in mind.

315
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,160
But it's the perfect moment.

316
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,539
We've been dreaming
about this for 16 years.

317
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:03,417
Um, not like this.
Not... not with you.

318
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,423
You are gonna draw me.

319
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:10,595
Then you're going to fuck
me in that car over there.

320
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,514
It's weird,
'cause I definitely think

321
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,517
that all men are created equal.

322
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:16,730
But, at the same time...
Okay!

323
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,900
Um, the crystals should be
really close.

324
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,444
There they are!

325
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:23,324
Wait.
Something's not right.

326
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,583
Get the crystals!
I'll handle the beast!

327
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:33,382
Prepare to be emancipated from
your own inferior genes!

328
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,762
Summer's gonna like me again.

329
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,734
Lincoler, come on!
Let's get out of here!

330
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,406
Mein journey is over, Morty.

331
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,414
I have something
important to tell you.

332
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:57,003
♪ And the gears, they turned
for a thousand years ♪

333
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,508
♪ Until the dark day
that they stopped ♪

334
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:02,511
Rick, I got them!

335
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:03,930
I got the crystals!

336
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,599
All right!
You did it, Morty.

337
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,894
Rick, wait! There's something
you need to know.

338
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,647
I couldn't have done it
without Lincoler.

339
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,013
He said that he was really sorry

340
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:12,652
and that he loves you
like a father.

341
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:14,071
He only wanted you
to accept him,

342
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,532
and he hopes that his final act

343
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:16,951
would redeem him in your eyes.

344
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:19,455
He sacrificed himself to save
all of us, Rick.

345
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,082
He died.

346
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,877
Well, at least
he didn't die in vain.

347
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:25,631
He got these crystals.

348
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:29,012
And these babies just saved
this lame-ass party!

349
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:30,556
Wubba, lubba, dub, dub!

350
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,392
Play something.
S-Somebody, play something.

351
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:34,687
Wait a minute. What?

352
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,614
♪ Put your right foot forward
and your left foot back ♪

353
00:14:40,698 --> 00:14:43,368
♪ Then slide around like
on a Nordic track ♪

354
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:45,705
♪ Move to the left.
Step to the right ♪

355
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,461
♪ Wiggle your elbows, and look
up into the light ♪

356
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,715
♪ It's the, it's the ♪

357
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,344
♪ It's the Rick dance ♪

358
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,305
♪ It's the, it's the ♪

359
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,183
♪ It's the Rick dance ♪

360
00:14:58,268 --> 00:14:59,978
Slow Mobius, hit me
with the clock beam!

361
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,448
♪ It's the, it's the ♪

362
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,700
♪ It's the Rick dance ♪

363
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,037
That's the Rick dance!
All right!

364
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:12,456
Whoa, man!

365
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:16,003
What the hell was that?!

366
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,009
I thought those crystals were
supposed to help us

367
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,384
get home or something!

368
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,638
What? No, no, no, I can get us home
whenever I want to.

369
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,100
But, listen, speaking of those
crystals, can I get the rest of them?

370
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,894
I'm starting to come down,
Morty.

371
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,774
Crystal Kalaxian is a really
strong, but fleeting high.

372
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,572
That's what I think of your
crystals, Rick!

373
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:34,408
Oh, Morty, you idiot!

374
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:36,745
Does anybody else have
any more K-Lax?

375
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,122
B-Birdperson?
Uh, Squanchy?

376
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,791
Don't squaunch at me.

377
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:42,087
All right, everybody,
party is officially over!

378
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,090
Rick, take us home now.

379
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,468
All right, fine, Morty,
you party pooper buzzkill!

380
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:47,888
Boo, boo! Morty sucks!

381
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:50,726
Boo! You suck,
whatever your name is.

382
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,729
Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

383
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,983
But these gears just
started turnin'.

384
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,861
Almost finished, Jerry?

385
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:58,906
Uh, almost.

386
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,203
I haven't quite captured
your beautiful eyes.

387
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,955
I'm sure it's good enough.
Move!

388
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,625
Every weekend,
Jacks and Roses have

389
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:07,461
their Titanic experience
in this car,

390
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:10,007
and I have to mop it up.

391
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:12,886
The floor drops out
to make it easier.

392
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,597
But now it's my turn.

393
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:17,268
We're going to get it nice
and steamy in there,

394
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:19,730
and I'm going to slam my hand
on the steam

395
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,483
and leave a nice handprint,

396
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,154
and then you're going to love
inside of me.

397
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,032
No mess. No clean.

398
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,037
Beth!

399
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,624
Bet you're glad I think
Kindles are dumb now.

400
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:35,339
I can't help
but feel a little guilty.

401
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:37,509
I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.

402
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:39,512
What does a rapist
look like exactly, Beth?

403
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,515
Is it a Slavic man
wearing a denim jacket

404
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:44,186
with a patchy beard
and the scent of cheap champagne

405
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,899
wafting over his
blister-pocked lips?

406
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:47,984
What?

407
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,572
Well, at least you got
all this free stuff.

408
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,577
Should be enough to satisfy your
Titanic Jones for a while.

409
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:57,207
I'm not going to fit.

410
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,961
Beth, listen to me.
You're going to get outta here.

411
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:01,672
You're gonna go on, and...

412
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:03,216
Jerry, just leave the door.

413
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:04,927
It's not a door, Beth.
It's debris.

414
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:06,764
I don't care.
Just leave it.

415
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeah. Okay.

416
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,114
"Cape Fear"!

417
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,700
"Cape Fear"!

418
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,703
I'm... I'm doing... I'm...
I'm going to do like

419
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:22,247
from "Cape Fear."

420
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:32,972
Hey, squanchers!

421
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:35,518
The party's squanching on
at my place!

422
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,024
- Cool.
- I'm coming, too.

423
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,902
Uh, no.
You're not squanchy enough...

424
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,863
for a squanchy party.
What?

425
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:44,574
Nancy told us
what a bitch you are.

426
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,494
Guys, seriously.
Nancy?

427
00:17:46,578 --> 00:17:48,413
Summer, you're a bad person.

428
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,584
All you care about is having
popular people like you.

429
00:17:50,668 --> 00:17:52,587
That's not what
Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

430
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,926
Well, I-it was hard to pin down
wha the stood for,

431
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,390
but it's certainly not
what he died for.

432
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:03,647
Next time I party,
I'm just gonna focus

433
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:05,650
on getting totally wrecked.

434
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,444
You're so wise.

435
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:11,075
May I assist you with that?

436
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,786
Uh, sure, yeah.
Thanks.

437
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,707
Morty, do you know what
"wubba lubba dub dub" means?

438
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,294
Uh, that's just Rick's
stupid nonsense catchphrase.

439
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:20,173
It's not nonsense at all.

440
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:22,427
In my people's tongue, it means,

441
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:24,388
"I am in great pain.
Please help me."

442
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,934
Well, I got news for you.
He's saying it ironically.

443
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,020
No, Morty.
Your grandfather is, indeed,

444
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:31,065
in very deep pain.

445
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,068
That is why he must numb
himself.

446
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,863
- Come on, um...
- Birdperson.

447
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,367
Come on, Birdperson.
Rick's not that complicated.

448
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,287
He's just a huge asshole.

449
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,916
Then why do you care so much
if you are no longer allowed

450
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,919
to continue on your adventures
together?

451
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:46,256
It appears fate has presented
you with an opportunity

452
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,009
to free yourself of Rick
forever.

453
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,638
You know what? You're right.
I shouldn't even care.

454
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:53,267
This is probably the best thing
that could have happened to me.

455
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:54,978
I'm sick of having adventures
with Rick.

456
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,481
My people have another saying...

457
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,108
"gubba nub nub doo rah
kah."

458
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:01,489
Lt means, "whatever lets you
sleep at night."

459
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,951
Guys, Mom and Dad are, like,

460
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:05,621
right around the corner.

461
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:08,458
This is your moment, Morty.
Choose wisely.

462
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:09,835
Tammy!

463
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,507
Caw!

464
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:18,975
Wow. We are so screwed.

465
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,811
- Rick, wake up.
- Huh? What? Wait? What? Stop.

466
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:22,439
Rick, you got to do
something quick.

467
00:19:22,524 --> 00:19:24,817
My parents are home.

468
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,197
Uh, all... all right.
All right. Hold... hold on.

469
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,117
Ahh! So good.

470
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,286
Oh, my god. They're walking up
the driveway.

471
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,540
- Bring me the thing.
- What... what thing?

472
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,209
The thing. The thing.

473
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:36,920
It's got, like, buttons on it
and lights on it.

474
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,464
It... it... it beeps.
Rick!

475
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,050
That describes everything
in your garage!

476
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,135
Do you mean this?

477
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:44,683
Summer for for the win.

478
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,310
All right, that should do it.

479
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,607
- Whoa! What did you do?
- Uh, s-see for yourself.

480
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,318
Whoa!

481
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:53,196
Yeah, e-everything's
frozen in time.

482
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,074
Yeah, and Slow Mobius thinks
he's all that.

483
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:56,535
For how long?

484
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,496
I don't know.
How long do you guys want?

485
00:19:58,581 --> 00:19:59,957
A week? A month?

486
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,588
Can we start cleaning the house
and see how we feel?

487
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,602
- Worst movie ever.
- Dumb.

488
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,047
Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.

489
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,469
Get it?
You know, 'cause it's frozen.

490
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:35,305
This has been so much fun.

491
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,142
Hey, Rick.
You know, this whole time,

492
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:38,811
I haven't once
heard you say that

493
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:40,481
"wubba lubba dub dub" thing
that you usually say.

494
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:41,940
Don't need to.

495
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,736
I have a new catchphrase.

496
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,572
Oh, yeah?
What... what's that, Rick?

497
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:47,742
- I love my grandkids.
- Aww.

498
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,620
Psych! Just kidding...
my new catchphrase is,

499
00:20:49,704 --> 00:20:51,665
"I don't give
a fuck!"

500
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,670
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

501
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,633

00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:05,813
That's the end, motherfucker!

506
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,108
"I don't give a fuck" is
my new catchphrase!

507
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:09,568
Fuck you!

508
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,613
That's season one! Boom!

Yeah!

511
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,383
Revenge.

512
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:52,387
What?!

513
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:57,771
Party!

514
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,315
Whoo, baby!

515
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:03,029
Please, stop!

516
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,406
Hey, brah!

517
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,409
I don't understand.
