1
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,076
Principal Vagina here...

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,206
Don't let the name fool you.
I'm very much in charge...

3
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,129
reminding you that tonight is
our annual Flu Season Dance.

4
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:41,174
I don't know how many times
I have to say this,

5
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,138
but if you have the flu,
stay home.

6
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:44,223
Hey.

7
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:46,060
The Flu Season Dance is about
awareness, not celebration.

8
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,401
You don't bring dead babies
to Passover.

9
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:53,492
Okay. Here we go.
H-Hey, Jessica. Uh...

10
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:55,538
What's up, Morty?

11
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:56,833
What are you doing?

12
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:58,545
- Um...
- Wait, wait.

13
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,758
Were you about to talk...
to her?

14
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:03,263
Well... I mean, I was
thinking about it.

15
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,309
Dude, stay in your league.

16
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:07,647
Look at how hot she is.
You don't see me going...

17
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,485
to a bigger school
in a wealthier district

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,155
and hitting on their
prettiest girl.

19
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,574
Gee, thanks, Brad.

20
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,286
I throw balls far.

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,873
You want good words?

22
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:17,585
Date a languager.

23
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:19,422
Try not to worry about it, Morty.

24
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:21,259
You're a good kid,
and there's not a premium

25
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:23,146
on that right now,
but you'll be getting girls

26
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,809
sometime after Brad's
out of shape.

27
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:26,535
You're missing the point, Dad.

28
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:29,109
I don't want girls.
I want Jessica.

29
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:31,990
Ah, well, I remember
feeling that way

30
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:34,162
about a young lady named
"your mom,"

31
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:35,623
and that's not an urban diss.

32
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:37,210
Your mom was my Jessica.

33
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:38,713
I remember the first time
I saw her.

34
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,258
I thought...
"I should get her pregnant,

35
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:41,761
and then she'll have
to marry me."

36
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:43,975
I beg your pardon, Rick...
inappropriate.

37
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,644
Sorry, please proceed
with your story

38
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,356
about banging my daughter
in high school.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,778
I'm not sure you wanna take
romantic advice from this guy, Morty.

40
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,782
His marriage is hanging
from a thread.

41
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:54,162
My marriage is fine, thank you.

42
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,791
Jerry, it's your house...
whatever you say it is

43
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,670
is how it is... but I think
a blind man could see

44
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,382
that Beth is looking
for the door.

45
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,678
I barely have a reason to care,
and even I noticed.

46
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:03,975
Come on, Rick! Don't talk
about my parents like that.

47
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,812
Listen, Morty, I hate
to break it to you,

48
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:07,482
but what people call "love"

49
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,851
is just a chemical reaction that
compels animals to breed.

50
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:12,492
It hits hard, Morty,
then it slowly fades,

51
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,497
leaving you stranded
in a failing marriage.

52
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:16,501
I did it.
Your parents are gonna do it.

53
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:17,880
Break the cycle, Morty.

54
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,759
Rise above. Focus on science.

55
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:24,727
All right, well, I'm gonna go
get dressed for the dance.

56
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,611
Yeah, I'm just going to...
check on your mom.

57
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:33,079
Morty, hand me
that screwdriver, huh?

58
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:35,918
I'm almost finished making
my ionic defibulizer, Morty.

59
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,880
It's gonna be great.
Hey, listen, Rick.

60
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,759
Y-Y-You know how you said
that, you know,

61
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,845
love is a chemical
and all that stuff from earlier?

62
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,131
Well, I was thinking, you know,

63
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,814
w-w... could you make some sort
of chemical thing happen

64
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,358
inside of Jessica's mind,
you know,

65
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,028
so where she falls in love
with me

66
00:02:49,113 --> 00:02:50,532
and all that sort of thing?

67
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,619
You know, like, some sort
of love potion or something?

68
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:54,306
Morty, that's such
a poor use of my time.

69
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,628
It's beneath me.
Hand me the screwdriver.

70
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,298
You know what?
No, Rick!

71
00:02:58,383 --> 00:02:59,927
I'm not gonna hand you
the screwdriver.

72
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,014
I-I'm not gonna hand you
anything ever again, Rick!

73
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,353
I'm always helping you with this
and that and the other thing.

74
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,524
W-W-W-W-W-What about me,
Rick?

75
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,528
W-W-W-W-Why can't you just
help me out once...

76
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:09,948
once... for once?

77
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:12,119
You're growing up fast, Morty.

78
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:15,209
You're growing into a real big
thorn straight up into my ass.

79
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:17,213
Listen, this is called oxytocin.

80
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,675
I extracted it from a vole.

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,386
Do you know what a vole is,
Morty?

82
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,140
You know what a vole is?
It's a... it's a rodent

83
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:23,852
that mates for life, Morty.

84
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,299
This is the chemical released
in a mammal's brain, you know,

85
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:27,652
that makes it fall in love.

86
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:29,990
I just gotta...
combine it with your DNA.

87
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:31,827
Oh, well, okay.

88
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,831
A hair, Morty.
I need one of your hairs.

89
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,585
This isn't
"Game of Thrones."

90
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,130
Ow!

91
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:39,137
All right, Morty, whoever
you smear this stuff on

92
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,182
will fall in love with you,
and only you, forever.

93
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,185
Are you happy now, Morty?
Heck, yeah!

94
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,272
Thank you, Grandpa Rick.

95
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:47,151
Hey, there's no...
dangers or anything,

96
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:48,696
or side effects, right?

97
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,367
W-W-W-What am I,
a hack?

98
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,621
Go nuts, Morty.
It's foolproof.

99
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:57,215
Eh, unless she has the flu.

100
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,096
Beth, do y-you still
love me?

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,518
Ugh, what kind
of question is that?

102
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,438
The "yes or no" kind?

103
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:06,944
Jerry, do you want
homeless people to have homes?

104
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,196
Yes.

105
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,282
Are you gonna build them?

106
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,409
No.

107
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:12,079
Then what good was the "yes"?

108
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:15,086
Wait, I-is loving me the house
or the homeless people?

109
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,967
Loving you is work,
Jerry... hard work,

110
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,971
like building
a homeless shelter...

111
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,892
nobody wants to say
no to doing it,

112
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:23,604
but some people put the work in.

113
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,775
So, what do you say?
Do you see me working here?

114
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,155
Does this conversation seem
tedious to me?

115
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,491
Sort of.

116
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,204
Then I obviously
sortof love you, don't I?

117
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:34,293
So stop asking, and maybe
I'll love you more.

118
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,297
Crap, they need me
at the horse hospital.

119
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:37,550
Puh! This late?

120
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:39,846
The racetrack
had a starlight derby.

121
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,391
There was a seven-horse
collision,

122
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:43,354
and Davin's there alone.

123
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:46,277
Davin. Davin.

124
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:48,490
Davin! Davin.

125
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:50,828
Davin!
Davin!

126
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:53,208

Oh, well,
n-no problem, Brad.

148
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,239
There's something special
about you, Morty...

149
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:48,658
so special.

150
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:50,663
Whoa, take it easy!
Get your hands off of him!

151
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,667

That's enough, Bradley!

153
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,008
We don't want you injuring
your ball-throwing arm.

154
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:57,511
Oh, come on,
Principal Vagina. I just...

155
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:59,766
Never leave me, Morty.
Never!

156
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,814
Uh, sure.
I mean, o-of course not.

157
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:05,319
W-What do you think that
was all about?

158
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,073
Who cares? Just hold me.

159
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:09,495
Let me go!
I love you, Morty!

160
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,334
Let go of me!

161
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,090
Morty!

162
00:06:19,517 --> 00:06:21,812
She's gonna be alone
with that guy all night.

163
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:23,817
Yeah, Dad, digging
around the insides of horses.

164
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,612
It's not a very romantic setting.

165
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:27,366
Well, Summer,
there's always the possibility

166
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:29,078
that she made the whole
work thing up.

167
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:31,082
Maybe Davin's digging around
in her insides.

168
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,046
Grandpa, so gross!
You're talking about my mom.

169
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,717
Well, she's my daughter, Summer.

170
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,220
I outrank you.

171
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:39,976
Or family means nothing, in
which case don't play that card.

172
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,771
She's not responding
to my texts!

173
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:44,234
Careful, Dad.
Jealousy turns women off.

174
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,988
Well, isn't that convenient?

175
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,783
Not for the men
they cheat on, no.

176
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:50,206
Okay, I'm...
going to go out...

177
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,542
for some ice cream.

178
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,128
And maybe
stop by the hospital...

179
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:55,091
to support my wife...

180
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:57,387
with my confidence.

181
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,601
God, Grandpa,
you're such a dick.

182
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,398
I'm sorry, Summer. Your opinion
means very little to me.

183
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:04,569
How come you're not at this
stupid dance everyone loves?

184
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:06,573
Screw that.
I don't wanna get sick.

185
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,327
It's flu season.
It is?

186
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,039
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

187
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,514
Please just let this work out.

188
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,478
Do it, Morty. Do it.

189
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:23,526
Rip my clothes off
and mate with me for life!

190
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:27,410
Um... can we maybe go
somewhere more private?

191
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,581
Jessica, get a hold of yourself!

192
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,923
You don't deserve to carry
Morty's genes.

193
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:36,137
♪ I love Morty ♪

194
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,641
♪ and I hope Morty loves me ♪

195
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,355
♪ I'd like to wrap my arms
around him ♪

196
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,652
♪ and feel him inside me ♪

197
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:45,239
Oh, crap.

198
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:49,749
Morty!

199
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,254
Morty, come on!
We gotta get you out of here.

200
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,258
You won't believe this 'cause
it usually never happens,

201
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:55,719
but I made a mistake.

202
00:07:57,223 --> 00:07:58,934
Come on, Morty.
We got to get out of here.

203
00:07:59,019 --> 00:07:59,853
Come on.
Morty!

204
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,064
Are you okay?

205
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,943
- I'm fine!
- Oh, good.

206
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:05,616
If anything ever happened to
you, I would kill myself.

207
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,787
I love you bad, Mo-Mo!

208
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,716
Morty, the principal and I
have discussed it,

209
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:17,307
a-a-and we're both insecure
enough to agree to a three-way!

210
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,735
I didn't realize
when I gave you that serum

211
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,614
that Jessica had the flu...
you know,

212
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,453
t-t-t-t-t-that might have been
valuable information for me!

213
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:28,819
What the hell is going on, Rick?

214
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,334
What does it look like?

215
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,004
T-T-T-The serum is
piggybacking on the virus.

216
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,508
It's gone airborne, Morty.

217
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:36,055
Oh, crap.
What are we gonna do, Rick?

218
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,641
It's gonna be fine,
Morty, relax.

219
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,769
I whipped up an antidote.

220
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:41,023
It's based on praying-mantis
DNA.

221
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:43,027
You know, praying mantises
are the exact opposite of voles.

222
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,364
I mean, they...
they mate once,

223
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,331
and then they, you know,
decapitate the partner.

224
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,788
I mean, it's a whole ritual.

225
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:49,917
It's really gruesome
and totally opposite.

226
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:51,337
There's no love at all.

227
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:53,800
I-I-I basically mixed this with
a more contagious flu virus.

228
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:56,347
It should neutralize
the whole thing, Morty.

229
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,059
It'll all be over very shortly.

230
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:04,616
Uh, by the way, Morty, I know
you didn't ask or anything,

231
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,620
but I'm not interested
in having sex with you.

232
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:08,332
These serums, they don't
work on anybody

233
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,751
related to you genetically.

234
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,716
Morty!

235
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:25,201
Okay, well, sometimes,

236
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:27,205
science is more art
than science, Morty.

237
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,167
A lot of people don't get that.

238
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,311
Come on.
Are you kidding me?

239
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,277
Hello!
Morty!

240
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,366
You're not Morty!
Bring us Morty!

241
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,387
Nobody's killing me...

242
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:57,644
until after I catch my wife
with another man.

243
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,982
I had sex with Billy.

244
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,819
But you were already pregnant!

245
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,406
Yeah, so what's the worst
that could happen?

246
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,287
We interrupt "Pregnant Baby"
with breaking news.

247
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,916
Come on.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,379
This just in... Morty Smith's
whereabouts are still unknown.

249
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:12,425
What the hell?

250
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,265
The only thing that is known
is... how cute he is.

251
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,853
I love him so much, I want
to make love to him

252
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,523
and then eat his head.

253
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,528
I love him more than you do,
Harold!

254
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,282
You wish, you stupid bitch!

255
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,910
- Morty's mine!
- Morty's mine!

256
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,372
Meant to be together!

257
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:29,545
Morty!

258
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,436
Where is Morty?

259
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:54,222
Oh, my god, Rick.
The whole world is infected!

260
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,436
Yeah, it's pretty wild
how fast that spread.

261
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,690
I've really outdone myself.
Outdone yourself?!

262
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:00,610
W-W... a-are... are you
kidding me, Rick?

263
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:02,239
This is not okay!

264
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,035
Not only do they all want
to have sex with me,

265
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,081
but, you know, now they want
to eat me afterwards!

266
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,500
Yeah, I don't know what
I was thinking.

267
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,254
Mantises are
the opposite of voles?

268
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:11,968
I mean, obviously, DNA's more
complicated than that.

269
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:13,346
You know what, though, Morty?

270
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,184
This right here's gonna do
the trick, baby.

271
00:11:15,268 --> 00:11:17,688
It's koala mixed
with rattlesnake, chimpanzee,

272
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:20,027
cactus, shark, golden retriever,

273
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,906
and just a smidge of dinosaur.

274
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,659
Should add up
to normal humanity.

275
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,506
I don't... that doesn't make
any sense, Rick.

276
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:27,542
How does that add up
to normal humanity?

277
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,296
What, Morty, you want me
to show you my math?

278
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,966
I'm sorry... a-are you
the scientist

279
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,845
or are you the kid
that wanted to get laid?

280
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:37,898
Well, I'm glad we saved
all those horses,

281
00:11:37,982 --> 00:11:39,902
but I'm almost sorry
we're finished.

282
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:41,489
Yes, it's satisfying work.

283
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:43,660
Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh...
it's more than the work.

284
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,165
I love being
in that sterilized room,

285
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,420
sealed off from the world.

286
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,758
It's the only time I can
really think... and feel.

287
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:54,349
Hmm, uh, what are you doing?

288
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,521
I'm playing African dream pop.

289
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,733
What do you do
after a long night?

290
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:02,784
Oh, ha, um, hey, I b...
I'd better get going.

291
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,540
Um, Jerry's been texting some
pretty high-maintenance stuff.

292
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,502
- Beth...
- What is it, Davin?

293
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:10,425
Just once, I'd like to know...

294
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,018
w-w-what it was like
to give your son a bath.

295
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,188
What?!

296
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:19,612
What does Morty's skin
smell like?

297
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,242
How soft...

298
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,663
How soft are his privates?

299
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:26,584
Let go of me, Davin!

300
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:34,601
Take me to Morty.

301
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,733
You're not Morty.

302
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:40,280
No, I'm Mr. Crowbar,

303
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:42,618
and this is my friend,

304
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:44,915
who is also a crowbar.

305
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,794
That's... stupid.

306
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:50,844
Yeah?

307
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,682
Well, look where being
smart got you.

308
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:54,686
Jerry! Thank God!

309
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,854
God?

310
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:58,945
God's turning people
into insect monsters, Beth.

311
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,116
I'm the one beating them
to death.

312
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,454
Thank me.
Thank you, Jerry.

313
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:04,873
Thank you.

314
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,596
Take a good look down there,
Morty, and soak it in,

315
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,142
because, you know,
once I pull this lever,

316
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,519
it's all back to normal.

317
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,064
Just do it already.

318
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,901
Well, technically,
Morty, there's no rush.

319
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,828
I mean, you know,
o-once it's fixed, it's done.

320
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,659
It's fixed.
You know, we could...

321
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,663
we could just enjoy it
for a little bit.

322
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,125
I mean, I-I-I-look
at how crazy it is.

323
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,795
I mean, Morty,
w-w-when's the next time

324
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,321
you're gonna see
something like this?

325
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:29,843
I mean, soak it in, you know?

326
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,513
It's... it's pretty neat.
It's pretty interesting.

327
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,120
That's it, Rick!
I'm pulling the lever.

328
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,911
W-What do we have here,
Morty?

329
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,837
Looks like I was right
and you were wrong, huh?

330
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,879
I-I-I-l-I bet you feel pretty
stupid right about now, huh?

331
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:48,758
I-I-I bet you feel like
the world's smallest man

332
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:51,055
that you were doubting me about
this whole thing, Morty.

333
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,017
Oh, Rick, something's not right.

334
00:13:53,102 --> 00:13:54,687
Yeah, you.

335
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:56,023
You're not right... ever.

336
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:57,903
No, no!
Look, you idiot!

337
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,000
Bet you're loving this, Morty.

338
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,087
This must be the best day
of your life.

339
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:29,010
You get to be the mayor
of l-Told-You Town.

340
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:31,098
You're welcome.

341
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,915
Hold on.

342
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,750
I wish that shotgun
was my penis.

343
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,715
If it were, you could
call me Ernest Hemingway.

344
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,346
I don't get it,
and I don't need to.

345
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,352
Mom! Dad!

346
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,147
Summer!

347
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:17,279
Where's Morty?

348
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:18,657
I don't know.

349
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,828
Do you think Grandpa Rick had
something to do with this?

350
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,665
It's not fair to
assume that, Summer.

351
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,712
Oh, not fair?
Give me a break.

352
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,799
He is a selfish,
irresponsible ass,

353
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,261
and he left my mother.

354
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,142
A real man stands by his woman.

355
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,867
♪ Tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo.
Tchoo-tchoo ♪

356
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,539
Boy, I really Cronenberged
the world up, didn't I?

357
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,376
We got a whole planet of
Cronenbergs

358
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,046
walking around
down there, Morty.

359
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:47,134
A-At least they're not in love
with you anymore, though.

360
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:48,971
That's a huge step
in the right direction.

361
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,267
Oh, my God!
It's a living nightmare!

362
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,814
How could you be
so irresponsible, Rick?

363
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,320
Me irresponsible?! You...
all I wanted you to do

364
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,074
was hand me
a screwdriver, Morty!

365
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,829
You're the one who wanted to
be... wanted me to buckle down

366
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:03,168
and make you up a...
roofie-juice serum

367
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:06,383
so you could roofie that
poor girl at your school.

368
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,431
I mean, g... w-w-w-w-w... w...
are you kidding me, Morty?

369
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,518
You're gonna try to take
the high road on this one?

370
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,980
Y-Y-Y-Y-You're a little
creep, Morty.

371
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,358
Y-You're a... you're...
you're...

372
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,362
you're just a little creepy...
creep person.

373
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,074
All right, fine. I should have
just listened to you

374
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:19,703
when you refused to make
the serum.

375
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:21,623
I'm willing to accept my part of
the blame for this, Rick.

376
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,335
But I'll tell you something...
you know what?

377
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,005
You gotta accept your part
of the blame!

378
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,801
I'm not the one
who fouled up the serum!

379
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,638
I'm not the one who...
who... who...

380
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,100
who haphazardly, you know,

381
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:31,770
mixed a bunch of nonsense
together

382
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,566
and created a bunch of
Cronenbergs!

383
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,945
You gotta fix this, Rick!
All right, all right, Morty.

384
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,657
You know, w-w-w-we are
in a pretty deep hole, here,

385
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,455
but I do have one emergency
solution that I can use

386
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,376
that'll kind of put
everything back to normal,

387
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,837
relatively speaking.

388
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,340
Here, Morty, put this on
while I do

389
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,344
a little bit of scouting.

390
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,708
Wow, Rick, I gotta say...

391
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:03,876
you really pulled a rabbit out
of your hat this time.

392
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,842
I mean, l-I really thought
that the whole place

393
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,721
was gonna be messed up for good,

394
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:09,683
but here, you did it...
y-y-you... you...

395
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:11,437
you figured out that crazy
solution,

396
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:12,606
like you always do.

397
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,443
Whoo!
That's some great luck.

398
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:16,448
Come on, Morty. Luck had
nothing to do with it.

399
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:19,496
I'm great.
That's the real reason.

400
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,625
Now, Morty, what do you
say, buddy?

401
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,463
Will you hand me a screwdriver

402
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:25,300
so I can finish my ionic
dis... defibulizer?

403
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:27,638
Sure thing, Rick.
Here's a screwdriver.

404
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:29,935
All right, Morty.
Thank you very much.

405
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,941
We got one screw turn...
and two screw turns...

406
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,736
and...

407
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:41,292
All right, Morty, here we are.

408
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:43,297
Oh, my god, Rick!
Is that us?!

409
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:45,259
W-W-W-We're dead!
What is going on, Rick?

410
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:46,846
I'm freaking out!

411
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,516
Calm down, Morty!
Look at me! Calm down, Morty!

412
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,227
No, I can't deal with this!

413
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:51,856
Calm yourself, Morty.

414
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,443
I can't deal with this, Rick!

415
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:54,946
- Calm down, Morty.
- This can't be real!

416
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:57,159
- You gotta calm down, Morty.
- W-W-W-W-We're ripped apart!

417
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,121
Shut up and listen to me!

418
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:00,458
It's fine.
Everything is fine.

419
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,961
There's an infinite number
of realities, Morty,

420
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:03,715
and in a few dozen of those,

421
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,761
I got lucky and turned
everything back to normal.

422
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:07,514
I just had to find one
of those realities

423
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,228
in which we also happen to both
die around this time.

424
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:11,774
Now we can just slip
into the place

425
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,360
of our dead selves
in this reality

426
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:15,030
and everything will be fine.

427
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:16,533
We're not skipping a beat,
Morty.

428
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,619
Now, help me with these bodies.

429
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:18,788
This is insane.

430
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:21,035
Look, Morty, I'll grab myself,
you grab yourself, okay?

431
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:22,463
I mean, t-t-t-that seems
fair to me...

432
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,509
I mean, that seems like
a fair way to divvy it up.

433
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:26,554
Rick, what about
the reality we left behind?

434
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,310
What about the reality where
Hitler cured cancer, Morty?

435
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:30,814
The answer is don't
think about it.

436
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:33,026
It's not like we can do this
every week, anyways.

437
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,713
We get three or four more
of these, tops.

438
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,492
Now, pick up your dead self
and come on.

439
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:37,829
Haste makes waste.

440
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,041
I-I-I don't suppose you've
considered this detail,

441
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:42,630
but obviously, if I hadn't
screwed up as much as I did,

442
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:46,555
we'd be these guys right now,
so, again, you're welcome.

he's got lifeless eyes...

457
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:30,066
black eyes, like a doll's eyes.

458
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,653
When he comes at ya,

459
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:33,657
he doesn't seem to be living
until he bites ya,

460
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,622
and then the... the blood,
and the red, and the water...

461
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,920
You ever wonder what happened
to Rick and Morty?

462
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,759
Sometimes.
But, I'm ashamed to admit,

463
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:48,397
now that they're gone,
I'm finally happy.

464
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,609
Here we are, Cronenberg Morty...

465
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:52,238
a reality where
everyone in the world

466
00:20:52,322 --> 00:20:53,700
got genetically Cronenberged.

467
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,870
We'll fit right in,
Cronenberg Morty.

468
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,334
It'll be like we never even
left Cronenberg world.

469
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,796
Yeah, Cronenberg Rick,

470
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,722
but, you know, I'm gonna miss
Cronenberg world,

471
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,345
because everyone
was Cronenberged all along

472
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,098
like us from the beginning,
you know?

473
00:21:05,183 --> 00:21:06,727
I mean, l-I wish we hadn't
genetically ruined

474
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:08,732
Cronenberg World
beyond repair like we did,

475
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,361
you know, and turned everyone
into regular, normal people

476
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:12,906
just walking around.

477
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:14,593
Don't you worry about
that sort of thing,

478
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:15,746
Cronenberg Morty.

479
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,128
Let's go make ourselves
at home, huh?

480
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:24,264
Did you get any of that?

481
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,310
It's a good-a show!
