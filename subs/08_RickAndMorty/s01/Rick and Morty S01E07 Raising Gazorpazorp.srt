1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:03,755
Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,467
for a broken defraculator.

3
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,682
That is multiphase quantum
resonator.

4
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:10,518
- Well, does it defraculate?
- Fuck no.

5
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:12,522
Then... then... then
it's a broken defraculator.

6
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:14,526
Like you would even know dick
about fraculation!

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,238
Your planet just got cellphones,

8
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,325
and the coverage still sucks!

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,453
Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.

10
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,290
So, let's say 60 smidgens.

11
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,002
I tell you what...
I'll do you a favor.

12
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:25,588
I'll throw in a fart.

13
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,592
Hey, uh, Rick, um, you think

14
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,430
maybe I could get
something from this place,

15
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,266
like a souvenir, like,
just to have...

16
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,019
like, something cool, you know?

17
00:00:33,104 --> 00:00:34,564
Not here, Morty.
We'll stop somewhere else.

18
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:36,860
Because, you know, there's
always another pawn shop.

19
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,864
Oh, okay. I just, um...

20
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:40,550
you know, I thought that
robot over there

21
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:42,370
looked pretty cool, you know?

22
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:44,834
Oh, it looks cool, huh?
That's why you want it?

23
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:46,462
Yeah!
You know, I mean...

24
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,174
it's different
from the stuff on Earth,

25
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,178
and, you know, you take me
to all these crazy places

26
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:51,722
across the galaxy,

27
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:53,728
and, you know, I don't
really have anything to...

28
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,688
to remember all those trips by.

29
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:57,691
It'd be kind of cool,
like a souvenir.

30
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,445
You know, like, what if
you passed away

31
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:00,822
or died or something?

32
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:02,618
I wouldn't even have anything
to remember

33
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:04,413
all the cool stuff
we did, you know?

34
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,416
Okay. 60
for the resonator,

35
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,172
and my grandson
wants the sex robot.

36
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:49,958
So, we're just going
to pretend this isn't happening?

37
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,045
I'm not saying that's
a bad idea... just asking.

38
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,883
Rick, why would you let Morty

39
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:56,012
bring that
thing into our house?!

40
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,472
I don't know.
What do you want from me?

41
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:59,852
He thi... he thou...
he thought it looked cool.

42
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:00,770
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,023
Whew!

44
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,533
Ahh. All right.

45
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,122
Back to... back to...
b-back upstairs.

46
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:15,423
Well, I'm intervening.

47
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:17,093
Intervening with puberty?

48
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,556
You'll turn him into
Ralph Fiennes in "Red Dragon."

49
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,687
He's at that age.
Let's just be proud of him.

50
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:25,233
Jesus. Did I really set
the bar that low?

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,531
Um, Rick, could you
come with me, please...

52
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,742
q-quickly?

53
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:33,750
Okay, now if we hear squeaking,
we intervene.

54
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,256
Where's the sex robot, Morty?

55
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,469
That is Gwendolyn...
l-I mean, the robot!

56
00:02:39,553 --> 00:02:41,975
She started beeping, transformed
and tried to fly away!

57
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:43,644
Strange... that's
usually the man's job.

58
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,356
You know what I'm talking
about, Morty?

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,234
Wubba-lubba-dub-dub!

60
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:48,737
Morty!

61
00:02:48,822 --> 00:02:50,407
That's my catchphrase, remember?

62
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,079
Remember... remember how I...
how I cemented that catchphrase?

63
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:54,498
All right.
All right, seriously, though,

64
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:55,709
let me grab this thing.

65
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,633
Come on, you... rascal.

66
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:02,723
- Okay, unacceptable! Oh.
- What is going on?

67
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,559
All right. Uh-oh.

68
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,521
"Uh-oh"? What is that?!

69
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,442
Hmm. I think Morty's robot
was designed

70
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,904
for more than long weekends.

71
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,703
Genetic compiler,
incubation chamber.

72
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,623
Yep. This here's some kind
of baby maker,

73
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,335
and that there's half Morty,
half...

74
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,339
who... who knows wh-what?

75
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:22,426
It's my bad, guys.
I'll... I'll take care of it.

76
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:24,055
- Grandpa Rick, no, no!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

77
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:25,724
What do you think you're doing?!

78
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,570
Hey, listen... you guys
quarantined the house

79
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,326
when Summer brought olives
back from Mexico.

80
00:03:29,357 --> 00:03:31,479
I mean, this thing could grow
to the size of Delaware.

81
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,865
I mean, it might eat brains
and exhale space AIDS.

82
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,702
We gotta be careful.

83
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,705
I lost the chance
to be careful, Rick.

84
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,042
I'm a father now!

85
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,920
You know, it's time for me
to be responsible.

86
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:42,757
Isn't that right...
Don't name it.

87
00:03:42,841 --> 00:03:44,761
- Morty Jr.?
- Oh, crap. He named it.

88
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,765
Well, Dad, it's a living thing,
and it's half human.

89
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,478
And it was born on American
soil, which entitles it to...

90
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,482
Jerry, majoring in
Civics was your mistake.

91
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,901
Don't punish is for it.

92
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:54,446
Fine.

93
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,243
I'm gonna take this thing
to my workshop and investigate.

94
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,247
Do not let that thing out
of your sight.

95
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:02,253
It looks harmless now,
but it could grow dangerous.

96
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:04,257
Like The Insane Clown Posse.

97
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,218
Yeah. Good one, Jerry.

98
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:08,849
2003 just called.
It wants its easy target back.

99
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,019
Ohh.
He's like a little me!

100
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:14,109
Y-You don't think he'll turn
into a monster... do you?

101
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,736
They always do.

102
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:18,074
Hey, uh, 1995 called!

103
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,578
They want their
"certain year called

104
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:21,497
wanting its 'blank' back"
formula back!

105
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,543
Why, Jerry?
Why expend the effort?

106
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:25,797
Life is effort,
and I'll stop when I die!

107
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,847
- Out.
- Whatcha doin'?

108
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:31,642
Well, I can't solve
the problem my way,

109
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,645
thanks to your family's
primitive biological hang-ups.

110
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,984
Gross. I might have just
touched one of Morty's loads.

111
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,280
But maybe I can find suitable
parents for Morty Jr.

112
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:42,120
On this robot's home world,
which is...

113
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:44,124
Gazorpazorp
in the Andromeda system.

114
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,130
Scoot, Summer.
Don't you need a new companion

115
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:49,134
now that Morty's
in the family way?

116
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,388
I don't do adventures
with chicks, Summer.

117
00:04:51,473 --> 00:04:53,391
Oh, right... because there's
something about having a wiener

118
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:55,897
that would make me better
at walking through a hole?

119
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:59,028
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Oh, crap.

120
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,989
Grandpa Rick! Ugh!

121
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:03,495
Help! Help! Aah! Aah!

122
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,087
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

123
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,756
- Grandpa Rick!
- Still think it's a good idea

124
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,343
to go through holes
without a wiener?

125
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,847
- I want to go home.
- Yeah, no duh.

126
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,308
Ugh!

127
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:20,026
Great. Now I have to take
over a whole planet

128
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,406
because of your stupid boobs.

129
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,245
- You're doing great, Morty.
- Really? You think?

130
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,081
I mean, I'm not doing
much of anything.

131
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:28,417
What do I do if it cries?

132
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,629
Then you put it down
and let it cry itself out.

133
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:33,218
Yeah, right. We tried
that technique on Summer,

134
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,431
and she's gonna end up
stripping, isn't she?

135
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:36,933
Yes, she is.

136
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,937
She's gonna strip for attention

137
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,941
because she was denied it.

138
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:43,362
Stop filling it
with your own insecurity.

139
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:45,533
You're gonna turn it
into Morty...

140
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,746
uh, mm... more...
more... more... more of you.

141
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,583
Well, we can't all be
raised like reptiles

142
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,377
by a mentally ill scientist.

143
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,214
What the... aah! Aah!

144
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,556
Listen to me. I am not
rewarding this behavior.

145
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,226
Knock it off, both of you!

146
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:01,063
G-Give me him!
Give me my baby!

147
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:02,858
You're both nuts!

148
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,404
I'm gonna raise Morty Jr.
Myself!

149
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:08,077
♪ Where's your hands?
There's your hands ♪

150
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:10,706
♪ And that's how we play
handy hands ♪

151
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:14,254
Oh, you are going
to ruin that kid, Morty.

152
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,175
At least we can agree on that.

153
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:26,319
Thanks, Dum-Dum.

154
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:28,908
I said, "Thanks, Dum-Dum."
Go get more.

155
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:30,536
Summer, put your burqa on!

156
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,540
That burqa is
a human-rights violation,

157
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:35,169
and I spent a lot on this top.

158
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:37,006
Look, I'm trying to
repair a p-portal gun

159
00:06:37,091 --> 00:06:38,426
with a bunch of sex-doll
parts,

160
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,846
and I have to do it
one-handed

161
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,932
to keep these Belushis
from carting you off.

162
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:44,103
The least you could do is be
ashamed of your gender.

163
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:46,567
Ugh. What's the deal
with this place?

164
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,361
Why is it such a sausage planet,

165
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,699
and how did such backward
idiots invent robots?

166
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,369
Obviously, at some point,

167
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,788
the Gazorpians became so evolved

168
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,335
that they replaced females
with birthing machines.

169
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,548
The resultant lack of
distraction and hen-pecking

170
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,509
allowed them to focus entirely
on war,

171
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,513
so they bombed themselves back
to the stone age,

172
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,476
and now they just fight with
each other over fake pussy

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,978
with sticks and rocks
all day long.

174
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:08,149
You think it's efficient
to get rid of women?

175
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:10,236
You ever see a line for
the men's room?

176
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,990
Are you hear... do you Li...
do you hear me, Summer?

177
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:15,121
Droppin' loads.

178
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:18,294
Droppin' loads! Droppin' loads.

179
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:22,594
The plot thickens.

180
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,436
Uh, you might want to cover
your eyes, Summer.

181
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,565
Yeah, like it was
my dream to watch.

182
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:32,446
Yeah, baby!

183
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:35,159
Summer, grab...
grab hold.

184
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:36,537
Yeah, baby!

185
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,998
Aaaah!

186
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:42,632
Grandpa Rick, where
are we going?

187
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:44,260
Well, obviously, Summer,

188
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:46,347
it appears the lower
tier of this society

189
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,633
is being manipulated through sex
and advanced technology

190
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:51,357
by a hidden ruling class.
Sound familiar?

191
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,319
Ticketmaster.

192
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:55,406
Oh, there... there we
go, Summer.

193
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,159
Hey... hey, brother.
Hey, bro.

194
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,997
Nice racket you got
going on here.

195
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:01,835
Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from
Earth dimension C-137.

196
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,089
Don't mean you any harm.
Coming in peace.

197
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:06,970
It's all cool in the, uh...
"good in the neighborhood"

198
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,308
is what I was trying to come...
is what I meant.

199
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:13,858
Oh, I get it...

200
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,405
the old behind-every-great-man
Amazon twist.

201
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,701
Silence!

202
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:24,128
- Your slave is ill-mannered.
- My slave?

203
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,132
We assume you are
from a more primitive world,

204
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:28,345
where men are still
permitted to be servants.

205
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:30,891
If he is a rogue male, tell us
now and we will kill him.

206
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,560
He's my slave.
He's my slave.

207
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,646
He's definitely my slave.

208
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,652
Ugh! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!

209
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,447
Oh, boy.

210
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,368
What's the opposite
of "wubba-lubba-dub-dubs"?

211
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,287
Am I right,
ladies and gentlemen?

212
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,708
Are you guys kidding me?

213
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,629
Oh, Morty Jr.!

214
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:48,716
You're gonna be a special
little guy, aren't you?

215
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,887
You... oh, yeah.
You're my special little guy.

216
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:52,724
Ohh.

217
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,602
Ohh! Ha ha!

218
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:55,688
DA.

219
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,191
What was that, Morty Jr.?

220
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,153
Were you gonna say, "Dada"?
Say, "Dada."

221
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,239
Death!

222
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,616
"Dada."

223
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,077
Domination!

224
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:05,164
Um... "Dada"?

225
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,168
Destruction. Domination.

226
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:09,631
Nice.

227
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:18,064
The spider in sector "C" is still alive.

228
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,068
Plan your route accordingly
and expect delays.

229
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:22,072
We're not telling you
what to do.

230
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:24,075
We're just sharing how we feel.

231
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,079
And now weather...
is anyone else cold,

232
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:28,167
or is it just me?

233
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:32,258
I am Mar-sha,
ruler of Gazorpazorp.

234
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:34,137
I am here if you need to talk.

235
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,516
- What is this place?
- Paradise.

236
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,271
We built it during the great
passive-aggression,

237
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:41,400
when the females separated
from the males

238
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:44,156
due to their increasingly
destructive behavior.

239
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,658
I am here if you need to talk.

240
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,621
I am here if you need to talk.

241
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:50,209
From here, we dispense
mechanical surrogates

242
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:51,712
to maintain our population.

243
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:55,177
Fertilized surrogates are
returned here to our nursery.

244
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,182
The females are placed
into educational programs

245
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,687
where they can discover
a service to our paradise

246
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:02,608
that fulfills them most.

247
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:04,946
Males...

248
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,619
they get to play outside.

249
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,623
That was just a baby.

250
00:10:10,707 --> 00:10:12,627
And within a day, he'll be
an adult male Gazorpian...

251
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,547
one of the most aggressively
violent creatures

252
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:15,883
in the universe.

253
00:10:15,968 --> 00:10:17,886
Wait a minute... we're here
because a male Gazorpian

254
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:20,350
was born on our planet.

255
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,944
You speak when you're
spoken to, ding-a-ling!

256
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:28,490
It's true, though... one of your
babies was born on Earth.

257
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,828
Are you the ruler of this Earth?

258
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:32,915
- How did you know?
- The quality of your top.

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,836
- Do you love it?
- I love it.

260
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,255
I'm here if you need to talk.

261
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:37,675
I'm here if you need to talk.

262
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,011
I'm here if you need to talk.

263
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,765
If the Gazorpian is male,
your Earth is in grave danger.

264
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,603
We will give you passage
back home

265
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,022
so it can be terminated.

266
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,692
But first, mojitos.

267
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,528
We don't have time for mojitos.

268
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,909
- You are insulting them.
- I don't care, Summer!

269
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,912
This place is the worst!
I want to go home!

270
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,916
Well, it really
doesn't matter what you want,

271
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,128
because this is a sane place
where women rule.

272
00:10:57,212 --> 00:10:59,132
Yeah. You know what
I have to say about that?

273
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,225
I cannot believe my ears!

274
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,572
Whoo, boy!
Who let the frogs out, huh?

275
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,660
Grandpa!

276
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:15,872
- Grandpa?
- That sounds patriarchal!

277
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,542
It means "father of father."

278
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,880
Then this one is not your slave,

279
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:22,385
and your Earth is yet
another planet dominated by men.

280
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,597
It's not dominated by us, okay?

281
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:26,476
On Earth, men and women
are equals.

282
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,983
Equals?! We make 70% of your
salary for the same job!

283
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,820
- Seize them!
- Whoa!

284
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:35,995
Was this really the time
to make that point, Summer?

285
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,459
This is for you, Daddy.

286
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,753
Oh, man!

287
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,924
Um, okay.
Listen to me, Morty Jr.

288
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,595
I've got to tell you something
very important, okay?

289
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,641
Killing is bad...
bad!

290
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:49,645
You're silly, Daddy.

291
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,899
No, Morty Jr.
I'm being serious, okay?

292
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,737
You need to put your energy
into something else.

293
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,490
I mean, what about dancing?

294
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:57,016
Would you like to learn
how to dance?

295
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,831
I'd like to dance...
on the graves of my enemies.

296
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,378
Ohh!
No, Morty Jr.!

297
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:05,885
Daddy, can I go outside?

298
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,429
No! Absolutely not!

299
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:09,558
But that's where all
the people and the animals are.

300
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,812
Yeah, but you can't
go out there because the...

301
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,816
the air is poisonous for you!

302
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,194
You will die...
you'll die instantly

303
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,114
if you ever leave this house!

304
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:18,450
You hear me?
For real?

305
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,245
For real times a million, buddy.

306
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,706
So, let's just stay inside,

307
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,710
and, you know, let's try
dancing, right?

308
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,714
Look at me. Yay! Look.
We're gonna dance.

309
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,593
Come on. Join...
dance with me here.

310
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:29,398
We love to dance.
Why do we love to dance?

311
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:31,893
'Cause I said so!

312
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:34,731
Nice.

313
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,202
So, what are you in for?

314
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:43,331
Because I got...
I got a big,

315
00:12:43,415 --> 00:12:45,210
you know, penis between my legs.

316
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,047
What... what...
what are you in for?

317
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,426
The worst crime
a female can commit.

318
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,054
Veronica Ann Bennett,

319
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,269
I find you guilty of having
bad bangs.

320
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,231
You ever notice the ones
with bad bangs

321
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:57,942
always have three names?

322
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,283
You are hereby sentenced
to the silent treatment!

323
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,664
Pfft!
This is gonna be cake.

324
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:05,833
No! Jackie!

325
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,502
Rick and Summer of Earth,

326
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,673
for the crimes of treason
against womankind

327
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:13,096
and for creating the sound
of which we do not speak

328
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,685
because it does not exist,
you are hereby sentenced to...

329
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,772
What, what, what...
a night on the couch?

330
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:19,567
- Death.
- Ooh, gerp.

331
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:21,446
I hate you so much right now.

332
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,450
This will be the first instance

333
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,454
of capital punishment
in our society

334
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,125
in 500 years due
to our awesomeness,

335
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,171
so we are forced to improvise.

336
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:33,219
We placed a large boulder
on that ledge.

337
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,848
Holy shit! Y-Y-You're gonna
crush us with a boulder?!

338
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,852
No! Stop interrupting!

339
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:39,648
The boulder falls onto a lever

340
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:41,651
that will launch...
knives.

341
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:42,819
What?

342
00:13:42,904 --> 00:13:44,657
Just give me a gun.
I'll kill myself.

343
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,327
Stop interrupting!

344
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:48,247
The knives will...

345
00:13:48,331 --> 00:13:50,627
Fine! You were right
the first time, okay?

346
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,255
The boulder crushes you.

347
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,301
I just didn't want to admit
you were right. Happy?

348
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,263
No, just ignore them.
Ignore them.

349
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:57,932
Such an asshole.

350
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,769
Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

351
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:01,575
I feel bad that I let you
drag us into this.

352
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,442
I wish I could have been
a better Grandpa to you,

353
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,113
and, you know,
for what it's worth,

354
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:07,117
that is a really nice, cute top
that you're wearing there.

355
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,953
Top. My top!

356
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:11,959
My top... the same top you
complimented earlier!

357
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:15,299
Look... look at the tag.
Read it.

358
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:18,096
It says, "Marc Jacobs."

359
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,226
Marc? Jacob?
These are names of the penis.

360
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,357
Yes.
An Earth man made this top.

361
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,153
Maybe on your planet,

362
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,782
separation of the genders is
the right thing to do,

363
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,786
but on Earth, a certain
percentage of our males

364
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,373
are born gay,

365
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,921
which is why my clothes are
better than all of yours.

366
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,466
A man made something fashionable?

367
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,472
It's true, and sometimes
the truth hurts,

368
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,184
but it must be accepted.

369
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,187
Like if I told you that
you're using

370
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:46,024
the wrong
color foundation for your skin

371
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:47,861
and it ends at your neck,

372
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,614
making you look like
a party clown.

373
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,910
Okay, ouch. Noted.
But the fact remains...

374
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,791
if you impose
Gazorpazorp's laws on Earth,

375
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,419
you're no better than the men

376
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,757
whose farts shall remain
unspoken.

377
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,761
And if you think my top is cute,

378
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:02,764
you cannot execute.

379
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,730
Very well. Give the Earth
people a spacecraft

380
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:08,734
so they may head back
to their weird planet,

381
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,865
where women are kind of equal
but not really.

382
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,868
Good job, Summer,
and thanks, girls.

383
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,580
You know, you girls are really
something,

384
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,166
I'll tell you that.

385
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,837
You know when we first
go there, I was like...

386
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,464
Give them a ship now.

387
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,847
Morty Jr.! Smoking?!

388
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,349
That is not okay!

389
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,643
What are you gonna do...
ground me?

390
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:27,937
I can't go outside anyway!

391
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:30,693
So what?!
You could do things inside!

392
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,947
You could play guitar.
You could masturbate.

393
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:35,493
I don't want to masturbate.
I want to conquer the planet!

394
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:38,166
Oh, here we go again!
You know, who do you think...

395
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,253
is gonna love you if you conquer
the planet, Morty Jr.?!

396
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,922
Love... that's all you
care about!

397
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,383
What about weapons?!

398
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,262
What about domination
of the enemy?!

399
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,228
All right, that's it...
no more History Channel!

400
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,562
This TV is for cartoons
and video games only!

401
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,610
I hate video games!
You take that back!

402
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,321
Give it to me!

403
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:56,325
Ugh!

404
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,329
I-I-I didn't mean...
I didn't mean that.

405
00:15:58,413 --> 00:15:59,999
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

406
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,504
I can't take this anymore!
I'd rather breathe poison...

407
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,508
than live another minute
with you!

408
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,845
No! No, no, no! Stop!

409
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,358
My life has been a lie!

410
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:15,445
God is dead!
The government's lame!

411
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,448
Thanksgiving is about
killing Indians!

412
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,285
Jesus wasn't born on Christmas!

413
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,914
They moved the date!
It was a pagan holiday!

414
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,917
- Oh, Dad!
- Yes, Morty?

415
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,921
My son is gonna take
over the planet,

416
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,466
and I am too young to drive!

417
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,752
Can you help me get him back?!

418
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,725
I suppose, Morty.
I suppose.

419
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:35,733
But first, a deep sip
from a very tall glass

420
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,906
of "I told you so."

421
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:44,500
Oh, my god!

It's okay!

433
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,994

- No!
- Morty!

440
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,649
That's one of the most
violently aggressive

00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:03,775
creatures in the universe!

00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:05,447

Dad, I'm so confused!

445
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:19,307
I know, Morty Jr.
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,101
I ended up lying to you
and yelling at you

447
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:23,147
just like my parents did to me.

448
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:25,568
You know, parents are just
kids having kids.

449
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,240
One minute, you like
how a shiny robot looks.

450
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,411
The next minute,
you're in a fist fight

451
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,332
with your alien son.

452
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,834
I'm an alien?

453
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,838
We all have bad
impulses, bad thoughts.

454
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,633
We just have to learn
to channel them

455
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,345
into something constructive.

456
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:41,933
But I want to murder
everyone I see.

457
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:43,770
Well, you know, I mean,
maybe there's a job out there

458
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,439
for people that feel that way.

459
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,943
Actually, there is.

460
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,905
Hi. I'm Brad Anderson,
creator of

461
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,117
the nationally syndicated
comic strip "Marmaduke."

462
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,120
You should consider being
a creative.

463
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,833
I'm haunted by uncontrollable
thoughts

464
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,586
of mutilation and sexual assault

465
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:58,422
on a near daily basis.

466
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:01,011
But, you know, I channel it
all into my work.

467
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,722
- Oh. Wow.
- Huh.

468
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,889
I never got that impression
from reading "Marmaduke."

469
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,355
Well, did you get the impression

470
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,568
I was trying to make you laugh?

471
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,949
Tell me that wasn't
Brad Anderson.

472
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,161
Aw, see?
You hear that, Morty Jr.?

473
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:16,374
Maybe you could try being
a creative of some kind.

474
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,420
Maybe!
I always have sort of wanted

475
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:20,716
to see my face
on the back of a novel.

476
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,721
I mean, what I really want to do
is slit people's throats,

477
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:24,890
but beyond that...

478
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:27,186
I know you can do it, son.

479
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,608
I think it's time I get
a place of my own.

480
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,446
I promise I'll call you
every day I need money

481
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,658
or a place to do laundry.

482
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,708
Aaaaaaah!

483
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:44,427
So, I assume this novel
your son writes

484
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,892
is gonna pay for my rear axle?

485
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,604
Isn't it interesting, Summer,

486
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,608
that after all that stuff
we just did,

487
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,774
nothing really mattered
and there was no point to it?

488
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,741
Kind of makes you wonder,
huh... about nothing?

489
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:58,162
Are you sure it doesn't
make you re-evaluate

490
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:00,416
your policy about taking
girls on adventures?

491
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,545
No. I'd say, given
what we've been through,

492
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,048
that I was right the whole time

493
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:06,052
and any epiphanies
about gender politics were

494
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,931
a projection of your feminine
insecurity.

495
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:10,477
But, hey, why don't you have
a pink spaceship?

496
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,564
Go ride around and have
a jolly old time.

497
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:14,777
Maybe that'll shut you up.
Dad? Summer?

498
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:16,405
Where were you guys
this whole time?

499
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,992
On Gazorpazorp.
Where were you?

500
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,619
I was reading a newspaper.

501
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,083
Oh, that's interesting, Beth.
You know, it's funny.

502
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,462
I-I-I heard about a little bit
of news myself.

503
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,591
Take a look.
T-Take a listen.

504
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:31,852
Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs!

505
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,604
This this world

506
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,775
still got a...
it's still got a chance!

507
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,446
Yeah! Ha ha!

508
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,073
See you... see you guys
next week!

509
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:40,618
See everybody next week.

510
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,969
Mortimer Smith, Jr.,

511
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,598
New York Times
bestselling author,

512
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:15,684
your book is about innocence,
the definition of it,

513
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:17,605
and, inevitably,
its impossibility.

514
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,442
Is it autobiographical?

515
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,694
Certainly.

516
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,617
I mean, all writing is,
in my opinion.

517
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,580
But my, uh...

518
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,336
My father kept me locked
in the house

519
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,841
until I was a teenager.

520
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,636
And there was violence

521
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,767
and, uh,
threats of poison gas...

522
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,520
but also dancing.

523
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:40,649
But you persevered
and created this masterpiece

524
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,027
from your suffering.

525
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:44,699
Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel,
"My Horrible Father,"

526
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:46,661
in every store
and on everyone's mind.

527
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:48,455
Pick it up.
We'll be right back.

528
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,042
It's a thankless job, Morty.

529
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,211
You did the best you could.

530
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:53,716
I hope he's eating enough.

531
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:56,680
Did you get any of that?

532
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,767
It's a good-a show!
