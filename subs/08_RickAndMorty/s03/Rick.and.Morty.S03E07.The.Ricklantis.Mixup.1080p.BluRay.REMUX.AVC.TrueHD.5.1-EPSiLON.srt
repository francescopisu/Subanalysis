1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,879
All right, Morty, you ready
for our adventure

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,214
to the Lost City of Atlantis?

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,590
Ready as I'll ever be, Rick.

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,550
Oh, for fuck's sake.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,053
Hello. I'm Rick K-22.
This is my Morty.

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,804
We're going from reality to reality

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,223
asking Ricks to contribute

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,934
to the Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund.

9
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:17,935
What are you, stupid?

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,520
We're done with the Citadel of Ricks.

11
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,772
I was never on board with it
in the first place.

12
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,066
That's why I murdered everyone
in charge and left it to rot.

13
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,151
Oh, that was you.

14
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,695
- They tried to murder him first.
- Aw, geez.

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,406
Well, you'll be happy to know
that the council's gone now.

16
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,158
Yeah, he knows.
<i>He</i> murdered them.

17
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,410
- You want to rein in your Morty?
- Every day.

18
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,454
The Citadel of Ricks
Redevelopment Fund donates...

19
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,623
Morty, he's not gonna donate.

20
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,124
You're pitching the Policeman's Ball

21
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,584
to a black teenager here.

22
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,211
- Let's go.
- You don't have to be a dick.

23
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,837
I think you know that's not true.

24
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,798
Geez. I didn't know there were
still Ricks and Mortys

25
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:48,799
living on the Citadel.

26
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,467
I wonder what their day-to-day
lives are like.

27
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,552
Well, you can keep wondering that

28
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,636
while we go on a fun, fresh,

29
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,846
self-contained adventure to Atlantis.

30
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,975
Anyone continuing to explore
the Citadel is either stupid

31
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,268
or one of the unfortunate millions

32
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,144
held hostage by their terrible ideas.

33
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,355

Citadel Morning News.

43
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,364
News about the Citadel in the morning,

44
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,866
pretty self-explanatory.

45
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,909
Good morning. I'm Rick D-716B.

46
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,454
- And I'm Rick D-716.
- Must be nice.

47
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,873
Coming up, gravity outages
in East Sanchez Heights.

48
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,916
And is your uranium-powered
cellular matrix

49
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,084
making you sick?

50
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,878
The answer may not surprise you.

51
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,755
It's... Yes, it's uranium.

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,090
Those stories and more
after this break.

53
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,552
60 iterations off the central finite curve,

54
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,471
there's a Rick that works
more with wood

55
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,222
than polarity plating.

56
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,392
His name is Simple Rick,
but he's no dummy.

57
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,935
He realized long ago

58
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,979
that the greatest thing
he'd ever create

59
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,230
was his daughter.

60
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,398
I love Daddy!

61
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,691
We captured that moment.

62
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,277
We run it on a loop
through Simple Rick's mind,

63
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,404
and the chemical it makes
his brain secrete

64
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,616
goes into every Simple Rick's
"Simple Wafers" Wafer Cookie.

65
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,534
Come home to the impossible flavor

66
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,078
of your own completion.

67
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,121
Come home to Simple Rick's.

68
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,999
Just one day remains before
our newly democratic Citadel

69
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,668
elects its first President.

70
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,087
It's anyone's race among
the Rick candidates.

71
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,838
But a certain other
candidate should be getting

72
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,299
at least one vote for most adorable.

73
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,177
That's right. The Morty party
candidate's still in the race,

74
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,137
and you just gotta love him for that.

75
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,056
Here you see him in his
little Morty suit waving.

76
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,266
Isn't that adorable?
Little jackass.

77
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:04,518
Uh, yeah, I think we actually have

78
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,103
the audio for his speech here.

79
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,396
"Aw, geez. Aw, man.

80
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,106
I'm gonna lose the election and stuff."

81
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,442
We had a good run, sir,

82
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,653
but I think it's time
to pull out of the race.

83
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,780
I feel pretty confident
about tonight's debate.

84
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,491
You shouldn't, sir.
You should be terrified.

85
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,618
Maybe you should find
a little faith, young man.

86
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,121
You don't pay me to have faith.

87
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,789
And we're the same age!

88
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,423
- Aah!
- Whoa!

89
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,635
Oh. Sorry. I-I was expecting...

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,636
A Rick partner?

91
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,180
Lesson one, rookie,
expect the unexpected.

92
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,640
Now, get in.

93
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,977
Mortys are human!

94
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,479
Get the fuck off the car,
you Rickless fuckin' animal!

95
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,647
- Whoa!
- The election's

96
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,232
got these yellow shirts more riled up

97
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,650
than a picture-day Jessica.

98
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,985
That's pretty harsh, sir.

99
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,653
So report me.
Nobody gives a fuck.

100
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,238
Look, I'm just saying,
it makes me a little sad

101
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,449
to hear a Morty cop
calling Mortys animals.

102
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,325
Well, it makes me sad
to hear another Rick cop

103
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,119
buying into his sensitivity training.

104
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,704
Well, I'm glad to know
there's more like me.

105
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,830
Oh, there was one.

106
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,291
Why do you think that seat was empty?

107
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,626
<i>Robbery at Fifth and Avenue.</i>

108
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,712
Fifth and... That's Morty Town.

109
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:14,713
Unit seven responding.

110
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,131
Ohh!

111
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,885
Good idea, Rick.

112
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,344
Good idea, Rick.

113
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,096
This is a great adventure.

114
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,015
This is a great adventure.

115
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,225
I love being your new Morty.

116
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,685
I love being your new Mor...

117
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,270
Farty.

118
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,189
Very amusing, Mr. Smith.

119
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,191
Almost as amusing
as when your first Rick

120
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,610
was decapitated on Zorpantheon Nine.

121
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,613
Or was that your third Rick?
How many Ricks have you had?

122
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,114
- Five.
- I see.

123
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,742
So you <i>are</i> top
of the class in something.

124
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,077
Tomorrow you'll be transferred
to your new Ricks.

125
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,163
Hopefully they will be your last.

126
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,207
Yes, Slow Ri... Tall Morty?

127
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,959
Di... Did I gradgitate this time yet?

128
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,795
Anything's possible, Tall Morty.

129
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,218
I guess we won't be seeing
each other after this, huh?

130
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,386
I say we make our last day count.

131
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,764
I say... we go to the Wishing Portal.

132
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,682
- That's a myth.
- It's not a myth.

133
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,351
My first Rick's fourth Morty

134
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,811
knew a Rick whose Morty went there.

135
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,562
If we're not here for graduation,

136
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,147
our butts are gonna
wind up in Morty Town.

137
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,358
I thought your last Rick
fused you with a lizard,

138
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,484
not a chicken.

139
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,944
Okay, fine. I'm in.

140
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,320
Me too.

141
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,949
- What the hell?!
- I thought I saw a fly.

142
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,126
Listen up, fuck nuts.

143
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,920
I've been your supervisor
for five years,

144
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,839
but all shitty things
must come to an end,

145
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,258
and I have been promoted
to regional manager.

146
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,594
Yeah, I feel the same way.
May be never meet again.

147
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,595
Of course, that makes

148
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,138
the position of supervisor available,

149
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,766
so, as of next week,
the ass you'll be kissing

150
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,309
will be that of...

151
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,895
K-83, affectionately known as Cool Rick.

152
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,231
I know I'm new to the Citadel,

153
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,400
and some of you might not
think I put in my time,

154
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,818
but what can I say?

155
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,027
I'm Cool Rick!

156
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,821
Yo! Ha! Ha! Check me out!

157
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,906
All right knuckleheads, any questions?

158
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,994
All right, then, back to work,
you gold rickers.

159
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,796
No Ricks, no families,

160
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,173
high off their asses,
and running amuck.

161
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,217
Mortys are raised to be sidekicks.

162
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,095
Without a side to kick,
they just start kicking.

163
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,639
They were...
They were about my height,

164
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,182
around 14 years old.

165
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,559
Oh, their... their shirts were yellow!

166
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,144
Yeah, make sure you get <i>that</i> down.

167
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,062
Any mutations, augmentations?

168
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,189
Uh, three eyes? A tail?
Maybe a buzz cut?

169
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,733
No. Just four normal Mortys.

170
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,651
- Normal?
- Put it in your blog.

171
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,320
Let me turn over a few rocks.

172
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,323
Aw, geez.
Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?

173
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,699
Aw, geez, man.
Nothing, man.

174
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,034
We're just hanging out and stuff.

175
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,243
I hear that. Aw, geez.

176
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,620
I guess I'm supposed to be figurin' out

177
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,038
who robbed the store across the street.

178
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,748
But, aw, geez, I don't know.

179
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,999
Aw, geez man, that sucks

180
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,417
that your Rick's making you do that.

181
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,753
He's not my Rick.
He's my partner.

182
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,171
Aw, geez.

183
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,423
Well, maybe the uniform
makes a big difference.

184
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,716
Who am I to say?

185
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,218
To me, you just look like a sidekick.

186
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,095
Call me a sidekick one more time!

187
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,722
- Call me a sidekick!
- Hey, man! Come on! Aw, geez!

188
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,265
Wanna see how I paint a wall?!

189
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,892
It was the Morty Town Locos, man!

190
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,435
The... The Morty Town Locos!

191
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,062
Aah! Aah!

192
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,064
Do you realize how many
codes you just violated?

193
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,273
Aw, geez, Rick.

194
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,942
What do I know about knowin' stuff?

195
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,777
Get in the fuckin' car.

196
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,195
More lasers.

197
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,405
You could take more time to answer
the question if you like.

198
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,701
Okay, Juggling Rick,

199
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,037
how would you solve
the Citadel's financial crisis?

200
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,373
First off, can I just say
that I believe this Citadel

201
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,625
is the greatest in the entire multi-verse.

202
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,710
Now, I believe the answer
to your question

203
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,087
has three parts.

204
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:46,049
First, education spending
must get <i>much</i> higher.

205
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,009
<i>But it has to be
balanced with defense...</i>

206
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,053
- <i>Whoa! Whoa!</i>
- Can we fact-check this please?

207
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,346
Never mind.
Who am I kidding?

208
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,722
This race is over.

209
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,558
And that's how you run a Citadel!

210
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,938
Candidate Morty, the number
of displaced Mortys is soaring

211
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,023
while Rick satisfaction
levels are plummeting,

212
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,526
and the divide between the two
groups has never been wider.

213
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,236
Solve that one real quick.

214
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,782
I don't see a divide between
Ricks and Mortys.

215
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,866
Oh, shocker.

216
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,745
I'd like to offer a re-buttal.

217
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,248
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think
we can all agree on one thing.

218
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,166
Well, it came out as two things,

219
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,793
but you get the idea.

220
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,253
You guys finished?

221
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,923
The division I see is between
the Ricks and Mortys

222
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,758
that like the Citadel divided...

223
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,343
and the rest of us.

224
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,887
I see it everywhere I go.

225
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,514
I see it in our schools

226
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,224
where they teach Mortys
we're all the same,

227
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,351
because they're threatened
by what makes us unique.

228
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,187
I see it in our streets where
they give guns to Mortys

229
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,774
so we're too busy fighting
each other to fight real injustice.

230
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,192
I see it in our factories

231
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,945
where Ricks work for a fraction
of their boss' salary

232
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,614
even though they're identical
and have the same IQ.

233
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,993
<i>The Citadel's problem
isn't homeless Mortys</i>

234
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,494
<i>or outraged Ricks.</i>

235
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,208
<i>The Citadel's problem
is the Ricks and Mortys</i>

236
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,543
<i>feeding on the Citadel's death.</i>

237
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,628
Holy shit.

238
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,006
He's headed for the flavor core!

239
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,258
<i>But I've got a message for them,</i>

240
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,219
<i>from the Ricks and Mortys
keeping it alive,</i>

241
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,347
<i>a message from the Ricks and Mortys</i>

242
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,142
that believe in this Citadel

243
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,519
to the Ricks and Mortys that don't.

244
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,647
You're outnumbered.

245
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,529
Holy shit.

246
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,740
I don't believe it.

247
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,158
I-I <i>can't</i> believe it.

248
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,494
I know. That's why you're fired.

249
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,705
Sounds like you're looking for work.

250
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,583
I can offer you a very enticing
compensation package.

251
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,627
First, let's talk benefits.

252
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,214
Daddy loves you.
That's Daddy's good girl.

253
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,465
Your life is a lie, man.

254
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,509
All your life's are lies!
Don't you get it?!

255
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,552
They told us we were special
because we were Ricks,

256
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,679
but they stripped us of everything
that made us unique!

257
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,680
We know how you feel.

258
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,516
We're working-stiff Ricks just like you.

259
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,309
But our assembly line is justice.

260
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,519
What are your demands?

261
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,937
I-I-I want a portal gun.

262
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,396
Unregistered, untraceable,

263
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,191
with enough fluid to take
me off this goddamn prison!

264
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,027
- The media's outside.
- Well, keep 'em there.

265
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,822
Anyway, so, yeah, the suspect
says the Citadel's a lie,

266
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,740
built on lies, and some other shit.

267
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,742
I say appreciate the life you have,

268
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,369
because it can always be worse.

269
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,370
Back to you, Ricks.

270
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,580
Thank you, Rick 0716-C.

271
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,124
- That fuckin' guy.
- Tell me about it.

272
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,750
Meanwhile, in election news,

273
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,670
an unexpected turn of events
as Morty from the Morty Party

274
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,255
soars to the top of the polls.

275
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,549
- Morty! Morty! Morty!
- Yes.

276
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,051
Morty, what's your original reality,
and where's your Rick?

277
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,263
Gosh, we moved around so much,
it's hard to remember.

278
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,056
I see every Rick as my Rick.

279
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,225
<i>I hope they see me as their Morty.</i>

280
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,602
Another? Please?
With less water?

281
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,104
Hey, cheer up, pal.

282
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,730
A Morty's gonna be president.

283
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,567
Imagine this kisser getting
blamed for everything.

284
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,527
I guess I should've had more faith.

285
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,280
It's not faith you need.
It's fear.

286
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,074
What's this?

287
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,201
It's secrets.

288
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,327
Wh-Wh-Wh-What do you think it is?

289
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,328
Look at how I'm dressed.

290
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>Having taken aim at the system,</i>

291
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,290
<i>are afraid at all for your safety?</i>

292
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,916
<i>I'd rather live in hope than fear.</i>

293
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,461
<i>If I had to fear anything,
I'd fear other people being afraid.</i>

294
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,671
<i>Of fear. Itself.</i>

295
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,506
<i>But, no, I'm not afraid.</i>

296
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,507
Hey, Rick, man,

297
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,260
when there's a Morty president,
you gonna lick my balls or what?

298
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,469
Sheeeet, grandson,

299
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,097
you keep me peelin' skrabquams
and slippin' nib nibs,

300
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,016
I'll lick whatever ain't nailed down.

301
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,185
Hands in the air!

302
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,020
What the hell, man?!
What the hellin' hell?

303
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,563
You guys doing a little
chemistry homework

304
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,607
- with Grandpa?
- Is this what I think it is?

305
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,983
Bootleg portal fluid.

306
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,198
I guess his math was off.

307
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,574
Search the place.

308
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,998
Are... Are you... my new... R-Rick?

309
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,499
It's okay, Morty.

310
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,548
Jesus.

311
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,050
He stabbed me.
He got me bad, Morty.

312
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,843
Shh. It's okay. You're okay.

313
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,178
You were right.

314
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,763
Everything I learned
at the academy was...

315
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,680
Doesn't matter.

316
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
Nothing's wrong with putting
your faith in a Morty.

317
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,768
You just gotta pick the right one.

318
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,353
Why is there a crib in here?

319
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,647
Something they do.
To make you feel bad.

320
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,941
Boy, I got us knee-deep
in paperwork, huh?

321
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,734
Go to the car and grab a medi-pack.

322
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,527
Let me worry about this.

323
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,620
- What happened?
- Same old story.

324
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,039
Mortys killing Mortys.

325
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,045
Almost... got it.

326
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,338
Hey!

327
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,507
Y'all get the hell away
from my damn mega fruit!

328
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,176
Sic 'em, boy!

329
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,302
I don't wear this dag-nab hat

330
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,012
and commit to this rural character

331
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,223
so you can eat for free
while you come of age!

332
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,475
I bet the Wishing Portal
leads to a reality

333
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,476
where they're... where all...

334
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,853
where it's a bunch of French
toast with boobies.

335
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,522
I bet it leads to a place
with a bunch of fry...

336
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,190
fly... flies everywhere.

337
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,984
Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere.

338
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:56,985
I bet it's a big hole

339
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,112
where the Citadel dumps
all its broken dreams.

340
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,239
Slick, why do you have
to be so dramatic?

341
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,324
You wanna know why?
Because of this.

342
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,118
I'm part of an experimental
line of Mortys

343
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,744
with a drama implant.

344
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,746
How do you think it feels, Fat Morty,

345
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,164
to know that no matter where I go,

346
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,457
I'll always be the one

347
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,960
that makes everybody sad
and a little bored?

348
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,337
Slick, that implant
isn't who you are, okay?

349
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,965
You also roll up your sleeves.

350
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,384
I thought I was Left-Handed Morty.

351
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,387
Then you should use your left hand
to eat more vegetables.

352
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,639
Hey, there. How you doing?
Great to meet you.

353
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,933
I'm a plumber, sir.
I'm a Rick, and I'm a plumber.

354
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,143
That doesn't sound like Rick work.

355
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,228
You didn't come to the Citadel
to be a plumber, did you?

356
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,563
Ha! Ha! I sure didn't, sir!

357
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,731
Mr. Morty! Mr. Morty!

358
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,941
I cloned myself so you
could kiss me as a baby!

359
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,443
This is just like a Morty baby!

360
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,531
Hey, did you, uh,
end up getting a new job?

361
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,658
Yeah, I did.
Assassinating you.

362
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,288
I'm okay. I'm okay.

363
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm...

364
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,381
Aw, man. Aw, geez. Aw, hah.

365
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,258
You look like you could
use a good time.

366
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,594
One dance for $10, two for $25.

367
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:07,096
No, thank you. And bad math.

368
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,098
Ha! Ha! Yeah! This is a good time!

369
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,267
- What is this place?
- The Creepy Morty.

370
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,144
What is it your kind's always saying?

371
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,604
"Don't think about it."

372
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,273
Come on. There's someone
important I want you to meet.

373
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,275
Ah, Bubbala!

374
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,486
How'd it go with the Morty Town Locos?

375
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,862
They had a little accident.

376
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,822
They won't be causing
any trouble anymore.

377
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,284
Those were bad Mortys.
Very bad Mortys.

378
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,037
Big Morty likes to contribute

379
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,955
to keeping the peace in Morty Town.

380
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,709
Think of him as a "drug lord"
and us as cops on his payroll.

381
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,169
- Morty...
- Which Morty?

382
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,837
M-M-My partner.

383
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,923
Morty, you're right.
Morty Town is bad.

384
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,800
But that doesn't mean
that we have to be.

385
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,635
Hey, what's going on here, Morty?

386
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,054
- Which Morty?
- The cop, morons!

387
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,597
Don't worry about Rick, Big Morty.

388
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,515
He's new.

389
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,725
He doesn't understand how it works.

390
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,186
That's what you said
about your last partner.

391
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,022
Why would you say something
like that, Big Morty?

392
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,274
You're fucking things up
for both of us here.

393
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,653
Wrong. He's fucking things up
for both of you.

394
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,072
Unless he takes the money.

395
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,574
Big Morty, you're under arrest.

396
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,910
S-Smartest man in the universe.

397
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,085
They're just props!
Th-They're just props!

398
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,005
Not so big now, are ya?

399
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,841
I never was!
It was figurative!

400
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:25,675
That's enough.

401
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,968
If we don't kill him, he'll talk.

402
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,553
If you do, <i>I'll</i> talk.

403
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,846
O-One thing's for sure.

404
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,473
Y-Y'all don't have to worry
about Cowboy Morty talkin'.

405
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,852
This little cowpoke's gonna
mosey up on out of here.

406
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,062
You told me to put my faith
in the right Morty.

407
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,730
I've got faith in you, partner.

408
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,441
Do the right thing.

409
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,026
Oh, Grandpa Rick,

410
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,945
I-I don't wanna be
on the Citadel anymore.

411
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,655
I wanna be a regular kid.

412
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,699
I-I wanna to go to school
and throw balls around

413
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,242
and masturbate.

414
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,960
What the hell happened in there?

415
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,462
Same old story.

416
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,547
Ricks killing Mortys.

417
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,216
Okay, man, okay,
we got your portal gun.

418
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,807
What the hell's he doing?

419
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,101
- Where... Where am I?
- A bad place.

420
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,811
But you're going to a better one soon.

421
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,230
Hey! Hey!

422
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,399
- No, no, no, no!
- Whaa...

423
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,400
God damn it!

424
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,319
A portal to the blender dimension?

425
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,778
That's the oldest trick in the book!

426
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,822
I'm a Rick!
I'm more Rick than any of you!

427
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,241
Then you should know you just
killed your only leverage!

428
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,826
Then comes and get me, motherfuckers!

429
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,375
Stop. I'm Rick D. Sanchez the Third,

430
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,252
owner of this here wafer establishment,

431
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,463
and I say that the Rick
in there is right.

432
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,839
He's more Rick than any of you.

433
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,090
He's a terrorist!

434
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,258
What Rick isn't?!

435
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,345
The Citadel was founded
by Ricks for Ricks to be free!

436
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,930
What's your name, young man?

437
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,140
- Rick. And I'm...
- The same age as me, I know.

438
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,434
- How long have you worked here?
- 15 years.

439
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,019
What the hell have we become?

440
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,563
Whatever time you were gonna
make him serve, he's served it.

441
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,940
It ends now.

442
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,650
- Come with me, friend.
- Where are we going?

443
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,817
To your new life.

444
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,153
Which starts with walking
the fuck out of here.

445
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,197
Yo J-22, give 'em hell!

446
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,660
There's a Rick that held
a factory hostage

447
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,704
after murdering his boss
and several co-workers.

448
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,792
The factory made cookies,
flavored them with lies.

449
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,794
He made us all take a look
at what we were doing.

450
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,463
And in the bargain, he got
a taste of real freedom.

451
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,426
We captured that taste,
and we keep giving it to him

452
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,178
so he can give it right back to you

453
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,473
in every bite of new Simple Rick
Freedom Wafer Selects.

454
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,809
Come home to the unique flavor

455
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,894
of shattering the grand illusion.

456
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,480
Come home to Simple Rick.

457
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,899
It is real.

458
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,735
After you.

459
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,411
There it is. The Wishing Portal.

460
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,121
They say for your wish to come true,

461
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,207
you have to give up
something really important.

462
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,418
For me, that's my panini maker.

463
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,087
I wish for a million sandwiches.

464
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,047
And, yes, I see the irony.

465
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,674
I guess I wish I had something cooler

466
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,301
than this dumb-ass surfer necklace.

467
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,263
I wish incest porn had...
had a more mainstream appeal.

468
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,889
For... For a friend of mine.

469
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,891
None of those things
are gonna happen, you know.

470
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,311
Morty wishes never come true.

471
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,604
Not on the Citadel.

472
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,938
Then why did you bring us here?

473
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,648
Because I wish that would change.

474
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,067
I wish anything about
this life would change.

475
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
Well, I hope you're putting something

476
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,404
pretty goddamn important in there.

477
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,697
Me too.

478
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,073
But I doubt it.

479
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,534
- No!
- Slick!

480
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,996
M-Maybe...

481
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,706
Maybe it went somewhere nice.

482
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,207
<i>Garbage dump.</i>

483
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,293
<i>Stand back.</i>

484
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,049
He had to be stopped.

485
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,551
He... He cou... He c...
couldn't be allowed to win.

486
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,470
Then you should've worked
on your aim, bro.

487
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,764
He's alive? No, no, no.
You gotta listen to me.

488
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,224
I-I worked for him.
I was his campaign manager.

489
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,310
That Morty is not what he seems.

490
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,854
Yeah, well, no Morty
seems like a president.

491
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,898
- He... won?
- Yeah.

492
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,233
It was a blowout.

493
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,860
I would hardly call it a blowout.

494
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,695
It was almost close enough
to trigger a recount.

495
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,281
Jesus. What are you,
joke security now, too?

496
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:18,949
Why am I still here?

497
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,618
I heard he confessed to everything.

498
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,870
Your case has been reviewed.
You're free to go.

499
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,831
But... I violated at least
a dozen departmental codes.

500
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,833
New department. New codes.

501
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,335
New Citadel.

502
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,421
Did we miss graduation?
Where are the new Ricks?

503
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,256
No graduation. No new Ricks.

504
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,050
The school's curriculum is changing.

505
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:36,801
To what?

506
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,219
I don't know, and I don't have to know.

507
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,303
I've been fired.

508
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,805
Good luck, turds.

509
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,432
Holy crap. Slick's wish came true.

510
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,686
Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

511
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,188
- Had a little crisis at work.
- Worth it!

512
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,606
It's no problem.

513
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,274
Uh, a little more off the top.

514
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,027
You were saying, Garment District Rick.

515
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,822
We were saying, "President" Morty,

516
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,490
that we don't care
who sits in that seat.

517
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,034
A Rick, a Morty, a goddamn Jerry,
doesn't matter.

518
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,412
We've been running the Citadel
since before the council,

519
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,372
and you'll find that we're
still running it now.

520
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,499
Does he really speak for everyone here?

521
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,250
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

522
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,043
Well, I think it's important to be clear.

523
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,878
Raise your hand if he speaks for you.

524
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,219
Is... that enough off the top?

525
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,555
I don't know. Is it?

526
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,889
- Yes, yes, goddamn, yes.
- I think it's great.

527
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,683
Good.

528
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,768
This seems like a good time for a drink

529
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,355
and a cold calculated speech
with sinister overtones.

530
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,859
A speech about politics...

531
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,527
about order...

532
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,696
brotherhood...

533
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,197
power.

534
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,533
But speeches are for campaigning.

535
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,411
Now is the time for action.

536
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:53,002
♪ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

537
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,088
♪ Ah, ah-ah ♪

538
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,759
♪ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

539
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,886
♪ Ah, ah-ah ♪

540
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,650
♪ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

541
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,653
♪ Ah, ah-ah ♪

542
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,282
♪ Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

543
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,701
♪ Ah, ah-ah ♪

544
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,346
Whoo! Yeah!

545
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,556
- Atlantis, baby!
- That was amazing.

546
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,099
You got some of that mermaid puss.

547
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,559
I'm really hoping it wasn't
a one-off thing

548
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,644
and I can see her again.

549
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,729
By the way, hey, um,
still not curious about

550
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,940
what might've happened
at that crazy Citadel place?

551
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,942
Psh. Not at all, Morty.
That place will never have

552
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,110
any bearing over our lives ever again.

553
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,363
Unlike that mermaid puss! Yeah!

554
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,823
We're going back for seconds!

555
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,533
We're gonna do that shit
every week, man!

556
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,493
- That was Atlantis!
- Oh, shit!
