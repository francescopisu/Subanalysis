1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,588
Come on, football!
Go, go!

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,091
Oh, come on.

3
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,427
Play football!

4
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,311
Aaah!

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,397
So, you're mining stuff to craft with

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:23,857
and crafting stuff to mine with?

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,776
- Uh-huh.
- Did your dad write this game?

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,819
Mean.

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,242
Gentlemen, you're needed
by a friend in Washington!

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,702
How clandestine.

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,747
If they can teleport,
why did we take...

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,415
I just work here, Steve, same as you!

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,419
All right.
All right, all right.

14
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,630
- Mr. President.
- It's about time, gentlemen.

15
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,839
Rick, do you need to drink in here?

16
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,299
- Yes.
- Here's the adventure.

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,343
Some kind of alien... googa

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,220
has infested the Kennedy Sex Tunnels.

19
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,264
I want it hunted down and taken out.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,682
Kennedy Sex Tunnels?

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,058
Naturally, you'll forget you saw them,

22
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,352
along with, in order
of national embarrassment,

23
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,521
the Truman Cocaine Lounge,
the McKinley Hooker Dump,

24
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,565
and the Lincoln Slave Coliseum.

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,358
He didn't free them all.

26
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,568
And let me know when you're done.

27
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,610
Maybe then we could get a selfie?

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,821
Too busy, Morty.
Now tell me about this summit.

29
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,448
Is it a peace one or a regular one?

30
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,085
Ugh. This sucks.

31
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,336
God, tell me about it.

32
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,838
Oh, man. If you're not into it...

33
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,673
What do you mean?
Why would I be into it?

34
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,758
- It's lame.
- You're into lame stuff, Morty.

35
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,885
I thought young dumb people
considered it an honor

36
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,096
to work for presidents
or whatever the shit.

37
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,390
Maybe the first few times,
but this just sucks.

38
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,267
He treats us like Ghostbusters.

39
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,102
- We should talk to him.
- Yeah, that sounds fun.

40
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,479
Let's set some boundaries
with a spoiled control freak

41
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,731
that thinks he runs the world

42
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,899
and orders drone strikes
to cope with his insecurity.

43
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,360
It's either that or more of this.

44
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,862
Third choice...

45
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,363
- "Minecraft."
- You like it now?

46
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,699
Got to be honest, Morty.
It's growing on me.

47
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,200
Notify the president.

48
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,620
- What do I tell him?
- Tell him the truth.

49
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,582
Tell him Rick and Morty
just blew off America.

50
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,782
You can use that wood to make a chest.

51
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,241
Oh, good.
Then I can store all this wood

52
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,868
I'll need later for chest-making.

53
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,036
Okay. You're not going to have fun

54
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,496
if you analyze everything.

55
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,747
This is what they'd rather do?

56
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,540
It's all in the transcript.

57
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,417
"Treats us like Ghostbusters."

58
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,086
So, Ghostbusters aren't cool now?

59
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,754
I don't recall signing that bill.

60
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,880
"Control freak."

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,257
"Orders drone strikes to cope with..."

62
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:56,843
"Insecurity."

63
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,261
Should we drone-strike them?

64
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,263
- That would prove him right!
- And blow him up.

65
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,473
Give me the phone.

66
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,308
Is this game popular
with autistic people?

67
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,851
Why would you say something like that?

68
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,228
'Cause I'm starting to love it.

69
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,356
"Failure to answer is a felony offense"?

70
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,357
Play it cool.

71
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,234
As far as he knows,
we're still in the tunnels.

72
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,112
When should we reveal we can see them?

73
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,655
We're holding all the cards right now.

74
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,699
We don't show any
before the time is right.

75
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:19,950
- Awesome.
- Yello?

76
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,451
Hi, guys. U.S. President calling.

77
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,911
- How's it going?
- Oh, hey.

78
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,955
Just hard at work on this
sex tunnel gagoo.

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,873
I think it's kind of our new
archnemesis, you know?

80
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,999
It might take a while.

81
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,418
What do you think, Morty, a month?

82
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,877
Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.

83
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,547
You lying dicks!

84
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,090
I see your asses playing "Minecraft"!

85
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,550
I got you on satellite!

86
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,884
That's right.

87
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,219
What do you have to say for yourselves?

88
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,138
Okay, obviously,
this looks bad, Mr. President.

89
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,556
I mean, what doesn't look bad

90
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,890
through an illegal spy satellite?

91
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,016
Don't high-road me.

92
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,727
The two of you break
1,000 federal laws a day.

93
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,478
- Wow, really?
- That's pretty cool.

94
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,814
And, yes, yes, yes, yes,
you save the world now and then.

95
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,023
America returns that favor

96
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,526
by not holding the two of you
accountable to its laws.

97
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,319
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh, God.

98
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,071
We... We didn't know
you saw it that way.

99
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,865
Well, it's nobody's fault.

100
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,700
We never had "the talk," so to speak.

101
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:02,951
Yeah. I mean, the way we see it,

102
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,746
when we show up,
that's the favor to you.

103
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,706
Especially, you know, when it turns out

104
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,499
you wanted someone to come over
just because you found

105
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,293
an "X-Files" monster in your basement.

106
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,588
As for the reason you've never,
like, arrested us,

107
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,798
we assumed you just knew
that it was impossible,

108
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,300
like, if you tried.

109
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,469
You know, it wouldn't go well.

110
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,681
Wouldn't go well?
Can you elaborate?

111
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,559
I think one of your 1,000 laws says,
no, I can't elaborate.

112
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,394
Just trust me.
None of us want to go there.

113
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,937
Which we'll never have to.

114
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,814
By the way, we'll keep on
saving the Earth.

115
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,357
You know, we're...
we're happy to do that.

116
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,109
Yeah, but not because
it contains America...

117
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,570
because moving to a new version
of Earth is a bitch and a half.

118
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,281
But feel free to call us, you know,
as... as, like, friends.

119
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,450
Yeah, like, if you ever
want to take a selfie...

120
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,911
So, are we cool?

121
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,955
Yes. Thank you, gentlemen.

122
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
I told you, man!

123
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,626
I'm impressed, Morty.
That went really well.

124
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,963
Everybody, get ahold of yourselves!

125
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,299
Sir, what is our new
Rick and Morty policy?

126
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,552
Our policy is, we never needed
them and never will again.

127
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,679
Today, we celebrate our independence

128
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,306
from Rick and Morty.

129
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,600
Everyone out.

130
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,068
♪ How can I move on from your love? ♪

131
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,529
<i>All this spring at Clothes Mart,
there's a clothes sale.</i>

132
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,780
<i>Come on down to the clothes section.</i>

133
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,032
I just put it on for fun.
I know I can't buy it.

134
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,035
Oh, come on. You look great!
You're only young once.

135
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,912
Just promise, if the results
are too strong,

136
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,955
you'll use protection.

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,706
Really?! Thanks!

138
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,084
- When did you get rad?
- I don't know.

139
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,255
Maybe I adjusted to the divorce
and everything's new.

140
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,673
I'll say. I couldn't stand you

141
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,800
for more than an hour at a time before.

142
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,385
No... No offense.

143
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,179
I like it. It's great.
You're like a different person.

144
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,390
Yeah.

145
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,433
Different person.

146
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,108
<i>Contato.</i>

147
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,319
<i>Vamos! Vamos!</i>
Aaah!

148
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,737
How do you like that, Morty?

149
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,781
Whoa! Just like "Minecraft"!

150
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,950
Ooh, a tiny nuclear-capable species

151
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,618
just got discovered in the Amazon.

152
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,245
Let's go make first contact
before someone else

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,788
- gets all their shit.
- What about this?

154
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,582
South Park did it four years ago, Morty.

155
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,959
- They're fast.
- Or we're slow.

156
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,881
Don't do it, guys.

157
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,425
The casualties would be
in the "Brazilians"

158
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,051
because you're Brazilian.

159
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,386
It's a threat and a pun.

160
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,470
Nobody gets me.

161
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,180
<i>Americanos! Pressa!</i>

162
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,243
Oh. Hello, Rick.
You're here, too.

163
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,162
I guess this is a global crisis.

164
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,705
Oh, God. Uh, Mr. President,

165
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,332
Morty and I have the situation covered.

166
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,750
I'm sure you did.

167
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,209
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed?

168
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,836
Yeah, dismissed.

169
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,213
Not needed here.
You can leave and nobody will care.

170
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,214
Have you never heard that before?

171
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,758
Do you even know how
to take out this kind of threat?

172
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,926
We're not taking it out.

173
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,220
We're going to shrink down
and approach them diplomatically.

174
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,726
- You shrink with pills?
- Are you still here?

175
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,770
Shouldn't you be going down
to your next version of Earth

176
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,855
with your selfie-craving
star-fucker sidekick?

177
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,523
- Whoa!
- We're allowed to be here.

178
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,067
You aren't president of the Amazon.

179
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,818
Yeah, I learned about
your job in school.

180
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,195
You're a civil servant.

181
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,529
We're technically your boss.

182
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,697
Oh, please, Morty.

183
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,407
You pay as many taxes
as you have pubes.

184
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,077
Oh, I got pubes, Commander-in-Queef.

185
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,287
- Y-You want to count them?
- Commander-in-Queef.

186
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,497
That's it! Do it!

187
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,875
Recognize the rare element Sanchez-eum?

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,378
We've been preparing for a Rick-level
eventuality for some time.

189
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,546
You mean you've been ordering
other people to prepare for it

190
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,423
while you sat on your ass
at peace summits.

191
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,384
- Peace summits are important!
- Oh, yeah! They work great!

192
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,260
We're really drowning in peace!

193
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,096
- You suck!
- You suck!

194
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,722
Task Force Alpha, prepare to shrink.

195
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,684
Is there a Task Force Alpha
health plan, by the way?

196
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,061
Because if those pills are based
on subatomic compression,

197
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
you could get a more curable cancer

198
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,731
just walking through
the mushroom clouds.

199
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,149
God damn it!
I'll do it.

200
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,903
- Whoa.
- Task Force Alpha is disbanded.

201
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,655
And you two aren't American anymore!

202
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,657
I can say that.
You're expatriated!

203
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,701
If you step foot on homeland soil again,

204
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,577
I'll treat it as an invasion.

205
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,787
Is this supposed to be painful?

206
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,788
Painful to watch.

207
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,415
Oh, such lame shrinking.

208
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,792
Oh, his clothes stay the same size?

209
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,253
'70s shrinking, party of one.

210
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,422
Eat my shrinking ass!

211
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,134
There he goes. All right.
Let's get out of here, Morty.

212
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,761
What the hell?!

213
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,972
I made Sanchez-eum up, dumbasses.

214
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,016
Don't believe everything
you read on Wikipedia.

215
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,852
Stand down.
He's not afraid of pirates.

216
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,563
Oh! Run, Morty!
That part was true!

217
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,913
I-I can't talk now, sweetie.

218
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,081
- Oh, when can you?
- Good point.

219
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,082
What's up?

220
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,501
Remember a little while ago when
you said that, if I wanted,

221
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,254
I could, like, leave Earth
and wander the infinite cosmos

222
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,715
to figure out who I am and that
nobody would ever know I'd left

223
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,134
because you could
replace me with a clone?

224
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,427
- Mm-hmm.
- Am I the clone?

225
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,970
- Sorry. What?
- Am I the clone?

226
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,014
Did the real me choose to leave,
and I only think I chose to stay

227
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,223
because that's what I need to think

228
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,059
because I'm the replacement Beth?

229
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,186
- No.
- Okay.

230
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,479
Wait. And one more thing.

231
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,690
If I <i>were</i> a clone, would you tell me?

232
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,485
Beth, you know, when...
when smart people get happy,

233
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,612
they stop recognizing themselves.

234
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,990
And you are very smart because
you're very much my daughter.

235
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,993
Oh, God. You're right.
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,411
- Thank you, Dad.
- All good?

237
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,413
Totally. I'm fine now.

238
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,956
And just to be sure,

239
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,541
you're not pretending to be
convinced you're real

240
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,335
because you're actually
convinced you're a clone

241
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,170
and you're now terrified
that becoming self-aware

242
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,922
would mean I'd have to terminate you?

243
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,092
- No.
- Okay. Glad I could help.

244
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,384
See you soon.

245
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,931
Aaaaaah!

246
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,564
Where do I go?

247
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,318
What does Th... What... What...
What... What does this mean?

248
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,361
This means nothing.

249
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,196
Pull forward and park.

250
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,447
Then say that, God damn it!

251
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,449
Sorry.

252
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,076
Bad day.

253
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,539
I am Presidentress
of the Mega Gargantuans.

254
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,041
We named ourselves
before learning we were small.

255
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,669
Madam Presidentress,
I'm President of America,

256
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,753
which is basically the world,

257
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,088
but you didn't hear that from me.

258
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,923
- I've come to...
- I know who you are.

259
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,758
We've already agreed to a ceasefire

260
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,552
with your ambassadors, Rick and Morty.

261
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,512
- Rick and Morty were here?
- Of course they were here.

262
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,389
They can shrink instantly and teleport.

263
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,932
They told me to give you this.

264
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,268
They said it will stretch
as your cancer pill wears off

265
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,729
and your body awkwardly enlarges
at the rate of a '50s movie.

266
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:47,730
Are there pants?

267
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,858
They said you'd prefer just a shirt.

268
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,694
Apparently, you have a need
to swing your dick around?

269
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,822
Rick and Morty escaped.

270
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,740
No shit. Take me to the Pentagon.

271
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,242
We're at war with Rick and Morty.

272
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,827
You'll want to make a stop
at the White House?

273
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,454
I have pants at the Pentagon, Rhonda.
It's in my contract.

274
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,248
I mean you need to call
a press conference.

275
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,917
Israel and Palestine have announced
a permanent ceasefire.

276
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,752
- What?
- They signed something called

277
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,130
"The Pretty Obvious If You
Think About It" accord.

278
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,507
Apparently, an anonymous
American diplomat

279
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,718
took them to a "Star Wars" cantina,

280
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,511
where they smoked perspective-enhancing

281
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,680
alien pheromones through a laser hookah.

282
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,432
I still say it has to be Putin.

283
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,933
It was Rick and Morty,
you fucking dunce!

284
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,059
But you're getting the credit, sir.

285
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,978
Your approval rating just hit 100%.

286
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,438
Why would Rick and Morty want that?

287
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,148
Because they're assholes!

288
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,734
I'm flattered, but it
takes a whole team

289
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,194
to achieve what we did today.

290
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,653
Thank you.

291
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,321
Well?

292
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,447
They haven't been back home, sir.

293
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,782
We've got every possible
location under surveillance.

294
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,659
God damn it!
They're right here!

295
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,536
- They're here, God damn it!
- Code Red! We need backup!

296
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,246
Everybody relax.

297
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,456
Just waiting for you in the only room

298
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,041
you can't blow up or spy on.

299
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,876
So, we're not changing
timelines for you,

300
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,419
but now you have everything you want,

301
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,963
so you can forget we exist,
and we'll return the favor.

302
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,298
You couldn't say that in a text?

303
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,884
Well, since we won't be seeing
each other again, my...

304
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,178
Guys, we get it.
It's a Code Red. Enough.

305
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,888
My grandson has worked hard for you,

306
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,640
and I feel like he's earned a selfie.

307
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,516
Honestly, I could take it
or leave it at this point.

308
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,517
You're taking it.

309
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,519
No. What kind of fratty-ass
status move is that?

310
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,520
Get out of my office!

311
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,314
Seriously? You're that stubborn?

312
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,191
He's the stubborn one.
I'm protecting my country.

313
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,359
Uh, from selfies?

314
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,110
From subordination to hostile powers.

315
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,862
Uh, does China know
about that deal-breaker?

316
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,489
China doesn't piss on the White House.

317
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,324
Well, why would they?
I'm sure it was expensive.

318
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,992
- Get out.
- Not without a selfie.

319
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:23,743
Arrest them.

320
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,078
Son, you have a right
to refuse his order,

321
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,788
and I guarantee you're going
to die if you touch me,

322
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,915
and there's no afterlife.
Everything just goes black.

323
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,124
Don't do it.

324
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,043
- Whoa, Rick!
- Okay. What was that?

325
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,169
- Death.
- What kind?

326
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,420
- Instant.
- There was no sound.

327
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,005
- He just died.
- Yeah, terrifying.

328
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,465
It's a terrifying thing
to watch happen.

329
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,716
It's called a deterrent.

330
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,218
You couldn't just knock him out?

331
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,053
How is knocking out a deterrent?

332
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,304
Everyone wants to be knocked out.

333
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,681
Nobody wants to be dead.

334
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,140
You committed murder
in the Oval Office.

335
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,183
- Now you can't leave.
- That's fine.

336
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,810
I said I'm not leaving
without a selfie.

337
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,270
Uh, I don't need a selfie.

338
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,354
And I'm saying you aren't getting one

339
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,355
and you aren't leaving.

340
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,899
- So we agree?
- Yes. No. We disagree

341
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,859
because you think you're
getting a selfie and leaving.

342
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,902
Am I getting a selfie?

343
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,279
- Never.
- Then I'm never leaving.

344
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,530
- Exactly.
- See?

345
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,531
Does anyone have a shot?

346
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,408
Yes, nine people.
I can show you.

347
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,244
- But I wouldn't recommend...
- Open fire!

348
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,912
God, you are dumb!

349
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,038
Get the President out of here!

350
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,790
- Bad idea.
- Wait. Why?

351
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,958
Because if there isn't someone in here

352
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,376
that they're <i>not</i> supposed to kill,

353
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,128
they're going to wreck
the place trying to kill me.

354
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,171
As long as you live,
no matter where you are,

355
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,924
if it isn't in a selfie with him,
I'll be here.

356
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,135
Jesus! He's not a fucking god!

357
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,469
You don't know what I am!

358
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,637
And you don't know what I can do!

359
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,763
Geez, it's... it's cool, Rick!

360
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,140
I'm Doctor Who in this motherfucker.

361
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,350
I could be a clone.
I could be a hologram.

362
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,102
We could be clones controlled by robots

363
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,520
controlled with special headsets

364
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,730
that the real Rick
and Morty are wearing

365
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,772
while they're fucking your mother!

366
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:35,815
I'm going to kill you!

367
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,567
Then come to 312 Olive Street!

368
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,651
Is that her address?

369
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,236
You don't know
because you're a bad son!

370
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,864
- Ow!
- Take him down! Semper fi!

371
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:43,906
Aaaaah!

372
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,034
<i>Number three, The Twister.</i>

373
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,410
- Ow! Damn it.
<i>- Number four...</i>

374
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,745
<i>The Hanky Panky.</i>

375
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,831
Beth?

376
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,083
My dad might have cloned me,
and I might be the clone.

377
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,835
And he says I'm not,
but that's what he'd say to a clone.

378
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,129
- Typical.
- <i>Number six, The Texas Ripple.</i>

379
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,756
You look like you to me.

380
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,717
What are you, an idiot?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

381
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,760
That was so rude.

382
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,220
I came to you for help, and now
I'm insulting your intelligence.

383
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,764
And look where intelligence gets you.

384
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,891
Well, don't knock intelligence,
because right now

385
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,643
I'd love to understand
how I can help you.

386
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,228
I can't be in charge of that, Jerry.

387
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,731
My mind, my ideas are
all part of the variable.

388
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,900
The only constant is you.

389
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,694
You know me inside and out.

390
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,237
Do what you have to do.

391
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,699
Okay. Sit down.

392
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,201
Now cross your legs.

393
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,535
That leg on top. Good.

394
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,662
Oh, what is this?

395
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,749
Senior year, I took you on a date

396
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,292
to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra

397
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,379
performing the music
of Alan Silvestri in the Park.

398
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,506
At this point in the song
from "Volcano,"

399
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,549
when Tommy Lee Jones
and the utility workers

400
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,094
are using cars to guide
the lava into a cul-de-sac,

401
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,804
I realized my palms were so sweaty,

402
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,347
I would never get to hold your hand.

403
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,723
But I was desperate to touch you,

404
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,767
so I wiped my palm
on the grass next to me.

405
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,727
But a Snickers wrapper
kind of got stuck on it,

406
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,604
so I started kind of jiggling it,

407
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,439
whipping it without moving too much.

408
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,899
But you started looking over,
and I thought,

409
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,026
"Well, this is it. She's going
to see that I'm a loser,

410
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,111
and I'll never get to touch her.

411
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,779
But I still have time to touch her."

412
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,197
But my hand had Snickers on it,

413
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,615
and the brass section was swelling

414
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,450
because it was the scene
with the guy melting in the lava.

415
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,577
And I just thought,
"Fuck it. Lips don't sweat."

416
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,290
Wow. Yeah.

417
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,793
I'll never forget that feeling.

418
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,628
You're the real thing.

419
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,004
Then that settles it,

420
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,715
because my memory
is of hating that night.

421
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,969
But now, reliving it, all I can
feel is how lucky I am

422
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:33,015
to be loved by such a simple,
honest, simple man.

423
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,016
Simple twice.

424
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,894
This isn't the woman
you married, Jerry,

425
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,604
because this woman loves you.

426
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,066
Uh... well, <i>vive la différence.</i>

427
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,110
Okay. That was lame.

428
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,779
Listen, I... Words.

429
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,531
Don Cheadle.

430
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,621
You have the right to get
the fuck out of my office!

431
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,707
You have the right to kiss my dick!

432
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,792
Give me the thing.

433
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,960
Ugh!

434
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,004
Oh! Ugh!

435
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,427
Ugh!

436
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:33,951
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

437
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,292
Oh!

438
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,805
Aah!

439
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,485
Ohh!

440
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,820
Submit!
Submit for the selfie!

441
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,906
I yield! I yield!
Take the selfie!

442
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,534
Okay. Morty, get in there
and say, "Cheese."

443
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,577
Morty?

444
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,787
Morty, come on!

445
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,622
God damn it!

446
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,835
Rick, don't get mad,
but I-I stole your portal gun.

447
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,087
What the fuck, Morty?!

448
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,881
I told you I didn't want
the damn selfie 800 times!

449
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,633
Look, whatever the hell
is going on between you

450
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,635
and the president, it's got
nothing to do with me.

451
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,345
- So where did you go?
- I can't tell you.

452
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,639
Rick, did you tell my mom
she might be a clone?

453
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,474
No! I told her she <i>wasn't!</i>

454
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,976
Well, isn't that
what you'd tell a clone?

455
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,102
Oh, for Christ's sake.

456
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,020
Rick, my mom and dad
are getting back together.

457
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,814
What? No!
She's not a clone!

458
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,816
Well, she says it doesn't
matter if she is or isn't

459
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,192
because now she loves my dad,

460
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,027
and she wanted me and
Summer to come home,

461
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,029
and we're hiding from you
so you don't kill her

462
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,366
if she's a clone in a place
I picked that you will never find.

463
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,868
So don't look for us.

464
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,414
- Come on, bitch!
- Oh, you come on, bitch.

465
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:02,915
I'm out. I'm done.

466
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,293
I got to... I got to go.

467
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,628
So I win. Then I'm in charge,
and you can't leave.

468
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,255
You're a terrorist.
You're an enemy of the state,

469
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,923
and you kicked me
in the balls 10 minutes ago!

470
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,800
The office of the President can't coexist

471
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,802
with a living god
that won't submit to it...

472
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,304
I mean, besides Poseidon.

473
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,888
But he's locked up in Area 51 already,

474
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:18,889
so that doesn't really count.

475
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,766
Mr. President, I'll make you a deal.

476
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,852
If you let me use your
ghetto-ass off-brand

477
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,645
deficit-tripling teleporter,

478
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,398
I can go take care of something,
and you'll never see me again.

479
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,984
Yes. Deal.
Invisi-troopers, stand down.

480
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,152
Yeah, yeah.

481
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,153
I don't want to hear it.

482
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,863
You know I could see them
this whole time, right?

483
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,364
Don't push it, Sanchez.

484
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,209
He found us!

485
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,419
I told you we shouldn't have gone

486
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,879
to the same cabin as last time!

487
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,298
Oh, we're not going anywhere.
This ends now.

488
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,594
Dad, if you're my dad.
Of course, you're not my dad.

489
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,554
You're here with a gun
because I am a clone.

490
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,222
I guess I have all your
daughter's memories.

491
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,768
So I guess I was her,
which makes me related to her.

492
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,102
But I don't relate to her.

493
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,231
She left her family and me,
which means I relate to them.

494
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,359
So if you kill me, fine.
You're not killing her.

495
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,277
But you're killing a real family.

496
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,696
And instead of doing that,
will you just go away?

497
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,448
Aren't there, like, infinite timelines?

498
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,742
Can't you just move to one where
I don't know I'm a clone

499
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,952
and where a different
but identical version

500
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,622
of your authentic
sociopathic crazy bitch

501
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,874
of a daughter can keep making you proud

502
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,209
by being somewhere else?

503
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,837
Beth, you crazy bitch.
You're my daughter.

504
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,464
I brought this here to kill Jerry.

505
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,591
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!

506
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,594
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You win, Jerry. You win!

507
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,972
No amount of genius can stop your
dumb mediocre vacuous roots

508
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,058
from digging into everything
and everyone around you

509
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,686
and draining them of any
ability to fend you off.

510
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,730
Well, it couldn't have been easy
for you to say that.

511
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,856
I appreciate it.

512
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,067
Morty, where's my portal gun?
Let's get out of here.

513
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,276
I'm staying here, Rick.

514
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,028
Are you... Ugh!

515
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,321
Nobody gets it.

516
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,948
Nothing you think matters matters.

517
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,157
This isn't special.

518
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,617
This... This is happening infinite times

519
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,785
across infinite realities.

520
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,287
Including this?

521
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,789
Yes!

522
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,792
Which is not to say that,
subjectively, it wasn't funny.

523
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,793
Are you going to stay?

524
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,420
There's infinite timelines, Morty.

525
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,839
Why would I stay in the one where
I trashed the White House,

526
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,424
became an enemy of America

527
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,510
and the lowest-status
character in my idiot family?

528
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,013
Because of the fart?

529
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,807
There's still some rubble over there.

530
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,517
I don't think you've ever understood

531
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,562
what "Secretary of the Interior" means!

532
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,605
Hi, Mr. President. I'm Rick Sanchez,

533
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,315
but not the one that did this.

534
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,318
We Ricks travel the infinite
and switch places with each other

535
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,903
like hermit crabs, I think.

536
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,238
I'm Fly Fishing Rick.

537
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,614
You can distinguish me from the Rick

538
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,741
that you had a falling-out with

539
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,577
by my fly-fishing enthusiasm
and accompanying hat.

540
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,870
I hope I can be of service

541
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,038
if, uh, you ever find
the planet to be in danger.

542
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,039
Friends?

543
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,918
Sounds good to me.

544
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,462
Kids, dinner!

545
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,838
I got Panda Express!

546
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,006
Did you get sugar chicken?

547
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,841
That's kind of the only thing they have.

548
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,551
I love Panda E!
Thanks, Mom!

549
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,762
I'm hoping to get a piece
of your sugar chicken later.

550
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,055
Stop it.

551
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,974
Here's your stupid hat, dipshit.

552
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,185
Dad, you can't talk to Jerry
that way anymore.

553
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,020
We're a real family now.

554
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,147
In many ways,
things will be like Season 1

555
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,690
but more streamlined.

556
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,776
Now Jerry and I are happily
married parents,

557
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,319
and the idea that I was motivated

558
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,321
by a fear of you leaving
can be eschewed.

559
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,490
Eschewed?
You've never used that word.

560
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,949
Maybe you are a clone.

561
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,118
It's not like Rick would tell us.

562
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,658
Ooh-wee! What a season!

563
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,327
Sorry I never showed up,
but I got married.

564
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,203
I had a baby.

565
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,498
I went back to school
and got my G-E-E-E-D.

566
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,875
What did you do while you were waiting?

567
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,629
Hopefully you didn't just fuck
around and waste your life.

568
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,172
Ooh-wee!

569
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,885
See you for Season 4 in,
like, a really long time!

570
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,098
I might even have a big
white Santa Claus beard

571
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,267
and... and... and a...

572
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,311
and a couple of grandkids

573
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,438
and all that kind of stuff.

574
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,649
See you... See you then!
