1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,253
Morty?!

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,256
- Morty!
- Rick?

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,717
- Hey, Morty?!
- Rick?

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,512
Are you far away,
or are you inside something?

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:12,971
Is this a camera?

6
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,640
Is everything a camera?

7
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,391
Morty, the garage, Morty.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:17,768
Come to the garage!

9
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,104
- Morty?
- Rick? W-Where are you?

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,356
On my work bench, Morty.

11
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,399
Are you invisible and you're gonna,
like, fart on me?

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,609
Flip the pickle over.

13
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,735
What, I'm gonna touch it,

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,320
and you're gonna tell me
it's an alien dick or something.

15
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,197
Come on, flip the pickle, Morty.

16
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,116
You're not gonna regret it.
The payoff is huge.

17
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,244
I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,538
Boom! Big reveal... I'm a pickle.

19
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,789
What do you think about that?

20
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,624
I turned myself into a pickle!

21
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,626
W-What are you just
staring at me for, bro?

22
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,545
I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!

23
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,796
- And?
- And?

24
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,339
What more do you want
tacked on to this?

25
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,133
I turned myself into a pickle,
and 9/11 was an inside job.

26
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,468
- Was it?
- Who cares, Morty?

27
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,262
Global acts of terrorism
happen every day.

28
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,347
Uh, here's something that's
never happened before...

29
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,723
I'm a pickle.

30
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,101
I'm Pickle Rick!

31
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,514
Are you going to, I mean, you know...

32
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,641
Is this the first part
of some kind of magic trick?

33
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,643
I don't do magic, Morty, I do science.

34
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,395
One takes brains,
the other takes dark eyeliner.

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,689
Well, can you move?
Can you fly?

36
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,316
Wouldn't be much
of a pickle if I could.

37
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,360
All right, well,
do pickles live forever or...

38
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,614
Morty, stop digging for hidden
layers and just be impressed.

39
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,157
- I'm a pickle.
- I-I'm just trying

40
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,867
to figure out why you would do this...

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,243
why anyone would do this.

42
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,787
The reason anyone would
do this is, if they could,

43
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,998
which they can't, would be
because they could,

44
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:03,999
which they can't.

45
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,168
Morty, we have to get going,
or we're gonna be late.

46
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,961
- Where's your grandpa?
- Right here, sweetie.

47
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,546
- I'm a pickle!
- What?!

48
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,006
Why would you... Ugh!

49
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,633
Look, we're running late.
We have to go.

50
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,925
W-Where are you guys going?

51
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,178
We have an appointment downtown

52
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,222
that was set a week ago
and agreed upon by everyone,

53
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,223
including you.

54
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,518
Oh, my God. Beth, oh,
it totally slipped my mind.

55
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,520
Geez, oh, man.
I'm a pickle.

56
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,856
I mean, I don't know if I can...
Ooh, geez.

57
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,484
Rick, did you do this on purpose
to get out of family counseling?

58
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,985
- Morty!
- It's okay, Beth.

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,445
I understand Morty's suspicion.

60
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,113
I've misled him before.

61
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,574
Morty, turn me so we're
making eye contact.

62
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,328
Morty, I assure you,
I would never <i>find a way</i>

63
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,455
to <i>get out of</i> family therapy.

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,123
I hope my lack of fingers
doesn't prevent

65
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,875
the perception of my air quotes.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,460
Can't you just turn yourself
back into a human?

67
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,628
Great question, Summer.

68
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,631
The unfortunate answer is
I did this to challenge myself.

69
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,591
And it could take hours or even days

70
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,968
before I'm able to figure out
how to return to human form.

71
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,679
But, I mean, you know,
your mom could put me

72
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,347
in a purse or a pocket, you know,

73
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,473
if she really needs me to go.

74
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,725
Nobody needs anything.
Okay, it's fine.

75
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,435
I mean, you should just
stay here and figure out

76
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,853
how to stop being a pickle, okay?

77
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,815
Hey, Rick, why is there
a syringe of mysterious fluid

78
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,233
hanging directly over you?

79
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,694
Also, why is the string
attached to it running through

80
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,445
a pair of scissors attached to a timer?

81
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,948
And why is the timer set
to 10 minutes from now,

82
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,409
exactly when we would have
left for therapy?

83
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,704
Well, Morty, if you must know,

84
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,456
the syringe is completely
unrelated to this discussion

85
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,333
and, therefore, does not
warrant further explanation.

86
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,961
Enough. Kids, it's time to go.
We don't want to be late.

87
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,462
W-W-What are you doing there, Beth?

88
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,755
W-What are you doing there, sweetie?

89
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,632
Well, I mean, you don't want
to get pierced by a needle

90
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,843
full of liquid unrelated
to your situation.

91
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,094
How's that gonna help?

92
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,429
Can't argue with that.

93
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,596
Great. We'll see you later.

94
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,889
Hey, hey, be careful with that.

95
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,015
It's for something else.

96
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,183
It's really important,

97
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,143
so don't break it.

98
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,938
Okay, I may have fucked up here.

99
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,067
Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut,
dah, pap, pap, pap, pah.

100
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,819
T-T-Tah, tah.

101
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,164
Oh, great.

102
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,417
Stupid cat.

103
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I know what it looks like

104
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,046
to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake!

105
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,590
I've seen the YouTube videos.
I know cats are scared

106
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,842
of cucumbers and pickles
because they think they're snakes.

107
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,302
I'm not a snake!

108
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,678
I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!

109
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,888
Whoa!

110
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,098
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

111
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,269
Oh, crap, that sun is bright.

112
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,480
Okay, come on.

113
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,898
This can't really be the way I go out.

114
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,441
This is the mega-genius equivalent

115
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,193
of dying on the toilet.

116
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,530
So hot.

117
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,365
This is how I'm gonna die.

118
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,002
Oh, God, moisture.

119
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,505
Oh, God, the moisture.
Dial it back, God.

120
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,507
Dial it back a little bit here!

121
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,716
Oh! Oh.

122
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,221
Oh, God!

123
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,348
Perpendicular, perpendicular!

124
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,933
Oh, shit!

125
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,143
Oh! Oh!

126
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,694
Oh!

127
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,454
Come on. That's it.

128
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,581
Come get this delicious brine.

129
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,666
Aah!

130
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,711
Come on!
Come on, motherfucker!

131
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,046
Come on!

132
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,278
Yes!

133
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,572
How is this even family therapy

134
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,032
if Dad's not invited
and Grandpa won't come?

135
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,243
Yeah, and what's courageous
about eating a hot dog?

136
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,579
It's nobody's choice
to be here, you knobs.

137
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,331
The family was told to get
counseling by your principal,

138
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,083
even though it's not
the family that was

139
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,544
huffing pottery glaze in the art room

140
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,296
and desk wetting in history class.

141
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,172
Oh, the Smith family,

142
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,549
minus a dad.

143
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,384
You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?

144
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,386
Temporarily... by order of the school.

145
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,472
Me too. How long have you
all been eating poop?

146
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,935
We... have never... eaten poop.

147
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,520
Uh, me, neither.

148
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,690
Say, where did my family get off to?

149
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,483
Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong.

150
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,027
Come on in.

151
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,034
I was told there was a grandpa
that might be joining us?

152
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,994
He got wrapped up in an experiment.

153
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,746
He's a scientist.

154
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,081
Like, legit, like on a an inter-galactic,

155
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,750
sci-fi level. His work is very...

156
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,084
He turned himself into a pickle.

157
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,295
Morty, Mom's talking.
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,213
I suppose that's a good segue

159
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,633
into our little discipline cases here.

160
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,469
Does Grandpa turn himself
into a pickle a lot?

161
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,513
What?! No!
What kind of question is that?

162
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,475
The kind that wasn't designed
to attack or hurt you in any way.

163
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,852
Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these.

164
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,272
No, my father has never turned
himself into a pickle before.

165
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,566
He's unpredictable and eccentric.

166
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,818
The whole family is.
Speaking of which...

167
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,780
Okay, let's open things up
to the whole family,

168
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,949
and let me ask this.

169
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,118
Why do we think Grandpa
turned himself into a pickle?

170
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,213
Wow. Ugh!

171
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,551
Hey, listen, I know this is
your world, not mine.

172
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,261
The sooner I can get out,
the sooner I can go back

173
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,556
to taking big craps, and you can
go back to subsisting on them.

174
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,892
You are one driven rat.

175
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,854
Could you be a little more driven?

176
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,731
To the right.

177
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,693
Yes, yes, yes!

178
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,778
Come on, come on, come on!
Fresh, fresh, fresh!

179
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend?

180
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,782
Don't worry,
he died doing what he loved,

181
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,367
being a dumb fucking rat.

182
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,931
Oh, yeah!

183
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,914
Aaaah!

184
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,624
I didn't say my father is perfect,

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,084
I said his work is important.

186
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,919
And she's saying what's important is

187
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,963
that Grandpa lied to you
to get out of coming here.

188
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,048
Oh, he did not!

189
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,549
Let's do an experiment here.

190
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,926
I get the impression this
family values science.

191
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,179
So raise your hand if you feel certain

192
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,056
you know what was in the syringe.

193
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,601
Raise your hand if you know for certain

194
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,812
the syringe does not
contain anti-pickle serum.

195
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,024
Beth, your hand did
a little thing there.

196
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,442
Do you really not see
what's happening here?

197
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,444
- Tell me.
- Well, Dr. Wong...

198
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,029
by the way, racist name...

199
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,156
obviously, Morty and Summer
are seizing on your

200
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,408
arbitrary pickle obsession
as an end run

201
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,619
around what was supposed
to be <i>their</i> therapy.

202
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,997
Oh, I think this pickle incident
is a better path than any other

203
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,999
to the heart of your
family's dysfunction.

204
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,876
I think it's possible that you
and your father

205
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,170
have a very specific dynamic.

206
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,254
I don't think it's one

207
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,131
that rewards emotion or vulnerability.

208
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,508
I think it may punish them.

209
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,177
I think it's possible that dynamic
eroded your marriage

210
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,096
and is infecting your kids
with a tendency

211
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,847
to misdirect their feelings.

212
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,933
Fuck you.

213
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:00,934
- Mom!
- Mom!

214
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,018
Fuck both of you, too.

215
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,356
By the way, you might
notice that in spite of

216
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,149
your numerous distinctive features

217
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,736
I never gave you a name
like Scar or Stripe or Goliath.

218
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,197
That's because, to me,
you aren't special.

219
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,491
You were special to rats.
Now they're dead.

220
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,910
I guess it was me
you should have impressed.

221
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,703
God damn it, I love myself.

222
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,383
Pickle Rick!

223
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,024
Get that parkour.
Get that parkour!

224
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,988
Hey, it's cool.

225
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,239
Just need to find the nearest exit.

226
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,907
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No need to freak out.

227
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:00,785
Whoa!

228
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,414
Who in the fuck's toilet is this?

229
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,380
What is it?

230
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,883
A pickle? A rat? Both.

231
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,426
It says it's a scientist.

232
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,719
Where is it?

233
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,554
It seems to be using the air ducts

234
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,181
and the mail tubes to get around.

235
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,850
It's been gathering
office supplies, we think,

236
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,143
to build weaponry.

237
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,687
But look what it did on the mezzanine.

238
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,649
It transferred a bottle
from the trash to the recycling bin.

239
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,236
Whatever this thing is,
it's shaming us.

240
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,822
We have 34 armed guards,
and we can't kill a pickle?

241
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,824
32 armed guards.

242
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,618
He killed two.

243
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,785
It's on the phone.

244
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,705
Put him on, and locate
the phone he's using.

245
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,123
Hello.

246
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,126
Hi, um, can you, uh please let me out?

247
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,753
Your mere presence in this building

248
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,630
violates international law.

249
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,758
I couldn't let you out even
if you hadn't killed two men.

250
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,010
You should know those
men killed themselves.

251
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,762
And how is that?

252
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,764
They didn't let me out.

253
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,598
Solen'ya.

254
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,058
Shut your mouth and do your jobs,

255
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,142
you fucking children!

256
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,102
Uh, is this not a good time or...

257
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,813
Some of my men
are calling you "Solen'ya"...

258
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,150
the Pickle Man, an old wives' tale.

259
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,777
He crawls from bowls of cold soup

260
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,029
to steal the dreams
of wasteful children.

261
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,572
That'd be a lucky break for you.

262
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,823
Go, shoot to kill.

263
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,326
Aaah!

264
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,965
We got him.

265
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,007
- Ah.
- Ah.

266
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,008
Because this pickle

267
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,177
doesn't care about your children.

268
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,388
And I'm not gonna take their dreams.

269
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,307
I'm gonna take their parents.

270
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,826
Solen'ya!
He's coming!

271
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,537
It's because I threw
halfway my sandwich!

272
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,330
He's just a pickle!

273
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,498
He's a monster.

274
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,208
He's not the only one.

275
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:25,221
You can stay dead to the world
and die in this room.

276
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:29,350
Or you can kill a pickle for me
and earn your freedom.

277
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,604
There is no freedom
while your leader breathes.

278
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,773
Our country is a prison.

279
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,608
Then Catarina is a prisoner.

280
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,111
Perhaps I could arrange
her escape, as well.

281
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,739
She lives, Jaguar.

282
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,242
Where is this pickle?

283
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,536
What do you think
is in the syringe, Beth?

284
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,247
You're the one that costs $200 an hour.
You tell me.

285
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,790
- Anti-pickle serum.
- It's anti-pickle serum.

286
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,793
Your kids think it might be
anti-pickle serum.

287
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,547
My kids pee their desks
and suck on unbaked vases.

288
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,674
They're just angry at me
for divorcing their father.

289
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,217
I never said I was angry at you.

290
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,470
That's the point
of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer.

291
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,096
You do it so you don't have to say,

292
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,140
"I'm angry at Mommy," out loud.

293
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,808
Oh, my God! Oh, there...

294
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,935
there's pictures of people
eating poop in there!

295
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,814
It's not my job to take
sides or pass judgment.

296
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,317
Do you think when your father
asks for that syringe,

297
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:20,151
you could ask him...

298
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,569
He won't have to ask for it, okay?

299
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,780
He won't need it.
He'll just make more.

300
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,074
He doesn't <i>need</i> anything from anyone.

301
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,534
You admire him for that.

302
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,745
It's better than making your problems

303
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,246
other people's problems.

304
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,307
Oh, come on!

305
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,779
Pickle Man, you should know
this isn't personal!

306
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,364
You should know that isn't original.

307
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,448
They have my daughter.

308
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,534
There's nothing I won't do
to see her again.

309
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,786
Yeah, there's lots I <i>wouldn't</i> do
to see my daughter,

310
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,579
but killing you gets me to her quicker

311
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,373
than your derivative bullshit.

312
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,213
I never bullshit, Pickle Man.

313
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,424
This can only end with one of us dead,

314
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,967
and I have never died.

315
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,885
That will be your downfall, Jaguar,

316
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,179
not being open to new experiences.

317
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,860
Is it done?

318
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,278
Jaguar?!

319
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,155
Jaguar couldn't make it.

320
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,322
Do it.

321
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,616
Okay, you win, Pickle Man.

322
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,034
I'm unsealing the building.

323
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,704
No, thanks.
I'm coming for you now.

324
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,331
Pickle Man, there's $100 million
worth of bonds

325
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,708
in a safe on level two.

326
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,959
I'll give you the combination.

327
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,919
That money belongs to the people.

328
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,172
Shut up and call me
a helicopter, you prick!

329
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,298
Do we have a deal?!

330
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,300
Take that money,
give it to Jaguar's daughter

331
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,426
when you set her free.

332
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,719
Or I'll be visiting you.

333
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,304
Jaguar's daughter is dead.

334
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,555
Huh, so you're a liar.

335
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,098
Jaguar was an animal.

336
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,683
You're an intelligent pickle.

337
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,101
<i>We</i> can do business.

338
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,187
I don't think so.
See you soon.

339
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,563
- Is the helicopter here?
- Yes.

340
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
And the police are on the way.
What do we tell them?

341
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,192
- Ooh!
- Aah!

342
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,985
Tell them we were robbed.

343
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,825
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?!

344
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,410
I'm right here!

345
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,010
Farewell, Solen'ya.

346
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:56,891
F-15s are scrambled.

347
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,393
This helicopter will be shot down
in seven minutes.

348
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,937
Well, my daughter is about five away,

349
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,688
and I've got about eight to live.

350
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,066
Pickle Man, it's too late for me
to tell my daughter

351
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,817
I love her, but not for you.

352
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,194
Oh, well, uh, she knows.

353
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,071
I mean, we don't really buy
into that kind of crap.

354
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,531
To the extent that love
is an expression

355
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,242
of familiarity over time,
my access to infinite timelines

356
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,035
precludes the necessity of attachment.

357
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,496
In fact, I even abandoned
one of my infinite daughters

358
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,500
in an alternate version of earth
that was taken over by mutants.

359
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,961
Okay. Good luck with that.

360
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,046
Wait. Do I have infinite daughters?

361
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,132
Huh? Uh, no.
No, nope, sorry about that.

362
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:31,551
Nope, just me.

363
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,136
Yeesh!

364
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,099
I...

365
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,725
am...

366
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,394
afraid...

367
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,937
that my kids will get expelled.

368
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,438
Good. Summer, you go.

369
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,816
I am mad...

370
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,818
that I can't huff enamel

371
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:51,821
without people assuming
it's because my family sucks.

372
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,366
I hope to be seen one day

373
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,285
as someone that just
likes getting high.

374
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,244
Good job.

375
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,162
Morty, do you have an "I" statement?

376
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,666
I am sad...

377
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,959
that I peed.

378
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,546
I'm sad that I peed in class
instead of a toilet.

379
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,757
Look at this family go.
You guys are pros.

380
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,844
What do you guys think
about doing this once a week?

381
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,888
Ugh.

382
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,356
- You must be Rick.
- Mm-hmm.

383
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,983
I've heard a lot about you today.

384
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,027
Your family is crazy about you.

385
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,737
Your daughter holds you
in very high regard.

386
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,155
You're a lucky fella.

387
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,073
Yeah, thank you.
Uh, sweetie, you don't still

388
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,783
happen to have that syringe
in your purse?

389
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,289
Dad...

390
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,835
I would like you to tell me
what's in the syringe.

391
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,006
It's a serum that I need to,
uh... to stay alive.

392
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,967
I have had a rough day.

393
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,346
And, uh, I've sustained
a lot of damage.

394
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,349
I'm pretty close to death,
which the serum will prevent.

395
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,768
By changing you
from a pickle to a human.

396
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,519
Yes.

397
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,605
Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?

398
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,858
So I wouldn't have to come here.

399
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,109
Why didn't you want to come here?

400
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,654
Because I don't respect therapy,
because I'm a scientist.

401
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,864
Because I invent, transform,
create, and destroy

402
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,449
for a living, and when
I don't like something

403
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,742
about the world, I change it.

404
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,827
And I don't think going
to a rented office in a strip mall

405
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,829
to listen to some agent of averageness

406
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,665
explain which words mean which feelings

407
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,249
has ever helped anyone do anything.

408
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,918
I think it's helped a lot
of people get comfortable

409
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,878
and stop panicking,
which is a state of mind

410
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,755
we value in the animals we eat

411
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,465
but not something I want for myself.

412
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,716
I'm not a cow.

413
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,802
I'm a pickle... when I feel like it.

414
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,554
So... you asked.

415
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,890
Rick, the only connection between

416
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,226
your unquestionable
intelligence and the sickness

417
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,145
destroying your family
is that everyone in your family,

418
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,732
you included, use intelligence
to justify sickness.

419
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,318
You seem to alternate between
viewing your own mind

420
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:58,155
as an unstoppable force
and as an inescapable curse.

421
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,699
And I think it's because the only

422
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,826
truly unapproachable concept for you

423
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,829
is that it's your mind
within your control.

424
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,622
You chose to come here.

425
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,500
You chose to talk,
to belittle my vocation,

426
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,794
just as you chose to become a pickle.

427
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,838
You are the master of your universe,

428
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,549
and yet you are dripping
with rat blood and feces,

429
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,844
your enormous mind literally
vegetating by your own hand.

430
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,513
I have no doubt that you
would be bored senseless

431
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,266
by therapy, the same way
I'm bored when I brush my teeth

432
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,559
and wipe my ass.

433
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,477
Because the thing about repairing,

434
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,273
maintaining, and cleaning
is it's not an adventure.

435
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,692
There's no way to do it
so wrong, you might die.

436
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,277
It's just work.

437
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,361
And the bottom line is,

438
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,948
some people are okay going
to work, and some people...

439
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,325
well, some people would rather die.

440
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,995
Each of us gets to choose.

441
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,874
That's our time.

442
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm going to give you guys my card

443
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,418
and hope to hear from you again.

444
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,295
And if you have any friends
or family that eat poop

445
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,089
and would like to stop,
give them my number.

446
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,302
I, um...

447
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,429
I'm sorry I lied to get out
of the thing.

448
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,598
- I... I shouldn't lie to you.
- Oh, it's fine.

449
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,017
I mean, thank you, and,
yeah, you shouldn't.

450
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,810
But I hope you know that's not what

451
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,520
that session was supposed to be.

452
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,106
Oh, no, I mean, I know it was
Morty peeing his pants

453
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,983
and Summer snorting glue or whatever...

454
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,945
She huffed enamel, and we
never even talked about it.

455
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,197
Well, there was so much more at stake.

456
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,451
I mean, that shrink,
what a monologuist.

457
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,996
Are we gonna go back?

458
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,915
Sweetie, could I get...
get that syringe now?

459
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,292
Oh, my God, yes!
Dad, it's in my purse.

460
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,294
Oh, I'm sorry.
You must be in agony.

461
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,587
Eh.

462
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,220
Jesus.

463
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,098
Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.

464
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,517
Weird breed.

465
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,227
Man, I missed having hands...

466
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,188
and blood and a stomach.

467
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,648
We should get a drink.

468
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,107
Really? Like, go somewhere?

469
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,693
Yeah, let's drop the kids off
and go tie one on.

470
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,445
Absolutely.

471
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,989
I-I liked her.

472
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,076
So what are you thinking,
like, Smokey's Tavern?

473
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,077
Maybe Shoney's?

474
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,120
Yeah, either one.
Either one.

475
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,405
You'll never get away
with this, Concerto.

476
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,574
That is where you're mistaken,
Mr. Sanchez.

477
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,327
This shall be my greatest
performance of all time!

478
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,415
This is it, Morty.
We're goners.

479
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,541
We're not getting out of this one.

480
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,001
After everything we've been through,

481
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,168
this is how we're gonna die.

482
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,753
Make peace with your god.

483
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,755
Oh, geez, Rick,
I-I-I don't want to die!

484
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,842
And now for the E-splat!

485
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,053
Jaguar!

486
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,268
Who... Who was that, Rick?

487
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,187
That, Morty, is why you
don't go to therapy.
