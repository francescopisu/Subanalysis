1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,600
The Allies have landed in Italy
which is occupied by the Germans.

2
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,580
In their advance towards the North
where Mussolini is still in control

3
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,080
the American, British, Canadian
and French armies

4
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,920
are held up by the solid German defense belt

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,280
along the Gustav line,
in the area of Monte Cassino.

6
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:43,400
Perched on the top of the mountain,
is historical St. Benedict's monastery.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,730
The Allies think that the Germans have turned
this 1,400 year old monument

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,960
into a look-out post.

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,280
More than 200 Allied bombers

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,760
will drop over 500 tons of bombs
on the monastery.

11
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,840
In World War 2, nothing is sacred.
It turns everything into an inferno.

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,280
RETREAT AND SURRENDER

13
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,560
The Allies launch their attack
but the German paratroopers push them back.

14
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,720
The German shock troops are now firmly
entrenched in the ruined monastery.

15
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,360
Nothing was achieved by the bombing.

16
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:05,976
These scenes were filmed
by the American director, John Huston,

17
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,710
who was sent to this front in Italy.

18
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,960
He would later say,
"It was a massacre in the freezing cold."

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,361
And yet, Churchill had called Italy
the soft under-belly of Europe.

20
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,240
By moving in from the south via Italy,
Churchill's aim is to take Berlin

21
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,560
before the Russians could.

22
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,680
The Red Army continues to advance steadily
from the east. Kiev is liberated.

23
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,910
The German Wehrmacht army
pulls out of the Ukraine

24
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,760
obeying Hitler's order
to systematically destroy everything.

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,130
In Italy, several months later,

26
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,040
the Wehrmacht is still holding
the Gustav line and Monte Cassino.

27
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,010
The French general, Juin,
proposes to surprise the Germans 

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,960
who have left those slopes,
thought to be too steep, undefended.

29
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,120
The rugged soldiers of North African
and Polish regiments, however,

30
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,690
manage to climb up the mountain
and put the Allies on the road to Rome.

31
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,920
As the Wehrmacht retreats,

32
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:46,880
it once again leaves a path of destruction
behind it.

33
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,281
But together with Mussolini,
and his remaining fascists,

34
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,160
the Germans will retain control
of Northern Italy and its industries.

35
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,760
They are the target of attacks
by Italian partisans

36
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,930
and they retaliate
with indiscriminate violence.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
At the same time, in Southern England,

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,080
the Allied war machine assembled
for the Normandy landing, is gearing up.

39
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,350
On the evening of 5th of June,
the paratroopers get ready to leave.

40
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,240
Decked out in their Indian style war paint
and haircut to make themselves feel brave.

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,480
The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces,
general Eisenhower, comes to tell them,

42
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,760
"You are about to embark
upon the great crusade."

43
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,480
The plan is to land on 5 beaches

44
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,840
along on 100 km stretch
of the Normandy coast.

45
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,910
From the Seine to the Cotentin Peninsula,

46
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,110
where the German Atlantic war defenses
are the weakest.

47
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,090
At midnight, on June the 5th,
British Gliders and Dakotas,

48
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,250
full of British, American
and Canadian paratroopers,

49
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,480
slip silently inland over the Normandy region.

50
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,600
The paratroopers are the first
to set foot in occupied France.

51
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:11,200
Their mission, to secure the flanks
of the landing zone.

52
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,520
The Allied fleet is on its way.
It is the biggest armada ever assembled.

53
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,160
Nearly 5,000 landing ships and assault craft.

54
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:29,791
Yet it is not detected by the Germans

55
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,320
who are prevented from carrying out
reconnaissance flight by the stormy weather.

56
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,800
Bombardment and shelling
from the battleships, pound the coast

57
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,800
but completely miss their targets
on the beach code named Omaha.

58
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:47,120
The German bunkers remain intact.

59
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:54,983
The first assault wave of American troops

60
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,640
is getting ready to tackle the German defenses
on Omaha beach.

61
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,390
Among them, is American writer,
Ernest Hemingway

62
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:07,395
who is a war correspondent.

63
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,320
He writes: As we moved in towards land
in the grey early light,

64
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,638
the coffin-shaped steal boats took
solid green sheets of water,

65
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,575
that fell on the helmeted heads of the troops,
packed shoulder to shoulder.

66
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:27,560
In the stiff, awkward, uncomfortable,
lonely companionship of men going to a battle.

67
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,877
Another war reporter,
the photographer Robert Capa

68
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,213
is also caught up in this inferno.

69
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,120
He says,
"It was the ugliest beach in the whole world.

70
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:08,640
Exhausted from the water and the fear,
we lay flat on a small strip of wet sand."

71
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,990
Over 2,000 American soldiers
will lose their lives here.

72
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,200
As the tide rolls in, the soldiers are trapped

73
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,134
between the sea and gun fire
from the German blockhouses.

74
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,920
Eisenhower had prepared a communique
in case the landing failed.

75
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,840
In a hand-written letter he said,

76
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
"My decision to attack at this place
was based on the best information available.

77
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,920
If there is any blame or fault attached
to the attempt, it is mine alone."

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,420
But a small group succeeds in climbing up
under enemy fire

79
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,550
and neutralizing the German cannons

80
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,960
with the help of
Royal Air Force's fighter bombers.

81
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,440
In the meantime, the Canadian troops
have landed on Juno Beach.

82
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:05,513
There is indeed very little resistances,
only a few shots

83
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,560
that do not deter the British
on the next beach along.

84
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,440
The few German defenders who survived
the bombardments, finally surrender.

85
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,000
British and French commandos
land on the fifth beach.

86
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,040
The Allies plan to land 326,000 men.

87
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,650
In just one week,
a daily average of 10,000 men,

88
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,590
3,200 vehicles and 15,000 tons of supplies
are ferried across.

89
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,550
In order to accomplish this,
a harbor is needed.

90
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:50,291
But the Allies decided to stay away
from the big ports 

91
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:54,763
which were too well-defended,
and to land on the beaches of Normandy.

92
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
Instead, they brought their harbors
with them.

93
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,030
Gigantic construction kits called "Mulberries".

94
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:06,170
146 concrete caissons,
61 m long and weighing 6,000 tons

95
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,310
were assembled to create
breakwaters and piers

96
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,440
where the Liberty ships, as they were called,
could unload their cargo.

97
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:17,986
American shipyards had turned out
one of these ships everyday.

98
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,840
In less than 3 years, the war industry
has turned the United States into a super power.

99
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,162
The country has mobilized more
than 11,000,000 men.

100
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:32,400
Its armies are now in France, Italy,
North Africa, and Asia.

101
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,870
The power of the United States is such

102
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,210
that, just a few days after
the Normandy landings in Europe,

103
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,440
it's able to assemble a second fleet
on the other side of the world, in the Pacific.

104
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,240
In order to attack the Mariana Islands,
which are under Japanese control.

105
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,920
Having taken the island of Tarawa
the year before,

106
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,760
the Americans now want to use
the island of Saipan

107
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,360
as a base for bombers taking off for Japan.

108
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:05,720
Some 127,500 troops, two-thirds of them
marines, prepare for combat.

109
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,120
15 aircraft carriers and 900 planes
will crush the Japanese Air Force

110
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,880
in an air battle will come to be known
as "The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot".

111
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,880
A fatal blow is also dealt
to the Japanese Imperial Navy.

112
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,760
After which, Japan's defenses in Saipan
are battered.

113
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,080
But when the marines land on this tiny island,
which is only 9 km wide,

114
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,720
one of the bloodiest battles of the war begins.

115
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,920
Over 15,000 Americans and at least
27,000 Japanese will be killed or wounded.

116
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,640
A month and a half after D-Day,
the fighting is still fierce.

117
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,280
The Allies are advancing,
but Eisenhower is worried.

118
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,960
Hitler is determined to contain the Allies
in Normandy

119
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,160
in order to protect the launch ramps
for his weapon of terror, the V-1

120
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,440
which he fires at London
from the Northern France.

121
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,000
It is the first cruise missile ever to be used.

122
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:57,120
The V-1 is a flying bomb, with a pulse jet
engine and a 1 ton explosive warhead.

123
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,480
This small, swift, pilotless aircraft
is difficult to intercept and shoot down.

124
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,690
The British call them "Buzz bombs"
because they made motorcycle noise

125
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,840
that alert Londoners to their arrival.

126
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,410
By the time the V-1s reach the capital city,
their fuel is used up and their engines die out.

127
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,960
Londoners never know where they will fall.

128
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,050
Nearly 20,000 of these missiles were launched
against England and continental Europe.

129
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,840
Killing 11,000 people.

130
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,290
But even under these conditions,

131
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
the British retain their pluck
and their composure.

132
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,360
If the V-1s fail to demoralize the British,

133
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,940
their purpose was also to boost
the morale of the Germans.

134
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,320
For years, they have had to live
in underground shelters.

135
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,819
American bombers by day
and British bombers by night

136
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,560
demolish Germany's cities,
under a carpet of bombs.

137
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,860
American planes drop 1,400,000 tons of bombs.

138
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:23,320
Allied bombing led to around
600,000 casualties. 7,000,000 homeless.

139
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,403
Such is the outcome of
the strategic bombing campaign

140
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,770
whose purpose is to destroy the industrial
and human potential

141
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,800
behind Germany's war time effort.

142
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,680
In the Führer's headquarters, the Wolf's Lair, 

143
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,480
beneath the obligatory smiles,
many of Hitler's officers are deeply troubled.

144
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,880
Especially those from
the old Prussian military aristocracy.

145
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,320
In the past year, many of them
have joined a plot to get rid of Hitler.

146
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,320
One of these officers,
colonel Count Claus von Stauffenberg,

147
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,800
places a bomb under Hitler's desk
during a conference in the Wolf's Lair.

148
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,840
It is this heavy table, that saves Hitler.

149
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,480
It deflects the blast, that would eventually
kill 4 men and wound 20 others.

150
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,105
Of the failed assassination attempt,
Hitler says,

151
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,840
"Having now escaped death,
I am more than ever convinced

152
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,000
that the great cause that I served
will be brought through its present perils

153
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,080
and that everything can be brought
to a good end.

154
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,400
Hitler is only slightly injured, a bruised arm,
his eardrums punctured, his hair singed.

155
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,320
But the incident deeply traumatizes him,
affecting his mental state.

156
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,120
Intensifying his cruelty and his paranoia.

157
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,640
He unleashes his revenge.

158
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,920
The main conspirators are tried.
5,000 suspects were arrested,

159
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,040
200 of them executed
and their families deported.

160
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,476
He has no second thoughts
about executing his marshals.

161
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,350
Because he agreed to replace Hitler
at the head of the army,

162
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,649
Rommel is forced to commit suicide.

163
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,280
Hitler hypocritically gives him a state funeral.

164
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:26,000
Henceforth, power is in the hands of the SS.
Nothing can save Germany now.

165
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,800
The Russians continue to advance in the East.

166
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,600
"The Great Patriotic War", as they call it,
has taken a new turn for them.

167
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,520
The Red Army is suddenly able to strike
with a force that amazes all sides.

168
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,560
An endless supply of men.

169
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,480
Even after the extremely costly battles
of Moscow and Stalingrad.

170
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,040
The offensive in Belarus
in the summer of 1944

171
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,600
is one of the biggest battles
of the second World War.

172
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
The Eastern front is 1,000 km wide.

173
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,840
But the Russians are able to push forward
100s of kilometers within 2 months

174
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,960
destroying 17 German army divisions.

175
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,390
The Wehrmacht retreats towards East Prussia,
leaving behind many thousands of casualties.

176
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,840
Some 50,000 captured Germans will be paraded
through Moscow.

177
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,680
In the West,
the Allies are gaining the upper hand.

178
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,120
For the Wehrmacht,
the situation is deteriorating.

179
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,850
50,000 German soldiers are taken prisoner
in the Falaise pocket,

180
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,200
or as the Germans call it,
"Stalingrad in Normandy".

181
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:58,760
It is a much needed victory for the Allies.

182
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,400
The Allies tighten their noose
with a new landing in Provence.

183
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,200
The reassembled French Army
plays a major part in this landing.

184
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,943
Africans, Moroccans,
Algerians, Tunisians, French colonials

185
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,240
and young Frenchmen,
who were part of the Free French Forces

186
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,916
aid the liberation in Provence.

187
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,400
It takes them just 2 weeks to liberate
the entire coast, up to Marseille.

188
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,920
The resistance movement comes out
of the shadows

189
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,600
and participates in the liberation,
as it will do in Paris.

190
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,200
Paris rises up.
Barricades are erected across the city.

191
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,120
Most of the German army has retreated
to the East,

192
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,840
but 20,000 men remain behind,
under the command of general von Choltitz

193
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,960
who is received orders from Hitler
to destroy the city.

194
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,100
Violent fighting breaks out.

195
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,528
On the fourth day of the insurrection,
a French unit,

196
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,800
general Lecrec's 2nd Armor Division,
arrives from Normandy.

197
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,640
And the capital is finally liberated
the next morning.

198
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,760
The Germans surrender
and General von Choltitz is taken

199
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,880
to Leclerc's headquarters
in the Montparnasse train station.

200
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,240
Hitler had just called and
asked his famous question,

201
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,560
"Brennt Paris?"
"Is Paris burning?"

202
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,709
Choltitz preferred to turn himself in.

203
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,545
This highly disciplined officer
from the airborne regiment,

204
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,040
disobeyed Hitler's order
to fight to the last man.

205
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,160
Then de Gaulle arrives
with eloquent words for history.

206
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,400
Paris has been offended,
Paris has been shattered,

207
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,640
Paris has been tortured,

208
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,280
but Paris has been liberated!

209
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,280
While France and Belgium
are progressively liberated,

210
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,275
and the Red Army waits outside Warsaw,

211
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,950
on the other side of the globe,
the American general MacArthur,

212
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,600
is returning to the Philippines.

213
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,800
After escaping from the Japanese siege
3 years earlier, MacArthur said, "I shall return."

214
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,630
His return is sumptuously staged
by his public relation staff,

215
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,070
complete with
his legendary Popeye corn cob pipe.

216
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,640
He proclaims,
"People of the Philippines, I have returned.

217
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:10,880
The hour of your redemption is here."

218
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:21,185
But it will take 4 months to liberate
the Philippines.

219
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,880
Manila, the capital, will be the second most
devastated city of the war, after Warsaw.

220
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,400
The savagery and the cruelty of these combats
can be explained 

221
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,120
by the American troops' discovery
of the mass execution of hostages.

222
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,520
And the camps with the surviving US prisoners
from 1941.

223
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,520
Everywhere in the Pacific,
the war is marked by this type of savagery.

224
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:12,200
Everywhere, the same confusion of marines
trapped on the beaches of these inferno islands.

225
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,056
The same suicidal obstinacy of the Japanese.

226
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,800
For them, surrendering
is the ultimate disgrace.

227
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,440
The Americans are no longer taking any risks.

228
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,840
They follow the nstinct to shoot first,
and ask no questions.

229
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,040
Along with imperialism, another underlying
cause of World War 2 is racism.

230
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Racism gave birth to Auschwitz,
the killing factory.

231
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,720
Liberated by the Russian offensive
of January 1945.

232
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Hatred of the Jews, exterminating them,
was, as Hitler wrote in "Mein Kampf".

233
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
His mission.

234
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,560
He sent 1,000,000 Jews to their death
in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

235
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,640
6,000,000 died of starvation,
brutal treatment,

236
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:17,280
were shot and burned in the crematoriums
in Majdanek, in Sobibor, in Treblinka.

237
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,040
The Russians find a few hundreds survivors,
tattooed for life.

238
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,480
They also intercept the trains full of deportees.

239
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,818
The Nazis continue to give priority
to these death trains

240
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,760
even over the munitions convoys.

241
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:45,825
They make their trips to
the approximately 100 concentration camps

242
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,240
that are still operating
at the beginning of 1945.

243
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,840
Millions of Jews, political activists, opponents,

244
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,760
Christians, homosexuals, Gypsies,
have been deported to these camps.

245
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,440
And 5,000,000 of them have died of hunger,
abuse and exhaustion.

246
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,480
Like the slaves in the Dora tunnel,
the underground factory

247
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,480
where the Nazis are assembling
another secret weapon, the V-2.

248
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,990
The first ballistic missile
with a 1 ton explosive warhead

249
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,900
that has a range of 300 km.

250
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,720
From the German coast, 1,500 of them
are launched against London.

251
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,240
And 2,000 against Belgium, adding to
the devastation and the civilian casualties.

252
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,480
The Allies' greatest fear is that
it might one day, carry a nuclear charge.

253
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,482
The eminent scientist Einstein himself
had warned Roosevelt

254
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,990
about the urgency of getting ahead
of the Germans.

255
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,400
Huge funds were provided
and a team of scientists

256
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,920
secretly went to work
on the first atomic bomb.

257
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,120
A bomb that uses a metal, uranium
that makes it possible to split the atom.

258
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,240
It is expected to have
the power of 20,000 tons of TNT.

259
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,170
More than 2,000 times more powerful
than the largest bomb used to date,

260
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:13,080
in addition to lethal radioactive fall out.

261
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,760
The designated target was Berlin.

262
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,040
But this first atomic bomb will not be finished
in time for Germany.

263
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,058
In Germany,
are there any factories that still standing 

264
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,030
that will be capable producing such a weapon?

265
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,280
Even synthetic fuel is becoming scarce.

266
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,534
The carpet bombing, carried day and night
by the Allies,

267
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:37,880
continues to devastate German cities.

268
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,960
The Allied bombers will destroy Dresden.

269
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,960
An important center of communications
for the German armies on the Eastern Front.

270
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,290
And one of the biggest industrial cities
in the Reich.

271
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,840
Until now, it has remained untouched.

272
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:06,920
Dresden, known as the "Florence of the Elba"
was one of Europe's finest medieval cities.

273
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,238
Phosphorus bombs create a fire typhoon

274
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,120
in which an estimated 25,000 people
are burned to death.

275
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,400
The city continues to blaze for 7 days.

276
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,250
Churchill had said,
"We will make the German people taste

277
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,200
and gulp a sharper dose of the miseries
they have showered upon mankind.

278
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Their cities are dying
and now Goebbels and the Nazis

279
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,830
want to send all Germans
from 16 to 60 years old

280
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,040
to their deaths as part of the "Volkssturm",
the People's Militia.

281
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,000
They shout, "I vow to fight courageously
for my homeland.

282
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,240
Swear to die for Adolf Hitler."

283
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,480
Hitler says, "There must be not be
any weakening of Germany."

284
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,240
His generals, those who survived
the massive purge

285
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,960
following the July 20th assassination attempt,
no longer dare to oppose the Führer.

286
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,660
They obeyed his order which seemed absurd,

287
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,320
to launch an attack in the West,
in the Ardennes during winter.

288
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,520
They would have preferred to devote
all their efforts to fighting the Russians.

289
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,880
Hitler was hoping to recapture
the Port of Antwerp,

290
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,880
in order to stop the Allies from unloading
their equipment,

291
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,280
which would enable them to move into Germany.

292
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,760
But the German offensive
in the Ardennes failed,

293
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,440
due to the extraordinary defense, put up
by the American paratroopers in Bastoigne

294
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,400
to the intervention of general Patton's tanks

295
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,760
and to the overwhelming power
of the Allied Air Forces.

296
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,550
As for the Russians in the east,
they are crossing the German border.

297
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,240
Millions of Germans flee in panic
from the approaching Soviet troops.

298
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:10,957
Especially the German women,

299
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,760
who fear the mass rapes
that are being perpetrated.

300
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,405
There is no dissension between
the Western Allies and the Russians.

301
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,609
Moreover, in Churchill's mind,
the problem with Germany is practically over.

302
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,960
He is now thinking about how to divide up
the occupation zones.

303
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,320
He and Roosevelt meet in the Crimea
for an important conference with Stalin.

304
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,100
Concerned about the increasing losses 
being suffered in the Pacific,

305
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:56,200
Roosevelt has come to press Stalin
to join the war effort against Japan.

306
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,609
Stalin has made Roosevelt
come all the way out to Crimea

307
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,110
which takes a toll
on the ailing president's health.

308
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,450
He is drawn and emaciated.

309
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:11,840
He barely has the strength
to hold out his arm.

310
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,400
Roosevelt smokes cigarette after cigarette.
He is very frail.

311
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,480
He will pass away a few weeks later.

312
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,202
His main priority is Japan.

313
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:32,440
At the same time he does not have
the strength to oppose Stalin

314
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,440
who liberates but also occupies,
the Baltic States,

315
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:40,920
Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Silesia and Prussia.

316
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,080
And there is no way to make him leave.

317
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,480
The only one who tries to negotiate is Churchill.

318
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,440
Finally, he gets Stalin to promise to hold
free elections in Poland.

319
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,280
A promise that will never be kept.

320
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,560
And to give up Greece
which will led to civil war.

321
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,800
The Greek communist partisans will rise up
and Stalin will let them be massacred.

322
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,612
One of the goals of this conference

323
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,840
is the founding of the organization
of the United Nations

324
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,980
which will soon be convened
in San Francisco.

325
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,060
The UN mission will be to seek a
peaceful settlement for all disputes

326
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,680
and to protect human rights.

327
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,840
This picture heralds
the beginning of the Cold War.

328
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,739
The war in the Pacific continues.

329
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,740
The marines raise the American flag 
on top of mount Suribachi.

330
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,200
The volcano that dominates 
the island of Iwo Jima.

331
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,800
The battle took the lives of 7,000 Americans
and 20,000 Japanese.

332
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,080
It is now possible for
the Boeing B29 Super Fortress Bombers

333
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,400
taking off from Iwo Jima and other islands
on the Pacific to reach Japan.

334
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,360
Humans have invented something
even more vicious

335
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,160
than the phosphorus used in Dresden,
Napalm.

336
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,760
Gasoline mixed with incendiary jelly.

337
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,600
1,700 tons dropped on little houses,
made of wood and paper.

338
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
The Japanese are victims
of their fanatical military leaders,

339
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,200
who plunged them into this inferno
and who wanted to pursue the war

340
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,840
in spite of the 80,000 victims and the 1,000,000
homeless from this air raid over Tokyo.

341
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,880
7 years earlier,
Hitler was at his chalet in Bavarian Alps,

342
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,960
along with his dog Blondi, of whom he seemed
to be fond of more than any human being.

343
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,530
He predicted, "The next war would not end
like the First World War.

344
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:11,640
There will be no 11th of November.
It would be either victory or annihilation.

345
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,080
Perhaps this vertiginous feeling of
"All or nothing"

346
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,560
is what kept him from marrying
his mistress, Eva Braun.

347
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,480
He said,
"I'm already married to Germany."

348
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,560
His Germany is on the verge of collapse.

349
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,680
The Soviet forces have surrounded Berlin.

350
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,760
But Hitler refuses to admit defeat.

351
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,720
He says,
"It will be the opposite of Stalingrad."

352
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,640
But his remaining soldiers overwhelmed
by the Russian rocket launchers

353
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,240
surrender, one after the other.

354
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,364
Beneath the ruins of the Chancellery,
in his underground bunker,

355
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,520
Hitler rants and raves and maneuvers
his imaginary armies.

356
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,139
The last of his faithful followers
take advantage of a lull,

357
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,410
to come out and celebrate his birthday
on April the 20th.

358
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,680
Hitler is 56 years old.

359
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,800
He consoles these Hitler youth
who have been chosen because their parents

360
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,960
have just been killed
in the bombing of Dresden.

361
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:42,680
As the Americans advance westward,
they capture thousands of this Hitler Jugend.

362
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,570
Sent to the front to replace the soldiers
who've been killed.

363
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,840
The Americans can hardly believe
their eyes.

364
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,120
These boy soldiers are afraid of nothing.

365
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,310
They have undergone years of brainwashing.

366
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,410
Hatred and racism have been indoctrinated
into them.

367
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,050
The old men in the Volkstrum
who are also captured,

368
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,840
have no words of comfort for them.

369
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,280
The Americans met up with the Russians
on the Elbe, near the Torgau bridge.

370
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,950
East meets West, the final act of the alliance.

371
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,840
The atmosphere is friendly, for the cameras.

372
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,300
Stalin's portrait is superbly displayed.

373
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,440
But Roosevelt's is draped
in black mourning crepe. He died on April the 12th.

374
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,510
One of America's most renowned generals,
George S. Patton is furious.

375
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,760
He thinks the Americans should have
entered Berlin before the Russians.

376
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,950
Patton, the man with a pistol in his belt

377
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,480
who drove his tanks through Africa
through Normandy, through the Ardennes.

378
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,240
He says to Eisenhower,
"The 9th Army is 60 miles from Berlin.

379
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:34,040
Not to go all the way there is a historic error
whose consequences will be very grave."

380
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,760
Eisenhower says nothing.

381
00:34:38,814 --> 00:34:43,418
The only thing that matters to him
is to eliminate Hitler and the Nazis.

382
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,220
A few days earlier,
Patton had called him up urgently,

383
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,440
wanting him to witness the horrors
of the concentration camp at Buchenwald.

384
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,240
Eisenhower had the inhabitants
of the nearby city of Weimar

385
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,840
taken there in trucks, so that they
could no longer say that they did not know.

386
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,850
In order to show them
that such things did exist.

387
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,800
So that they would be able to testify
in Germany.

388
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,640
To say that they had seen the tattoos
collected from the corpses of the deported.

389
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,680
The lamp shades, made of human skin.

390
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,880
The shrunken-head paper weights.

391
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,330
Then, in accordance with the Yalta Agreements,

392
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Eisenhower withdrew his troops
from Buchenwald

393
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,160
which was located in the Soviet zone.

394
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,600
Stalin immediately put the camp back to work.

395
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,920
It will become part of his prison system

396
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,010
where people suspected of hostility
towards his regime, will be imprisoned.

397
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,640
In Berlin, the Russians are 300 m away
from the Führer's bunker.

398
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,601
Hitler kills his pet dog Blondi,
after marrying Eva Braun.

399
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:21,520
She swallows a cyanide pill.
Hitler shoots himself in the head.

400
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,480
Goebbels and his wife also committed suicide.

401
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:31,800
Before that, Magda Goebbels had poisoned
her 6 children.

402
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,390
In her last letter she wrote:

403
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,600
That we can end our lives together
with the Führer

404
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,560
is a blessing for which we never dared
to hope.

405
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,280
The Soviets will raise their Red Flag
over the Reichstag.

406
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,520
The main Nazi leaders will be captured.

407
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,120
Like Göring,
one of Hitler's most diabolical accomplices.

408
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,000
In Italy, Mussolini is executed by partisans
and his body is lynched by the crowd.

409
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,210
Everywhere in Europe,
a wave of revenge is unleashed

410
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,880
against those who in one way or another,
collaborated with the devils.

411
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,000
In Berlin, Anna Pavlovna directs traffic
at the Brandenburg gate.

412
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200
To defeat Nazi Germany,
Russia paid a very high price.

413
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,700
20,000,000 civilians and soldiers were killed.

414
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,610
Nearly 15 percent of the population
of the Soviet Union.

415
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,080
Soviet general Georgy Zhukov

416
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,840
has himself filmed in the ruins
of the Grand Chancellery of the Reich.

417
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,800
The very symbol of Hitler's delusions
of grandeur.

418
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,920
And finally, in Hitler's office,

419
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,640
with the famous globe that Charlie Chaplin
parodied in his movie, "The Great Dictator".

420
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,040
Hitler had ordered the SS to burn his body.

421
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,360
The Soviets will get rid of the bones
in order to prevent any kind of hero worship.

422
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,240
Wehrmacht commander Marshall Keitel,

423
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,470
signs the unconditional surrender
of Nazi Germany

424
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,400
in front of general Zhukov, his mortal enemy

425
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,560
and the Allied officers,
the British Air Marshall, Tedder,

426
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,920
the American general, Spaatz
and the French general, de Lattre de Tassigny.

427
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,050
Keitel will later be tried
at the International Nuremberg Trials.

428
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,960
He will be hanged,
like many other war criminals.

429
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,868
To stop the Nazis,
Germany had to be annihilated.

430
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,280
Will it also be necessary to annihilate Japan?

431
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,960
In the Pacific, the suicide pilots,
that the Japanese call "Kamikaze",

432
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,480
nose dive their planes into the American fleet.

433
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,960
Clutching on to their power,
the military chiefs in Tokyo

434
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,000
sacrifice what remains
of their country's youth and their aircraft,

435
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,920
in order to prevent the Americans
from landing in Japan.

436
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,760
In the end, the United States decides against
an invasion in Japan

437
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,600
which it thinks will cost the country
a million lives.

438
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,600
Instead, it detonates the atomic inferno.

439
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,280
The first 2 nuclear bombs ever exploded
kill in 1 second, over 100,000 people.

440
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:18,200
And finally enable the emperor, Hirohito
to seek peace without losing face.

441
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,400
The atom bomb had to be dropped
before these Japanese soldiers

442
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,870
and officers would finally consent
to perform this act.

443
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,640
Which is entirely contrary to the "Bushido",
their code of honor.

444
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,280
A few Japanese soldiers take to the jungle.

445
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Some never even learn of
their country's defeat.

446
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,120
The last of these will come out from hiding
and turned themselves in, in 1975.

447
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,280
In Tokyo Bay onboard the USS Missouri,
the representatives of the Allied Nations

448
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,120
from China, Great Britain, Russia
and France are filled with emotions.

449
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:58,638
They have the privileges of attending
the signing of the Japanese surrender

450
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,960
that marks the end of World War 2.

451
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,640
General MacArthur represents the victors.

452
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,920
The Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs,
in a top hat,

453
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,360
walks with a limp, having lost a leg
in a bomb attack in China,

454
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,200
will signing on behalf of the Emperor,
with whom he had met the day before.

455
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,870
He had told him,
"We must make off this day of mourning,

456
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:35,642
the first day of the birth of a new Japan.

457
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,800
In that way, we can go to the ceremony 
with our heads held high."

458
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,760
MacArthur concludes with these historic words:

459
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,360
It is my earnest hope and indeed
the hope of all mankind

460
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,200
that from this solemn occasion
a better world shall emerge out of the blood

461
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,070
and carnage of the past.

462
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,320
This war took the lives of some
50,000,000 people.

463
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,840
Most of them innocent civilians
in an outbreak of pure violence.

464
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,600
Thousands of victims suffered
for many years afterwards

465
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,480
from the appalling after effects
of nuclear radiation.

466
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,320
Or from the terrible loss
of parents or children

467
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,520
exterminated in the Nazi's camps.

468
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,440
This series is dedicated to the victims
of all forms of totalitarianism.

469
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,160
Let us be grateful to the cameramen,

470
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,160
the unarmed heroes who recorded
these combats for posterity.

471
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,440
And to all, who filmed the war
in all of its atrocity and its familiarity.

472
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,440
They introduced us to Rose,
who on the last day of the apocalypse,

473
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,040
wrote "The End" on a bomb.
