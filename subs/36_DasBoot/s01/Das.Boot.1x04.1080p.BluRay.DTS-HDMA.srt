1
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:22,121
All full ahead, left full rudder.
Come to 1-0-7.

2
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:23,401
Stand by to attack.

3
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:30,201
Watch the pressure
of the lubricating oil!

4
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:35,441
Bow angle bearing 0-5-0.

5
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,121
Locked on.

6
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,081
- Range, 2200 metres.
- Check.

7
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,241
Those two that are overlapping...

8
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:46,561
...double shot on the big one.
The other two, a single each.

9
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:50,161
- Targets identified.
- Right standard rudder.

10
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,441
All ahead one-third. Open bow caps.

Lock on tubes one and two.
New bow angle 0-6-3.

00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,601

00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:08,081

22
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,761
Destroyer ahead!

23
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,641
Alarm!

24
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,641
All hands forward!
Forward diving position!

25
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,121
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Keep it moving!

26
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,121
- Clear the way!
- Move, move, move! Keep it moving!

27
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:01,161
Watch out!

28
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:03,001
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

29
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:13,761
Battle stations!

30
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:19,121
Bow planes up 10, stern up 5.

31
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:21,241
Clear the way!

32
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,161
Sit down!

33
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,121
Keep quiet, you men.

34
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:29,641
- Down 80 metres.
- Down 80 metres.

35
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,721
Easy.

36
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:34,921
Bow down 15, stern up 10.

37
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,641
What about the torpedoes?

38
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,361
Any minute now.

39
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,081
Not long to go now.

40
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,721
110.

41
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:03,961
120.

42
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,961
Those lousy torpedoes.
They don't run true.

43
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:10,641
What a crazy thing to do.

44
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,721
Charging in like that.

45
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,001
That destroyer won't let us
off the hook.

46
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:19,281
They'll try and hunt us down,
you'll see.

47
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,761
We hit the first.

48
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,681
Out of the way!

49
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:35,041
We hit her! We hit her!
Quiet!

50
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,361
Time's up for the third torpedo.

51
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,241
Number three.

52
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,641
Now they are going to the bottom.

53
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,921
It's the bulkheads. They've collapsed.

54
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,881
This is it.

55
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,121
Now it's payback time.

56
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:20,881
- Well?
- Destroyer bearing 0-4-4.

57
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:23,801
- In our direction?
- Moving left.

58
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:26,241
Fading, sir.

59
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:43,081
Right full rudder.
Both engines ahead two-thirds.

60
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:48,041
Rudder is right full. Both engines
indicate ahead two-thirds.

61
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,081
Astern of us.

62
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,521
Way astern of us.

63
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,961
They're spitting in the wrong direction.

64
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,041
We haven't thrown them off yet.

65
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,401
I reckon they won't be too happy.

66
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:22,121
- Propeller noises.
- Propeller noises.

67
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:25,681
<i>Contact bearing 2-7-0, closing.</i>

68
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:30,641
- Both engines ahead one-third.
- Both engines ahead one-third.

69
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,481
Both main engines indicate
ahead one-third.

70
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,361
Now you'll see.

71
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,441
All full ahead!

72
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:16,361
- Pump out 150 litres!
- Main engines indicate full head!

73
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:16,881
Asdic.

74
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:21,161
Detector system. Ultrasonic.

75
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,001
The swine.

76
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,921
The filthy, rotten swine.

77
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:11,001
- What's the damage?
- Air shaft fractured.

78
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,321
Quiet, boys.

79
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:21,281
Keep it quiet.

80
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,921
Nice and quiet, now.

81
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:14,761
- Whole dead slow.
- Fifty rpm. Kill the fans.

82
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:19,801
- Left 15 degrees.
- Left 15 degrees.

83
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,121
Stern left 15, sir.

84
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:40,121
- Shit!
- All full ahead!

85
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,361
Let's get the hell out of here!

86
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:56,081
- Both ballasts and gate were fractured.
- Isolate it. Isolate it!

87
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,561
Shut it down!

88
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,841
My God! We're on fire!

89
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,761
Motor room caught fire.

90
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:09,921
Cut to number two auxiliary!

91
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,761
Calm down! Calm down, for God's sake!

92
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,801
Chief, emergency ventilation.

93
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,521
Switch on fans,
connect emergency cartridges.

94
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:38,081
Boy, oh, boy.

95
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,721
She doesn't want to let go of us.

96
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,721
What's going on?

97
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,161
Running away?

98
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:10,841
We have really smashed them.

99
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:16,441
My God, those bulkheads.

100
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,801
What's her bearing?

101
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:34,561
0-6-5, sir. Bearing constant.

102
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:41,521
Deeper, chief. Silent speed.

103
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:11,001
- Bearing?
- 0-5-0.

104
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:14,801
Growing louder.

105
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,201
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:36,881
Yeah.

107
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:50,321
Deeper still. Right 30 degrees.

108
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,001
We'll try doubling back.

109
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,481
Keep them guessing.

110
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,801
Bow planes steady. Stern up 10.

111
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,961
Contact bearing 2-7-0.

112
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,081
It's fading.

113
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,801
- Right full rudder.
- Right full rudder.

114
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,281
Rudder is right full, sir.

115
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,561
Steer 0-9-0.

116
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:48,201
Shit!

117
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:53,281
Second contact closing fast,
bearing 0-7-6!

118
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:59,201
Backup.

119
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:03,721
Those bastards.

120
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,241
Deeper.

121
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,201
But, sir...

122
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,041
Yes, deeper.

123
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:50,281
Bow planes down 10.
Stern planes up 7.

124
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,041
190 metres.

125
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:22,521
200 metres.

126
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,281
210 metres.

127
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,561
220 metres.

128
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,561
230 metres.

129
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,161
The bolts! They're bursting!

130
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,721
That's deep enough, chief.
Ten metres rise!

131
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:14,481
All ahead starboard.

132
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:15,841
Look out!

133
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,801
Quiet, men, quiet.

134
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,481
Quiet.

135
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:04,881
Bring her up to 150 metres!
Both full ahead!

136
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:11,881
Both full ahead, sir!

137
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,801
Left 20 degrees! Steer 0-5-0!

138
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,401
Steering on course 0-5-0, sir!

139
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,321
He is near his mark.

140
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:23,361
Not bad.

141
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:27,721
The foundation bolts are loose!

142
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,521
Quiet, damn you!

143
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:45,201
Reports! I want actual damage reports!

144
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:50,121
Leaking badly.
We are leaking badly.

145
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:54,961
Engine room taking water!

146
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,321
Captain, permission to inspect
engine room.

147
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,521
- Number One, take over!
- Aye, aye, captain.

148
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,681
- The exhaust flap.
- What's the trouble?

149
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:08,321
- Shit!
- The flange bolts are sheared.

150
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,121
I need gaskets! Fast!

151
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:17,841
Where are you? Where are the gaskets!

152
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:21,561
Torpedo hatch taking water!

153
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:29,321
- Get a crowbar!
- Get a crowbar!

154
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,801
They'll soon be out of fireworks.

155
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:57,081
Exhaust flap secured.

156
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,921
150 metres, all full ahead.

157
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:04,281
Torpedo-hatch spindle secured.

158
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:19,321
What's wrong, Johann?

159
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,841
Get back to your battle station.
Right now.

160
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,321
Damn it, don't go crazy!

161
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:47,201
Back!

162
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,001
Back, Johann.

163
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,921
Back, Johann!

164
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,001
Bring him to the back. Hurry.

165
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:19,161
He's under control.

166
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:01,681
Who would have thought it of Johann?

167
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:07,561
Degrading.

168
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:11,161
Shameless.

169
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:32,001
Let it be, Hinrich, we can hear it.

170
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:57,921
Well, then, come on.

171
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,081
- Water in the machine!
- All full ahead! Maximum power!

172
00:27:06,321 --> 00:27:08,241
Both engines!

173
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:21,081
Blow!

174
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,361
180 metres!

175
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,721
190 metres!

176
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:39,521
200 metres!

177
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:48,921
210 metres!

178
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,281
220 metres!

179
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,681
We're sinking!

180
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,441
We're sinking!

181
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:12,761
Kriechbaum, make a note
for the war diary.

182
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:14,841
Captain.

183
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,521
After six hours at silent speed...

184
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:24,921
...it appears that the destroyers
have lost us.

185
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:33,361
Observing intense fire glow
at 210 degrees.

186
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,161
Probably flames from the tanker we hit.

187
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:40,041
It's noted, captain.

188
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,201
We'll surface in 10 minutes.

189
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:53,481
Notify chief engineer.
Switch to red light.

190
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:02,161
First watch, stand by for duty.

191
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,481
You see, lieutenant?

192
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:34,481
They didn't kill us.

193
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:47,601
What a wizard, the chief engineer.

194
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:52,361
He worked in the machine room
like a crazy man.

195
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:56,761
Repaired everything
with what was on hand.

196
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:00,121
Who knows how he does it.

197
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:16,001
Forward hatch secured again.

198
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,041
Torpedoes are reloaded.

199
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:22,761
Good, Lumprecht.

200
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:37,161
These boys.

201
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:42,481
These great boys.

202
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:45,561
Her back's already broken.

203
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:53,161
She's a tough one. She won't go down.

204
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:58,721
- Let's finish her off, Number One.
- Master sight to Bridge.

205
00:32:59,081 --> 00:33:02,241
- Final shot. Flood number one tube.
- Flood number one tube.

206
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:05,721
Number one tube is being flooded.

207
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,641
Number one ready for surface firing.

208
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:11,641
- Target speed, zero.
- Check.

209
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:14,921
- Range, 650 metres.
- Check.

210
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:18,401
Depth, four. Torpedo speed, 30.

211
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,961
Aiming point?
Forward of aft mast.

212
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:27,001
- Tube one ready.
- Tube one is ready.

213
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,321
- Tube one.
- Tube one.

214
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:31,201
- Fire.
- Fire!

215
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:33,041
Torpedo running!

216
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:15,841
- There's still men onboard!
- There!

217
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,321
Why weren't they rescued off the ship?

218
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:32,641
Damn it! So many hours!

219
00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:42,281
Help me! Help me!

220
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,721
They're swimming towards us, captain.

221
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:03,401
Help me!

222
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:07,161
- Both engines back one-half.
- Both engines back one-half.

223
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,841
Help, save us!

224
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,201
May I clear the table?

225
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:48,081
It had to be like that.

226
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,201
Not nice, things like that.

227
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:00,321
But it had to be like that.

228
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,801
Why?

229
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:13,201
- Excuse me?
- Why did it have to be like that?

230
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:24,761
Because our boat is barely enough
for the 50 men we need here.

231
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:28,121
How many men would
you have taken in?

232
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,841
One? Ten?

233
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,201
One hundred?

234
00:37:43,601 --> 00:37:46,801
We are ordered to sink ships
where we find them.

235
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:50,081
You can ask the men who started
this war about the rest.

236
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,321
More signals, captain.

237
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,481
Read.

238
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:15,241
"Three freighters sunk. Convoy
dispersed into groups and stragglers.

239
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:20,921
Contact broken.
Cruising course, 30 degrees." U-112.

240
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:25,361
Wenzel. Not bad.

241
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:29,161
Kupsch's in contact
with the same convoy.

242
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,841
Stackmann hit a 6000-tonner.

243
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:37,681
They're having a field day.

244
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:41,641
Any hope of joining them?

245
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:48,961
Difficult. Minimum five hours away
at full speed. The fuel...

246
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,441
- We can't make...
- Yes, yes! It's good!

247
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,041
When do we turn around, captain?

248
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:26,801
When I order for us to go back.

249
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:29,521
Navigator.

250
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:04,041
Fired from tube one at 950 metres.
Hit aft mast with explosion.

251
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,641
Crew, assumed rescued,
still onboard.

252
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:09,761
Survivors jump off the fast-sinking
wreck, swim toward U-96.

253
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,841
Captain?

254
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,481
I wish to apologize.

255
00:40:52,681 --> 00:40:54,521
This is nothing you can apologize for.

256
00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:00,001
You deserted your post
at a critical moment.

257
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:03,121
You also disobeyed my order.

258
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:17,561
Am I going to be court-martialed,
captain?

259
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,841
How many patrols have you done?

260
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,761
Nine.

261
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:38,041
Why you, Johann?

262
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:43,721
This has never happened to me before,
captain.

263
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:46,441
I was...

264
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,441
I blew a fuse somehow...

265
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,241
The nerves.

266
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:06,081
It won't ever happen again, captain.
You can depend on me.

267
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,841
I swear.

268
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,801
All right, Johann.

269
00:42:18,281 --> 00:42:20,121
No court-martial, sir?

270
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:27,921
Get some sleep.

271
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:46,961
Sunk at 192 degrees.
Decision: Return 0700.

272
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:55,721
<i>What a relief.</i>

273
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:58,201
<i>After 56 days at sea...</i>

274
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,281
<i>... we are headed home.</i>

275
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,041
Cipher officer.

276
00:43:12,521 --> 00:43:14,161
We'll fix it.

277
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:18,241
- It's the bulkhead conduit.
- It'll work.

278
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:24,201
- Morning.
- Morning, captain.

279
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:26,921
Get moving.
There's a signal to be decoded.

280
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,801
Something top-secret.

281
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:41,001
Another special engagement.

282
00:43:41,801 --> 00:43:43,441
But not with us.

283
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,921
Our boat is ready for the wharf.

284
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,961
Not to mention the fuel shortage.
It won't last to La Rochelle.

285
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:52,441
- The last 100 miles...
- We'll sail.

286
00:43:53,441 --> 00:43:55,041
Don't worry, chief.

287
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:59,201
Decoded it yet?

288
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,361
Well, what is it?

289
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:07,801
For the captain only.

290
00:44:31,881 --> 00:44:35,681
Very strange. Triple-enciphered.

291
00:44:45,681 --> 00:44:47,081
Number One.

292
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:52,001
- Number One!
- Captain?

293
00:44:52,361 --> 00:44:53,801
Come here.

294
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:03,641
- Take a look at this on the map.
- Yes, captain.

295
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:27,681
Interesting.

296
00:45:38,961 --> 00:45:41,081
We've got a new destination port.

297
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:44,201
Really?

298
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:50,001
La Spezia.

299
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:53,961
- Excuse me?
- La Spezia.

300
00:45:55,641 --> 00:45:58,321
Do you suffer from deafness
all of a sudden?

301
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:04,841
- That's in...
- Italy, yeah.

302
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:12,281
Mediterranean.

303
00:46:12,441 --> 00:46:15,081
- The fuel...
- Supplied in Vigo.

304
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:17,641
Spain.

305
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:25,001
We're getting fuel, torpedoes,
provisions, everything.

306
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,641
Heart, what else could you want?

307
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,841
Vigo is 200 miles closer.

308
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:39,761
We can do that without sails.

309
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:44,281
How nice of the bosses.

310
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:48,241
They think of everything.

311
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:54,081
Starboard 15, go to 130 degrees.

312
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:02,281
Gibraltar.

313
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:10,161
What do you know.
Christmas in La Rochelle.

314
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:14,801
- Real girls in our Christmas stockings.
- The sweet telephone operators.

315
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:18,961
- The sexy newsgirls.
- We'll fuck our brains out.

316
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:22,721
A nice, slow, afternoon fuck.

317
00:47:23,681 --> 00:47:25,881
<i>- Now hear this.</i>
- The master's voice.

318
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:28,721
<i>La Rochelle's out.</i>

319
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:31,721
<i>We've got a new port of destination.</i>

320
00:47:32,761 --> 00:47:34,361
<i>La Spezia.</i>

321
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:37,321
<i>That's in the Mediterranean,
as you know.</i>

322
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:40,561
<i>First, we'll pick up fuel and supplies
at Vigo.</i>

323
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:44,481
<i>That's in Spain. Over.</i>

324
00:47:46,641 --> 00:47:48,161
Shit.

325
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:51,601
They must be crazy.

326
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:56,521
- What a dirty, rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.

327
00:47:57,081 --> 00:48:00,201
No sexy little newsgirls. No whores.

328
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:03,961
I'd like to kill those morons!

329
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:06,521
Christmas in macaroni land,
I've wished for that.

330
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:09,281
We've got to get there first,
to get to them!

331
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:13,241
- Why?
- Why? Gibraltar!

332
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:16,281
You can figure out what that means!

333
00:48:21,241 --> 00:48:23,401
That's as narrow as a virgin.

334
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,841
If you want to get through that, we need
to cover our boat with Vaseline.
