1
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,001
What do you know.
Christmas in La Rochelle.

2
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:23,041
- Real girls in our Christmas stockings.
- The sweet telephone operators.

3
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:27,161
- The sexy newsgirls.
- We'll fuck our brains out.

4
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,681
A nice, slow, afternoon fuck.

5
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:34,441
<i>- Now hear this.</i>
- The master's voice.

6
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,281
<i>La Rochelle's out.</i>

7
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:39,881
<i>We've got a new port of destination.</i>

8
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,561
<i>La Spezia.</i>

9
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,401
<i>That's in the Mediterranean,
as you know.</i>

10
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,841
<i>First, we'll pick up fuel and supplies
at Vigo.</i>

11
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,281
<i>That's in Spain. Over.</i>

12
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,001
Shit.

13
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,161
They must be crazy.

14
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:04,041
- What a dirty, rotten trick.
- There goes our Christmas stocking.

15
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,961
No sexy little newsgirls. No whores.

16
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:11,241
I'd like to kill those morons!

17
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,401
Christmas in macaroni land,
I've wished for that.

18
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:17,281
We've got to get there first,
to get to them!

19
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,921
- Why?
- Why? Gibraltar!

20
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:24,041
You can figure out what that means!

21
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:31,321
That's as narrow as a virgin.

22
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:35,561
If you want to get through that, we need
to cover our boat with Vaseline.

23
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,961
<i>Securing Rommel's supply routes,
that's our official job.</i>

24
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:49,161
<i>They're losing Africa.
We're called to the rescue.</i>

25
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,321
<i>It's insane.</i>

26
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,401
<i>We haven't enough U-boats
in the Atlantic as it is.</i>

27
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,961
Mediterranean.

28
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,921
It's madness.

29
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,921
It's swarming
with English combat ships.

30
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,161
Werner, stand by.

31
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:06,401
Zero...

32
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,481
...25 degrees, 43.3 minutes.

33
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,361
Gibraltar.

34
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,161
It's the best chance
to get ourselves killed.

35
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:34,561
When we reach Vigo, you go ashore,
Lieutenant Werner. You and the chief.

36
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,041
But, sir...

37
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,441
I've already made the decision.

38
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,441
I've got to find me a replacement
for the chief.

39
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,161
Our agents will smuggle you out
of Spain somehow.

40
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,241
Dressed up as Gypsies, for instance.

41
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,841
- But, captain, I thought I'd be going...
- No heroism.

42
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,241
It's all been settled.

43
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:09,201
It's easier to get two of you out.

44
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:16,041
Our agents will smuggle you
out of Spain somehow.

45
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:31,201
The chief needs a break.

46
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,681
He must get home.

47
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,601
I understand, sir

48
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,361
<i>The silence onboard is oppressive.</i>

49
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:07,561
<i>Each man isolated by an inner struggle
to overcome his disappointment.</i>

50
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:12,241
<i>But most of all, his fear.</i>

51
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,481
Supplies in Vigo?
But that's not possible.

52
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,521
It's not up to you to worry about it.

53
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:29,601
But Spain is neutral.

54
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,121
You're pretty smart.
They should have asked you first.

55
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,201
Tough break.

56
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,841
When we reach Vigo, it's goodbye.

57
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:23,641
Together with the chief.

58
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,201
The captain's ordered it.

59
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,921
So...

60
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:37,121
...I could deliver your mail for you.

61
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,521
Yeah.

62
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,841
There's quite a bunch of them here.

63
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:02,201
Well, it's quite a romance, isn't it?

64
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,401
<i>Vigo, Spain.</i>

65
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,041
<i>Peacetime city...</i>

66
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,961
<i>...in a neutral country.</i>

67
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,041
<i>They won't be too happy
about our presence.</i>

68
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,201
Tuesday, 64th day

69
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:03,281
My longing for the sight of dry land
is so overwhelming...

70
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:08,961
...sometimes I think I can actually
smell it. Only 24 hours to go.

71
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,241
Equalize.

72
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,161
Guess how long
I've been wearing this shirt.

73
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:15,761
- Since we sailed.
- No, three weeks before that.

74
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,881
Pipe down.

75
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:21,721
- Switch to white light.
- Hurry up with that gear.

76
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:23,641
Quiet, man!

77
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,001
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees, rudder.

78
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:39,441
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees, rudder.

79
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:44,841
All ahead one-third.
Left 10 degrees, rudder.

80
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,721
Can you see the klieg lights?

81
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:51,161
On the port bow,
double and triple flashes, wide.

82
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,041
There, navigation lights...

83
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,961
- ...a fishing boat.
- She won't spot us.

84
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:08,921
Traffic's pretty heavy around here.

85
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,361
We'd better make sure
we don't run anyone down.

86
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:21,201
Right, Kriechbaum?

87
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,481
That's a new one.

88
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,081
Right.

89
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,961
Keep a check on water depth.

90
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,441
Twenty-six metres.

91
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,721
- Lieutenant.
- 26.5 metres.

92
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:50,441
- Thank you.
- Twenty-six metres. Constant.

93
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,321
Now we just have to find
this little barge.

94
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:02,481
<i>SS Weser.</i>

95
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:07,081
German merchant ship.
She's got herself interned here.

96
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,881
With a bellyful of torpedoes,
fuel and supplies.

97
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:17,921
- And that's all for us, Kriechbaum.
- Yeah, first-class service.

98
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:33,281
Starboard beam,
is it a customs launch?

99
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,161
No, fishing trawler.

100
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,161
- There.
- Where?

101
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,361
Over there, sir.

102
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,881
Signaling an A,
a code for us to approach.

103
00:11:57,601 --> 00:12:01,561
Both engines ahead two-thirds.
Left 5 degrees, rudder.

104
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,481
Both engines ahead two-thirds.
Left 5 degrees, rudder.

105
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:28,361
We arrived.

106
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,441
Port engine stop.

107
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,401
Officers to bridge.

108
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:05,681
Gentlemen.

109
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,481
Three cheers for our brave U-boat men.

110
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:16,441
<i>- Sieg...
- Heil.</i>

111
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,841
<i>- Sieg...
- Heil!</i>

112
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,521
<i>- Sieg...
- Heil!</i>

113
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:30,641
Welcome, captain lieutenant.

114
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:33,201
No, no. Please.

115
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,321
This is...

116
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:39,841
- This is our commander.
- My apologies, sir. I...

117
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,081
A pleasure to have you aboard
the Weser, captain lieutenant.

118
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:48,281
A hero.

119
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:51,641
I'm delighted to be so honoured.

120
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:55,401
Gentlemen, here they stand...

121
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,281
our heroes of the deep.

122
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,641
The Grey Wolves.

123
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,881
Our humble ship is honoured...

124
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,481
...by the momentous occasion
such as this is.

125
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,001
Captain, lead the way.

126
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:12,361
- Welcome aboard.
- Nice tugboat you got here.

127
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,001
Looking forward to meeting you.

128
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,521
So here we are, captain.

129
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:22,001
...we've done what we can in our
modest way. I hope it's to your taste.

130
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:25,521
Quite a table. Just like home.

131
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:29,561
Fresh bread,
cakes from the ship's bakery...

132
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:33,601
...belly of pork, fresh sausage,
slaughtered today, of course.

133
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:37,761
Well, we're waiting to hear your news.

134
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,041
Can't imagine what it means to us.

135
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,641
It isn't easy here. Despite what
people say, it's very frustrating.

136
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:49,361
Sure, there's plenty to eat.
Fuel supply's no problem.

137
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:53,561
Torpedoes are tricky, though.
Very tricky. Never mind.

138
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,801
You're all set up.

139
00:14:57,161 --> 00:15:01,241
The Spaniards tolerate us,
but you couldn't call them enthusiastic.

140
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,641
Christmas cake.

141
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,041
Now, tell us...

142
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:12,041
...how many ships have you sunk?
Now, let's see. I guess about...

143
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:15,561
Oh, champagne. How forgetful of me.

144
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,361
Take a glass.

145
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,761
Gentlemen, raise your glasses.

146
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,481
Drink to our heroes.

147
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:26,201
We're proud of you.

148
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:31,321
To the German U-boats service
and to our beloved... -

149
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:37,041
Oh, yes. We're not exactly at home,
if you understand what I mean.

150
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,761
Toast. All the best.

151
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:42,241
Cheers.

152
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:47,281
And now, plenty for everyone.
Come on.

153
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,761
- Okay. Let's get down to business.
- Yes, come along.

154
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,761
Yes, now, tell us all about it, captain.
Continue.

155
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,761
I'm bursting with curiosity.

156
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,321
Those are fresh figs.

157
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,681
Fresh figs.

158
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,321
Never had one.

159
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:22,081
Keep quiet.

160
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,801
This time, we very nearly had it.

161
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:35,281
Phenomenal.

162
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,641
See, gentlemen,
that's the stuff heroes are made of.

163
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:42,721
There's no other word for it
except "phenomenal."

164
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:46,801
Come on, captain, I want to hear more.
Here, give me your plate.

165
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:50,921
Herring salad,
another specialty of our chef.

166
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:53,321
You have to try it.

167
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,841
His mother's recipe.

168
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,681
Yes, and so...

169
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,521
...what's it like to be underwater?

170
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,361
To be submerged...

171
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:09,121
...while overhead,
the enemy lies in wait.

172
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:11,161
It's dark.

173
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:15,201
- Dark?
- Yes, and very quiet.

174
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,481
Just as long as no one farts.

175
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,441
- Why is that?
- Well, as long as no one...

176
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,161
I can explain.
Our Number Two means...

177
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:28,641
...at silent speed, the men must always
exercise discipline.

178
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,241
And that's why
you're forbidden to fart, yes?

179
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,281
Captain?

180
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,841
Herr Seewald,
we've been expecting you.

181
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,721
Captain, over here.

182
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,281
<i>Heil,</i> Hitler.

183
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,121
Representative of our
naval attaché here.

184
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,281
<i>Heil,</i> Hitler, captain.

185
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:48,281
I brought some communications
from Berlin.

186
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,441
First, the documents
for the breakthrough.

187
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,841
And then...

188
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:59,001
...this cable came.

189
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:12,041
Chief. Lieutenant Werner.

190
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:18,481
We are going for a little fresh air.

191
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:30,201
- Well, Seewald, what's happening?
- Bad news.

192
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:40,281
Headquarters say no.
Our request has been denied, chief.

193
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:50,361
There's no replacement.
You stay too, Werner.

194
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,841
I'm sorry.

195
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:06,241
I guess it's just as well.

196
00:19:09,561 --> 00:19:12,121
Who knows what kind of idiot
they'd have sent you.

197
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,801
One of those newfound warriors
who's all wind and smoke.

198
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:30,761
Could be right.

199
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:37,881
I've never been to the Mediterranean.
They say the climate is supposed to be...

200
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,761
No heroic pretence, Mr. Werner.
You don't know what that means.

201
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:51,361
I don't know.

202
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,881
Something doesn't feel right.

203
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,161
Three boats refurbished here recently.

204
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:06,401
Two of them sank
as soon as they moved out of the sea.

205
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,121
Remarkable, huh?

206
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:20,161
Are you still interested to hear about
depth-charge attacks?

207
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,121
Hey, steward, bring a punch bowl here.

208
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:25,561
- One glass, sir?
- No, not a glass, just the bowl.

209
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:29,841
Come on, gentleman,
if you don't mind, stand over here.

210
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:34,201
And you too, my friend. Here comes
a spectacular phenomenon.

211
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:37,561
- This is the Atlantic, I presume.
- Atlantic, sea, what you will.

212
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:40,761
Or the channel, by the looks of it.
Pretty narrow crossing.

213
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:46,641
So now, then. Here, we're down here.
That little lemon pit there.

214
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,601
And hang in there tight.

215
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,001
- Oh, yeah?
- You got it, pal, because...

216
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:54,881
...the British ships are cruising
here above us.

217
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,441
The British know very well
we're down there.

218
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:59,801
Though they still don't know
where exactly.

219
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:02,161
There are two possibilities.

220
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,441
- To wait, hoping you'll surface.
- That's one.

221
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,321
- Or drop their depth charge.
- Where he assumes us to be.

222
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,641
There we are waiting.
Now, will he drop them or not?

223
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:21,321
Well, I do believe they missed us again.

224
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:26,921
Those cardboard soldiers.

225
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:36,361
Those strange guys
from the naval attach?

226
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:41,401
I feel they can't be trusted,
could talk too easily.

227
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:47,521
We'll push off from this place
as quickly as we can.

228
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,321
Forget our schedule.

229
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,041
This is not my kind of place.

230
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:07,801
They should have stocked the sub
with a few horny little senoritas.

231
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,401
Lucky they didn't, lover-boy.
Spanish crabs, that's all we'd need.

232
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:14,121
Yesterday he was a virgin.
Now he can't live without it.

233
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,281
Hurry up and get this mess out of here.
Get that chart table cleared.

234
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,641
I can't navigate on bananas.

235
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:22,801
What are you doing?
Get that fruit out of here. Move!

236
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,361
I want those depth controls
completely free.

237
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:28,241
- Where should we put them?
- Is that a Christmas tree?

238
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:32,081
What do you think it is,
camouflage for the bridge?

239
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:39,041
We're staying onboard.
They won't replace us.

240
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:51,801
I'm sorry, Ullmann.

241
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,121
<i>Our 68th day at sea.</i>

242
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,401
<i>We are nearing Gibraltar.</i>

243
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,401
<i>One question dominates our thoughts
to the exclusion of all others:</i>

244
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:45,161
<i>Will we get through?</i>

245
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,481
Seven miles from coast-to-coast.

246
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:50,961
Bit narrow, huh?

247
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,481
Here, the British dockyards.

248
00:23:56,481 --> 00:24:00,321
The only ones the British have
in the Western Mediterranean.

249
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:04,641
So they are very heavily defended.

250
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,481
The place will be crawling
with patrol boats.

251
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:15,881
Anything that floats
will be on the water.

252
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:21,881
And this is where we have to go.

253
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,041
That's the situation.

254
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:47,561
Gibraltar, where the mildness and
beauty of the Mediterranean world...

255
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:52,561
...meet the force and expansion
of the Atlantic realm.

256
00:24:56,401 --> 00:24:58,681
So says the sea handbook.

257
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:14,601
We'll move in under darkness.

258
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:22,801
The surface.

259
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:31,121
We'll see if we can slip through
their cordon.

260
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:38,601
As near to Gibraltar as we can get.

261
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:49,961
Then dive down...

262
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:53,441
...and let ourselves drift through.

263
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:04,441
In the Strait of Gibraltar,
there are two different currents.

264
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:12,361
One flows on the surface from
the Atlantic into the Mediterranean...

265
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:18,921
...and a deeper current,
from the Mediterranean out.

266
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:24,361
That's a lot of pressure.

267
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,641
And so...

268
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:38,961
...dive...

269
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:43,921
...and allow the surface current
to pull us through the strait.

270
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,721
Nice and quiet.

271
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:56,561
And we'll save fuel.

272
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,601
Well, Kriechbaum?

273
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:14,241
Clever trick, captain.

274
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,521
Arabian week.
Must be our southerly course.

275
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,561
They're hoping to drink
some courage.

276
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:22,641
- Time check, please.
- 9:39, sir.

277
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:32,761
We're getting close now.

278
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:11,641
Be accurate.
Keep checking the water control.

279
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:13,561
Don't worry, chief.

280
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:15,961
We've got enough air here.

281
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,801
Double-check the high valves.

282
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,921
I'll check them, sir.

283
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,561
Stupid bananas.

284
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,441
Goddamn it!

285
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:39,721
Be careful, you idiot!

286
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,241
Both engines stop.

287
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,601
Let's get going.

288
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:20,881
Both engines half-speed.

289
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:28,121
The navigator and I stay up here.
Now clear the bridge.

290
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:48,321
I'm right. 0-7-9.

291
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:50,281
Then, course 0-7-9, sir.

292
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:02,361
That's half the British fleet out there.

293
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,281
Come left 20 degrees
and change to main motors.

294
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:10,201
Steering 0-5-9, sir.

295
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:18,361
Very kind of the enemy
to show their navigation lights.

296
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:26,121
- Steer 0-5-0.
- Course 0-5-0.

297
00:31:41,881 --> 00:31:46,041
Destroyer on port bow.
Range about 800.

298
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,681
Going which way?

299
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:50,641
Is she closing?

300
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,481
No, she's heading away.

301
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:00,721
That's good.

302
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:04,401
Breakthrough. Astern of her.
Left full rudder.

303
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:08,041
- All full ahead.
- Rudder is left full.

304
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,801
Both engines ahead.

305
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:16,041
Come right.

306
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,681
All full ahead, maximum power.
Right full.

307
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:37,881
All full ahead, maximum power.
Right full.

308
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,481
Come on. Quick.

309
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:43,921
Make it quick.

310
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:48,881
Both engines indicate maximum rpm.
1-0-0, still turning right.

311
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:08,161
Now he's in his element.

312
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:13,001
Course 0-7-9.
All ahead half power.

313
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:44,521
Course 0-7-9.
All ahead half power.

314
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:18,521
Right full rudder!
All full ahead! Be quick!

315
00:34:18,761 --> 00:34:21,841
- Right full rudder. All full ahead.
- Damn! Damn!

316
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:01,121
Kriechbaum.

317
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:14,561
Gibraltar.

318
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:28,721
We'll dive in 10 minutes.

319
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:46,801
Alarm!

320
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,161
Go.

321
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:57,681
The captain is still up. Don't dive.

322
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,721
Alarm!

323
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:07,121
Stand by, escape gear!
Ready to abandon ship!

324
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:11,881
The medic! Right away!

325
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:19,041
- Where is the medic?
- Medic!

326
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:22,041
Engines, maximum power!
Hard, starboard!

327
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:25,481
All hands on escape gear!

328
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:30,121
Hold on. Hold on to this!

329
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,561
Faster! Faster!

330
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:51,721
Compress this! Compress this!

331
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:01,001
Out of the way! Out of the way!

332
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:03,321
Out of the way! Silence onboard!

333
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:06,281
Chief to captain, we have to stop
port engine! Foundation is loose!

334
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:08,281
Maintain full power!

335
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:11,561
All the power you've got!
All the power you've got!

336
00:37:12,161 --> 00:37:13,841
What's his plan?

337
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:17,401
Due south. Heading directly
for the African coastline.

338
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:28,161
Damn it! Damn it!

339
00:37:30,441 --> 00:37:33,601
- Alarm!
- Ready to dive!

340
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:36,081
All hands forward!

341
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:45,521
Move, move, move!

342
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,401
Ninety metres!

343
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:51,841
Close exhausts.

344
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,801
- Bow planes are in action!
- Switch to manual!

345
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:00,401
The bow plane is jammed!
It's on a dive!

346
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:07,241
Shit!

347
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:09,841
All engines stop!

348
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:13,801
- All men go aft!
- All hands aft! All hands aft!

349
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:18,401
- What is going on?
- Quiet.

350
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:21,561
Move! Move! All hands aft!

351
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:25,481
- Auxiliary pump, out of action!
- With air.

352
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:32,081
- Tank's blowing.
- We're still going down.

353
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:35,481
- We've got to shed some weight!
- Pump out 1000 litres!

354
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:41,001
Damn it, shut him up!

355
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:45,321
Main ballast pump, out of action!

356
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,361
Permission to blow?

357
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:50,721
- Both engines hard to stern full!
- Hard to stern full.

358
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:57,961
- No effect.
- Blow.

359
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:00,921
- Blow!
- Blow fore ballast.

360
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,161
Stay put. Now.

361
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:11,361
Now. Stay put now!

362
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,841
All that you've got! All you've got!

363
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,001
All that we've got!

364
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:24,881
Come on!

365
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,841
Oh, God!

366
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:47,241
We can't hold the boat.

367
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:54,641
200.

368
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,841
210.

369
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:06,041
220 metres.

370
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:10,401
230.

371
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,961
240 metres.

372
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:17,281
250 metres.

373
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,361
My God.

374
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:27,961
Oh, Lord, turn not away from me.

375
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:30,761
Dear Lord, take away all our sins.

376
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,321
A shovelful of sand.

377
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:28,161
The merciful God's left a shovelful
of sand to keep us up.

378
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,321
280 metres.

379
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:45,201
And she's still in one piece.

380
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:58,481
Water. Goddamn it.

381
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:03,201
Torpedo hatch taking water!

382
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,281
The torpedo hatch taking water!

383
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,681
Torpedo hatch taking water!

384
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:11,601
Motor room's taking water now,
right behind starboard.

385
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:15,081
Tank two taking water.

386
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:16,881
Get around.

387
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:20,241
- Tank two taking water!
- Tank two taking water!

388
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:24,801
- What do you need?
- Some timber for sawing.

389
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:26,721
It's in the bow compartment.

390
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,521
Exhaust valve okay?

391
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:32,241
I need some flooring, quick.

392
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,721
Shit.

393
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,321
Pass it to me.

394
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:37,921
Give me that flashlight!

395
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:42,041
- I need a wrench, damn it!
- Give me damage report.

396
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:44,921
Water coming in
around the after rail.

397
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:47,201
- Where are the tools?!
- Quick, quick, quick.

398
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:48,761
The tools!

399
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:54,441
- Where is it?
- Look.

400
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:57,761
Main motor switchboard's
out of action.

401
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:00,961
- Engine room's completely wrecked.
- I want some proper damage reports!

402
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:09,521
What's going on down there?

403
00:44:09,721 --> 00:44:11,481
We can't stop the flooding!

404
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:14,321
If saltwater gets in the bearings,
we've had it.

405
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:16,521
Together.

406
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,481
Where's the most damage?

407
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:30,161
The shaft's stuffing boxes,
below the decoy.

408
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:33,721
Check damage to number two battery.
Quickly!

409
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:35,361
Assess damage!

410
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:40,201
Tighten carefully.

411
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:44,481
- I can't see!
- Push! Hard as you can!

412
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:45,881
I can't.

413
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:49,201
It's stuck tight!
I can't wedge it.

414
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:51,201
Here, give me the hammer!

415
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,641
Need a little more men
in aft torpedo room?

416
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:01,721
I'll ask the lieutenant.

417
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:06,681
This damn thing! Here, hold my light!

418
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:09,881
Father, forgive my sins.

419
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:13,881
Stupid son of a pig!

420
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,481
Idiot.

421
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:19,161
Toolbox from the engine room!

422
00:45:19,401 --> 00:45:20,961
Hurry up!

423
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:23,561
Where is that damn wrench?

424
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:28,481
Bring another wrench!

425
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:41,761
Tighten those seals!
Don't shear the bolts!

426
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:46,041
A leak in the cooling system!

427
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:50,841
Tighten those intake seals!
Hurry up!

428
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:56,401
Someone give me that shoring.

429
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,921
- Here!
- Good.

430
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:00,801
Here, take it quickly!

431
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:03,561
Plugs down here! Quick!

432
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:07,601
Hurry up! Get me the biggest one!

433
00:46:08,561 --> 00:46:11,481
Higher! Still higher!

434
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:13,961
Higher!

435
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,561
Careful.

436
00:46:18,161 --> 00:46:19,681
Captain.

437
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:24,921
Hurry! Hurry! Get on with it.

438
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:30,921
We're taking water very fast.

439
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:35,081
The two hull valves burst.
Cooling water system blocked.

440
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:37,361
And on top of that,
compressors are dislodged.

441
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:39,921
Shaft stuffing boxes
began to leak, sir.

442
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,561
Damn it.

443
00:46:41,721 --> 00:46:44,081
What about fuel leaks?
Any tank's been punctured?

444
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:46,321
- Can't tell as yet.
- What else, chief?

445
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:49,721
Lots of battery cells are cracked,
can't take this kind of hit.

446
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,881
Look out for chlorine gas, men.

447
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:59,761
Get the bilge water.
Use the litmus paper.

448
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:02,681
Over there with
the sounding block.

449
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,681
We need each cell.

450
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:37,081
Look, it's red.
Acid in the bilge.

451
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:38,521
Piece of line, quickly.

452
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:41,041
See how many cells are cracked.

453
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,641
Battery straps over here.
Move it, you.

454
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:46,761
Battery straps.

455
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,601
Easy, Kriechbaum. Quiet. Quiet.

456
00:47:57,681 --> 00:47:59,401
Quiet.

457
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:21,161
Lieutenant.

458
00:48:22,921 --> 00:48:25,081
Have we a chance?
