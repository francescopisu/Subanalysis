1
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:02,121
La Rochelle, autumn 1941.

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:04,641
The "Battle of the Atlantic"
grows stronger.

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,201
Germany's U-Boats fleet,
with which Hitler...

4
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:11,121
...hoped to starve Britain,
is beginning to suffer major setbacks.

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:16,601
The British escort freighters with
destroyers, with increasing success.

6
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:19,441
Nevertheless,
more U-boats are ordered...

7
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,601
...into battle
from their French Atlantic ports.

8
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:26,961
Of the 40,000 German U-boat sailors
serving in World War II...

9
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,081
...30,000 never returned.

10
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,681
<i>The final night onshore.</i>

11
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,041
<i>We sail at 7 tomorrow morning.</i>

12
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,361
<i>My first assignment on a U-boat...</i>

13
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:07,041
<i>... with no idea where
they are sending us.</i>

14
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,081
<i>The central Atlantic, probably.</i>

15
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,441
<i>Only a few boats out there.</i>

16
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:14,601
<i>They reinforced their protection,
it's a bad month.</i>

17
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,081
<i>The tommies learned their lesson.</i>

18
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,481
<i>The aces, there are not many left.</i>

19
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:29,961
<i>Prien, Schepke, Kretschmer,
all lost during attacks.</i>

20
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:33,121
<i>They all drowned,
except for Kretschmer.</i>

21
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:35,761
<i>Kelsch sank off of Gibraltar.</i>

22
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,961
<i>Endrass, with a nervous breakdown.</i>

23
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,081
Our boatswain's mate.

24
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,081
He's on quite a bender.

25
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:24,121
The street is closed.

26
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:26,441
Who are those pigs?

27
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,441
The street's free.

28
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,761
Water on!

29
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:47,161
They call that "fireboat drill."
They're all guys from our boat.

30
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,561
Captain.

31
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,961
Merkel's crew.
They ship out tomorrow as well.

32
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,881
Come on, comrades,
let's explode the whorehouse.

33
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,961
Just don't miss!

34
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:03,361
- Stick some greetings in with it!
- See you soon, comrades.

35
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,321
They're chickenshit.

36
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:08,841
They need that like the grave warriors
the schnapps.

37
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,521
What's going on here?

38
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,441
Okay, ready, fire!

39
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:22,961
Captain!

40
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,401
My second officer.

41
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,401
This is Lieutenant Werner,
navy war correspondent.

42
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,641
He'll ship out with us.

43
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,481
He'll report on everything
that catches his eye.

44
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,041
Welcome aboard, lieutenant.

45
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,241
Good evening.

46
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,241
Lieutenant, come along
and have a drink with us.

47
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,601
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Two beers, please.

48
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,961
Of course, captain. Right away.

49
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,121
Those are some meatballs.

50
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:22,241
It's nice here, isn't it?
Come with me.

51
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:24,641
Where's Thomsen?

52
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,801
I thought he wanted to celebrate
his Knight's Cross.

53
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,521
Any news from your wife?

54
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,561
They only connect private calls
after 10:00.

55
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,801
Two beers.

56
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,241
It can't get worse than this.

57
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:53,281
Captain.

58
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,241
I'm reporting back from U-96.

59
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,681
Oil provisions on board and fully armed.
The boat is clear for sea.

60
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,761
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- One more thing, captain.

61
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:11,361
On the drive here,
I was molested by some of the crew.

62
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,841
They...

63
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,241
An outrageous event.

64
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,001
They...

65
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,041
Say it already, they peed on you.

66
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:29,601
- Exactly, captain.
- Me too.

67
00:07:56,281 --> 00:08:00,921
Come, sweetheart. Let the boy live,
the Führer still needs him.

68
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:07,721
Prosit, lieutenant.
To the Freichor Tönitz.

69
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:19,201
- First time on a U-boat?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:22,761
First time. It's gonna be exciting.

71
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:26,641
Do you have a will?

72
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,361
Excuse me?

73
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:34,081
Thirteen boats down last month.
Sank with men and mice.

74
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,841
Exciting, huh?

75
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:47,641
One moment, please.

76
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,041
I'm asking for your attention.

77
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:54,041
To the newly appointed
Knight's Cross carrier...

78
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,801
...Captain Lieutenant Thomsen!
Three big cheers!

79
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:12,881
There is Thomsen from the old gang.

80
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:15,481
Always drunk now.

81
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,841
Quiet in this whorehouse! Quiet!

82
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,681
To our wonderful...

83
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:51,841
...abstaining...

84
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,761
...and womanless Führer...

85
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,761
...whose career rose gloriously...

86
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,481
...from apprentice painter...

87
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,321
...to the greatest battle strategist
of all times.

88
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:08,721
- He better watch his mouth.
- Why? Isn't it true?

89
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,721
He's a great naval expert...

90
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,081
...who took it upon himself...

91
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,721
...in his immeasurable wisdom...

92
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,121
How do I go on?

93
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:35,201
Who showed
that English bed wetter...

94
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:40,001
...that cigar-chomping asshole
of Churchill...

95
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:46,761
...where exactly to go
and stick his stinking cigars!

96
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:12,401
Don't cry, Françoise, don't cry.

97
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,841
I want to have it.

98
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:31,201
You know the Resistance.

99
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:35,801
They make short work of collaborators.

100
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:37,841
I want to have it.

101
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,361
If you should not come back...

102
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:51,481
I'll come back.

103
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,321
I promise.

104
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:46,161
Oh, excuse me.

105
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,521
I'll see you tomorrow.
I have to make a call.

106
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:07,161
Phillip, this isn't the old gang.

107
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,521
Now it's their turn.

108
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,121
All wet guys.

109
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:19,481
Bigmouths.

110
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,041
Ass cheeks together,
squeeze the balls...

111
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,881
...and the belief in the Führer
in their eyes.

112
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:32,121
They, too, will quiet down.

113
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:35,841
Alarm!

114
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,761
Hello?

115
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,641
Shit.

116
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,921
Lousy eels.

117
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,641
Torpedo failures?

118
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,601
Many.

119
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:05,121
Sabotage, you can count on that.

120
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,841
Did you hear about Kelsch?

121
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:22,321
Went down off of Gibraltar.
It was reported.

122
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,801
Not a good year for the old gang.

123
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,761
The tide is turning.

124
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:40,441
When are you going out?

125
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,521
Tomorrow morning.

126
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,041
Come on, boy.

127
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,801
Show the tommies.

128
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,481
I'll go pee and leave, then.

129
00:14:57,321 --> 00:14:59,761
I still have plans.

130
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:17,121
Hey! You old pig, you!

131
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:43,321
Combat! Conquer or die!

132
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:00,721
Come on. Come on, Phillip, get up!

133
00:17:00,881 --> 00:17:02,601
Come, give me a hand!

134
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,721
I wanted to really...

135
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:16,081
...screw my brains out...

136
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,001
...but I am not in the condition to fuck.

137
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,161
- That'll do.
- Sieg Heil!

138
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:36,521
The Thomsen boat.

139
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,921
Is there a special report
while still in dock?

140
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:44,041
- Starboard propeller blade was bent.
- I see.

141
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,481
That explains that whining noise
at low rpm.

142
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:50,841
New propeller. We've got
a brand-new propeller, captain.

143
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:08,721
<i>Chief engineer
to the optical workshop.</i>

144
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,721
<i>Call from Germany.</i>

145
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,561
Our boat.

146
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,921
Crew, stand by for inspection!

147
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:29,041
Attention!

148
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:32,241
Eyes, left.

149
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:43,081
Crew is present
and accounted for, captain.

150
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:45,121
Lower and upper decks clear for sea.

151
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,601
Thank you, Number One.

152
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,521
At ease.

153
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,841
Well, men...

154
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:20,721
- All set?
- All set, captain!

155
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:25,001
We have a guest on board.

156
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,001
Lieutenant Werner.

157
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:32,001
Navy war correspondent.

158
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,041
He's going to have a look around.

159
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:46,321
He wants to see good German heroes.

160
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:50,601
- So act appropriately.
- Yes, captain!

161
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:52,841
To manoeuvre stations.

162
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:57,201
Bockstiegel, pull in the rope.

163
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:05,241
Don't let them overpower you!

164
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,121
All the best! Good luck!

165
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:09,721
- Do you have a sense for romance?
- Excuse me?

166
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,921
There, the empty house
next to the warehouse.

167
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:22,521
Is that for you?

168
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,201
Not that I would know.

169
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,601
Isn't that area out of bounds?

170
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:32,081
Oh, yes.

171
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,601
Françoise.

172
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:51,481
Goodbye!

173
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,321
Goodbye!

174
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:06,121
Victory! And good hunting!

175
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:33,761
<i>The escorts left us at noon.</i>

176
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:37,761
<i>The dark plume of smoke
from the pathmaker disappeared.</i>

177
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,841
<i>The patrol boat is gone as well.</i>

178
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,601
<i>The quartermaster's taken
his final land measurement.</i>

179
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:48,001
<i>The lookouts feel the salty tang
of the Atlantic on their lips.</i>

180
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:51,601
<i>The boat is alone now, on course.</i>

181
00:23:56,521 --> 00:24:00,121
Move those crates of lettuce back there!
This isn't a vegetable garden!

182
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:04,321
Battle station, where we maintain
and stow the torpedoes.

183
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:07,921
Heads up, boys!
You're gonna be in the paper!

184
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:11,041
- Thank you, men.
- Come along, follow me.

185
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:14,201
Here we have the can.
One toilet for 50 men.

186
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,041
The other's full of provisions.

187
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:20,401
More space for eating, less to shit.
That's some kind of logic, huh?

188
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:24,041
The chief petty officer's quarters.
My home, if you will.

189
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:26,081
Here's the war room.

190
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:30,121
When I see you store your stuff,
I could puke. That's way too much!

191
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,361
It's nice here, very cosy.

192
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:37,081
- Where are you, lieutenant?
- Coming. Excuse me, please.

193
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,081
Careful!

194
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:42,041
This radio shack here.

195
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:44,681
- Here's the control room.
- Could've lived without him.

196
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,761
So this is the control room.

197
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:50,041
- The boat's command post.
- Thanks.

198
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:55,201
So this goes on to the U Room.

199
00:24:57,281 --> 00:25:00,281
Let's move this out of the way.

200
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:03,801
- Morning, lieutenant.
- Morning, lieutenant.

201
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,121
This is where the petty officers bunk.
Sleeps 12 men.

202
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:11,881
Most bunks are shared by two guys.
One sleeps while the other's on duty.

203
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,041
That means when one man
comes off watch...

204
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:16,521
...he climbs into the other man's stink.
Right?

205
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,681
This bunk's for you.

206
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:22,401
Got one to yourself since
you're a guest on board.

207
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:24,321
Here, lieutenant, that's for you too.

208
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,481
And here's your escape gear.
Very important.

209
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:30,641
It's only for show.
More for use in the Baltic Sea.

210
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,401
But it's useful when the diesel stinks.

211
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:35,881
Or when Frenssen farts.

212
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,921
Come with me.

213
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,841
Let us pass.

214
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,441
- This is our galley.
- Ah.

215
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,641
- And here's Johann, the ghost.
- Who?

216
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:53,601
Well, Johann, everything lubed?

217
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:24,521
Take pictures of returning crews,
not of departing crews.

218
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,521
Why is that?

219
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:31,441
Because they mean something then.

220
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,161
The tommies should feel ashamed...

221
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:45,561
...if they see in the paper
who gives them hell.

222
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,801
Baby-faced kids.

223
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:53,161
Babies that belong
on the mother's breast.

224
00:26:56,841 --> 00:27:00,041
To be among them
makes you feel ancient.

225
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,601
It's like a children's crusade.

226
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:24,641
- Permission to pass?
- Yeah.

227
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,361
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

228
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,881
Thank you.

229
00:28:02,841 --> 00:28:06,961
- From Mexico, aren't you?
- Yes, south of Mexico City.

230
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,321
- Nice there?
- Yes, captain.

231
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,401
Good climate
because of the high altitude.

232
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,561
Quite a way.

233
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,201
It was my duty as a German to come.

234
00:28:45,761 --> 00:28:47,601
What did you do there?

235
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:51,361
I worked on a plantation.
It belongs to my stepparents.

236
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:57,521
- So you are the boss' son?
- You could say so.

237
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,721
<i>Stand by, first watch
and starboard watch.</i>

238
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:03,161
Excuse me.

239
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:07,561
Can I get by?

240
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,761
Permission to go on watch, captain?

241
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,161
A new breed, our Mexican recruit.

242
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,361
Young marcher.

243
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,521
Worldly, evolved.

244
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:41,521
He's so uptight, he could crack nuts
with his butt cheeks.

245
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,601
Captain, wind northwest, circling right.
Good visibility.

246
00:29:47,761 --> 00:29:50,921
Barometer, 1003 millibar.
No special incidents.

247
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,881
Thanks, navigator.

248
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:08,281
<i>After all the problems
and worries onshore...</i>

249
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:12,361
<i>...our first day at sea seems like
a pleasure cruise in the middle of war.</i>

250
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,241
<i>Our general course is 317 degrees.</i>

251
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,841
<i>Only the captain knows
our final destination.</i>

252
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:27,361
It was about time to ship out.

253
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:33,161
Attention!

254
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:35,121
Zero!

255
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,001
- Thirty-six degrees, 20.5 minutes.
- Good.

256
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:42,281
Stay alert.

257
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:46,801
This area isn't safe.

258
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,881
The tommies know exactly
when we ship out.

259
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,801
There are enough informers.

260
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:02,641
Dock workers, cleaning ladies,
prostitutes.

261
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,321
Damn beasts.

262
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:18,401
Excuse me, captain.

263
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:20,961
If you can't handle it, don't do it.

264
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,641
Were you part of it?

265
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:33,881
Fireboat drill?

266
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,081
Yes, captain.

267
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,881
At least you can aim.

268
00:31:47,161 --> 00:31:49,761
Twenty minutes...

269
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,481
Screws, eggs.

270
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,681
- Permission to come up?
- Yes.

271
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,761
Alarm!

272
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:14,121
- Stand by, main vents!
- Stand by, main vents.

273
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:22,681
Starboard exhaust valve!

274
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,681
All men forward!

275
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,041
Come on! Come on!

276
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:32,361
Come on, come on, move it!
Come on, move it! Up! Up! Up!

277
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,041
Come on, move!

278
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,401
Faster, faster! Keep going! Keep going!

279
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,961
I wanna see steam
coming out of your ass!

280
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:44,921
In case you didn't know, it's an alarm!
You're not on a pleasure cruise!

281
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:46,841
Get into diving positions!

282
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,761
Lower negative tank.

283
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:11,321
Attention. Stern up 10.

284
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:26,441
April fools.
Practice makes perfect.

285
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,561
Don't get rusty.

286
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,721
A practice drill.

287
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,281
Level off, chief.

288
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:37,401
Bow up 15. Stern up 10.

289
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:39,961
Planes at zero.

290
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:47,201
- Levelled off, sir.
- Shut all main vents.

291
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,361
All main vents shut.

292
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:56,441
Take her down. Let's see
how the valves and seals hold up.

293
00:33:57,481 --> 00:34:00,041
Bow planes down 15, stern up 10.

294
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:12,041
The shipyard warranty
extends to 90 metres.

295
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:16,041
But of course, we could go deeper.

296
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,761
There's a limit somewhere.

297
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:33,161
We can only take so much
pressure before the boat...

298
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,201
...will be...

299
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,521
...crushed.

300
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,081
Check hull valves.

301
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:52,681
Check hull valves.

302
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:02,641
- The water pressure.
- Yeah, sure.

303
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,321
Deeper.

304
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:16,721
140 metres.

305
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:26,361
- She must take this depth.
- 150.

306
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:35,521
160 metres.

307
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,881
That'll do for now. Surface.

308
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,281
- Surface.
- Bow up 10. Stern up 5.

309
00:36:08,481 --> 00:36:10,241
Well?

310
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,921
Thank you.

311
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:17,201
We're not an ordinary ship.

312
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:19,041
Very interesting.

313
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:22,321
Incoming, bearing 3-2-0 and closing.

314
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:23,561
Get on.

315
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,561
Both planes down, full.

316
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:34,401
Wait, my friends.
You only get one more chance.

317
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,961
That was it.

318
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:57,161
Shut all main vents.

319
00:36:57,321 --> 00:37:00,081
Check hull valves.

320
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:06,041
The show is over.

321
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:37,281
Once a whore pissed on my back.

322
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:40,401
That felt so good.

323
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,121
You're a pervert.

324
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:58,001
I can tell you some really sexy tricks.

325
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:02,121
For an example, you take a cork...

326
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:07,601
...with a nail stuck in it and a
violin string attached on the side of it...

327
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:10,641
...stick it in the asshole...

328
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,561
...and then sideways jack off.

329
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:17,441
Could it be any more complicated?

330
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:20,481
Listen, it's supposed
to buzz real good in there.

331
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:31,201
<i>Our first night on board.</i>

332
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:35,321
<i>It's hard to switch off and relax.</i>

333
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,841
<i>The heat of the compartment...</i>

334
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:40,561
<i>...the stench of oil...</i>

335
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:44,001
<i>...the engine-room watchers
coming and going.</i>

336
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:47,241
<i>There is so much to get used to.</i>

337
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,441
<i>As for the officers I bunk with...</i>

338
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:53,441
<i>...they don't let my presence
cramp their style.</i>

339
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,761
<i>The way they keep harping
on subject number one...</i>

340
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:59,001
<i>...I'll be lucky to get any sleep.</i>

341
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:25,881
Is that her?

342
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,761
The girl from the window
of the ruin?

343
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:37,841
French girl?

344
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:50,161
You know the shop that sells flowers
beside Cafe A L'ami Pierrot?

345
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:52,961
- Beside where?
- A L'ami Pierrot.

346
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,321
Sure, I know it.

347
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:59,281
The two pretty salesgirls,
Jeannette and the other one's called...

348
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:01,881
Françoise.

349
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:07,441
We're engaged.

350
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:11,241
Secretly, of course.

351
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,921
Can I see?

352
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,721
Very pretty. Really.

353
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:34,241
What's wrong?

354
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,241
She's pregnant.

355
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:45,321
But, Ullmann...

356
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:47,961
...don't you know what that means?

357
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,041
If the Resistance ever
finds out that she...

358
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,361
...has a German baby...

359
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:55,721
What can I do?

360
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,561
She wants to have it.

361
00:41:04,761 --> 00:41:06,801
You've got problems, Ullmann.

362
00:41:48,481 --> 00:41:50,681
<i>Fifth day at sea.</i>

363
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,761
<i>No convoy.</i>

364
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:54,601
<i>No ship.</i>

365
00:41:54,761 --> 00:41:56,361
<i>Nothing.</i>

366
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:30,321
What's today's calendar quotation?

367
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:38,161
"One can only be one's best
when it seems unnaturally hard."

368
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:41,201
Cicero.

369
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:42,841
Excuse me?

370
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,561
"One can only be one's best
when it seems unnaturally hard."

371
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:47,881
Give it to me.

372
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:50,801
It's always best when it's hard.

373
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:09,161
<i>Special announcement
from Führer's headquarters...</i>

374
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:12,721
<i>... October 23, 1941.</i>

375
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:17,881
<i>The Armed Forces High Command
has issued the following announcement:</i>

376
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:21,201
<i>Last night,
the Navy and the Luftwaffe...</i>

377
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:26,121
<i>...lightened their stranglehold
on the British Isles.</i>

378
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:32,201
<i>Our U-boats in the Atlantic sank
11 merchant ships and one destroyer.</i>

379
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:37,681
<i>Wiping out 53,000 gross registered
tons of enemy shipping in one blow.</i>

380
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:39,521
Waste of shipping space.

381
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:43,441
<i>Three ships and one tanker
were severely damaged.</i>

382
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:47,041
All they talk is tonnage,
these morons.

383
00:43:48,361 --> 00:43:52,161
All good, seaworthy ships.

384
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:56,961
We've become nothing but agents
now for their vicious propaganda.

385
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:59,641
Just scrap merchants.

386
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:01,601
Butchers of the sea.

387
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:17,281
Our masters in Berlin
spend all their time...

388
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:19,761
...finding Churchill
clever new nicknames.

389
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:23,641
What's their latest creation?

390
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:29,081
Drunken pig.

391
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:32,241
Fat bore.

392
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:35,401
Paralytic.

393
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:41,401
I must say, for a drunken paralytic,
he's putting up a damn good fight.

394
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:45,481
You'll see.
We'll force him to his knees.

395
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,601
That is my firm belief.

396
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,401
Listen to me, smart guy.

397
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:57,841
He is a long way
from being down on his knees.

398
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:03,881
I'd like to know how many of his ships
are getting through us right now...

399
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:08,081
...while we sit on our behinds
waiting for orders.

400
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:11,241
Where are our planes and ships,
Herr Goering?

401
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:15,041
The British have plenty of them.

402
00:45:15,761 --> 00:45:20,041
Talking big is all he's good for,
that fat slob.

403
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:27,081
Big heroes. Nothing but hot air.

404
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,401
All of them.

405
00:45:35,681 --> 00:45:37,281
Go on...

406
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:39,681
...put that one down.

407
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:43,521
It'll make exciting reading
in your epic.

408
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,361
The Propaganda Ministry will love it.

409
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:54,081
I didn't know you were interested, sir.

410
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:59,561
You were mistaken, then.

411
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,841
Music, we need.

412
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,601
Think our Hitler youth leader
might put a record on for us?

413
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:18,601
The "Tipperary" song
if you have no objections!

414
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:34,721
Hey, now we're in the Royal Navy.

415
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:48,881
A simple record won't make you
into the King of England, Number One.

416
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:05,921
Shut the door...

417
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:07,921
...you lazy pig!

418
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,921
Stupid jerk.

419
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:15,001
They should use him as a doorstep.

420
00:47:15,161 --> 00:47:19,201
His rear end's big enough. One of
these days, he'll stick it in the can...

421
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,761
...and he won't be able
to pull it out again.

422
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:27,321
- Morning.
- Lieutenant.

423
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:30,681
- Morning.
- Morning, lieutenant.

424
00:47:30,841 --> 00:47:35,801
- It stinks in here.
- Sweaty feet and hair grease.

425
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,441
Pilgrim's specialty.

426
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:48,681
Tastes just like old shit...

427
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:51,441
...these rotten eggs.

428
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:55,641
Like baby poop.

429
00:47:57,481 --> 00:48:00,401
Maybe he wants to hatch chickens
in the control room.

430
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:04,361
That's right, ducks in a bilge.
Why not? Sweet little ducklings.

431
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:07,881
We could feed them green snot.

432
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:10,561
- You dirty pig-
- Why? What's wrong?

433
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,761
That would make them happy.

434
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:15,321
Every morning...

435
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:18,321
...they'd feed on those
delicious things.

436
00:48:34,641 --> 00:48:36,881
- Permission to come up.
- Yes.

437
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:41,641
Morning.

438
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:58,241
Aircraft closing, 1-7-0.

439
00:48:58,641 --> 00:48:59,841
Alarm!

440
00:49:00,081 --> 00:49:02,281
Move it, gangway.

441
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:04,361
Stay down. Move it.

442
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:06,881
Out of the way.
Slow down.

443
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:08,361
Watch out.

444
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:11,041
Watch it.

445
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:13,441
- Upper deck secured.
- Upper deck secured.

446
00:49:13,681 --> 00:49:15,321
Flood buoyancy tanks.

447
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:16,721
Take her down, 60 metres.
