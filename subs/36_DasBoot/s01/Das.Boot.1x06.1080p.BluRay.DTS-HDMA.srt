1
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:23,961
Careful.

2
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,081
Captain.

3
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,321
Hurry! Hurry! Get on with it.

4
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,321
We're taking water very fast.

5
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:41,481
The two hull valves burst.
Cooling water system blocked.

6
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,761
And on top of that,
compressors are dislodged.

7
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,321
Shaft stuffing boxes
began to leak, sir.

8
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,961
Damn it.

9
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,481
What about fuel leaks?
Any tank's been punctured?

10
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,721
- Can't tell as yet.
- What else, chief?

11
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,121
Lots of battery cells are cracked,
can't take this kind of hit.

12
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:59,281
Look out for chlorine gas, men.

13
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:06,161
Get the bilge water.
Use the litmus paper.

14
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,081
Over there with
the sounding block.

15
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,081
We need each cell.

16
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,481
Look, it's red.
Acid in the bilge.

17
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:44,921
Piece of line, quickly.

18
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,441
See how many cells are cracked.

19
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,041
Battery straps over here.
Move it, you.

20
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,161
Battery straps.

21
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,801
Lieutenant.

22
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,681
Have we a chance?

23
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,481
We'll never do it by hand.
Takes block and tackling.

24
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,161
The chief needs battery straps.
Make it quick.

25
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:47,561
Find some battery straps, damn it.

26
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,801
They still need it.

27
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,401
Logs and a hammer.

28
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,281
Here. Here.

29
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:58,801
Thanks, lieutenant.

30
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,481
Got it.

31
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:09,121
Get me more light here.

32
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,081
We're winning, sir.

33
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,201
And again, turn it.

34
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,481
Shit.

35
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,721
Pull it round.

36
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,401
The other side,
or it will tear the gasket.

37
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,321
The other side,
or it will tear the gasket.

38
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,321
Check the valves.

39
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,641
They came straight at us.

40
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,681
It's quite incredible in that light.

41
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:09,281
They say that the British
are using a new detection system...

42
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:14,081
...high frequency.

43
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:20,121
Could be true what they say.

44
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:26,241
They tried it out on us.

45
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,761
If they can find us in the dark...

46
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:39,921
...we can only pray.

47
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,721
Another bilge pipe
in the water cooling system.

48
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:55,321
- Bilge pipe in the water cooling system.
- Bilge pipe in the water cooling system.

49
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,641
Tell the chief water is out of the bilge
in the torpedo hatch...

50
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,401
...rising faster.

51
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,481
I can't see.

52
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:18,401
Lieutenant, hold the light.

53
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,721
We've got to close the leaks,
or it's all over for us.

54
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:33,601
To the right. More to the right. Down.

55
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:36,881
Careful.

56
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,001
Twenty-four battery cells cracked.

57
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,521
God almighty, what a hell of a mess.

58
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,321
Let's hope these are enough.

59
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:06,521
He's got to bridge the live cells.
It's our only chance.

60
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,281
Without batteries, we've had it.

61
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,761
Starboard...
Down, lieutenant.

62
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,881
We're drowning.

63
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,041
Wire. Get me wire to bridge them.

64
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,961
Wire! Come on, hurry up!

65
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,601
Wire! The chief needs wire.

66
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:04,161
Get moving! Look for wires!
Did you hear me?

67
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,801
- Wire.
- What kind of wire?

68
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:13,001
Any kind of thick wire, man.
There's got to be some wire around.

69
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,881
In the bilge, under the torpedo tubes.

70
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,561
We have got plenty
of fancy torpedoes, right?

71
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,641
Each one is 25,000 marks.

72
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,321
But no damn wire.

73
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:28,161
All they forgot is 50 pennies' worth
of old wire.

74
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,921
Now what?

75
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,281
Captain, the draining pump's jammed.

76
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:35,441
- It won't even extend manually.
- That's great.

77
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,121
Captain!

78
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,641
- Here.
- He's got some wire!

79
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:43,401
- Terrific. Better than nothing.
- Pliers!

80
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,481
- Here.
- Captain?

81
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,481
All the leaks have been stopped, sir.

82
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,801
Good, Johann.

83
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,001
That's good.

84
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,521
Now change your wet things, man.

85
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,921
We must get rid of the water.

86
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,241
The water has to go out.

87
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,361
Into the control-room bilge...

88
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,441
...and then outside.

89
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,201
All right, give it to me!

90
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,881
Come on. Move it.

91
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,361
- Careful, you jerk!
- Hoist the bucket.

92
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,641
Get a move on, boys!

93
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:58,041
Keep coming and going!

94
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:02,921
Come on, put your backs into it!

95
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:05,001
Keep those buckets moving.

96
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:09,681
Step on it, Dufte, Hermann.
Don't fall asleep. Keep going!

97
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,281
Hurry up!

98
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:15,241
Faster, goddamn it!

99
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:18,521
Come on. Don't slow down.

100
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,121
Pull. Pull.

101
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:28,161
Almost finished. Three cells to go, sir.

102
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:41,241
How is it going?

103
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,841
Almost ready.
Three more cells.

104
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:50,281
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

105
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:11,321
See, it works.

106
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,841
That's good.

107
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:21,561
It's all good.

108
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,921
Mum. Mum.

109
00:11:42,321 --> 00:11:44,801
Stop, boy. Take a rest.

110
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,281
Fucking shit.

111
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:07,601
Make some room down there.
Chief's coming through.

112
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,241
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes.

113
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,041
Keep going. Keep going.

114
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:39,641
- Motor didn't get wet, did it, Johann?
- It looks like it, lieutenant.

115
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,961
Here, pass your empty buckets.

116
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,001
Hey, guys, switch.

117
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:55,161
Captain?

118
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,601
All of our compasses are out of action.

119
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:04,081
We may have lost
speed indicator and sonar too.

120
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:06,881
And radio contact seems dead.

121
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,121
Pretty bad damage.

122
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,201
Can we get up again?

123
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,121
Do you think we have a chance, sir?

124
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,041
Good question.

125
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,481
Bit of air must still be
in the ballast tanks...

126
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,001
...from the blowing.

127
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,161
It should help us.

128
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,641
If we use every ounce of
high-pressure air that's left.

129
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:54,801
Maybe.

130
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:01,241
We have to reduce our weight.

131
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,881
We've got to get the water out.

132
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:06,841
We must.

133
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,561
Eliminate and scoop.

134
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:39,201
Commander, engine-room bilge
now almost clear of water.

135
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,881
Commander, engine-room bilge
now almost clear of water.

136
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,641
It could work. It could work.

137
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,241
It could just work.
By hand, into the trimming tanks.

138
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,961
Then with ballast pump
and high-pressure air...

139
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:19,841
...we could force the water out.

140
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,721
The ballast pump?

141
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,041
We can do it.

142
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,881
We have to risk it.

143
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:33,161
Blow.

144
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:36,161
We can only try once.

145
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:39,521
When?

146
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,561
When all repairs are completed.

147
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,521
In about six to eight hours.

148
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:48,161
- CO2 content?
- 1.8 per cent.

149
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,081
Do we have enough oxygen?

150
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,041
No.

151
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,321
Emergency cartridges. For all guys
who are not working.

152
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,001
The others go to the bunks.

153
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:01,641
Aye, aye, captain.

154
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,881
Emergency cartridges.
Guys not working, go to bunks.

155
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:23,641
- How is he doing?
- Difficult to say just yet, sir.

156
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,601
Doesn't look too good.

157
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,321
Well, Pilgrim...

158
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:36,121
- ...everything okay?
- Yes, captain.

159
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,721
Everything's okay.

160
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,121
What about aft?

161
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:46,961
It's getting better, sir.

162
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,961
I guess I'll go over there.

163
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:25,721
You should be careful.

164
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,321
- Can you make it?
- We'll make it, captain.

165
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,561
- How's it going?
- All right. It's okay.

166
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,961
How does it look?

167
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:15,001
Don't worry, captain,
we'll make it.

168
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,401
How's it going?

169
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:29,441
Two bearings which have
to be changed and fixed.

170
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,561
Then it should run smoothly.

171
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,401
Well, Benjamin, is everything okay?

172
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,201
Yes, captain.

173
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,481
What a mess.

174
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:14,361
Going well.

175
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,521
It's working out fine.

176
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,641
Yes, captain, we'll make it.

177
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:36,921
Laps of honour.

178
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,681
They're doing laps of honour.

179
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,761
Believe they made it.

180
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:53,561
They think we drowned.

181
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,521
Not yet.

182
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,561
Not yet.

183
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,721
I still have some glucose.

184
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,121
They were crazy...

185
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:00,281
...ordering us through the strait.

186
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,241
It was bound to go wrong.

187
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:10,241
He knew it.

188
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,401
The bastard, he knew it.

189
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:23,641
From the moment that radio signal
had come through...

190
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,321
...the captain knew it.

191
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:34,161
That's the reason
he ordered us ashore at Vigo.

192
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,441
He knew there was very little hope.

193
00:24:57,401 --> 00:25:01,401
He tried to fool us.
"Quite simple," he said.

194
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,721
"An easy trick."

195
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:11,761
"Dive and drift with the current, and..."

196
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:18,321
Quite a clever trick.

197
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:23,321
But it has to work.

198
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:32,521
Will we ever get up?

199
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,561
I don't know.

200
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,241
I'm sorry.

201
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,361
You think it's hopeless now?

202
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:43,201
It's been 15 hours.

203
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,001
He's not going to make it.

204
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,481
I'm sorry.

205
00:27:24,641 --> 00:27:26,961
I wanted this to happen.

206
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:36,041
To face the relentless truth.

207
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:42,121
Where no one's mother
looks around at night.

208
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:46,761
No woman crossing our way.

209
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:52,241
Where only reality reigns,
ferocious and great.

210
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:05,841
I was intoxicated by it.

211
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,081
That is reality now.

212
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,441
Situation report, sir.

213
00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:13,081
Motors in order.

214
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:15,921
The ballast pump is clear.

215
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:19,921
Accumulated water can now
be pumped into trimming tanks.

216
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,441
Then blown outboard
with high-pressure air.

217
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:26,841
Compass is in order.

218
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:29,441
Sonar clear.

219
00:29:45,121 --> 00:29:46,681
Good.

220
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:53,041
Good, good.

221
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:04,121
Go and take a break.

222
00:30:12,321 --> 00:30:14,601
We still have a few little problems.

223
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,641
All you need is a good crew.

224
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,641
A good crew.

225
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,401
And what about above?

226
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,161
Dusk was two hours ago.

227
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,081
We'll surface in 20 minutes.

228
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:33,321
Wake up. Come on, wake up.

229
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:36,521
Wake up!

230
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,561
- What's the matter?
- We'll surface in 20 minutes.

231
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,281
We're going to surface.

232
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,961
Wake the crew.

233
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,321
All hands prepare to surface.

234
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:53,801
We're coming up!

235
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,481
Everybody listen up.

236
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:06,001
We're going to blow...

237
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:08,721
...and see if we can get our rear up.

238
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,761
If so...

239
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,321
...it could get ugly again.

240
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:20,601
Traffic is heavy up there.

241
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,481
There's only one thing we can do:

242
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,401
Pray that the engines will start...

243
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:35,761
...so we can get out of this mess.

244
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:39,081
And let's go home.

245
00:32:41,161 --> 00:32:42,921
If it works...

246
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,201
...everybody gets half a bottle of beer.

247
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,841
There's one thing on our side.

248
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:57,561
They won't be expecting us.

249
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,081
So, guys...

250
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,001
...everything okay?

251
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:11,761
Aye, aye, captain.

252
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:16,841
Surface contacts?

253
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,641
Nothing near.

254
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:21,641
Get ready to surface.
Stand by, escape gear.

255
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,761
Switch to red light.

256
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:53,121
Let her blow.

257
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,721
Let her blow.

258
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:08,041
- She's rising.
- Yeah!

259
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,601
- Easy, guys.
- Starboard planes down 15.

260
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,841
270 metres!

261
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,881
First watch, stand by.

262
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,361
260 metres.

263
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:37,481
250 metres.

264
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,761
240 metres.

265
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,481
230 metres.

266
00:36:00,681 --> 00:36:02,321
220.

267
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,521
The air lock's open.

268
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:57,761
Start up engines?

269
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:04,441
Both main engines.

270
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,681
Well, let's see.

271
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:18,081
So?

272
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:36,321
I think they're running.

273
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:39,121
I never heard such sweet music
in all my life.

274
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:42,721
- They're running.
- They're running.

275
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,561
Yes, they're running.

276
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,081
They won't catch us this time.

277
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:03,721
Not this time.

278
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,161
Just you keep on going, damn it.

279
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,801
Just you keep on going!

280
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:15,601
Right full rudder.
Come to 3-2-0.

281
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:18,481
This goddamn bastard!

282
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:25,081
They haven't spotted us.

283
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,601
They are snoring in their bunks.

284
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:34,081
You know what?

285
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:37,441
They are drinking in the bar,
celebrating our sinking.

286
00:38:40,561 --> 00:38:42,641
Not yet, my friends!

287
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:44,921
Not yet!

288
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:04,121
<i>Tuesday, December 23, 194 1.</i>

289
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:05,841
<i>Course: La Rochelle.</i>

290
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:22,961
Drink up, boys!

291
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:26,521
- Here's to home!
- Here's to home!

292
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:34,281
Just imagine those sexy nurses.

293
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,801
The newspaper girls.

294
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,761
And Dufte and his broad
can get screwed.

295
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:48,121
How about you, Brückenwilli?

296
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:51,961
A nice, slow...

297
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,601
...afternoon fuck.

298
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,801
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, Hinrich.

299
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,441
Easy to forget.

300
00:40:57,481 --> 00:40:59,201
The holiday of love.

301
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,361
Christmas on a bombed-out hulk.

302
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:12,681
Something different.

303
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:23,001
Any bright ideas, Henri,
for the celebration?

304
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,401
Have our own celebration?

305
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,521
Sing a few carols...

306
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,841
...read from the Bible.

307
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:50,441
I guess we're not in the right mood.

308
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:58,361
Just postpone it, I'd say.

309
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:02,241
It'll be Christmas for us
when we're back on land.

310
00:42:05,161 --> 00:42:06,841
Good idea.

311
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:10,241
Postpone.

312
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,761
That's good.

313
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:21,321
That's really good.

314
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:48,281
Let's pray the engines hold out.

315
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:53,881
With a bit of luck, Hinrich...

316
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:00,961
...we'll make it back home.

317
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:10,481
The 3rd Submarine Flotilla welcomes
its comrades with three cheers!

318
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,921
Both engines stop.

319
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:48,921
- Stern line out!
- Stern line out! Watch those cables!

320
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,521
Roll that tighter!

321
00:43:56,401 --> 00:44:00,201
We Build for Victory!

322
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:12,921
- Thank you, Hinrich.
- It's okay.

323
00:44:13,081 --> 00:44:14,761
The sun is shining out there.

324
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,521
Up with him!

325
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:31,561
All right. We got you.

326
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,201
<i>Gunboat number three,
guard your position.</i>

327
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:16,801
<i>Gunboat number three,
guard your position at once.</i>

328
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,201
Hurry up.

329
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,281
Bring a medic.

330
00:46:39,441 --> 00:46:40,921
Over here.
