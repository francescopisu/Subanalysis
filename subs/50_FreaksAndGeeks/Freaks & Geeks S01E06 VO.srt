00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:01,853
Freaks and Geeks S01E06 I'm with the Band (VO)

2
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,030
You look a little bit
like my grandpa.

3
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,826
Oh, is your grandpa super cool?

4
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,955
All right. Simmer down, petunias.
We've got a busy week ahead of us.

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,666
It's time to start training for
the president's physical fitness test.

6
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,543
Jimmy carter's a wimp.

7
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,753
Can it, White.

8
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,924
We're gonna start on upper-body
strength with a little rope-climbing.

9
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,802
Yeah. That's gonna help us
get into a good college.

10
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,180
Oh, one more thing.
New district policy.

11
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,933
Everybody must take a shower
after class,

12
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,435
starting today.

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,063
And I'll check for wet hair,
so don't think you can pull a fast one.

14
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,692
Is Weir allowed to shower with us?
'cause he's a woman.

15
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,030
Come on, ladies, let's move!

16
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,281
Get up there.

17
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,700
Kiss the beam, you're on my team.

18
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,578
What do I look like,
a freakin' Tarzan?

19
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,623
Come on, Bill.

20
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,502
They cannot make us take a shower.

21
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,422
This is school.
They can make us do anything.

22
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,508
Don't you think it's kinda weird

23
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,386
that they want us to,
you know... get naked?

24
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,973
It's not a burlesque show, Sam.
They just want us to shower.

25
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,476
What are you guys talking about?
Stop lookin' up my shorts.

26
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,354
Why would we?
There's nothing to see.

27
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,648
Just keep climbing, Wonder Woman.

28
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,109
There is something to see.

29
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
Well, I'm not gonna do it.

30
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,572
Why, because you don't
have any pit hair?

31
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,034
I have pit hair.
Besides, I think it's kinda weird

32
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,327
that you wanna get naked
in front of everybody.

33
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,997
Hey, Schweiber.

34
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,791
You gonna show us your circumcision
in the showers today?

35
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,626
Yeah. Take a number.

36
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,591
Well, I guess it is kinda weird.

37
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,135
Then that's settled.
We're not doing it.

38
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,430
I can't go up any farther, guys.

39
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,807
How do I get back down?

40
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,937
Hi, everybody. If you're just
a boy or girl who can't say no...

41
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,106
Then you won't be able to say no

42
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,734
to tickets to the McKinley
drama club's presentation of...

43
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,152
What? What?

44
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,237
<i>Oklahoma</i>!

45
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,824
- Oh, no!
- No way.

46
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,244
So come on down, and pardner,
leave the ducks and geese at home.

47
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,955
Oh, what a beautiful
evening you'll have.

48
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,127
OK. Tickets are $2.00
at the box office.

49
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,421
Don't miss it.
It's a great show.

50
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,548
Wow. You'd look good in that dress.

51
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,385
- You guys wanna rehearse today?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

52
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,220
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

53
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,516
Is this your guys' rock band?

54
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,393
Yeah. We gotta audition for
a battle of the bands coming up.

55
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,520
The winner gets 300 bucks.

56
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,068
I bet you guys are really good.

57
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,528
I don't think so.

58
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,155
- Do you guys have a name?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,741
Creation.

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,743
No, we don't have a name.

61
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,745
Come on.
I like that name.

62
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,331
All right. 3:00.

63
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,584
No. I gotta do something
with Kim at 3:00.

64
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,670
How about 3:01?

65
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,173
How about 3:15?
I gotta fit in your mother.

66
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,759
You wanna sleep with my mom?

67
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,181
You know, to be honest,
I don't smell so good.

68
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,892
I could probably use a shower.

69
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,687
No! We have to stick together.

70
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,772
Hey, if we don't shower,

71
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,483
then we are gonna stick together.

72
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,569
You get it?

73
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,279
Weir!

74
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,074
Are you ladies having a nice time
at the beauty parlor?

75
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,913
You see, uh...
Mr. Fredricks, the thing is that...

76
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,625
I told you guys,
everybody has to shower.

77
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,211
Well... we didn't even sweat.

78
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,546
Smell us.

79
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,633
You know, Weir,
I'll put that on my "to do" list.

80
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,426
Fellas, hit the shower.

81
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,930
See, we're gonna be late for class,

82
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,974
and I have an algebra test
that I cannot make up.

83
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,477
And I can't be late for class.

84
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,312
Just go to class.

85
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,897
All right. Tomorrow,
you will get in the shower.

86
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,108
And if you don't do it,
I'm gonna know about it.

87
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,738
That guy's really into
making guys shower.

88
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,074
Tell me about it.

89
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,613
That was amazing.

90
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,823
You look so hot when you play.

91
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,826
I wish I could smash this thing.

92
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,495
Do it! Do it!

93
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,624
What'd you think?
That was pretty amazing, huh?

94
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,334
That was really wild.

95
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,211
Hey. Hey, hey, listen, uh,

96
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,047
Lindsay came up with some
great names for the band.

97
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,674
Tell them, Lindsay.

98
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,634
Oh, yeah? I hope
it's something catchy,

99
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,886
like, uh, the math-letes.

100
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,722
All right.
Let's hear 'em.

101
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,353
Well, I thought the band
needed a name

102
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,480
that not only said who you were,

103
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,649
but what you want to
represent to the audience.

104
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,025
- So...
- Say it.

105
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,152
Go tell 'em.

106
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,863
OK. Here's one.

107
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,698
Mission control.

108
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,491
- No way.
- Why not?

109
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,077
'cause it sounds like
some space thing.

110
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,621
So? What's wrong with that?

111
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,623
Space blows.

112
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,502
Tell 'em the next one
that you thought up.

113
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,338
You guys are gonna love
this one. Tell 'em.

114
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,048
Anarchy's child.

115
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,092
No way! Boo!

116
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,929
What does that even mean?

117
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,474
I don't see you guys coming up
with any names for the band.

118
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,186
Hello, ladies, gentlemen.

119
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,564
Hello, Mr. Andopolis.

120
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,858
I take it the symphony's over.

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,735
I'm sorry, Dad.
We just finished.

122
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,945
It sounded a lot better,
though, right?

123
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,448
Nick, can I talk to you
for a moment?

124
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:12,992
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,869
I'll be upstairs.

126
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,543
Ladies, gentlemen...

127
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,879
Let's get outta here.

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,424
- I'll just be a minute, you know.
- Yeah, but he won't.

129
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,718
I'm hungry.
Can we get something to eat?

130
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,345
Yeah. Let's go.

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,972
- You working the drive-through?
- Yeah, in an hour.

132
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,725
All right! Let's go there,
get a bunch of free crap.

133
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,353
You've got to at least buy a pop,
or I'm gonnahe get caught.

134
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,063
Can't you just wait for me?

135
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,940
Just meet us there.

136
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,818
This is Mission control
requesting permission to rock out.

137
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,949
Hey, I'll wait for you.

138
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,165
Hey, Dad, I know I'm not
supposed to play past 5:00.

139
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,625
I'm really sorry.

140
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,378
If you're sorry,
you wouldn't keep doing this.

141
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,630
I guess I just forgot
to look at the clock.

142
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,801
Nick, you're killing me here.
Jeez, I keep trying to be a good guy,

143
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,178
- you're pushing me.
- I'm not pushing you, Dad.

144
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,222
You're pushing me, Nick.

145
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,517
I want your drums
out of the basement.

146
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,271
Dad, you already made me move
the drums out of the garage.

147
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,941
Where am I supposed to put them if
I can't keep them in the basement?

148
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,151
Instead of practicing
with your friends,

149
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,238
why don't you try practicing
at keeping your grades up?

150
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,241
'cause your 18th birthday's
coming up fast.

151
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,077
You've got to maintain a C+ average.

152
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,704
You know our deal.

153
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,248
Dad, I really... I don't
wanna join the army, OK?

154
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,208
I'm not cut out for the army.

155
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,920
C+. It's not too much
to ask for, Nick.

156
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,714
I'm studying as hard as I can.

157
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,466
Maybe I'm not smart enough,
but I'm doing the best that I can.

158
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:55,011
You're not working
hard enough, Nick.

159
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,806
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:04,895
Dad?

161
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,399
I really think that I can
make it as a drummer.

162
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,612
I really thought
that I could walk on the moon,

163
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,032
but you just don't see any
moon rocks around here, do ya?

164
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,702
Thanks for the talk, dad.

165
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,969
You mom cans her own vegetables?

166
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,442
Are you OK?

167
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,449
Look, why don't you go, um...

168
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,577
Why don't you go meet up
with those other guys?

169
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,704
Yeah, OK.

170
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,922
Look, Nick, I couldn't help
overhearing.

171
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,216
And I know maybe
it's none of my business,

172
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,427
but you're the one who told me that
your drums are your reason for living,

173
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,097
and I don't think you should
let anyone talk you out of that.

174
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,934
You just need to stick with it
and prove everybody wrong.

175
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,229
- Is that really what you think?
- Absolutely.

176
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,816
You can do whatever you want
if you believe in yourself.

177
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,280
No one's ever said that
to me before.

178
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,616
Well, it's true.

179
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,537
Thank you.

180
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,373
Lindsay...

181
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,753
You're like the only person
who's ever gotten what I'm about.

182
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,215
Yeah, well, we're not
that different...

183
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,593
Except you're gonna be
a famous drummer.

184
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,225
Do you wanna come with me
to meet up with those guys?

185
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,936
All right. Let's go.

186
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,773
I should probably change
out of these shorts first.

187
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,900
I think they look good.

188
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,904
It's just a lot easier for me to
drum without fabric on my thighs.

189
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,119
This earth ball doesn't
look like the earth.

190
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,747
Watch out!

191
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,500
That's it.
I'm gonna die in gym class.

192
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,006
OK, everybody hit the shower.

193
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,008
Come on, that's it.
Good job.

194
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,384
Good job today.

195
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,058
Come on, this is ridiculous.

196
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,684
My hands are filthy.

197
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,396
Yeah, and I can't say no to a long,
luxurious shower.

198
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,398
No! You can't!

199
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,487
You're on your own.
I'm farshtinkiner, and I'm showering.

200
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,530
Oh, come on.
Just one more day.

201
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,574
Would you quit being such a baby?

202
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,203
Just close your eyes,
and it'll be over before you know it.

203
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm with him.

204
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,998
Oh, thanks!

205
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,958
You know?

206
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,210
Friends.

207
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,714
Hey, Sam.

208
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,135
Are you taking French next year?

209
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,433
I don't know.

210
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,812
I'm thinking of taking German,
since I'm 1/4 German.

211
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,525
C-could you put on a towel?

212
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,277
Why?

213
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,071
Well...
'cause you're naked?

214
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,658
Sam, our bodies are merely a shell

215
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,660
which conceal our heavenly souls.

216
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,079
Try not to get too uptight.
Auf wiedersehen.

217
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,088
When did you get chest hair?

218
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,840
What? I have chest ha...

219
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh! Would you look at that?

220
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,344
It'll slow you down in the pool.

221
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,138
So, you guys are gonna do it.
I mean...

222
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,100
You're gonna take a shower.

223
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,060
It's just water. What could happen?

224
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,649
Well, you could stop smelling
like my butt, for one.

225
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,613
Oh, shoot! I was gonna bring some
cologne. I completely forgot.

226
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,449
Nail the geeks!

227
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,543
I hope I can still have kids.

228
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,380
Come on. You got hit in the groin.
You didn't have a hysterectomy.

229
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,184
Weir, what are you doing?

230
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,979
Look at that head of hair, huh?
You just get that cut?

231
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,650
That is very stylish
and very, very dry.

232
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,985
Come on. I'm not
going through this again.

233
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,279
Off with the clothes
and into the shower.

234
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:06,739
What?

235
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,074
I mean...

236
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,955
I don't feel too well.

237
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,831
You don't feel well.

238
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,333
You think I'm new?

239
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,252
Don't pull the fake
sick crap on me. Come on.

240
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,671
I am sick.

241
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,547
I'm dizzy...

242
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,884
and I have a headache,
and I'm nauseous.

243
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,803
All right, OK. Just go
to the nurse's office.

244
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,307
Pick up the Academy Award
on the way there, Weir.

245
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,811
Schweiber, put on some clothes.
You look like a 50-year-old man.

246
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,402
Hey, I thought you guys
were practicing today.

247
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,155
Yeah. I don't know if those guys
are coming or not.

248
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,574
They went down to the junkyard

249
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,785
to get a carburetor
for Kim's Gremlin.

250
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,787
Yeah, it might take a while.

251
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,289
What?

252
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,707
No. I just...

253
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,795
I think you guys
need to rehearse more.

254
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,590
I thought that you said
that we were good.

255
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,011
Yeah, but you guys aren't good
enough to win any competitions.

256
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,264
Thanks a lot, you know?
Thanks a lot, Lindsay.

257
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,598
No. I...

258
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,810
Well, I mean, it's true, Nick.

259
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,981
If you wanna prove
your dad wrong, then...

260
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,940
the band has to be really great,

261
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,694
or else he's gonna
send you to the army.

262
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,363
I know.

263
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,742
You just need to work harder.

264
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,037
You think so?

265
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,833
Yeah. When I was in the mathletes,

266
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,961
we did logarithms until
we couldn't see straight.

267
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,713
You know, but it paid off.

268
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,673
We were state champions,

269
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,426
and we went to nationals
2 years in a row.

270
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,848
I don't know.
Daniel isn't really into practicing.

271
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,143
Well, who's the leader of this band?
You or Daniel?

272
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,379
- Thank you!
- I like it fast.

273
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,843
Listen, guys...

274
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,220
Listen, uh...

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,849
That wasn't very good.
Let's try it again.

276
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,268
What?

277
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,687
Let's try
<i>Sunshine of your Love</i> again.

278
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,274
We just played it, man.
Why would we do it again?

279
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,485
'cause it wasn't...
It wasn't right, man.

280
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,822
It was really sloppy, and it didn't
really sound anything like the record.

281
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,575
I don't care what
the record sounds like, OK?

282
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,702
We play it the way we play it.

283
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,955
Are you still buyin' pot
from the same guy?

284
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,206
You mean me?

285
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,210
Look, guys... I just wanna
play the song right, you know?

286
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,504
Look, any way we play
is the right way.

287
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,797
Not if we want to get into
Battle of the Bands.

288
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,384
I could give a crap about
Battle of the Bands!

289
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,178
Who cares?

290
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,603
You were right, Lindsay.

291
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,441
Right about what?

292
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,696
Please. Do tell.

293
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,910
I'll tell you.
That you guys don't care, you know?

294
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,164
Look, maybe you guys
are just screwin' around,

295
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,583
but I want us to be good, you know?

296
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,877
I'm tired of sucking
at everything in my life,

297
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,339
and I wanna nail
that audition, all right?

298
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,799
But we're not gonna
nail that audition

299
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,301
unless we play the songs
over and over and over again

300
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,262
until they're perfect.

301
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,974
All right, Daniel? So can we just
play the song right once?

302
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,851
Please?

303
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,563
All right?

304
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,950
- Let's play the stupid song.
- Thank you.

305
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,123
Did you hear any sticks, man?

306
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,876
Wait for my sticks, all right?

307
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,629
Gee, this is really fun, guys.

308
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,464
I'm glad we have a band.

309
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,582
- Well, that sucked.
- Royally.

310
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,627
No, hey.
Hey, it sounded better.

311
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,672
- Yeah, it really did sound better.
- Oh, did it, Lindsay?

312
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,340
Do you approve?

313
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,760
- Come on, Daniel.
- I'm outta here.

314
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,721
You're a piece of work, Lindsay.

315
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,348
- Daniel, where you going?
- Anywhere!

316
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,810
- We need to rehearse more!
- No, you need to rehearse more!

317
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,770
We need to get the hell out of here!

318
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,857
I hate this song now. We played it
6 times. I never wanna hear it again.

319
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,484
It sounded better.

320
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,902
Who cares, man?

321
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,155
We're in a paneled basement,
not the Silverdome.

322
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,450
You know, you and Yoko here
have turned music into school.

323
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,453
What are you gonna do,
start handing out band homework?

324
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,914
I just wanna play
the song right, Daniel!

325
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,751
- Then go join the marching band, geek.
- You know what? Shut up!

326
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,461
At least the marching band can play
something right twice in a row!

327
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,297
You are a dumb-ass, Andopolis!

328
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,050
Rock'n roll don't come from your brain.
It comes from your crotch.

329
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,011
And if you ever got any,
Mr. Cute shorts,

330
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,804
you'd know that.

331
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,847
Let's get out of here.
I quit.

332
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,392
- Fine!
- I guess that means I quit.

333
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,060
Fine! Quit!

334
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,857
You're not even good enough
to be in Creation!

335
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,448
Thanks a lot, Lindsay.

336
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,250
I don't get it.

337
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,710
What do they have that we don't?

338
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,919
Good bodies.

339
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,298
So he can throw her
over his shoulder.

340
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,300
Big deal.

341
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,636
He should use his legs more.

342
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,096
He's gonna throw out his back.

343
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,848
I don't know.

344
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,351
I mean, my mom says that women prefer
guys with a good sense of humor.

345
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,562
But you're not very funny.

346
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,856
Screw you! I'm hilarious.

347
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,317
Ooh, how witty.

348
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,361
Get this guy on Hollywood squares.

349
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,864
I overheard that Todd Shellinger

350
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,867
takes off his shirt
when he makes out.

351
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,285
Why would he do that?

352
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,828
Why would anybody do that?

353
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,957
Probably to show off his chest hair.
I know that's what I'm gonna do.

354
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,960
Go ahead, laugh,

355
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,130
but all cool guys have hairy chests:

356
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,594
Selleck, Reynolds, Rockford.

357
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,470
Hey, what about Mork?

358
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,724
He's got more hair on his hand
than Sam has in his pits.

359
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,434
Shut up!

360
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,732
Will girls ever like us?

361
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,028
I think our best
play is to go for...

362
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,530
the smart, sexy librarian type.

363
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,575
You know, she's sweet and shy,

364
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,037
but then she takes off
her glasses and rrrowf!

365
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:55,332
Like Bailey on WKRP in Cincinnati.

366
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,795
But Cindy Sanders
is like a librarian type.

367
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,506
Yeah. Librarian for
the Playboy mansion.

368
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,968
This push-up's too hard to push up.

369
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,599
Oh, man!

370
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,892
Gross!

371
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,436
Oh, you're sick.

372
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,357
Oh, my god.
It's cold.

373
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,628
So, where is everybody?

374
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:44,966
No idea.

375
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,009
Well, that's kinda weird, isn't it?

376
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,304
That no one is around...

377
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,432
Not that you don't have
any idea where anyone is.

378
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,563
I'm gonna go.

379
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,982
Hey, Lindsay.

380
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,943
Thanks for breaking up the band.

381
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,570
- What?
- "What?"

382
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,489
I didn't break up the band.

383
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,659
I just thought you guys
should learn one song.

384
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,077
So, you admit it.

385
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,538
Yes, I admit it. I...

386
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,041
God! How could I be
so awful to suggest

387
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,044
that you actually play an entire song
correctly all the way through?

388
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,049
God knows Zeppelin only plays
half of <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>,

389
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,845
and the Who never even
practices <i>Teenage Wasteland</i>.

390
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,014
<i>Baba O'Reilly.</i>

391
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:34,807
What?

392
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,106
The name of the song
is <i>Baba O'Reilly</i>.

393
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,691
It's on <i>Who's Next</i>?

394
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,168
I didn't break up the band.
I just wanted to help Nick.

395
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,338
- Nick doesn't need any help.
- How can you say that?

396
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,508
If he doesn't make it as a drummer,
he has to go into the army.

397
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,842
What?

398
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,553
He's not gonna make it as a drummer.

399
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,474
So why don't you just let him have
some fun before he has to ship off?

400
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,061
Yeah? Well, you sound
just like his dad.

401
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,979
Maybe his dad is right.

402
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,941
I can't believe you're saying that.

403
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,947
Lindsay, he's not gonna be
the next Keith Moon.

404
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,615
If he's got someplace to go
to take care of him,

405
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,450
why don't you just stay
out of his way?

406
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,787
Daniel, that is not
how it has to be.

407
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,550
Schweiber.

408
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,469
- Here.
- Trinsky.

409
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,887
Ich bin hier.

410
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,013
Weir.

411
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,143
Anybody seen Weir?

412
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,315
Yeah, man, and this kid,
he was, like,

413
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,859
"Red-rum! Red-rum!"

414
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,905
Forget it, man,
red-rum's murder backwards.

415
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,866
Come on.
This ain't tea with the queen.

416
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,870
You leave now, you're still 10 minutes
late to class. Come on, let's go.

417
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:22,789
- Red-rum...
- Aw, get out of here, you nut!

418
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,341
Who's there?

419
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,884
Who's in there?

420
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,354
You know, it's a little easier
if you sit down and drop your pants.

421
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,658
So, uh, how come you
weren't in English today?

422
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,369
I bailed.

423
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,374
The whole band breaking up thing
has gotten me really down.

424
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,375
You know?

425
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,377
Yeah, well, it shouldn't.

426
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,380
And it wasn't a real band.
Those guys were just screwing around.

427
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,467
You're the only one trying
to be a professional.

428
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,096
I still don't have a band, you know?

429
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,768
Well, maybe you could join this one.

430
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,979
What are you talking about?

431
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,194
Dimension's looking
for a new drummer?!

432
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,904
It was up at the record store.

433
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,282
These guys are like the top
working band in Detroit!

434
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,660
I saw them open for Jethro Tull
at Cobo Hall last year.

435
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,497
Tull could barely follow them.
Oh, man!

436
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,208
You could be getting paid
to drum, like a real job.

437
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,293
Hell, yeah!

438
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,838
Man, I gotta go call these guys
and set up an audition.

439
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,635
And then I gotta go practice.
It's not... it's not 5:00 yet, is it?

440
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,312
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

441
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,023
I don't want to get naked
in front of other guys.

442
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,651
Well, who does?

443
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:18,071
You know how many men have
seen me naked in my lifetime?

444
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,323
A lot.

445
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,158
Do you think I'm
comfortable with it?

446
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,952
No, but I live with it.

447
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,164
I just don't want them to tease me.

448
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,665
Who would tease you?

449
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,000
All right, look, here's what you do.

450
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,298
You tell the you're proud
of your body. That'll show 'em.

451
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,635
You have a beautiful body.

452
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,305
Doesn't he, Harold?

453
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,142
Yes. I just said
he had a beautiful body.

454
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,436
Those other boys are
probably just jealous.

455
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,147
Lindsay, tell your brother
what a beautiful body he has.

456
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,316
- Mom!
- Mom!

457
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:55,026
- Lindsay.
- What?

458
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,696
Your mother asked you to tell
your brother he has a beautiful body.

459
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,323
That is so stupid.

460
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,866
Lindsay, tell him.

461
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,868
It's not gonna help him.

462
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,331
Just say the words.
It'll make him feel better.

463
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,837
You have a beautiful body.

464
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,007
You're an adonis, a slab of beef...

465
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,800
If I wasn't your sister,

466
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,803
oh, my god...

467
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,262
Lindsay! Can it.

468
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,057
See, sweetheart?

469
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,418
That was great, Paul.
We'll be in touch.

470
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,421
I never played on a drum kit
this small before.

471
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,550
I'm sure I'll be fine.

472
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:02,802
You Nick?

473
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,226
- Hey, I'm Scott.
- Hello, Scott.

474
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,772
- That's Alex, and that's Vance.
- Hey, Alex. Hello, Vance.

475
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,691
- How's it goin', man?
- Great.

476
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,693
I hope this kit's OK with you.

477
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,693
Oh, yeah.
No, it's fine.

478
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:23,196
The one I normally play on
is a lot bigger.

479
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,324
- Really? How many pieces?
- 29.

480
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,243
29-piece kit.

481
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,746
What are you doing here?
You should be auditioning us.

482
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,706
Yeah, right. Right?

483
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,837
I saw you guys open for Jethro Tull
at Cobo Hall last year.

484
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,630
You guys blew them away.

485
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,175
You must've been there Friday, 'cause
Saturday we got booed off the stage.

486
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,304
We didn't get booed off the stage.

487
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,765
So what do you say?
You wanna jam or what?

488
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,060
- Cool.
- Let's rock it, man.

489
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,064
You call the tune.

490
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,359
How about a little Cream?

491
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,069
Yeah, let's do <i>Crossroads</i>.

492
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,822
What do you...
what about <i>Sunshine of your Love</i>?

493
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,283
I hate that song.
Let's do <i>Crossroads</i>.

494
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,783
We do it live.

495
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,538
- No problem.
- All right. Count it off, my man.

496
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,647
That was good, but let's
try it a little bit tighter.

497
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,105
Tighter?

498
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,817
- All right. Let's do it.
- Count it off.

499
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,998
Hold it. Hold it.

500
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,959
Hold on. Let's try it
just a little bit quicker pace.

501
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,172
Oh, quicker pace.

502
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,681
Sorry'bout that.
Ready?

503
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,599
- All right, here we go.
- Count it off.

504
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,397
Good. All right.
Great job, man.

505
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,023
Cool. Thanks a lot.

506
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,735
What do you mean?
That's it? What, that's it?

507
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,363
Thanks a lot.

508
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,200
Hey, good luck with
that 29-piecer, man.

509
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,829
Maybe someday,
you'll knock it up to an even 30.

510
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,331
Thanks.

511
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,182
So, what are you gonna do now?

512
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,644
Join the army, I guess.

513
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,189
No. I mean... Right now.

514
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,818
Do you want to go to
the record store or anything?

515
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,280
- I suck, Lindsay.
- No, you don't.

516
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,326
You were in there with me, right?

517
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,244
You... you heard me playing?

518
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,830
I was a joke.

519
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,671
You know, Nick,
those guys are 5 years older than you.

520
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,506
And in 5 years, you're gonna be
way better than they are.

521
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,092
No, I'm not.

522
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,434
Sometimes I go down in my basement,
and I put on a live album,

523
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,687
I can... see myself on the stage.

524
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,190
Do you understand what I mean?
I can see it.

525
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,983
And I'm playing a 10-minute solo,

526
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,362
and I'm on one of those
hydraulic risers, you know,

527
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,238
that make the drum kit
go way up high.

528
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,492
I'm Peter Chris or something.

529
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,203
Oh, man...

530
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,669
I'm not gonna be that guy.

531
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,003
I'm never gonna be that guy.

532
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,466
I'll be lucky if I get to be

533
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,842
the guy who pushes the button
that makes the riser go up,

534
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,011
but I'm not even gonna be that guy.

535
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,933
I'm not even gonna be that guy 'cause
I can't even keep a C+ average, man.

536
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,603
Well, Nick, I could... I can
help you get your grades up.

537
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,108
He's gonna make me join the army.

538
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,485
Oh, man, I'm gonna have
to join the army.

539
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:15,196
I'm gonna be surrounded
by a group of psychopaths

540
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,532
like my brothers and like my dad.

541
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,202
Nick, come on.

542
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,080
That's not gonna happen to you.

543
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,582
I won't let it.

544
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,750
Oh, my god.

545
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,212
I'm done, man.

546
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,340
I'm done.

547
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,842
What is wrong with them?

548
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:03,679
Why do they think that hitting
people with towels is so funny?

549
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,556
If it wasn't us...

550
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,976
It would be kinda funny.

551
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,938
Afternoon, gentlemen.

552
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,818
Hey, have you lost weight?

553
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,654
Shut up!

554
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,615
Get out of my way.

555
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,285
I'm gonna take a shower.

556
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,915
Look who finally decided
to take a shower.

557
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,709
Nice pecs, Weir.

558
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,088
You look like a flat-chested girl.

559
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,341
Flat-chested girl.

560
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,676
Well, I'm proud of my body.

561
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,679
Oh, he's proud of his body.

562
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,681
He should be proud.
Look at this.

563
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,684
Maybe you should show it to
everybody then.

564
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,310
What are you doing?!

565
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,188
Come on, guys.
Guys, don't...

566
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,734
I wouldn't want you to miss class.

567
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,238
Come on!

568
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,910
Let me in!
Mr. Fredricks!

569
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,369
So, how long have you been teaching?

570
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,080
- 2 months.
- 2 months? Do you like it?

571
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,708
- I love it.
- I love it, too.

572
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,504
Oh, I'm sorry, Rear.

573
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,380
I forgot to take that!

574
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,186
Got some shorts in my locker.

575
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,995
What...

576
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,375
Sam, Alan's gone.

577
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,919
All clear, you can come back now.

578
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,554
Can I talk to you for a second?

579
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,514
Yeah. Sure.

580
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,231
- Streaker!
- Go, Sam! Go!

581
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,338
- Where you from?
- I'm from right here.

582
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,299
- I actually live down the street.
- You're from right here?

583
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,598
Yeah, right.
You know...

584
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,647
Well, what the hell
are you looking at?

585
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,901
The shower's that way.

586
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,952
I just wanted you to know I can't
stop thinking about that kiss.

587
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,993
Oh, good.

588
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,667
It really meant a lot to me.

589
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,458
I'm glad.

590
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,923
Let's go out to the patio.

591
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,300
Patio? I thought you were
fighting with those guys.

592
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,302
Yeah, we were, but not anymore.

593
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,805
We fight like that all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.

594
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,807
They heard what happened
at the audition.

595
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,351
They came over last night,
we're cool.

596
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,812
You guys, I'm serious.

597
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,815
I think my mom, like, wants to come
see the band play or something.

598
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,734
- When she gets out of rehab?
- Shut up.

599
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,281
Ringo starr.

600
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,326
You finally got your wish, Nick.

601
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,744
You're as good a drummer
as John Bonham.

602
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,995
Of course, he's dead.

603
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,041
You should've seen the looks
on those guys' faces, man.

604
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,211
I think I ruined their love
of music forever.

605
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,384
Is Dimension gonna charge you for
the pee stain you left on the drum seat?

606
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,802
Shut up.
Look, Dimension sucks, man.

607
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,305
You're too good for them.
I saw them open for Tull,

608
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,390
they got booed off the stage.

609
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,601
Thanks a lot, man.

610
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,691
Lindsay, we have to talk.

611
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,818
You are such a slut.

612
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,905
No. It's cool.
We just gotta be out by 5:00.

613
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:31,866
Let's play some real songs for once.

614
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,450
I wrote out some Iggy Pop
and Ramones songs.

615
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,872
The Ramones? The Ramones
only play, like, 3 chords, man.

616
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,415
- So I'll learn another one.
- I gotta pee.

617
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,168
I heard you jumped him.

618
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,086
What?

619
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,715
You don't have to act innocent,
Lindsay, I know you're a slut.

620
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,302
I'm pretty sure
Cindy didn't see you.

621
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,720
And if she did, it was just
with her peripheral vision.

622
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,264
You know, it wouldn't be bad
if people saw my back.

623
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,061
But my front's a whole
other story, you know?

624
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,230
Maybe I could transfer
to another school.

625
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,689
Well, well, well.

626
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,613
That was fun
in gym class today, huh?

627
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,571
Leave me alone.

628
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,910
They're bringing in the psychiatrist
for the kids who had to see you naked.

629
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,995
Shut up, Alan.

630
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,245
There he is!

631
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:22,415
Hey, Sam, I heard you streaked!

632
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,832
Way to go!

633
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,128
Hey, shut up!

634
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,215
All right, Sam.

635
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,180
You guys are losers,
and you always will be.

636
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,268
How come you're the one
riding home with no friends?

637
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,188
You're like a god.

638
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,897
People are gonna worship you.

639
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,931
I play so much better
when you're around.

640
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:24,228
I want to play it again.
Put more dry ice in the bucket.

641
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,228
Sure.

642
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,693
Thanks.
