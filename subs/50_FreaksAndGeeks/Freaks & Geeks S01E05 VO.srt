Freaks and Geeks S01E05 Tests and Breasts (VO)

00:00:01,354 --> 00:00:04,209
"Puberty usually begins
between the ages of 11 and 14,

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:07,024
"when profound hormonal
changes occur.

3
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:09,630
"The onset of these changes
is the function

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:11,636
of a small gland
called the pituitary.

5
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:14,819
"This gland sends chemical signals
throughout the body,

00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:17,058
"most notably resulting
in height increase,

7
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,626
and hair growth
in the genital area."

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,063
Hey, hey!
Knock it off!

9
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,149
You think this is funny?
Just try me.

10
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:27,526
OK, all right.

11
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:31,678
Here is a female
reproductive system.

12
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,909
"The uterus is composed
of 2 main parts..."

13
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,411
What the hell is that?

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,330
You think she's single?

15
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,785
- Looks like it's from outer space.
- Shut up.

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,834
Weir!

17
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,549
You have something to say?

18
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,072
When you get the clap 'cause you weren't
paying attention in health class,

19
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,636
is that gonna be funny, too?

20
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,597
I didn't think so.

21
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,684
"The cervix. It has
a fine canal running through it

22
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:02,520
opening into the cavity
of the uterus above."

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,437
Didn't Sigourney Weaver
kill that thing in <i>Alien</i>?

24
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:06,562
Quiet.

25
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,319
"During pregnancy..."

26
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,530
Remember when it popped
out of the guy's stomach?

27
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,646
Idiot, it jumped out
of his chest.

28
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:16,993
- Shut up.
- All right, Weir!

29
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:20,560
Since you seem to know everything,
I got a great idea.

30
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:23,708
Why don't I shut my big mouth,
and you come up to teach the class.

31
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:25,751
Sorry.

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,609
I said get up here.

33
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,070
Get up here! Let's go.

34
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:40,516
Oh, uh, excuse me, Dr. Love?

35
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,334
Can you show me
where the ovaries are located?

36
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:47,273
- Ovaries?
- Ovaries.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,652
Sorry.

38
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,817
Uh, cervix?
Cervix.

39
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,275
Cervix.

40
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,872
Cervix says no.

41
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,691
Hey, all right...
Pachoski, you want to go help him?

42
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,756
The vagina, Weir, the va...
Easy one, easy one.

43
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,924
Basic stuff, guys know it.
Go ahead, point to it.

44
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,267
I don't know.

45
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,085
All right, mr. Weir,

46
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:30,496
instead of yucking it up in class,
you might want to pay attention,

47
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:33,008
or you're going
to have a very difficult life.

48
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,717
OK? Sit down, Dr. Love.

49
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:38,824
Dr. Love.

50
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,603
At least I didn't get head lice.

52
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:42,828
Thanks for those, Tricia,
they were de-licious.

53
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,832
Hey, good game on Saturday, Eddie.

54
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:50,535
Jennifer, I've been hearing
some terrific things about you

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,537
from my sources
in the English department.

56
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:54,038
As you were.

57
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,193
Hey, Brad.
Haven't seen you in a while.

58
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:59,488
- Stop by the office. We'll rap.
- Sure thing, Mr. Rosso.

59
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,785
Peace, brother.

60
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,578
Rock on, Kirby.

61
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:13,913
OK, Mr. Desario,
it's time for your favorite class.

62
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:21,415
OK, come on, people, simmer down.

63
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,940
Come on, let's go.

64
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:25,211
This is my time, not yours.

65
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:28,179
Hey, chatty Cathy,
you sit on the furniture at home?

66
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:31,270
OK, a reminder
about tomorrow's test.

67
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,564
It's tomorrow.

68
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,650
Uh, Kowchevski?

69
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,385
Desario.

70
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:40,780
Didn't we take a test last week?

71
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,114
Your point?

72
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:45,199
Well, I just don't think you've
taught us enough in the past week

73
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:47,328
to give us another test.

74
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:50,378
OK, people, in math,

75
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:52,647
every week you build off

76
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,882
what you learned the week before.

77
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:57,385
I mean, it's like a bus.
And you keep missing the bus,

78
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,757
you're never gonna
be able to catch up.

79
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,468
But, uh, I don't ride the bus, sir.

80
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:05,993
Yeah, flunk another test, Desario,

81
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,879
and you just might have to
come back here next year

82
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,601
and ride the bus with me again.

83
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,470
... so the guy looks up at her,
right, and he says,

84
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:19,348
"how do you think
I rang the doorbell?"

85
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,226
Oh, man, that's so raunchy.

86
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:24,729
- I don't get it.
- What's to get?

87
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:27,231
Jocks don't know how to tell jokes.

88
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:28,356
Do you get it?

89
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,475
I don't really like jokes.
I don't think they're funny.

90
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,311
I mean, maybe if we understood it,
it would be funny.

91
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:37,042
- They were laughing pretty hard.
- Trust me, they're idiots.

92
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,629
It's not funny.

93
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:43,138
Hi, Sam.

94
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:47,346
Hi, cindy.
How are you?

95
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,222
- I'm good, and you?
- Uh, pretty good.

96
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:52,518
Are you going to
the muscular dystrophy carnival?

97
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,194
- I'm in charge of the ice cream booth.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

98
00:05:56,886 --> 00:06:00,323
Oh, hey, Dr. Love, hey,
I can't find my girlfriend's cervix.

99
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:01,948
Can you help me out?

100
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,115
OK, what was that all about?

101
00:06:06,505 --> 00:06:09,035
Oh, that was just...
an inside joke.

102
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:11,996
Anyways,

103
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,612
if you need another volunteer
for the ice cream booth,

104
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:17,501
I'm around.

105
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:20,051
Well, thanks,
but Betsy's already doing it.

106
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,061
But make sure you stop by, though.

107
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:24,741
- OK.
- All right, see ya.

108
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:29,199
Hey, Tommy, are you coming
to the muscular dystrophy carnival?

109
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:30,824
Excuse me, Dr. Love?

110
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,370
Would you autograph my genitals?

111
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,592
I took 20 bucks from my mom, right?

112
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,573
But she thought it was my brother.

113
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:44,428
She completely went nuts on him,
hit him over the head with a spatula.

114
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:47,198
- I mean, it was hilarious.
- Sounds it.

115
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:50,978
God! You bastard!
Why'd you do that?

116
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,386
I don't know.

117
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,583
God, what are you, lit or something?
You know? Jeez!

118
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,626
- I'm sorry. Mellow out, all right?
- How do you like it?

119
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:01,829
Now I gotta walk around all day
with pop on my shirt.

120
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,249
You know?
Thanks a lot.

121
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,012
I get these weird urges sometimes.

122
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,013
I should probably go apologize.

123
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,313
Are you OK?

124
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:31,063
Kowchevski says if
I flunk this test tomorrow

125
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,810
I'll have to take algebra again.

126
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,200
Do you think you might flunk it?

127
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,249
No, I'm definitely gonna flunk it.

128
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,652
Do you take algebra?

129
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,490
No. I took it last year.

130
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:48,259
I take trig.

131
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,927
You must study a lot.

132
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:53,480
Math isn't this big deal
that everyone thinks it is.

133
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,983
It's just a few basic
formulas and some shortcuts,

134
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,937
- and then you plug in the numbers...
- Shortcuts? You mean, like, tricks?

135
00:08:00,483 --> 00:08:02,233
You could call them that.

136
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,151
You could definitely do it
if you wanted to.

137
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,102
Oh, yeah, I know.

138
00:08:07,643 --> 00:08:10,419
I mean, if I study, I could do it.

139
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,867
It's not like I'm a bus driver.

140
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,622
It's just, you know,
it doesn't interest me. It's so lame.

141
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,724
But do you really want to be
in Kowchevski's class again?

142
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:23,263
Hell, no.
I'd rather be in jail.

143
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:26,172
Well, I could help you study.

144
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,975
It could be kind of fun.

145
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,972
So the guy says,
"how do you think I rang the doorbell?"

146
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,228
- So it is funny.
- What does it mean?

147
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,813
You guys are so young.

148
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,898
You're only a year older
than we are.

149
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:47,623
Yeah, come on, Harris,
what does it mean?

150
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,907
He doesn't get it, either.

151
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:51,155
Oh, I get it.

152
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,406
Then tell us.

153
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,158
- I can't.
- Why not?

154
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,492
- 'Cause then you'd know.
- So, that's the point, isn't it?

155
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:00,039
You have to find out for yourselves.

156
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,874
That's why we're asking.

157
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,948
I told you.
He doesn't know.

158
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,337
If I didn't know,
would I be with Judith here?

159
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,205
Harris, you're so bad.

160
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:17,032
Love is like homework.

161
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:20,540
You got to study
if you want to get an "A."

162
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,524
So then the guy says,
"how do you think I rang the doorbell?"

163
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,902
- Do you get it?
- I don't.

164
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,854
Dad?

165
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:37,170
You know who's funny?
That Red Buttons.

166
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,914
- Who could that be?
- Oh, that's Daniel.

167
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,208
- A friend from school.
- I'll get the door.

168
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:47,121
It's dark out, and you're a...
a girl.

169
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:53,134
Hi, is Lindsay here?

170
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,827
Yeah.

171
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,025
OK, so...
how do you want to do this?

172
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:08,311
I don't know.
I've never done this before.

173
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:12,032
OK, well, in your textbook...

174
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,557
Did you bring your textbook?

175
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,586
I probably should have, huh?

176
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,044
Man...

177
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,846
Screwed up already.

178
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,522
No, it's OK.

179
00:10:28,647 --> 00:10:31,297
I think I have mine from last year.

180
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,354
Great.

181
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,885
You know, there's
these practice tests in here,

182
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,958
and they're kind of helpful.

183
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,658
Just talking about studying
makes me want to take a nap.

184
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:44,078
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

185
00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:45,227
What?

186
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,990
You can't smoke in here.

187
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:48,631
I... I mean, I don't care.

188
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,337
It's just, my parents.

189
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,812
Right, I'm sorry.

190
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,020
I got an idea.

191
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,516
I'll go outside and smoke this,

192
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,141
and when I get back,

193
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:02,898
blaze through those tricks of yours.

194
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,501
What you got there?

195
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,147
Nothing.

196
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:31,584
Nothing?

197
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,749
What's that?

198
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:39,063
Let me see.

199
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,564
These types of books just
make me think of all the crap

200
00:11:43,689 --> 00:11:45,246
that can go wrong inside you.

201
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,499
Why you reading this?

202
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,770
I'm taking sex ed
with Mr. Fredricks.

203
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:57,008
He embarrassed me
in front of the whole class

204
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,344
just because I'm a little bit behind
when it comes to that sort of stuff.

205
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,271
Yeah, I know how that goes.

206
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,161
You do?

207
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:10,872
You're not gonna learn anything
you can use from a book like that.

208
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,762
- I'm not?
- No.

209
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:21,446
I tell you what.

210
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:24,869
I'll find you at school tomorrow.
I'll set you up.

211
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:27,542
With what?

212
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,317
Don't worry. It's cool.

213
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,173
So, let's try a different one.

214
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:42,297
How do you solve
this type of problem?

215
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:48,028
- Use the quadratic formula?
- Exactly.

216
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:51,876
And what is the quadratic formula?

217
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,316
"x" equals...

218
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,157
Negative "b,"

219
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:03,087
plus or minus...
the square root...

220
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:07,442
When you told me you were gonna teach me
tricks, I thought you meant real tricks.

221
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:10,060
What do you mean, like magic tricks?

222
00:13:10,185 --> 00:13:12,035
I mean yeah, well, sort of.

223
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,565
Right now you're kind
of just teaching me math.

224
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,690
Yeah, but you're gonna get it.

225
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,358
I know, but I can't learn all this.

226
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,071
The test is tomorrow.

227
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:22,260
There's no way.

228
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:24,971
I... I don't know what else to do.

229
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:31,045
- I'll be cool.
- Really?

230
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,317
Hey, I'm sorry
for wasting your time.

231
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:42,028
No. You didn't.

232
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:45,866
You wanna do something?

233
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:50,927
Well, I don't think I can.
It's a school night and everything.

234
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:52,957
Are you sure you're OK?

235
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,675
Yeah, fine.

236
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,025
- See ya.
- Good luck.

237
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:03,336
See ya tomorrow.

238
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,958
The Hulk could kick
the Thing's butt any day.

239
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,395
No way! The thing could
definitely take the Hulk.

240
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,113
Even if the Hulk could beat him,
all it has to do is wait

241
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:17,728
till the Hulk turns into Bill Bixby
again and cream him, no problem.

242
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:19,867
- You know, you're right.
- Hey, Weir.

243
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:20,992
Come here.

244
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,235
I got something you
might be interested in.

245
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,460
Check it out, but don't lose it.

246
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:30,036
I want it back.

247
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
All right.

248
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:38,646
Don't open it here, man.

249
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:42,487
I don't want it getting confiscated,
know what I'm saying?

250
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:44,613
All right.

251
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,700
Confiscated?

252
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:51,836
Come on, let's go.

253
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,653
Hey, chump.
I need your help.

254
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:00,778
Come here.

255
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:06,200
Come on. I need to get something
out of this classroom.

256
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:10,329
If you see Kowchevski coming,
you just bang on this door, all right?

257
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,167
Hey, don't screw me over.
Look alive.

258
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,082
I'm alive, man.
You don't have to hit me.

259
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,295
All right.

260
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,981
I'll be out in a second.

261
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:23,923
Hey, Nick, what's up?

262
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,092
Oh, hey, what's up, Sarah?

263
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,875
Did you hear Danielle and I were gonna
sing <i>Super Trouper</i> at the talent show?

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah, we're gonna
dress up like ABBA.

265
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,003
ABBA, huh?

266
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:46,466
They're from...
Switzerland, right?

267
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,782
No, I think they're
from Sweden, actually.

268
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,247
What are you doing?

269
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:59,417
I'm, uh... thinking about ABBA.

270
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:06,896
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

271
00:16:07,872 --> 00:16:10,698
All right.
Well, uh, talk to you later.

272
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,461
I think I'm getting
a wart on my wrist.

273
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,683
Jesus, man,
this algebra test is crazy.

274
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,798
- What language is this?
- How do you get rid of a wart?

275
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,439
Hey. I'm trying to think here, OK?

276
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,814
I'm sorry, man.

277
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:27,975
It looks like some kind
of movie or something.

278
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,200
Let me see that.
Let me see it.

279
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,226
Hang on.

280
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:35,493
Oh, my god.

281
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,468
It's a naked woman.

282
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:40,807
- What's she doing?
- Who cares what she's doing?

283
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,473
She's naked.

284
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:44,982
It's a dirty movie.

285
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:47,077
You mean, like a porno?

286
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:49,947
Oh! Eww! Give me that.

287
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,347
What am I supposed
to do with a porno?

288
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,160
You watch it...

289
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,055
Over and over.

290
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,562
Only perverts watch pornos, right?

291
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:05,195
Well, then every guy
in America is a pervert.

292
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,027
The meaning of that joke
is right here.

293
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,739
How am I supposed to watch it?
I don't even have a projector.

294
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,038
Well, I do.
Give it to me.

295
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:18,042
After school today,
we go to my house,

296
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,414
and we watch this movie
from beginning to end.

297
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,047
Agreed?

298
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,172
OK.

299
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:36,180
I ganked the test.

300
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:37,848
Wait. What?

301
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:44,438
I stole it from Kowchevski's office.
He's got no clue.

302
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,167
I need your help.
I can't figure any of this out.

303
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,161
I can't.

304
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:55,503
Sure, you can.
This stuff's easy for you.

305
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:56,951
No, I mean...

306
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,246
- I shouldn't.
- Why not?

307
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,043
Don't worry.

308
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,967
I'm not gonna be hitting you up
every time I have a math test.

309
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:14,635
I promise.

310
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,393
So for this one...

311
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,315
Look, I don't mean to be uptight,

312
00:18:28,322 --> 00:18:29,609
but it's just...

313
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,944
Why don't I talk to Kowchevski?

314
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:34,238
What? Why?

315
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,070
I'll ask him for an extension.

316
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,950
He gave me one once.
He likes me.

317
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:41,058
I'll tell him I'm tutoring you
and you're getting the hang of it,

318
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:43,583
but you just need
a little more time.

319
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:47,335
Wouldn't it just be easier
to fill out this test?

320
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,463
Let me talk to him, OK?

321
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,466
Forget it. That dirtbag's
not gonna get an extension.

322
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,886
But I was working with him last night,
and he's really learning.

323
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:59,055
Daniel's the kind of student

324
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,100
who needs more attention, you know?

325
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,101
No. Daniel's the kind of student
who needs to just disappear.

326
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,187
Excuse me?

327
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,359
Look, he wastes my time.
He wastes class time.

328
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,068
And now he's wasting your time.

329
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:15,021
Well, no, he's not wasting
anybody's time.

330
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,155
I mean...

331
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,784
isn't it your job to teach him?

332
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:20,952
Lindsay...

333
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,957
I know Daniel is cute
with his bedroom eyes

334
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,709
and his stringy hair,

335
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:32,713
but he's a loser.
And losers pull down winners.

336
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,383
Now...

337
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,051
You're a smart girl.

338
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:40,554
Don't let your hormones
get in the way.

339
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:43,128
Excuse me.

340
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,099
Where's that test?

341
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,862
- In my jacket.
- Let's go.

342
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:56,279
. 74 times 23...
Put that in parentheses.

343
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:59,519
And x equals 19y,

344
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:02,572
and y equals 8.

345
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:07,132
Damn, it's weird you can
do this in your head.

346
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:08,962
Like a brainiac or something.

347
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:10,251
Thanks.

348
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,949
I can't wait to see
Kowchevski's face

349
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:16,048
when he hands this back to me.
This will blow his mind.

350
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,922
Yeah, but, Daniel,
this isn't over, right?

351
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:22,409
I'm gonna tutor you, and you won't
have to steal any more tests.

352
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,765
Yeah. I know.
No. I know.

353
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,443
I'm gonna be, like,

354
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,618
a guy with one of those things.

355
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,884
An abacus?

356
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:35,997
7y4x equals 9...

357
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:45,365
Come on, people. This is just a test,
not a death sentence.

358
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,590
If you're prepared,
you got nothin' to worry about.

359
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:21,338
Congratulations.

360
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,116
Turns out your friend Daniel didn't
need that extension after all.

361
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:25,993
He got an "A" on the algebra test.

362
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,815
Yeah, well, I told you
I helped him study.

363
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,590
Did you help him cheat?

364
00:21:35,707 --> 00:21:37,838
I've got an anonymous
note that says you did.

365
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:40,841
Well, I didn't.
I didn't cheat.

366
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:43,223
I think you did.

367
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,575
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

368
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,200
You're in a lot of trouble,
young lady.

369
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:53,049
Why were you talking
to Mr. Kowchevski?

370
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,328
Are you joining the mathletes again?

371
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,683
Jeez.
Sorry I asked.

372
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:08,369
You have popcorn?

373
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:12,088
Bill, this is a porno.
You don't eat popcorn during a porno.

374
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,287
This is taking forever.

375
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,422
We could've made
our own porno by now.

376
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:18,406
Do you want
the projector to eat the film

377
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:22,535
and have that Daniel guy kill you?
'cause, I mean, we can do that, too.

378
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,870
All right. There.

379
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,805
- Kill the lights.
- Aye, aye, sir.

380
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:36,101
Here we go.

381
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,867
How'd you like to come home
to that every night?

382
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:55,730
He's in good shape.

383
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:00,520
Oh, my god.

384
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,540
This is... weird.

385
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:31,243
That guy's got the best
job in the world.

386
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,138
Hey, you think there's
any short porn stars?

387
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,643
- I'm so dead.
- What did you tell Kowchevski?

388
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,618
- Nothing.
- Did you tell him that we cheated?

389
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:00,160
He could see it all over my face.

390
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,441
Then it's not over.

391
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:06,767
Anonymous note?
That means nothing. Get in.

392
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:11,971
As long as we don't, you know,
admit it, they got jack on us.

393
00:24:12,096 --> 00:24:14,112
You want to deny it?

394
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:15,663
Yeah, definitely.

395
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,790
- Daniel, I don't...
- Listen, Lindsay.

396
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,640
You're good at math.
I'm good at this sort of thing.

397
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:25,221
And when something like this happens,
you deny everything.

398
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,617
But I'm not a good liar.

399
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:36,642
Lindsay, I got you into this.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

400
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:38,603
But you gotta trust me.

401
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:40,897
We're in this together.

402
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,429
So, you want me
to thread it up again?

403
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,929
I'm goin' home.

404
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,392
Are we gonna go to hell for this?

405
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:03,998
I don't wanna go to hell.

406
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:10,192
Hey, Sam.

407
00:25:10,971 --> 00:25:14,584
You hardly touched your chicken
à la king. Aren't you hungry?

408
00:25:18,838 --> 00:25:20,971
I had a really big...

409
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:23,230
snack at Neal's.

410
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,590
After school.

411
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:28,903
May I be excused?

412
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:33,462
OK. But we're having chocolate
coconut squares for dessert.

413
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:37,557
Maybe later.

414
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:39,132
All right, sweetie.

415
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:43,062
- Of course.
- He's at that stage.

416
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,565
Yes, I understand totally.
All right. Good-bye.

417
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,771
You went through that.
You wouldn't eat a thing.

418
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:52,176
That was Mr. Kowchevski
on the phone.

419
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:56,430
Apparently, my daughter
is now a cheater.

420
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,600
She cheated on a math test.
Now she's facing suspension.

421
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,727
My aunt Sally. Lindsay!

422
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,063
It's not true.

423
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,275
You're a good student.
I don't understand why you would cheat.

424
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,360
She's hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

425
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:11,624
They're lying and cheating,
and, next thing you know,

426
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,990
she's Patty Hearst,
and she's got a gun to our head.

427
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:17,076
- Dad, I just told you it's not true.
- Maybe I don't believe you.

428
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:20,550
You don't even ask me
my side of the story?

429
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:23,374
You just jump to conclusions
and start yelling at me?

430
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,459
God, that is so sick.

431
00:26:26,823 --> 00:26:28,221
You know... fine.

432
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:30,043
Believe what you wanna believe.

433
00:26:30,168 --> 00:26:32,174
I don't even care.
Whatever.

434
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,553
You know, thanks
for all the support.

435
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,000
So then the guy says to her,

436
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,812
"how do you think
I rang the doorbell?"

437
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,199
It's a pretty good one, huh?

438
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:00,526
I need to talk to you.

439
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:04,415
Some of the mathletes
have been saying things...

440
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:05,995
About you.

441
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,793
Yeah? Like what?

442
00:27:08,592 --> 00:27:11,923
There's a rumor going around...
that you cheated on a math test.

443
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:13,758
I told them that's impossible.

444
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:16,422
Even though Lindsay's
not a mathlete anymore,

445
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:18,804
she would never break
the league's code of honor.

446
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,394
Yeah? Well, guess what, Millie?

447
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,896
I did cheat.

448
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,604
I lied and I cheated,
and then I lied some more.

449
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,868
You're funny, Lindsay.

450
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:35,603
I knew it wasn't true.

451
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:54,632
So...

452
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,677
Anyone see <i>Dukes of
Hazzard</i> last night?

453
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,110
It was a good one.

454
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,144
Yeah. Boss Hogg is really funny.

455
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:11,607
What's goin' on, guys?

456
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,571
All right, I'll see you later. Bye.

457
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,938
Hey, Sam.

458
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:26,219
What do you want?

459
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:29,351
Well, I was just wondering if you could
help me out with the ice cream booth

460
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,915
'cause Betsy can't
make it to the carnival.

461
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,591
Well, it turns out that
I can't make it, either.

462
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:38,889
Oh, that's too bad.

463
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,078
I'm a little busy right now, so...

464
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,098
Yeah, OK. Sure.

465
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,698
I'll see you later.

466
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:54,638
Wasn't that great,

467
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,904
when the Dukes handcuffed Roscoe,
Enos, and Boss Hogg together?

468
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:04,523
That was... really funny.

469
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,789
Is there anything you want to tell me
before the meeting this afternoon?

470
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:13,711
Just... I didn't cheat.

471
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:15,692
You know...

472
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,928
Something like this happened to me
when I was in high school.

473
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:22,678
- Got a minute?
- I guess.

474
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:28,666
I felt bad for this kid.
Bruce Conforti.

475
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:31,896
So I'd kinda "help" him
on biology tests.

476
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,440
OK, we cheated.

477
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,257
But after a while,

478
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:39,932
I realized he was the one
being cheated,

479
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:41,551
out of something priceless...

480
00:29:41,676 --> 00:29:42,990
Knowledge.

481
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:46,622
So one day, I just told him,

482
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:49,362
I'm not gonna do that anymore.
And...

483
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,104
He studied and he got
all As on his own?

484
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:55,606
Close. He beat
the living crap outta me.

485
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:01,273
And when I say, beat
the living crap outta me,

486
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,844
I mean, the living crap.

487
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,973
All I did was help Daniel study.

488
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:12,957
I trust you.

489
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:23,823
Hey, Kim.
Where's Daniel?

490
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:25,783
I don't know.
Beats me.

491
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,661
We have a disciplinary
meeting after school.

492
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:31,260
You nervous?

493
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:33,374
You know, don't worry about it.

494
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,960
Daniel gets out of stuff
like this all the time.

495
00:30:38,606 --> 00:30:40,562
Well, I shouldn't feel bad, right?

496
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:44,580
I mean, Kowchevski is a jerk,
and I'm gonna tutor Daniel,

497
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:48,055
and he'll pass the class.
Everything's gonna work out, right?

498
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,083
I'm sorry.

499
00:30:52,674 --> 00:30:56,480
You think that you and Daniel
are gonna be, like, study buddies?

500
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,233
He wants to learn.
And what about the next test?

501
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:02,548
He'll just get the answers
from somebody else.

502
00:31:02,673 --> 00:31:04,550
He always does.

503
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:09,910
You ready to stick it to the Man?

504
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,822
Partners in crime?
Give me five.

505
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:16,876
Hey, don't leave me hangin'.

506
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:20,421
All right.

507
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,680
Another thing they do
is the old cop trick.

508
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:38,184
They'll get you alone,
and they'll tell you I confessed.

509
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,400
But don't believe 'em.
I'll never confess, OK?

510
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,944
Well, I'm going to.

511
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,405
- I can't keep lying.
- Why not?

512
00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:48,895
What is this,
some kind of game to you?

513
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,855
You already got me to cheat

514
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,399
and to lie to my parents
and to Mr. Rosso.

515
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:57,208
I know, but... Why stop now?
We're almost home free.

516
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,773
All right. Lindsay.
Lindsay, I understand.

517
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:03,547
You care about your grades
and your transcript.

518
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:08,631
But if you get suspended,
it goes on your transcript.

519
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:11,097
Then you really will be screwed.

520
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:13,975
You're manipulating me.

521
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,393
What?

522
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,144
You're manipulating me.

523
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,480
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

524
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:23,029
And you know, it's really hard
to say no to you, but I have to.

525
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:25,778
I'm sorry. I can't go in there
and lie. I'm not going to.

526
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,549
- Fine. Don't lie.
- What?

527
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:30,477
No, let's go in there,
and we'll tell 'em what we did.

528
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:32,371
What's the difference?

529
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,373
You'll get a nice slap on the wrist,

530
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:36,831
and I'll get, what,
suspended? Expelled?

531
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,000
That is not fair, Daniel.

532
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,169
What do you think,
I want to be terrible at school?

533
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:44,505
You think I like it?

534
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:48,672
I wish I was as smart as you.
I wish it all came easy to me.

535
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,430
But it doesn't.

536
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:55,752
You know, when I was...
When I was in sixth grade,

537
00:32:55,877 --> 00:32:57,783
they told us when we got
to junior high,

538
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:01,033
we'd be either in track one,
track two, or track three.

539
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:05,384
Track one's the smart kids,
track two's the normal kids,

540
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:08,041
track three is the dumb kids.

541
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,448
And what do you think I got?

542
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,014
How do you think it feels...

543
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:16,889
to be told you're dumb...

544
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:20,374
When you're eleven years-old?

545
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,365
You are not dumb.

546
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:30,265
I just wanted to prove him wrong...

547
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,144
Just once...

548
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,223
Even if I am cheating.

549
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:43,731
"If a pregnant woman has sex,
can the baby get... Poked?"

550
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,113
Hey. Hyenas!

551
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:50,783
Can I get through one question without
you guys gettin' hysterical on me?

552
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:54,075
Listen, sex is perfectly safe
for the fetus.

553
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:58,321
It's not gonna come out with dents on
its head like a golf ball or somethin'.

554
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:00,247
I mean, Dellage got poked
in the eye.

555
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,517
I'm kidding. Kiddin', Dellage.

556
00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:08,517
Listen. Chapter 13 in
the text tomorrow for a pop quiz.

557
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:10,724
Whoop! You didn't hear it from me.

558
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:14,449
Can I talk to you for a minute?

559
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:17,689
In my office?

560
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,517
Sure.

561
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,096
When I was goin'
through these questions,

562
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,855
I was a little disturbed by yours.

563
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,392
How did you know
which one was mine? I thought...

564
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,424
I thought it was anonymous.

565
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,699
You're the only one with
Star Trek notebook paper.

566
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:39,138
Where'd you find out
about this..."activity"?

567
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:46,224
I saw a movie.

568
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,186
OK. I see.

569
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:52,928
Well, you know...

570
00:34:53,537 --> 00:34:55,551
In movies like that...

571
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,431
They sensationalize
certain things...

572
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:02,846
But in reality,
those things don't usually happen.

573
00:35:04,732 --> 00:35:06,832
You know what I'm tryin' to say?

574
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,470
All right. I'm gonna
tell you the truth. Plain language.

575
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:14,989
But listen, you can't tell
anybody we had this conversation.

576
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:17,783
Your permission slip for sex ed
doesn't cover this stuff.

577
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,735
I could get in a lot of trouble
for what I'm gonna tell you.

578
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,996
All right?

579
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,642
Fair enough.

580
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,193
Certain men... Not me...

581
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:27,720
Torture over.
We're done.

582
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:31,004
But just... just...
I mean,

583
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,627
those movies...
It's not reality.

584
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:36,195
OK? If it was reality,
I'd be freaked out myself.

585
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:40,199
- Thank you, mr. Fredricks.
- No problem.

586
00:36:40,628 --> 00:36:42,660
All right. Get outta here, cowboy.

587
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:45,746
I have just one more question.

588
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,331
What is it?

589
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,431
Could you explain this joke to me?

590
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:53,004
So, there's this guy
with no arms and no legs...

591
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:03,396
If you want to tell
the truth, it's cool.

592
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,161
Whatever you want.

593
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:07,810
Daniel,
let's just stick to our story.

594
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:14,358
When we get in there...
Let me handle it. OK?

595
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:23,095
Well, I'm cheesed off
right now, and I don't care.

596
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,097
Hi. We're Lindsay Weir's parents.

597
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:28,067
Mom... Dad.
What are you doing here?

598
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,069
Honey, we...

599
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:33,072
We felt terrible about last night.

600
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:36,385
You've always been truthful with us,
so we never should've doubted you.

601
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,577
Nobody falsely accuses my daughter!

602
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:40,142
Honey. Shh.

603
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,261
It's OK. I mean, it happens.

604
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,079
Not to members of this family,
it doesn't!

605
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:47,975
I want to give this Kowchevski
joker a piece of my mind.

606
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,645
Your father even closed the store.

607
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:55,911
Now, let's be patient,
try and hear everyone out,

608
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:59,233
Be a team. We don't actually
know that anyone cheated.

609
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:00,358
I do.

610
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,601
Well, fine. Unfortunately,

611
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:05,068
an anonymous note
isn't sufficient proof.

612
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,523
- There is no note.
- There's no note?

613
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:11,457
No. I use this as a ploy sometimes
to get a confession.

614
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,962
How do you expect to have real
relationships with these kids

615
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:16,866
- if you're lying to them?
- Let me tell you something.

616
00:38:16,991 --> 00:38:19,842
I knew kids like Desario in Vietnam.

617
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,760
Those were the kind of kids
that got you killed.

618
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,479
Everyone's here.

619
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:29,272
And if she says she didn't help
this kid cheat, then she didn't!

620
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:30,810
She tutored him, and it worked.

621
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,603
Yeah. You shouldn't
be punishing her.

622
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,717
You should be paying her
for doing your job.

623
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:37,219
Harold, it's recently come
to my attention

624
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:40,319
that there was
no anonymous note written.

625
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:43,197
- There was no note?
- No. It was a fraud.

626
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,792
- I apologize.
- See? I told you.

627
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:49,181
But we're still not entirely
convinced these two didn't cheat.

628
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:51,872
So you want to punish my daughter,
but you have no proof.

629
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:54,834
Look, Mr. Weir,
it should've never come to this.

630
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,057
I've talked to Lindsay.
I know she didn't do anything.

631
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:01,549
Daniel, did you...
Cheat on this test?

632
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:04,613
Good. Then I'm satisfied.

633
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:06,632
You're satisfied?
I'm not satisfied.

634
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:09,530
- Give it up, Frank.
- I took off work for this?

635
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,393
- I apologize for the inconvenience.
- No, no, no. Hold on a second.

636
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:14,353
I've got an idea.

637
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,647
I have the algebra test
that Daniel took.

638
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,317
If he can do the first problem,

639
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:22,248
I will not only get down
on my hands and knees

640
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:25,072
and beg everyone
in this room for forgiveness...

641
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:28,659
But I'll quit.
I will resign.

642
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:30,494
I'll never teach again.

643
00:39:30,864 --> 00:39:32,241
That'd be a start.

644
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:34,832
I already took the test.
You can't make me take iagain.

645
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:36,402
Yes, I can.

646
00:39:37,426 --> 00:39:39,715
Come on, Daniel.
One problem...

647
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,182
And this all goes away.

648
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,745
- Come on, son.
- Go ahead, Daniel.

649
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,181
Just need to use
the quadratic formula.

650
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,115
See? Look at him go.

651
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:32,056
I'm sorry if I was acting...

652
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:34,600
weird... at lunch.

653
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,560
Were you acting weird?

654
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:39,905
Well... anyways...

655
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:43,645
It turns out
that I can go to the carnival.

656
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,147
So, I mean, if you don't...

657
00:40:45,272 --> 00:40:47,947
If you still don't have a scooper,
I'm available.

658
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,009
Jeanine already said
that she was gonna.

659
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,828
But we can always
use another scooper.

660
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,194
And, look. Grab a brush.

661
00:40:57,946 --> 00:40:59,267
Thank you.

662
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:06,201
So, what time should I be there?

663
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:08,092
Well, I don't know.
It starts at noon,

664
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,862
so maybe you should come at 11:00.

665
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:11,887
AM? PM?

666
00:41:15,652 --> 00:41:16,652
12 noon.

667
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:24,126
He's got a problem.
That's all.

668
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:31,741
What is that?

669
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,659


670
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:37,017
That... is a student
that Mr. Rosso believes in.

671
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:41,542
Led Zeppelin is actually
the name of a popular rock band.

672
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,379
I know who Led Zeppelin is!

673
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:46,047
What the hell's goin' on here?
Are you kidding us with this crap?

674
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,598
Lindsay, you lied to us?

675
00:41:47,723 --> 00:41:50,195
Do you have any idea
how much money I'm losing?

676
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,235
Look, don't blame Lindsay.

677
00:41:53,217 --> 00:41:54,680
It's not her fault.

678
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,178
It's mine.

679
00:41:57,753 --> 00:42:00,993
She was just tryin' to help me.
Nobody else ever does.

680
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:03,948
What do you think,
I want to be terrible at school?

681
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:06,138
You think I like it?

682
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,482
I wish I was smart, you know?
I wish it all came easy to me,

683
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:11,072
but it doesn't.

684
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,319
You know, when I was in sixth grade,

685
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,567
they told us when
we got to junior high,

686
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:19,872
we'd be either in track one,
track two, or track three.

687
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,810
Track one's the smart kids,

688
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:23,812
track two's the normal kids,

689
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:25,837
track three's the dumb kids.

690
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:28,923
And what do you think I got?

691
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,938
How do you think it feels
to be told that you're dumb

692
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:35,388
in ink when you're eleven years old?

693
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,035
I mean... where are you
supposed to go from there?

694
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:06,794
Look. She's as high as a kite!

695
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:10,047
- My daughter is not high!
- Harold, what is going on?

696
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:13,434
- I thinks it's a nervous reaction.
- I don't know what's happening.

697
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,923
Tense situation.
I don't...

698
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:19,932
Track three!

699
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,769
Lindsay, what's going on?!
Will you... Stop laughing?

700
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,730
- You started all this.
- No, I did not start all this!

701
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:30,539
This school is the wrong
school for my daughter!

702
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:34,020
I asked him to do one question.
He could not even do one question.

703
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,282
She's a track one girl!
