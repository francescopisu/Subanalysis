00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,300
Hey, um...

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,800
My friend was wondering, uh...

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,300
If i gave you a joint,
would you have sex with me?

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,300
What?

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,300
I can't believe you did it.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Lindsay!

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,300
Hey! hey, guess what?

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,800
We got a gig.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Yeah. Stroker's brother's
gonna let us play at his party.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Uh, he's even gonna loan us

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,300
A marshall stack and a peavey bass cabinet.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,700
It's, like, total pro equipment.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
Yeah. We're gonna blow
the roof off his garage

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,200
In a most rock-tagious way.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,600
Wow. That's really great, you guys.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,100
So we just need your parents'
station wagon to pick up the amps.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,500
What? You guys can't use my parent's car.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
They're insane about it.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,500
My dad even calls it betty.

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,500
Lindsay, please.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,500
I mean, we need to get
those amps. Don't be lame.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm not being lame, daniel.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,100
My parents are never gonna let us

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Borrow their station wagon.

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Well, didn't you say

27
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,600
That your mom plays bridge
or something on tuesdays?

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, so?

29
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,500
So, she won't even know it's
gone. Just grab the keys.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,000
We'll be back before she
finishes the first hand.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
I don't know.

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
Oh! Squirrel!

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,800
Lindsay, whoa ! Jeez, my neck !

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,700
Just run over the stupid squirrel, linze.

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,700
Lindsa lindsay: aw.

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Y, you are a terrible driver.

37
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Shut up, daniel.

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,200
You are.

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,700
How far is this place, Japan ?

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
No. We're almost there.
it's on the next block.

41
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,200
No, daniel, i told you.

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,700
It's not on hancock. it's on warren.

43
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
It's on hancock. i was just there.

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
Hey, could you put on some real music?

45
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,700
I hate this new wave crap.

46
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
No. No. Leave it on,
man. that's joe jackson.

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,600
His bass player's unbelievable, man.

48
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,600
Hey, there's valerie's house, you guys!

49
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,600
You guys, i'm telling you,
we're going the wrong way.

50
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Lind no, we're not.

51
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,100
Y, please drive like a normal person.

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
I am driving nice.

53
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,900
Yeah. Yeah. roll down the windows

54
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,400
'Cause i got a big one a-brewing.

55
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,900
Oh, no. Please don't.

56
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,400
Ew. Ken, you better not.

57
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,900
Ken: it's coming! lindsay: ew!

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Those miller farts are unbelievable.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Lindsay, that's it!

60
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
That's the house over there! Right there!

61
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,700
Where ?

62
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,500
Watch out!

63
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,500
Oh, my god!

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Oh, my god.

85
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,800
I hate being in school after it's out.

86
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
Makes me feel like a janitor.

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
Janitors are cool.

88
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,300
I'd like to be a janitor.

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,800
Why? So you can show up with the red sawdust

90
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,300
After a kid throws up?

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,800
No. 'Cause janitors make
way more than teachers.

92
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,300
It makes up for all that
gross stuff they have to do.

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Todd: why? cindy: oh, you.

94
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Because i'm a girl.

95
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Come on, girls can call guys.

96
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Girls do not call guys.

97
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Sure, they do.

98
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,300
No, they don't.

99
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
Come on.

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
What's so great about him anyway?

101
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,800
It's the hair.

102
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,300
Oh, come on !

103
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
She likes him because of his hair?

104
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,800
Of course. He's got the
feathered thing going.

105
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,300
Girls love that.

106
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Yeah. All the men my mom dates

107
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,800
Have feathered hair.

108
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,300
I heard

109
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
Her talking to her girlfriends.

110
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,800
She said any guy with
feathered hair is foxy.

111
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,200
But it's just hair.

112
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,800
I mean, why would girls
care how you comb it?

113
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,300
That's women.

114
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
They get turned on by weird stuff.

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,700
My god, look at my car!

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
What were you doing?

117
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,700
What were you thinking about?

118
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,200
I am so, so sorry.

119
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,200
What is wrong with

120
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,200
You? Didn't you see me
pulling out of the driveway?

121
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,200
Hey, lady, she said she was sorry.

122
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
You know, we're all a little upset here.

123
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Don't talk to me now. do not talk to me.

124
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,700
Barbara, could you call the police?

125
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,200
The police?! come on, lady!

126
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Calm the hell down, all right?

127
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Kim, knock it off!

128
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
God, this is all your fault!

129
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,700
What? Lindsay, how is this my fault?

130
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Oh. "that's the house!"
that's when you were-

131
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

132
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Take it easy. it's both your faults.

133
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,200
What? This is not my fault, daniel.

134
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
You're the one who talked me into this.

135
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
I didn't talk you into anything.

136
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,100
Do you have any idea how
much trouble i am gonna be in?

137
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,100
You are gonna pay for every last
cent of this damage, young lady.

138
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Hey, lady. There's something
you might not have heard of.

139
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,600
It's called insurance.

140
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, please. You just stay
away from me. Just stay away.

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,100
Yeah. Who wants to be near
you anyways. You're too sexy.

142
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh, please. Oh, man.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Olice.you know that?

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I could call the police

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And report this as grand theft auto.

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can send my own dyou know that?

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,100
I'm so sorry, daddy.

148
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,200
You know what?

149
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,100
Lieve anythingyou say anymore.

150
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,600
Why should i?

151
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,900
You're grounded.

152
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,900
I can't even tell you for how long.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,500
You'll be coming homeand
sitting in your room.

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,000
No stereo, no radio,

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No tv, no nothing.

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,400
And you are not to hang out

157
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
With those burnt-out friends of yours...

158
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Ever again.

159
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,900
Ever! Do you hear me?

160
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,400
Don't worry.

161
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,900
I won't.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,900
You'd beer not.

163
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, lindsay.

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I saw the smashed car in your driveway.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just wanted to make sure

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Are you ok, lindsay?

167
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,300
Yeah.

168
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,800
No.

169
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,300
It was so terrible, millie.

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,300
It just didn't sound like
anything you've ever heard.

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,800
It was just this thud.

172
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
It was so scary.

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
Who was in the car with you?

174
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,200
Who do you think?

175
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,200
Sorry, lindsay.

176
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,700

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,700
Ou want, i can go get my uno deck.

178
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
No. I'm fine.

179
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Did you hear what happened
at the mathlete scrimmage

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Against north lake?

181
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Katie got so nervous when
she went up to do her round

182
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,300
That she got a bloody nose.

183
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
And then, she didn't know it.

184
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
She had to sneeze, and she
blew blood all over the place.

185
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,800
She looked down, and
she saw it on her shirt,

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
And she fainted.

187
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,300
Uh-uh.

188
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
No, she didn't.

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,200
Well, no, but...

190
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,200
She was gonna.

191
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,200
It was pretty funny.

192
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,200
So, how's the team doing this year?

193
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,700
They, uh
- it's been cool.

194
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Not as fun as last year.

195
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,700
I really miss you, lindsay.

196
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,700
All the mathletes do.

197
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,400

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,900
Oh, man.

200
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,900
How am i gonna get this on
without messing up my hair?

201
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
Gonna run till my feet are raw

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Slip kid, slip kid...

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,300
Man!

204
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm a soldier at 13

205
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,800
Slip kid, slip kid, realization

206
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,800
There's no easy way to be free

207
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,300
No easy way to be free

208
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,300
Boy, i can just imagine how much
those pirates are gonna charge me.

209
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,800
Just pretend you know a lot about cars.

210
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
But i don't.

211
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,900
They can smell it, the bloodsuckers.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah-

213
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,400
What's the matter?

214
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,400
Lindsay, you want some bacon?

215
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,900
No, thanks, mom.

216
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,900
I'm just gonna have some juice.

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, my goodness.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
What?

219
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
Sam.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,500
Hey, dad.

221
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,000
Sammy, you look so handsome.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Just like one of the hardy boys.

223
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Thanks.

224
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Hey, sam, wait up.

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Bye, mom.

226
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Bye, dad.

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Wow.

228
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,300
My goodness.

229
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,800
Don't the weirs look nice today?

230
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Thank you

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,900
See you.

232
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,900
See you, sam.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
Ha ha ha ha!

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
What, did you just come from church?

235
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,400
So, how'd things go with your dad?

236
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,900
Was he pissed?

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,400
No. Not at all. he was really happy

238
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,900
That i stole his car and smashed it.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,900
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
The party got moved till tonight.

241
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
You know what, daniel?

242
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
That doesn't make me feel any better

243
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
'Cause now i'm grounded, so i can't go

244
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
To any of your stupid parties, ever.

245
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,400
Why don't you just sneak out?

246
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Why don't you just go to hell?

247
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,900
Whoa.

248
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,400
God, lindsay.

249
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
Oh, shut up, kim!

250
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,300
I'm sick of you guys getting
me in trouble all the time.

251
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm sick of you guys, period.

252
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,300
Maybe you're just on your period.

253
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,300
Yeah, daniel, that's exactly it.

254
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,800
I'm on my period. you figured it out.

255
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,300
It was a joke.

256
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
Oh, sorry.

257
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,800
It's hard to pick up on
the subtlety of your wit.

258
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,300
What's up your butt, princess?

259
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,800
You are, daniel! i'm tired of you using me.

260
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,500
You're the most selfish people

261
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,000
I've ever met in my life.

262
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,300
Look, i know you don't
care about being smart

263
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,800
Or going to school or anything else,

264
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,300
But just because your
lives are such lost causes,

265
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,300
Don't keep assuming that mine is.

266
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,200
What was that all about?

267
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,700
I don't know,

268
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
But it was pretty funny.

269
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Shut up.

270
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,800
You know, who asked her to
hang out with us anyways?

271
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,800
Like we need her little
judgments all the time.

272
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,800
My life ain't a lost cause, you know?

273
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
Hers is.

274
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,800
She's just a big baby.

275
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,300
I told you guys that from day one.

276
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,300
It's like hanging out with my grandma.

277
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah. Well, little miss perfect doesn't know

278
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
What i'm gonna do with my life.

279
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,300
She doesn't know what my plans are.

280
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,800
What the hell are your plans?

281
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
I got a lot of plans.

282
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,700
Like?

283
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,100
Who are you, my guidance counselor?

284
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,600
What areyougonna do?

285
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm gonna wait for my dad to die

286
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
So i inherit his company.

287
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Then i'm gonna sell it and move to hawaii.

288
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Great plan.

289
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,200
I don't hear anything
better coming out of you.

290
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,400
Well...

291
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,900
I'm gonna be, like, a lawyer or something.

292
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm gonna put the pole on trial.

293
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,400
I'm gonna get guys out of jail and stuff.

294
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,400
You know?

295
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,900
Yeah. Maybe you can
break daniel out of there.

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,900
Screw you, man. i'm not going to jail.

297
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Ok. what will you be doing?

298
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Plenty.

299
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,400
Now if you're done grilling me, mr. Rosso,

300
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Why don't you give me a dollar
so i can get some sno-balls?

301
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Ok.

302
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,000
You guys, i'm telling you,

303
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This-it's not about the accident.

304
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,600
Lindsay's really depressed
that i broke up with her.

305
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,100
She's got to get over it though, you know?

306
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah, nick. Sure.

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,100
So, i guess you're gonna be, like,

308
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,600
A psychiatrist or something.

309
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
No. I'm gonna be a deejay, man.

310
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,200
And maybe, um, a lumberjack.

311
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,800
The name of the company
is texas instruments,

312
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,300
But i heard it's made in taiwan.

313
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,800
Hey.

314
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,800
Is it ok if i sit here?

315
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,800
Yeah. Sit down, lindsay.

316
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,800
Hi, carey.

317
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,800
Hi.

318
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,800
Hi, erin. hi.

319
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,300
Look, lindsay. erin got a new calculator.

320
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,300
It graphs and everything.

321
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,300
I got it for my birthday.

322
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,100
That's cool.

323
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Do you have a calculator, lindsay?

324
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,900
No. My dad won't buy me one.

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,400
He says einstein did fine
without one and so should i.

326
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,700
You don't need one, lindsay.

327
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,200
Yeah. remember that judge

328
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
At the intra-districts last year?

329
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
He called you the human calculator.

330
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,700
Oh, yeah.

331
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
I think I had a crush on you.

332
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,200
What?

333
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,700
Ew, he was, like, 40 years old.

334
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,700
That's so gross.

335
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Hey, lindsay,

336
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
I'm having a slumber party friday night.

337
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,300
All the mathletes are gonna
be there. You wanna go?

338
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,400
Well...

339
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Yeah, i would, but i'm grounded.

340
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Oh, yeah.

341
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
Well, you should ask your dad.

342
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,900
It's just across the street.

343
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,400
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

344
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
Yeah?

345
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,800
Well, it maybe.

346
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,300
'S an interesting look, sam.

347
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,300
Naw. Your hair's not long
enough to be feathered.

348
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,800
I think it looks weird,

349
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Like you're trying to be
all fancy or something.

350
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,300
I don't think you should
worry with how you look, sam.

351
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,300
My mom always says that you should be happy

352
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
With what the good lord gave you.

353
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Well, the good lord gave you a lot, gordon.

354
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,800
Neal & sam: bill!

355
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,300
My whole family's big-boned. it's genetic.

356
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,300
Besides, the world loves jolly fat guys.

357
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,300
Burl ives, jackie gleason...

358
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Santa claus, uh, curly, raymond burr.

359
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,100
No. Raymond burr's not jolly.

360
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,100
Well, he was extremely nice to me

361
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,100
At last year's auto show.

362
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,600
Hey.

363
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,300
Do any of you guys have
a pencil i could borrow?

364
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Oh, hey, cindy. how's it going?

365
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,400
It's ok. today in chemistry,

366
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,400
I sat on a piece of chocolate

367
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,900
And had to go home and change my pants.

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,200
Oh. Yeah.

369
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,900
Sam, did you wear a hat today?

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,900
Because your hair looks kind of flat.

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Got one.

372
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,500
Thanks

373
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
I'll bring it right back.

374
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,200
You better.

375
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, man.

376
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
You can't just comb your hair different

377
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,300
And expect cindy to start liking you.

378
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,600
You have to dress different, too.

379
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,600
I dress ok.

380
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,100
Sam, you look like your mother dresses you.

381
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,100
Hey, well, at least i don't dress
like a ventriloquist's dummy.

382
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Don't kill the messenger.

383
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,600
I know i look good. i dress well,

384
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,600
And i groom myself properly.

385
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Look around.

386
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,700
The whole school dresses better than you do.

387
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Change your clothes, change your life.

388
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
Pirates.

389
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
We live right outside detroit,

390
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,100
And they can't find a fender?

391
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Now i get 2 weeks of driving around town

392
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,600
Looking like some kind of hillbilly.

393
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,100
Hey, dad, can i borrow some money?

394
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,000
Hmm?

395
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,500
Uh, i wanna buy some new clothes tomorrow.

396
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,500
Oh, sammy, i'll take you to the mall.

397
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
We'll use my credit cards.

398
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,500
And then we can go to
magic pan and get crepes-

399
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, no. Mom! You always
get me something stupid,

400
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
Like garanimals or something like that.

401
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,500
I wanna buy my own clothes.

402
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Good idea Sam.

403
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
A man has to learn to dress himself.

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You know, you got to cut
those apron strings sometime.

405
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,100
Dad?

406
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I was thinking of going
back to the mathletes...

407
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,100
And i'll have to stay
after school for practice.

408
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,500
Is that ok?

409
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,500
Lindsay: DAD?

410
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,000
Well, yeah. i suppose it would be ok.

411
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,500
But if this is some kind of ploy,

412
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Then heaven help you.

413
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,500
It's not a ploy. and thanks.

414
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,300
Ok.

415
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
Ok. What's the gag?

416
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
There is no gag.

417
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,300
I thought you wanted me back on the team.

418
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,300
I'd love to have you back on
the team if you're serious.

419
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm serious.

420
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,200
That's great.

421
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,700
There's just one problem, lindsay.

422
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
I'm gonna have to put you in the reserves.

423
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Really? Aren't there any open blocks?

424
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
No. It's a big team this year.

425
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Look, why don't you
start coming to practices

426
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Until you get caught up,

427
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,200
And maybe in a couple of weeks,

428
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,700
We'll see what we can do. all right?

429
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,700
Yeah. Ok.

430
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,700
All right.

431
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
I got to go to class.

432
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,200
No. Come on. let's get out of here.

433
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,700
Dez gave me the keys to his place.

434
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,700
We'll go earn some extra biology credit.

435
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,200
What's your problem?

436
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I told you. i have to go to class.

437
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
Oh. Ok, lindsay.

438
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,700
You know what? shut up, man!

439
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,200
I thought you were the guy
that had all these big plans.

440
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,700
Yeah. I went to all my classes yesterday.

441
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,200
I could barely stay awake.

442
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,000
Then drink a cup of coffee

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And get it together, daniel.

444
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm out of here.

445
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,700
So, carl sagan say "that's not a cosine.

446
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
You don't know your asymptote
from a hole in the ground."

447
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,700
Oh, hi, lindsay.

448
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,200
Hey, shelly.

449
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,700
I hear that

450
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,700
You have to be on the reserves.

451
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,700
That's too bad.

452
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,900
You know, shelly,

453
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,900
If you give up first block,

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,400
Then lindsay could have
her spot back on the team.

455
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,400
Millie.

456
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,400
Just kidding.

457
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,400
Don't kid about first block.

458
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,100
Sorry.

459
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,600
You know, m.i.t. looks way more
carefully at your application

460
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,100
If you've been a first block.

461
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,600
I just can't believe that you
would give up being first block

462
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,100
Just to hang out with freaks.

463
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,100
God, shelly!

464
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,100
It's true! i'm not putting her down.

465
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,100
I mean, they're the ones who made
her get into that car accident.

466
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,000
I bet you they were all high.

467
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,000
Nobody was high.

468
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,500
Oh. Was that kim girl with you?

469
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,000
She's pregnant, you know.

470
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,500
My neighbor works at the free clinic,

471
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,500
And he said that he sawer
over there the other day.

472
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,000
Just because a girl chooses to live
her life differently than you do

473
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,500
Doesn't mean she's automatically
barefoot and pregnant.

474
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,500
I didn't say she was barefoot.

475
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,500
I mean, don't get all mad.

476
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Anyway, you know her better than i do.

477
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Mr. Kowchevski, i nt you
to make me first block.

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,600
Nice to see you, too!

479
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,900
Look, at least put me back on the team.

480
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,400
I am the best person at math in this school.

481
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,700
Well, actually, i think that i'm the
best person at math in this school.

482
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,200
Ok. But, come on,

483
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's cut the crap, kowchevski.

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Ok. you're right, lindsay,

485
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,000
The team needs you desperately. I mean,

486
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,500
If it wasn't for shelly,
we'd be in the toilet.

487
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
I cannot bounce anyone from this team.

488
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,000
They've been coming every day,
lindsay, it wouldn't be fair.

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,900
This is the mathletes,
not the football team.

490
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,900
What is the difference? it's still a team.

491
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,400
So if you're gonna have a team,

492
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,900
You might as well have a winning one.

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,300
Otherwise, what the hell
is the point of competing?

494
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Looks like a disco.

495
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Hey, guy, you can't eat in here.

496
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
I'm not done.

497
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,300
I can't throw it away.

498
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,700
Well, i can't have you getting mustard

499
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
All over our garments.

500
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,700
Yeah, maybe you should wait outside.

501
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,200
No, no, no.

502
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,700
There. All gone.

503
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Excellent. Well, uh,

504
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
What can i help you gents out with today?

505
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,600
Yeah, uh, i wanna buy some new clothes.

506
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,100
Something that'll make me look like

507
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,100
The best-dressed kid in school.

508
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Well, i've got a question for you.

509
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,200
You wanna be a stud,

510
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,700
Or do you wanna be a super stud?

511
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,200
Super stud, sam. go for super stud.

512
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,200
All right, then. walk this way.

513
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
All right, guys. check it out!

514
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,600
It's the latest thing in.

515
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,100
It's the hottest thing going

516
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,600
In europe right now.

517
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,600
What is it?

518
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,100
This is a parisian nightsuit,

519
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
And i predict every trendsetting guy

520
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,600
In this city's gonna own one.

521
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,600
Wow.

522
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,100
Really?

523
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Really is right.

524
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Buy this garment, and i guarantee

525
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,100
You'll be perceived as a man
of distinction by the ladies.

526
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,500
I don't know.

527
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey, guys, look at me.

528
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,500
You know, i'm not a handsome man,

529
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,000
But i learned how to style my hair,

530
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Started wearing some of these clothes.

531
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's been pretty cool.

532
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,900
All right, gang. I've had
to make some tough decisions

533
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
About who's gonna be competing tomorrow,

534
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,100
And some of you are not gonna like that.

535
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Lindsay, you're on the team.

536
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,800
She rejoins and gets into
competition in one day?

537
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,800
That's not fair!

538
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,800
No, shelly, it's not fair,

539
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,300
But if we lose against lincoln tomorrow,

540
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
We're gonna blow our home
advantage for the rest of the year.

541
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,800
This is just a little insurance.

542
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,200
Well, then, who's gonna get bumped?

543
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,700
Well, that's strictly a decision based

544
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,300
On the last few practices.

545
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Millie, would you mind sitting out tomorrow?

546
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,500
Oh.

547
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
No, mr. Kowchevski.

548
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,000
That's fine. i don't mind.

549
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,000
No, mr. Kowchevski, i-i
don't think millie should-

550
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,500
No, lindsay. that's cool.

551
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,500
The team really needs you.

552
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,500
No, we don't!

553
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
This is completely unfair to you, millie.

554
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,000
I said it's ok, shelly.

555
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,700
Care

556
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,700
DOESN'T MATTER. SHE'S NOT-

557
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,100
This is unfair to all of us!

558
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,600
You know, mind your own business!

559
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,600
This is my business!

560
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,100
No, it's not. shelly, i'm not trying-

561
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Ladies, ladies !

562
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,100
This is just

563
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,500
For tomorrow's scrimmage.

564
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,500
This isn't the last chopper out of saigon,

565
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,500
So can we please just crank
down the drama a notch, ok?

566
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,600
Ow!

567
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,500
Hey, cindy, what's happening?

568
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,500
Hey! Hey, cindy!

569
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,000
Hey, cindy, what's up?

570
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Hey, ouch! Ow! Ow!

571
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,800
Oh? Oh!

572
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,400
Well, she's a flame

573
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,400
Fla-a-a-ame

574
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Flamethrower, she's a...

575
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Let's you and me get outta here.

576
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
She's a flame

577
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Fla-a-a-ame

578
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
A red-hot blower, she's a

579
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Flamethrower tonight

580
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ow!

581
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Jeez, millie, don't you
ever clean your room?

582
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I just did.

583
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm really glad mr. Kowchevski

584
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,000
Kicked me off the team so you can be on it.

585
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
He didn't kick you off the team, millie.

586
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
He just put you on the reserves.

587
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Yeah, i know. don't worry.

588
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,800
How much does shelly know about trig?

589
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,300
Is she good at it?

590
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,800
I think so

591
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
. We don't have too many trig questions.

592
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,200
Yeah, but when you do,
does she get 'em right?

593
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,200
I don't know. i forget.

594
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,700
Millie! Come on, think!

595
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,200
If i'm gonna blow shelly out of the water,

596
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I gotta know this stuff.

597
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,700
Think mr. Kowchevski'll
move you to first block?

598
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,800
He'd better.

599
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,300
If i'm gonna be the mathletes,
i'm gonna be number one,

600
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,500
Or else i'm not gonna do it.

601
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Hey, mom. hey, honey.

602
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,500
I think i'm gonna eat in my room
so i can cram for the scrimmage.

603
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,500
Oh, lindsay, you've been studying nonstop.

604
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,000
Why don't you take a little break?

605
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,500
Mom,

606
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,500
I can't. not if i wanna win.

607
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,500
Lindsay, there is more
to life than competition.

608
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,500
Not if you want to wipe out shelly weaver.

609
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,000
Ah. Is she from lincoln?

610
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,500
No, she's on our team.

611
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh. Hey, lindsay?

612
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What?

613
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Are you having fun?

614
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah. Course i am.

615
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,700
Hi.

616
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Hey.

617
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
Ok what you say...

618
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,700
Hey!

619
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,700
Hello!

620
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,200
Go on and laugh at me 'cause you don't see

621
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,700
That i got something going right here

622
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:00,400
You gotta look sharp

623
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
And you gotta have no illusions...

624
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
What the hell is this?

625
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Oh, man. whoa!

626
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,300
Hey, henson, look!

627
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,800
It's the new disco ken doll!

628
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Ha ha ha ha!

629
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Hey, pull the string and make him talk!

630
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm telling you, you can light them
It's methane.

631
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
Yeah, but what if the
flame goes back inside you?

632
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
Do you
- do you explode?

633
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,500
Hey!

634
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, my god.

635
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,600
I guess elvis hasn't left the building.

636
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,100
Hey, don't make fun of him.

637
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,600

At's a parisian nightsuit,

639
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,700
In case you didn't know.

00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Hey, you guys-

641
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,200
A parisian? ooh la la!

642
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
No, no. it's a jumpsuit.

643
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,700
My grandpa in fort lauderdale

644
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,200
Be wears them all the time

645
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Cause he's too lazy to put on pants.

646
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Listen! I gotta get out out of here!

647
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,400
Head for the front door.

648
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,400
Hey, hey, what t-

649
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,400
Why did you buy that?

650
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,900
Hey, you were the one that
said i should dress better.

651
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,900
Yeah, i didn't say you should
dress like evel knievel.

652
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,900
Hey, guys, i think we're directing

653
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,900
More attention toward us by doing this.

654
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,900
This is cool.

655
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,400
I feel like i'm in the secret service.

656
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,900
Get me to the front door.

657
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,900
Hey, what are you doing?

659
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,900
W-we gotta go.

660
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,900
We got a pop quiz in
whitman's class, remember?

661
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Oh, man! Ok, uh...

662
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,400
Ok, tell whitman that i missed the bus.

663
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,400
Ok.

664
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,200
'Scuse me. where you going?

665
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,700
Yeah, uh, i was just gonna
go outside to get something.

666
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,500
Yeah? Well, unless you're
going out to drive a bus,

667
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
You'd better turn around

668
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,700
And get your butt to class.

669
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,100
Sorry.

670
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,100
Nice dud junior.

671
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Ok, now,

672
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
Who wants to take a crack at identifying

673
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,400
All the prepositional
phrases in these sentences?

674
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,900
No takers, huh?

675
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,900
Ok...sam.

676
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,900
Do you want to come up
here and give it a shot?

677
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,900
Come on, sam. make me proud.

678
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,900
My, don't you look nice!

679
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,400
Homo

680
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Homo

681
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,300
Hey, hey, hey!

682
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Now-now if sam wearing something different

683
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
To express his individuality

684
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,800
Makes him a "homo,"

685
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Well, then, i guess we should all be proud

686
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,800
To be "homos."

687
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Now you go ahead, sam.

688
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,200
You're not gonna beat me up, are you?

689
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,700
No.

690
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,100
What are you reading?

691
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,100
The, uh, the monster manual.

692
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,100
It's adungeons and dragons handbook.

693
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Do you play?

694
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
No.

695
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,100
You should.

696
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,600
You'd make a goo

697
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,100
D dungeon master. I can tell.

698
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,600
Yeah?

699
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Oh, yeah.

700
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,100
Thanks.

701
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,600
Can i ask you something?

702
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,600
Sure.

703
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
What do you make of me?

704
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,600
Excuse me?

705
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,700
Well, if someone asked you...

706
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,700
"What do you think of daniel
desario?" what would you say?

707
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Would you say he's a loser?

708
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,400
Um, um, no.

709
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
No, you're not a loser, 'cause you have sex.

710
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,900
But, if you weren't having sex,

711
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,300
Then we could definitely debate the issue.

712
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,800
Right.

713
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,400
You get good grades, huh?

714
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah, don't you?

715
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,600
No. I get terrible grades.

716
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,100
I don't even like thinking about school

717
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,600
'Cause i think about
how bad i'm really doing.

718
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,100
I was even left back once.

719
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,000
Ouch. Well...

720
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,000
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

721
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,000
Someone sent my dad a card with that on it

722
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,500
For his 65th birthdays.

723
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,000
You're dad's 65?

724
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,000
70 now.

725
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,500
When i'm 45 he'll be 100.

726
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You know, you're a pretty
interesting guy, harris.

727
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah, i mean, you do your own thing.

728
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,900
You're comfortable with yourself.

729
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,900
You got it pretyeah, i guess i do.

730
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,400
I don't have sex, though.

731
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,400
Ok, people, listen up. let's not get cocky

732
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,400
Just 'cause we have the
home-field advantage.

733
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,000
Now you all know your stuff,

734
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So just stay clearheaded,
and we blaze through this.

735
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
Now let's go kick some lincoln butt!

737
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Come on! Let's go.

738
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,000
Good luck, everybody.

739
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,500
Good luck, shelly.

740
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,900
Thanks. Same to you.

741
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,900
Good luck, lindsay.

742
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,900
Even though i know you don't need it.

743
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,900
Go, first block!

744
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,500
Nick?

745
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, what are you doing here?

746
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
What areyou doing here?

747
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,900
I

748
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Was just, um, killing some time.

749
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,900
All right, i gotta get going.

750
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,900
Mrs. Amendella?

751
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,400
Hi, it's sam from next door.

752
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Yeah, my mom's not home.

753
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,900
Oh, ok. All right, well, i'm at mckinley.

754
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,400
You think you could pick me up?

755
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,900
'Scuse me. Aren't you danny
terrio fromdance fever?

756
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,900
No, i told you, it's
chrissy fromthree's company.

757
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,900
Ha ha ha ha!

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,900
What do you want, alan?

759
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,900
I just wanna know something.

760
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,900
Exactly how queer are you?

761
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,400
Shut up.

762
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,900
No, really, really, i'm serious.

763
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
You know, just when i think

764
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,900
He's as queer as he can be,

765
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,400
You go and do something even queerer.

766
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Let me alone, alan! i'm sick of you!

767
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,400
Oh, my god. it's go time!

768
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,400
Hey!

769
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,400
Alan, how many times a day

770
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,400
To be cool?

771
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,400
I'm just trying to talk to sam.

772
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,900
Yeah, yeah, it looked like you guys

773
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,400
Were having a regular meeting of the minds.

774
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,900
What's this all about, sam?

775
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Mr. Rosso...

776
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,400
I need a ride home.

777
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,900
If the hour hand of a clock

778
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Moves k radians in 48 minutes,

779
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,800
Then k equals...

780
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,300
Theye a tough team.

781
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,800
You nervous?

782
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,800
I don't get nervous.

783
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,400
Wow. that's great.

784
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,900
I wish i was that confident.

785
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,400
It comes with being first block.

786
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Yeah, i remember.

787
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,300
0.4.

788
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
Correct.

789
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Well, guess i'm up. wish me luck.

791
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Woo hoo!

792
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,900
Question one:

793
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,900
If the longer diagonal of a rhombus is 10,

794
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,400
And the large angle is 100 degrees,

795
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,500
What is the area of the rhombus?

796
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
42.

797
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,800
Correct.

798
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,100
Woo! woo hoo!

799
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,600
You ok, sam?

800
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
I thought you were gonna change.

801
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Do i have to go back to school?

802
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,500
I mean, i'm sick of
everybody laughing at me.

803
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,500
So? Let 'em laugh.

804
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,500
Who cares?

805
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Sam, when i was about 20,

806
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,500
I was hanging out in
this honky-tonk down south

807
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,000
When a big bunch of rednecks surrounded me.

808
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Started making jokes about my fringe vest,

809
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,000
My hair.

810
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,500
Calling me a hippie, a woman.

811
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
They dragged me into an alley,

812
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,500
Made me dance,

813
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Told me to bark like a dog.

814
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,900
Did you do it?

815
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
Yeah.

816
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,900
Pretty much had to, there was 10 of them.

817
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
Heh. What happened?

818
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,300
It doesn matter.

819
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,400
What matters is that i
never lost pride in who i am.

820
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,300
Mr. Rosso,

821
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,300
I dressed up just to impress cindy sanders.

822
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,800
Sam, some of my friends

823
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,300
Are the dirtiest, stinkiest
guys you'll ever meet,

824
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,800
But they date more women

825
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,700
Than you or i could ever hope for.

826
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,700
It's all about confidence.

827
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
It's true.

828
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,700
If i say i'm the coolest guy in the world

829
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,700
And i believe i'm the
coolest guy in the world,

830
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,200
Then suddenly i become

831
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,700
The coolest guy in the world.

832
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,700
I'm telling you, it
sounds weird, but it works.

833
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,200
But i'm not cool.

834
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,100
You're not?

835
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,100
No.

836
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,100
Hmm.

837
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Well, then take a look at this kid.

838
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Because that's a cool kid.

839
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,300
One horizontal and one vertical asymptote.

840
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Correct. well done, mckinley.

841
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
"If arcsine x equals 2 arc cosinex,

842
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,500
Thenx equals..."

843
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Damn, i've never felt so stupid

844
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,500
In my whole life.

845
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
0.9.

846
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,400
Correct

847
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Perfect round to mckinley.

848
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
You were great, lindsay.

849
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,300
You were so great.

850
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,800
You're a born mathlete.

851
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,800
Ok, shelly, come on.

852
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,800
Let's give them that old
mckinley one-two punch.

853
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,800
Good luck, shelly.

854
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,300
"A sphere is inscribed in a cube.

855
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,800
"The ratio of the volume of the sphere

856
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,800
To the volume of the cube is..."

857
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
Come on, shelly.

858
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,700
We just went over this last week.

859
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
0.52:1.

860
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,200
Correct.

861
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,800
Did you guys see shelly

862
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
When she missed that square root problem?

863
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,800
She started sweating like a pig.

864
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,300
Hey Millie,
Now maybe kowchevski.

865
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,300
Will kick her off the team,

866
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,800
And you can get your block back.

867
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,300
I guess. i hope so.

868
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,000
I mean, i kind of felt
bad for shelly, though.

869
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,500
Forget her. she had it coming.

870
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,400
Hey, you guys, come here.

871
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,100
You've got to see M.I.T.'s dorms.

872
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
If i think i'm cool,

873
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Then people will think i'm cool, too.

874
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Yeah, that's what mr. Rosso said.

875
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,100
Yeah, and he's cool.

876
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah, but i already think i'm cool.

877
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,100
Maybe that'sso am i. but nobody
ebecause you're noti'm really cool.

878
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,300
You know what, sam?

879
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,300
You actually do seem cooler all of a sudden.

880
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,300
I think it's working.

881
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,300
Mr. Rosso's some kind of genius.

882
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Lindsay

883
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,100
Where are you going?

884
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,600
Millie, i gotta go home.

885
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,500
What's the matter?

886
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
Are you gonna go use your own bathroom?

887
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,400
No, it's...

888
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
I just can't do this.

890
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Yeah. I mean,

891
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,200
It's been great hanging out with you,

892
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,200
But it's just not where i'm at anymore.

893
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,400
Things are different now.

894
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Whatare you gonna do ?
I don't know,

895
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But i don't think i want to be a mathlete.

896
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's ok. I understand.

897
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,400
But can we still play uno sometimes?

898
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,900
I mean, when you've got nothing else to do?

899
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,400
Yeah, we can always do that.

900
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,400
Millie, we'll always be friends.

901
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,300
I'll see you around tomorrow, ok?

902
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Hey do you guys want to 
maybe go see a midnight movie?

904
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,800
I think there's a foreign film playing

905
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,300
At the state theater.

906
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,300
A foreign film? Is that
the kind you have to read?

907
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
What's the point?

908
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,800
The point is trying not to be a dumb ass

909
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,900
For once in your life, that's what.

910
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
That's the point, apparently.

911
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,900
I'll go.

912
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,400
Thank you, babe.

913
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,900
It just better not be
about a guy who talks a lot.

914
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,000
Hey.

915
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,500
What's up?

916
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,900
Nothing. What are you guys up to?

917
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,900
Nothing.

918
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Actually,

919
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,400
We were just about to go see a foreign film.

920
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Cool.

921
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,900
You know, just because.

922
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,400
Can i come with you guys?

923
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,300
Sure.

924
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,800
Can we borrow your dad's car?

925
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,300
Aww.

926
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
