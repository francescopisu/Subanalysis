Freaks and Geeks S01E03 Tricks and Treats (VO)

1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,379
All right, here's the bet.

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,755
For 10 bucks...

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,007
I'll drink this much of anything.

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,843
Anything?

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,803
Anything.

6
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,930
As long as it's
something you can eat.

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,350
Only stuff from the kitchen. Nothing
from the bathroom and the garage.

8
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,476
OK.

9
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,145
It has to be food.

10
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,355
Nothing from under the sink.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,067
No cleanser, no detergent,
no furniture polish...

12
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,611
And no cut up bits of sponge.

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,572
OK.

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,034
I'm just trying to win 10 bucks here,
I don't wanna die.

15
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,201
All right, now, put on...

16
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,663
the blindfold.

17
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,333
I don't want to mess up my hair.

18
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:47,422
Great. And now, step into
the soundproof booth.

19
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,011
I'm trusting you guys.

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,768
OK, put in some mustard,
it'll make him barf.

21
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,355
I don't want to make him barf,
my mom cooks dinner in here!

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,983
If we're not trying to make him barf,
then, why are we doing this?

23
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,611
I can hear everything
you guys are saying.

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,322
Come on, Bill. Quit listening.

25
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,698
Can't help it.

26
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,825
Then hum, so you can't hear us.

27
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,663
Cayenne pepper!

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,334
Good one!
Pass me the pickle juice.

29
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:30,132
You know, my cousin once drank
an entire jar of pickle juice,

30
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,926
he had to sit on the toilet
for ten hours.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,095
Oh, God, that's nasty.

32
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,221
This is going to be great.

33
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,765
Salt...

34
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,309
Sardines...

35
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,269
That's got to stink.

36
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,395
Oh, man!

37
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,272
Vinegar.

38
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,608
Vinegar!

39
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,276
Soy sauce.

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,861
Soy sauce!

41
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,739
Chili!

42
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,574
For texture.

43
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,201
It's disgusting!

44
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,327
Exactly!

45
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,038
And just a little bit of jelly.

46
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,165
Some dairy cream...

47
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,544
And... to top it all off,

48
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,088
a couple of after-dinner mints.

49
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,176
Mix it up.

50
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,603
Oh, God.

51
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,105
It's bubbling!

52
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,775
It's disgusting.

53
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,783
It's show time!

54
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,581
Let me see the money first.

55
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,378
Come on, drink up already.

56
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't rush me.

57
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,274
It's not bad.

58
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,198
I'm gonna be sick!

60
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,378
Hey, look!

61
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,965
Maple Farm Realty gave everyone
in the neighborhood free pumpkins.

62
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,508
Wasn't that nice?

63
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,637
There's nothing nice about it,
it's a cheap way to get customers.

64
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,890
They give you a 20 cents pumpkin, you
give them a ten grand to sell a house

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,851
- Some deal.
- Well, I just think it was nice.

66
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,980
Can I have the prize?

67
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,732
My bowl... my prize.

68
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,776
Come on.

69
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,827
Sam, what are you trying to do?
Kill me?

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,953
Sorry.

71
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,039
Sammy, what are you going out as,
for Halloween?

72
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,417
I'm not going out. Bill and I
are gonna see <i>The Nude Bomb</i>{\ at Parkway}.

73
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,420
Hey, that's a dirty movie.

74
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,713
Dad, it's a <i>Get Smart</i> movie.

75
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,008
You're not going trick-or-treating?

76
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,385
Mom! I'm in ninth grade.

77
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,179
I know, but you went out last year.

78
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,932
Yeah, well last year,
I was in junior high.

79
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,143
- Yeah, but Sam...
- Honey.

80
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,563
The boy's 14, he can miss a night
of walking around the neighborhood

81
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,148
begging like a tramp.

82
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,567
Halloween is for little kids anyway.

83
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,737
Lindsay, you're still going to
hand out candy with me, aren't you?

84
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,614
Remember how much fun
we had last year,

85
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,866
looking at all the little kids
in their costumes?

86
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,826
Yeah, Mom,
I told you I was going to.

87
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,411
Well... good!

88
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,749
'Cause we're going to have a really
good time this year, I promise.

89
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,298
Hey, Lindsay.
Long time no see.

90
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,799
I saw you guys here yesterday.

91
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,510
Why are you wearing a hat?

92
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,637
It's the day before Halloween.

93
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,765
It's your costume?

94
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,141
It kinda sucks.

95
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,393
No, it's Devil's day.

96
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,688
Each year, the seniors bring
a hair removal foam

97
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,607
and spread it on freshmen's heads.

98
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,318
- Then all your hair falls out.
- Really?

99
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,404
No! That stupid rumor
has been around for years.

100
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,157
Yeah, I know,
I was just goofing on them.

101
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,492
No, you weren't.

102
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,243
Yes, I was.

103
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,746
- Hey, Lindsay.
- Hey, Millie.

104
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,834
What are you doing tomorrow night?

105
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,587
My church is having a Halloween dance.
You want to come?

106
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,801
Well, I would go, but I got to
hand out candy with my mom.

107
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,929
OK.

108
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,392
You want some Lick-M-Aid?

109
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,268
No. You're going to eat candy now?

110
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
Millie, it's 7:30 am.

111
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:41,192
It's just Lick-M-Aid.
It makes my spit taste Like fruit juice.

112
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,073
Hey, check it out, it's Lindsay.

113
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:49,992
What's up?

114
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,327
Hey, Daniel.

115
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,746
Hey, Kim.

116
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,206
Hello, brain.

117
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,500
Oh, this is your bus stop?

118
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,294
Yeah.

119
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,007
We've had the same bus stop
since kindergarten.

120
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,134
How fast does your car go?

121
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,763
150, if I hook up the nitros tank.

122
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,475
You car is really loud.

123
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,519
My dad says you need a muffler.

124
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,563
Once, he even threw rock at you
as you drove by.

125
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,693
But... I guess you didn't hear it.

126
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,862
He threw a rock at me?

127
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,990
Kid, what the hell are you eating?

128
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,241
Laundry soap?

129
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,535
It's Lick-M-Aid. Want some?

130
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,661
Millie!

131
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,413
I'll pass.

132
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,540
Yeah, we gotta get going.

133
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,003
I'd give you a ride, Linds, but I got
the engine blocking the back seat.

134
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,714
Yeah...

135
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,054
Thanks for the candy, skinny.

136
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,023
See... My dad's right.

137
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,692
He needs a muffler.

138
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,119
You're going to
Sarah's party tomorrow?

139
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,289
Yeah, but I think
I'm going to Jenny's first.

140
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,798
If it isn't the Amelia Earhardt
of McKinley High.

141
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,967
What does that mean?

142
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,304
Well, you're headed to class,
but you never seem to get there.

143
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,391
Mr. Rosso, could you not humiliate me
in front of the whole school?

144
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,937
Come on, Lindsay,
don't turn me into The Man, here.

145
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,190
Just trying to help you.
And if when you graduate,

146
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,776
it turns out I did help you
but you hate me,

147
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,277
I'm OK with that.

148
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,862
I gotta get to class.

149
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,614
See, it's working already.

150
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,534
Embarrassing.

151
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,245
That's the only word I can think of

152
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,499
to describe these books
you've chosen to do your reports on.

153
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,129
<i>Al Jaffee's snappy answers
to stupid questions.</i>

154
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,468
A novelization of <i>Star Wars</i>.

155
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,012
<i>Yes, I can</i>,

156
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,808
<i>the autobiography of Sammy Davis Jr.</i>

157
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,856
<i>Crime and Punishment</i>
is a good example

158
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,526
of the kind of book
you should be reading now.

159
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,738
In it, Fyodor Dostoevsky

160
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,534
was attempting to create
what some would call

161
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,161
an existential enigma.

162
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,168
A protagonist who is both a nihilist

163
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,253
and a moralist.

164
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,008
Now, I know this sounds
confusing to you all, but soon,

165
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,302
you'll all know
what I'm talking about.

166
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,930
Because I expect you to have
the first chapter of this book

167
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,682
read by Monday.

168
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,977
It's time to grow up, people.

169
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,440
You like that? You're hot.

170
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,859
Knock it off, you're making me sick!

171
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,905
Why don't you make out with Nicky?
We'll call it a foursome.

172
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,868
Damn, why don't you make out
with my butt? We'll call it love.

173
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,245
You guys, be cool.

174
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,663
The nark's here.

175
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,541
Yeah, watch out or I'll bust you!

176
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,586
Hey, man, I ain't joking.

177
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,589
I heard about
what you did to Brian Stocker.

178
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,218
You saw him smoking MJ
and you told some cops.

179
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,055
Brian's in prison now.

180
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,016
And I heard his brother's
looking for you.

181
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,976
What? I didn't do that.

182
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:52,151
I know, I was just messing with you!

183
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,988
She got me with
that same joke last week.

184
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,115
It's kinda funny, though.

185
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,284
Hilarious.

186
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,787
What are you doing for Halloween?

187
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,164
I have to hand out
candy with my mom.

188
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,959
I know, it sounds really dorky.

189
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,420
She gets really into it.

190
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,840
Lindsay, I don't think
that sounds dorky at all.

191
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,510
You know what,
at least she's being nice.

192
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,805
Because you hate your mother,
doesn't mean everybody else does.

193
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,641
No, everybody hates her mother.

194
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,226
What are you guys doing?

195
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,770
Well, Kim, Nick and I are going out.

196
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,690
I'm borrowing
my uncle's big-ass Caddy,

197
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,442
and we thought maybe
you'd like to come with us.

198
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,280
You mean, like a double date?

199
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,034
If that's what you need to call it
in your diary, princess.

200
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,121
I can't.

201
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,664
Your loss.

202
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,209
Oh, the bell.

203
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,211
Let's not be late for class.

204
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,339
Hey, Lindsay.

205
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,178
You know, I think it's nice that
you're helping your mom hand out candy.

206
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,640
So, I'll see you later.

207
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,102
See you later.

208
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,443
It's going to take, like,
a trillion years to read.

209
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,403
I don't even know what it's about.

210
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,655
Whitman said
it's about an ax murderer.

211
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,115
This sounds kinda cool.

212
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,492
I guarantee it's not
going to be cool.

213
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,704
Look how small the printing is.

214
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,666
Perhaps you've never heard
of a little thing called CliffsNotes?

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,794
You still have to read them.

216
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,962
Whitman is such a jerk.

217
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,423
You know, she says
you have to be young adults.

218
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,426
We're not adults.
We're kids until we turn 18.

219
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,345
Well, maybe you are.

220
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,472
When I hit 13, I became a man.

221
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,892
It's only in your temple, Neal.
Not in the real world.

222
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,355
We should go trick-or-treating
tomorrow night.

223
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,982
In case you haven't noticed,
we're a little old.

224
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,818
We're not.
We went trick-or-treating last year.

225
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,613
Come on.
Let's go out tomorrow night.

226
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,200
No way. I'm going to
the Jaycees Haunted House.

227
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,661
The "hot-dog on a stick" girls
from the mall are working it.

228
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,705
- The tall ones?
- Yeah. Judy.

229
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,416
- They're hot.
- Judy, Judy, Judy!

230
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,211
Then, why don't we go
trick-or-treating before that?

231
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,213
Why don't we just go buy candy?

232
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,964
Oh yeah, it's really fun.

233
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,717
Come on, it'll be a blast.

234
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,763
It's better than sitting home
reading some stupid Russian book.

235
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,058
You know, I...

236
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,978
Yeah, I guess... i guess so.

237
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,771
I don't know.

238
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,607
You're never gonna dress up
as Groucho again?

239
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,488
You know, that's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard!

240
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,406
Groucho sucks.

241
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,834
Tommy.

242
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,336
Millie.

243
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:05,844
Lindsay!

244
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
What's up?

245
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,065
Millie, who is that?

246
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,695
Who?

247
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,076
You weren't supposed to see.

248
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,328
That's Tommy, my secret love.

249
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,914
We met this summer at church camp.

250
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:35,917
You have a boyfriend?

251
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,753
Lindsay, you got to keep this
a secret. I mean...

252
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,423
Tommy and I don't even
French kiss yet.

253
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,051
Tommy says that if you do before
you've been going for six months,

254
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,720
you go to Hell.

255
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,180
Why didn't you tell me?

256
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,099
I didn't want to make you feel bad,

257
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,810
since you don't have
a boyfriend and all.

258
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,984
Come on, no way.

259
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,030
No, it's true. When I heard them play
at Cobalt Hall, the guy was amazing.

260
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,240
- Hold on a second.
- What?

261
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,284
They're called Santana, right?

262
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,870
But that guy who's singing,
he's not Santana.

263
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,706
No. Santana's the guitar player.

264
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,752
Then how did he get them
to name the band after him?

265
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,295
I don't know, man.

266
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,631
Maybe he's just a bad-ass.

267
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,468
If that's true, yes, he's amazing.

268
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,679
Maybe we should name
my band Desario.

269
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,225
I'm going out with you guys
tomorrow night.

270
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,310
Hey, that's great!

271
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,729
Yeah, but what about your mom?

272
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,856
How is she going
to hand out candy all by herself?

273
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,985
She'll survive.

274
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,737
Well, well, well.

275
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,867
<i>He did the mash</i>

276
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,662
<i>He did the monster mash </i>

277
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,205
<i>It was a smash</i>

278
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,792
<i>It was a graveyard smash</i>

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,589
Mom, Neal, Bill and I decided
to go trick-or-treating tomorrow night.

280
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,509
That's great,
we have to get you a costume.

281
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,511
I'm gonna make my own.
I'm going out as Gort.

282
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,971
He's the robot from
<i>The Day the Earth stood still</i>.

283
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,724
Gort! How exciting!

284
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,561
Sam, what are you doing? You're too old
to go out trick-or-treating.

285
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,230
Harold, stop...

286
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,107
What? It's true.

287
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,986
There was this kid in my neighborhood
when I was growing up, Scott Biron.

288
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,782
He kept on trick-or-treating
until he was well into his 20s.

289
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,993
You know where he's living now?

290
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,621
At home.
With his 90-year-old mother.

291
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,457
He's the laughing stock
of the community.

292
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,084
He never took a wife, either.

293
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,003
I don't think there's anything wrong

294
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,463
with acting like a kid
every once in a while.

295
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,509
{\I know }Lindsay and I are gonna have a great
time tomorrow{\ night}, aren't we, sweetie?

296
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,678
Yeah, Mom, we sure are.

297
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,139
<i>He did the mash</i>

298
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,057
<i>The monster mash</i>

299
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,517
<i>It was a smash</i>

300
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,186
<i>It was a graveyard smash</i>

301
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,027
- Bill and I will come by your place.
- Bring pillow cases. No grocery bags.

302
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,778
If your bag rips,
you're on your own.

303
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,447
I'm gonna bring my plastic pumpkin.

304
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,116
Don't bring that,
it gets full after one street.

305
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,951
Not if I eat the candy as we go.

306
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,288
Last time you did that, you puked
before we got past our bus stop.

307
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,082
Hey guys, I heard you're going out
for trick-or-treats tonight.

308
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,294
- How did you find out about that?
- The word gets out, people talk.

309
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,922
But you gotta be careful, the candy
is gonna be dangerous this year.

310
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,050
They say that every year.

311
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,303
But this year, there are evil hippies
who don't want Reagan to be president,

312
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,013
so to disrupt the election,

313
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,682
they're gonna inject the candy
with heroin, turn kids into addicts.

314
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,019
It's not true, you just have to
watch out for pins and razors.

315
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,979
And rat hair is a big one.

316
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,565
You're gonna find yourself
wishing for rat hair.

317
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,444
Word on the street is they're putting
a pooh inside Fun Size candy bars.

318
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,113
I love Fun Size candy bars.

319
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,575
That's stupid. Like nobody
will be able to tell what it really was.

320
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:00,871
They dip it in chocolate first,
so you can't tell the difference{\ until it's too late}.

321
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,123
See ya!

322
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,713
Actually, it sounds kinda fun.
Do you mind if I come with you guys?

323
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,717
Mom?

324
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,178
In the kitchen!

325
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,231
Where have you been? You're gonna
miss the first trick-or-treaters.

326
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,817
You know the cutest ones
always come early.

327
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,069
I was hanging out with my friends.

328
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,195
Lindsay!

329
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,742
Look what we're gonna hand out
this year. Halloween cookies!

330
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,454
- Great, Mom.
- What's up with all the cookies?

331
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,999
I laid your robot costume out
on your bed.

332
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,418
- You didn't rip it, did you?
- No, but I wrote

333
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,088
"My boy is the cutest boy in
the whole world" on the front of it.

334
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,008
Lindsay, I got you a costume.
Go put it on, sweetie.

335
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,677
I'm gonna put
these cookies by the door.

336
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,722
We are going to have so much fun!

337
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,605
I kind of hate when Mom
gets goofy like that.

338
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,050
Looking for Chaplin,
only seeing Hitler.

339
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,307
If I were the Bionic Woman...
what would I wear?

340
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,915
This is ridiculous.

341
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,708
I look like Tom Selleck.

342
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,752
Mom!

343
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,181
I'm sorry, Steve Austin,
I can't marry you.

344
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,183
I'm mad at you, right now.

345
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,808
What?

346
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,812
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

347
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,106
Hold on, I'm going to put
the phone on my bionic ear.

348
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,819
That's better.

349
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,781
Don't talk so loud!

350
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,951
Don't forget
I've got bionic hearing.

351
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,162
No. These are not bionic!

352
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,498
These are all me.

353
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,254
No, I heard that, pal.

354
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,757
Oh, it wasn't you!
Oh, OK, I guess I'll just...

355
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,470
Oscar Goldman,
it's me, Jaime Sommers.

356
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,848
Steve Austin is trapped
in the reactor.

357
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,270
Hi, Mom. OK, you can use the phone.

358
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,440
Hey, Lindsay!

359
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,902
Hurry up, honey.
Our first little visitors are here.

360
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,904
Linds!

361
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,036
What an... interesting costume...

362
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,874
All right. Happy Halloween!

363
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,213
Do you want another cookie?

364
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,427
I'm here to go for
trick-or-treats tonight with Sam.

365
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,722
You're one of Sam's friends!
I'm so sorry.

366
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,889
Come on in.

367
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,851
My gosh... sorry.

368
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,815
Nice costume. You look like
Richard Benjamin in <i>Westworld</i>.

369
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,820
Hey, don't you look nice!

370
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,783
What the hell are
you supposed to be?

371
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,952
I'm a guy with a knife
through his head.

372
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,079
Well, mission accomplished.

373
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,583
Mom, I got to talk to you.

374
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,169
Put your costume on,
the trick-or-treaters are here.

375
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,839
<i>Trick or treat, smell our feet</i>

376
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,216
<i>Give us something good to eat</i>

377
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,555
You guys are both great. Come on in!

378
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,521
Harris, that looks really real.

379
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,689
How do you know it isn't?

380
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,902
If you get any closer,
I'll be bagging ya.

381
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,487
Hey, cut that out.

382
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,989
Oh, Bill, you look really lovely.

383
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,284
I'm Jaime Sommers, the Bionic Woman.

384
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,577
Oh, of course you are.

385
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,788
Who's that?

386
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,085
Mom, I'm gonna go hang out with
my friends a little bit, I'll be back.

387
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,629
- Wait.
- I'll be back!

388
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:01,004
Sweetie, wait!

389
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,423
Come on, Lindsay, let's go.

390
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,678
Do you have any
fake blood around here?

391
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,347
I want to freshen up my wound
before we go out.

392
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,890
What?

393
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,446
She did what?

394
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,200
She said it was only gonna be
for a little while, she'll be back.

395
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,911
I know she was really
looking forward to this.

396
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,122
She'd better back,
that's all I can say.

397
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,416
That daughter of yours
is on thin ice.

398
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,128
Until she gets back, would you put
this on and help me pass out cookies?

399
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,800
For crying out loud...

400
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,268
Boo!

401
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,065
His plans fell through, you know...

402
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,775
I'm sorry.

403
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,408
Knock it off or you're
gonna blow the speakers.

404
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,246
I'm sorry, Grandpa, I'll try not to blow
anything of yours from now on.

405
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,167
What are we gonna do?

406
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,170
There's this haunted house
that's supposed to be scary.

407
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,047
That could be kind of fun.

408
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:26,382
For who? Losers?

409
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,927
Hey, shut up. I like haunted houses.

410
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,887
I rest my case.

411
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,434
Listen. We're just gonna drive around
and see where the night takes us.

412
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,561
Is that cool with you?

413
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,687
Lindsay?

414
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,567
I'm up for anything.

415
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,943
Right on, kid.

416
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,198
I'm really glad
that you decided to come.

417
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,866
Thanks.

418
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,826
So am I.

419
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,249
You two are adorable!

420
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,002
Mom, look!

421
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,213
Jessica, come on, don't stare.
It's not polite.

422
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,053
Why is everybody staring at me?

423
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,515
You'd think they never saw
the Bionic Woman before.

424
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,310
They just probably didn't know
she was so hot in real life!

425
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,438
Are you joking?
You're joking, right?

426
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,024
I saw the real Jaime Sommers
at the auto show last year.

427
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,651
Her boobs weren't that big.

428
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,363
We should go to the rich neighborhood
first, they hand out the best candy.

429
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,699
It's not true. Rich people
traditionally give the cheapest candy.

430
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,368
How they stay rich.

431
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,080
I just hope I get
some candy I can eat.

432
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:42,040
I'm allergic to
peanut, liquorish, and nougat.

433
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,168
How can you possibly
be allergic to nougat?

434
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,379
I don't know.

435
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,506
My doctors say I'm allergic
to more things than anyone

436
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,633
they've ever seen.

437
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,219
Then I get the dibs
on all your malt balls.

438
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,845
You can have them.

439
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,472
I like the Pixy Stix.

440
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,391
- Pixy Stix rule.
- No way!

441
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,767
Chunkies are the best.

442
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,894
Candy corn, my friend.

443
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,522
I must admit,
I'm a Wax lips man myself.

444
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,859
Trick or treat!

445
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,320
You're the cutest things.
Harold, come look!

446
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,867
Kids, I was just kidding!

447
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,037
I'm not really a vampire,
I own a sporting goods store.

448
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,624
Hey, what's the big idea,
scaring my kids?

449
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,292
I didn't mean to...

450
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,794
I'm sorry, I made him put this on.

451
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,672
Here, give this to your children,
they're home-made.

452
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,798
Are you crazy?

453
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,052
I've been lecturing my kids for weeks
not to take unwrapped candy.

454
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,346
Those cookies could have
razor blades or pins in it.

455
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,849
I wouldn't do that.

456
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,030
Come on, cow-girl,
enough of this kids stuff.

457
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,868
Let's head out to the bar and I'll give
you a real good roll in a hay.

458
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,369
Harold, not now.

459
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,333
When?

460
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,002
I mean, think about it.

461
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,255
All the people in this town
are real religious.

462
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,592
And just cause it's Halloween,
they'll hang pictures of devils,

463
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,347
witches, ghosts, all over
their houses. It's a joke.

464
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,224
Yeah, I know, it's total
white middle-class hypocrisy.

465
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,895
Right, exactly.

466
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,480
You wanna know
what I think about it?

467
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,943
Lovely, you know.

468
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:34,570
Your years in charm school
have really paid off.

469
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,322
By the way,
how are things going at ass school?

470
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,866
Getting all As!

471
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,996
We could go to the movies,
there's a new <i>Friday the 13th</i> playing.

472
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:48,083
Brain, why are you so hung up
about doing something?

473
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,919
Are we boring to you?

474
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,422
What? We should do something.
We can't just drive around all night.

475
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,884
Man, we can just drive around.
It is Halloween.

476
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,443
Trick or treat!

477
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,784
What do you want?

478
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,743
Trick or treat!

479
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,704
Aren't you guys
a little old for this?

480
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,250
We're only freshmen in high school.

481
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,503
High school. That's too old.

482
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,338
We're young at heart.

483
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,051
Circus peanuts.

484
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,262
What are you supposed to be anyway?
Tin Man?

485
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,516
I'm Gort. He's the robot from
<i>The Day the Earth stood still</i>?

486
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,018
You look like the freaking Tin Man.

487
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,606
Ma'am...

488
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,065
I hope there aren't any peanuts
in these peanuts,

489
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,527
cause if there are, I could die.

490
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,153
Good night.

491
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,324
These are so cute.

492
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,997
But you know, Jean, they train the kids
not to take unwrapped food stuffs.

493
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,125
You should see, all the parents
are dumping the cookies on your lawn.

494
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,878
They're all covered with ants!

495
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,128
What?

496
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,506
Well... happy Halloween!

497
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,346
I give up.

498
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,143
Harold, run up the Farmer Jack
and buy some candy.

499
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,355
What? Dressed like this?

500
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,525
All right.

501
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,236
Don't answer the door
until I get back.

502
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,990
Stupid kids holiday...

503
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,121
I say... we make Lindsay do it.

504
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,041
No, I'm going in.

505
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,044
No, man, let me do it, alright?

506
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,770
Hey, relax, it's Halloween,
we're supposed to do this stuff.

507
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,125
Oh, man...

508
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,044
that is so uncool.

509
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,889
I can't believe we just did that!

510
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,978
Yes, congratulations to us all,
Lindsay.

511
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,316
I'm so happy I'm not at
the Ted Nugent concert.

512
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,155
Come on, go.

513
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,823
Go ahead, Linds.

514
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,907
You can do it.

515
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,412
Go!

516
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,131
Oh, my...

517
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,433
Oh my God.

518
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,936
Come on, come on!
Come on, Lindsay!

519
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,200
Happy Halloween!

520
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,536
This one's for you.

521
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,288
Oh, look, it's Fun Sized.

522
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,501
You guys having a good time?

523
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,589
Happy Halloween.

524
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,549
Thank you.

525
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,011
Well... I'll eat it later.

526
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,413
Batter up, baby!

527
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,040
Here, baby!

528
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,890
- Come on, Lindsay.
- Go for it, Weir.

529
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,599
Do it already.

530
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,581
Great. Thanks a lot!

531
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,917
I can't believe this.

532
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,879
I can't believe the Hot Dog
on a Stick girls saw us!

533
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,132
That's months of ground work
down to drain.

534
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,800
Like they'd ever go out with you.

535
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,721
Shut up, they like me. They always
do me free lemonade refills.

536
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,724
Well, well, well.

537
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,808
If it isn't the geek patrol.

538
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:40,935
Oh, no, no.

539
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,398
Oh, my God!

540
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,650
Hey Alan, what's up?

541
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,403
I don't know whose ass
I wanna kick first!

542
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,364
You better watch out, Alan.
We kicked your ass once.

543
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,824
We can do it again.

544
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,452
I don't think so.
That was three against one.

545
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,621
Now we got us a fair fight.

546
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,581
It's time to settle the score.

547
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,254
No, I got it. Let's go salt
the school windows.

548
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:12,884
Look, I say it's time we get down
to some serious damage.

549
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:14,303
Kenneth.

550
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,055
Breakfast, anyone?

551
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,809
Oh, my goodness.

552
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,018
We don't want to fight you, Alan.

553
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,312
You don't have to.

554
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,815
Just give us your candy
and you're free to go.

555
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,523
OK, here.

556
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,196
- Now you, dork.
- Forget it!

557
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,367
- We went through a lot for this!
- Shut your mouth, you little girl.

558
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,868
I'm not a little girl,
I'm a Bionic Woman!

559
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,121
Yeah? Prove it.

560
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,544
No, cut it out!

561
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:49,547
Just stop, take the candy,
this is my grandpa's coat!

562
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,342
I fell on my knife.

563
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,551
Let's get out of here!

564
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,561
That's it.
That is it!

565
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,770
This is all your fault!

566
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:09,524
I never should've let you
talk me into this.

567
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,651
I didn't talk you into anything.

568
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,445
It sure as hell wasn't my idea.

569
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,034
Oh, yeah. You're too cool,
getting free lemonade refills.

570
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,160
Guys.

571
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,371
Let's just stick to the plan.

572
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,873
Is this thing on straight?

573
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,503
- Wanna do it?
- Dig in, children!

574
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,629
Awesome.

575
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,591
- Thank you.
- Enjoy it.

576
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,343
Alright, jackpot!

577
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,426
- Where?
- Ready? Over there!

578
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,848
You're such a little baby,
with your baby's evenings.

579
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,433
Going to some stupid haunted
house is that much better?

580
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,393
- You're stupid!
- It takes one to know one.

581
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,022
- Well, you are one!
- Enough, guys, come on.

582
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,398
My bra is chafing. Let's get home.

583
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:53,986
I want to see!
Ken, you're blocking my view!

584
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,203
- That was so awesome!
- We nailed it.

585
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,330
- What?
- Oh my God.

586
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,667
We just egged my little brother.

587
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,299
Oh, my God.

588
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,553
Wait, stop the car.

589
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,554
Just eggs, he'll be fine.

590
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,598
No! Stop the car, please, Daniel!

591
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,393
You just take it easy.

592
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,518
Let me out of the car!

593
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,062
Daniel, just stop the car.
Let her out.

594
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,773
Don't get out, we'll get him.

595
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,278
Sam!

596
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,904
Gentlemen...

597
00:36:38,574 --> 00:36:40,198
I'm going home.

598
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,081
They're coming back
to finish the job!

599
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,416
Let's go cut through the backyard!

600
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,087
Sam!

601
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,007
Sam, I'm sorry.

602
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,802
Get in the car.

603
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,599
Sam, I'm really sorry.
Please, come on.

604
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,308
Let us give you a ride home, OK?

605
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:14,065
Kid, it's not your sister's fault.
She didn't even know it was you.

606
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,568
She's really really upset, kid.
I swear to God.

607
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,071
It's true, Sam, I swear to God.

608
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,581
Is it just me or did he seem upset?

609
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,875
Would you shut up, please?

610
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,045
Just give her a break, alright?

611
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:38,381
Man, I'm in so much trouble.

612
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,259
- Just take me home.
- Why don't you just...

613
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,803
Take her home already. God!

614
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,806
I told you she's be a drag.

615
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,017
Trick or treat!

616
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,985
My God, Sam! What happened?

617
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,115
- I got egged.
- What's going on?

618
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,365
Are you alright?
Did you get egg in your eye?

619
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,244
- I'm fine!
- My God...

620
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,414
Well, well, look who's here.

621
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:54,208
We're so happy you could
grace us with your presence.

622
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,252
What kind of terrible people
would do this to a little boy?

623
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,423
Who the hell did this to you, Sam?

624
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,884
Some freaks.

625
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,012
Freaks? Like circus freaks?

626
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,266
Jean, I don't think there's bearded
ladies running around throwing eggs.

627
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,354
He means hippies.
You know who these freaks were?

628
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,647
Just a bunch of dirt-bags.

629
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,691
Honey, my little baby.

630
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,902
I'm not a baby!

631
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:31,120
I'm certainly glad we all decided
to celebrate Halloween.

632
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,204
Last time I had this much fun,

633
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,750
I was pinned down in a foxhole
by the North Koreans.

634
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,006
I'm sorry, honey.
You did a nice job.

635
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,721
And you, you're on thin ice, Missy.

636
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,268
I didn't expect you back so soon.

637
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,438
Mom, I told you I'd be
back in a little bit.

638
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,732
Who were those people
you went off with?

639
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,610
- Some friends from school.
- Anyone I know?

640
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,112
Not really.

641
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,992
Lindsay, if you didn't want
to hand out candy with me,

642
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,744
- you could have just told me.
- I couldn't.

643
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,122
I didn't want to make you feel bad.

644
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,668
Oh, well, I don't know.

645
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,967
The world is such a different place
than the one I grew up in.

646
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,014
Everyone just seems so much...

647
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,099
meaner, these days.

648
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,521
Mom, kids didn't throw eggs
when you were in school?

649
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,272
I don't know, I guess so.

650
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,735
I just know I never did.

651
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,343
Nothing like getting yelled at by Dad
when he's dressed like a vampire, huh?

652
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,349
Thanks for not turning me in.

653
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,231
I'm really sorry,
you know that, don't you?

654
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,865
Nobody thinks you're cool, you know?

655
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,993
Trust me, I know.

656
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,689
Trick or treat!

657
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:13,989
Mom?

658
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,455
That's the wrong costume.

659
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,874
You were supposed to be
my little princess.

660
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:29,922
Well... I guess I'll have to be
your little prince instead.

661
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,348
I'll get it.

662
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,311
Trick or treat!

663
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:46,063
You're the cutest things!
Lindsay, aren't they cute?

664
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,774
Yeah, they are.

665
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,615
Happy Halloween!

666
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,709
Sam?

667
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,586
Can I come in?

668
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,549
You OK?

669
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,679
Yeah, I'm just reading
a book for school.

670
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,307
Any good?

671
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,976
I don't know yet. Everyone's name
is really weird and long.

672
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,354
Well, don't stay up too late.

673
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,523
I won't, Dad.
