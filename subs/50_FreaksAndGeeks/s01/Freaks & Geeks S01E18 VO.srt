00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,500
'Cause that way, when i have kids,

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
They'll think i was a big stud.

30
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
I bet we'll find out some
girls have crushes on us.

True love always..."

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,000

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,000
"Neal, you're a wild and crazy guy."

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Never a wild and sexy guy.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500

I hate when they do this!

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,900
I mean, why do jocks think it's so funny?

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,400
They think clean-outs are funny.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,900

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,500
Where do they find time to play sports?

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm sick of being called a geek.

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,700
I mean, what's so geeky about us, anyways?

48
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,200

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Why would we do that?

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,700
Well, because nick is

All right, uh... we better get going,

60
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
'Cause they're gonna be

Oh, yeah, finals.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,700

Uh, yeah, but, um, don't tell anybody.

68
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Oh, no!

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,400

What in the name of god is going on?

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Oh, that is so sad.

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,100
I don't know.

75
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,700
Sara's cool.

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,700
I'll bet he's probably
hoping that you get jealous.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Oh, hey, you guys.

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,400
Sorry about the smoke.

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
These things are gonna kill me.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,900
I know i might look cool
with a cigarette in my hand,

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,400
But, remember, it's just a crutch.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
Don't forget that, got it?

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,300

Ight there, where they cleaned you out-

98

That's the pinnacle of their lives.

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
Hey, i want to play college ball.

100
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,800

to get a sports scholarship?

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,300
Ow, i just blew my knee out during practice.

102
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,200
Oops, i'm out of school

You get cleaned out,

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Girls don't even look at you.

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,700
I thought this was supposed
to make us feel better.

110
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,700
Hold on, cool breeze, it gets better.

111
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,700

Like a long time from now.

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
We have to put up with
this for another 3 years.

120
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,100
That's why you have to learn to enjoy...

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,000
The simple pleasures of life.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,500

You know the rules.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
If you pass, you fly.

134
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,600
If you fail, you get to look at
my pretty face again next year.

135
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
Hey.

136
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Where's dave fleury?

137
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
He's never late.

138
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,400
Didn't you hear?

139
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Broke his arm in gym this morning.

140
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
He fell off the ropes and missed the mat.

141
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,500
It was hilarious.

142
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,500
Hey!

You don't think you're
the fonz or something?

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
If a jukebox was broken,

149
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,200
Think you could hit it
and it'd start playing?

150
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,700
I feel like we've been here before, daniel.

151
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,600
I'm a nice guy.

152
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,100
But you know when i stop being nice?

Um...

181
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,600
I'm one lucky girl?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,300
See, here's thweird thing.

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
Ok? Usually students are happy

184
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,400
About being selected to
attend the academic summit.

185
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
How can i be in the top 1%?

186
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't study that much.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,900
I mean, are the

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,100
Kids in michigan schools that stupid?

189
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,700
No. You're justhat smart.

190
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Maybe you'reired and broken.

191
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,300
Your tongue is twisted
with words half-spoken

192
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,300
And thoughts unclear.

193
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,900
What do you want me to do?

194
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,700
Hrough.

195
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,400
Why are you talking like that?

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,500
D.

197
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,100
I know it always makes me feel better.

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Not the who. Ha ha.

199
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,200
The grateful dead.

200
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,500
When I¨was in college,
back in the 1700s,

201
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,300
I put their album american beautyon
whenever i was stressing out.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You know what?

203
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Put it on while you're studying for finals,

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,700
And soon you'll be rarin' to
go to that academic summit.

205
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
I got kinda woozy

206
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,400
When i had to show that
girls' time of the month film.

207
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,900
They didn't even let me into
the class to show that one.

208
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,400
They said the girls
would be too embarrassed.

209
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I heard that's because you
could see a girl's boobs in it.

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
All right, fellas,

211
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Looks like our happy little a.v. family

212
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,100
Is about to get a new addition.

213
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,600
Daniel desario is going
to be joining us here

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,700
For the rest of the year.

215
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,200
Why?

216
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Well, i guess he was
having a little trouble,

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
And mr. Rosso thought that a stay in a.v.

218
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,200
Might be a good attitude adjustment for him.

219
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,700
Wait a minute.

220
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,200
He's putting him in a.v. as punishment?

221
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Speak of the devil. here he is.

222
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Welcome to the audio-visual
department, mr. Desario.

223
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Thank you.

224
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,700
Hey, daniel, how's it going?

225
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,100
Fine.

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,500
Hey, daniel, do you know
how to fix a projector?

227
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,600
No.

228
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,500
We can teach ya.

229
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Great.

230
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,700
This is terrible.

231
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
Daniel's gonna ruin the
only place we like in school.

232
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
Yeah, why did mr. Rosso do this to us?

233
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,200
I bet that daniel guy is high on drugs,

234
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,800
And if we make him angry, he'll
freak out and wreck the a.v. room.

235
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Oh, no! no, he won't.

236
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,800
He's not a bad guy.

237
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I mean, he's friends with my sister.

238
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I've talked to him.

239
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
Sam, he gave you a porno.

240
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,200
I wouldn't exactly say you have a
meaningful relationship with him.

241
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Um, none of us really
know him that well, neal.

242
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,800
All i know is, what we've gotta do

243
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,300
Is get him tohow movies every day.

244
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,700
It's the only way we'll be
able to get rid of him. Agreed?

245
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,700
Agreed.

246
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,800
Lindsay, i understand
congratulations are in order.

247
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,400
Welcome to the 1% club.

248
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I was one back in 1956.

249
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Look what it did for me!

250
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Thank you.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,400
Ooh!

252
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,900
Oh, my god! i am so sorry!

253
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,900
That was my fault. That
was me. I'm the clumsy clod.

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Hey,american beauty. that
is a great album, man.

255
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Oh. Yeah, that's what i've heard.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Are you a deadhead?

257
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,900
Um...no. I-someone just
gave it to me to listen to.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Oh, well, if you never heard it
before, you're in for a treat,

259
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,900
'Cause it's like the best album of all time.

260
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Really?

262
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,300
Is it that great?

263
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,200
I wish i'd never heard it,

264
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,200
Just so i could hear it
again for the first time.

265
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,100
This is such a cool vest, kenny.

266
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Why don' kenny?

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
T you come over to nick's after school?

268
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,100
We're gonna go over some new dance moves.

269
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,600
I don't think so.

270
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,100
Uh, ken doesn't really like to dance.

271
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,900
Oh, well, kenny,

272
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,500
That's just because you don't know how.

273
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Now, i taught nick how to do
the hustle in less than an hour.

274
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
And you know what? You'll probably
learn even faster than that,

275
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,000
Because you'll have both of us
teaching you at the same time.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Um...no?

277
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Ok. Your loss.

278
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,900
Um, do you guys want anything?

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
I'm gonna go get some more milk.

280
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,400
No, i'm ok.

281
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I'll be right back, baby.

282
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I'll be here.

283
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
All right.

284
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,400
I give up, nick.

285
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,900
When does alan funt come boogieing out?

286
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,200
You know, that's not cool, man.

287
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,800
Come on. That's my girlfriend, man.

288
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,200
Do i need to remind you
that you used to hate disco?

289
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Look, what's the difference
between zeppelin and disco, really?

290
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,200
No, listen, they both have heavy drums

291
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,700
And they have bass.

292
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Have you heard that foxy song, hot number?

293
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
It rocks, man.

294
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
No! I don't know that song, thank god.

295
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,300
But i can guarantee it sucks.

296
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,200
All right, you know what sucks, man?

297
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
You suck.

298
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
No, i've been trying really hard

299
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200
To get a decent girlfriend for a long time.

300
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,100
And now i've got one, and
you're being a real jerk.

301
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,500
Nick, you are only going out with sara

302
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,100
To make lindsay jealous,

303
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,600
And it isn't working.

304
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,500
Admit it.

305
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,500
You know what? screw you, man.

306
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Thanks for the support.

307
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,400
What's that all about?

308
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,900
Lindsay, can you please

309
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Start going out with nick again?

310
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,900
I can't take much more of this.

311
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,500
Look out of any window

312
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,600
Any morning, any evening

313
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Any day

314
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,900
Maybe the sun is shining

315
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Or rain is falling from a heavy sky

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,400
What do you want me to do?

317
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,400
To do for you to see you through?

318
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,400
For this is all a dream we dreamed

319
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,400
One afternoon long ago

320
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Our daughter in the top 1%.

321
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Like my grandpa used to say,

322
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
If i was wearing my vest,
all the buttons would pop.

323
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,500
Here i didn't think you
were applying yourself,

324
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,900
And now look.

325
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,900
You must be absolutely thrilled.

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,500
Yeah, i don't know.

327
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
I mean, i'm not even sure if i want to go.

328
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,500
What's the point?

329
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,000
Wacky?

330
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,500
Can it!

331
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
You're going to that summit, lindsay.

332
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,300
This isn't even open for debate.

333
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Dad, i didn't say i wasn't gonna go.

334
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,700
Ju sounds kinda...dumb.

335
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Dumb?

336
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Spend 2 weeks with the
intellectual elite of your peers?

337
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh, yeah, that sounds pretty dumb.

338
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,800
Honey, think of all the people you'll meet.

339
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,700
Yeah, mom, i know.

340
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,200
It's just-

341
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Haro

342
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,200
It's just nothing !

343
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,700
This is your key

344
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,700
To the best schools in the world...

345
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Harvar yale, princeton.

346
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,200
Don't blow this, lindsay.

347
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,200
Dad, i didn't say i wasn't gonna go.

348
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,500
Can' god.

349
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,500
T we have a normal
discussion about something?

350
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,500
When it comes to something like this...no.

351
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,700
Well, everyone,

352
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,600
Last week of school can only mean one thing,

353
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,100
And that's that today is movie day.

354
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,100
But just so that we don't
completely waste time,

355
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,400
We'll be watching

356
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,300
The 1968 franco zeffirelli
version ofromeo and juliet.

357
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,300
If one of our astute
members of the a.v. squad

358
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,800
Would get his butt in here,

359
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,300
We'd be able to get this show on the road.

360
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Hi, i'm here to show your movie.

361
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
I'm glad you could make it.

362
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,700
I was starting to think i'd
have to act out the film myself.

363
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh.

364
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Where was i?

365
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes. This version of...

366
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,200
Geek!

367
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,100
Ah! Uh...

368
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,600
This version ofromeo and juliet

369
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,100
Is unique in that it is
the first time that a film

370
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,100
Had chosen to let teenage actors play-

371
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Do you need a hand, sir?

372
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,700
No, i think i got it.

373
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,200
In the version before mr.
Zeffirelli's masterpiece,

375
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,600
The role were played by actor in their 30s,

376
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Which caused it to have an artificial feel.

377
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,700
Will somebody please help mr.
demille set up the projector?

378
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,800
All right, i got it.

379
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Any chance of being
ready in the near future?

380
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,800
Yeah, just one second, all right?

381
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
Ok.

382
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
Ready.

383
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Ready. Saints be praised.

384
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,900
Instead of hitting it, could you please

385
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Just make the film loop a little bigger?

386
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,400
What?

387
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,400
Make the film loop bigger.

388
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Thanks.

389
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,800
So you guys just drive around

390
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
And follow the dead everywhere?

391
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,600
Yeah, it's great.

392
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,100
You meet a lot of really cool people.

393
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,300
Well, are the concerts that different?

394
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,800
Yeah, it's like nothing
you've ever experienced.

395
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,300
This one time, we were in new jersey,

396
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,800
And it started raining

397
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,800
Right in the middle of the show.

398
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,400
Suddenly everybody goes
running down to the pit,

399
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,400
And they start dancing in the mud.

400
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
And then the sun comes out,

401
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,600
And there's this rainbow

402
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,100
Right over the stage.

403
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,100
I started crying.

404
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
It was beautiful.

405
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,700
Really what it's all about

406
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,200
Is being together and
having a good time, as one.

407
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,100
Judging has nothing to do with it.

408
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
That's not what the dead are about.

409
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,200
It's all about being
connected and being free.

410
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Nothing-nothing is better, i'm telling you.

411
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,100
Yeah, it sounds wild.

412
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,100
We're going down to texas when school's out.

413
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,800
We're gonna follow the tour up to colorado.

414
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
9 shows in a week and a half.

415
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I can't wait.

416
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,800
Wow.

417
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
So, what are you gonna do this summer?

418
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,900
Oh, i got into this academic summit thing

420
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
It's kinda goofy.

421
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Hey, man, you gotta do what you gotta do.

423
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,100
Man, i can't believe i have
to go to a.v. again today.

424
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,600
It's so stupid.

425
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,600
Well, you know, daniel,

426
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,600
Nobody asked you to pull the fire alarm.

427
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,100
Oh, what was i supposed
to do, flunk the test?

428
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,600
I suck at math.

429
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,400
I suck at everything.

430
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
Well...

431
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,900
What do you want me to say, daniel?

432
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,300
I don't know, kim.

433
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,600
You know, i am always listening
to your stupid problems.

434
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,400
You know what, daniel?

435
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Why don't you go tell it to the fire alarm?

436
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,800
Thanks!

437
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,400
Guys, i want my new dungeons
and dragons character

438
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,300
To be called gorthon.

439
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,800
Why gorthon?

440
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,400
'Cause it sounds cool.

441
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
I'm gorthon the thief.

442
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Surrender your jewels, princess!

443
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,800
Oh, bill, don't be a thief again!

444
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
You always fall down a
well trying to steal stuff.

445
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,300
Uh, sorry, kragenmore the destroyer.

446
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,700
So, sam, will logan the
huge be making an appearance?

447
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,800
I told you, i don't want to play.

448
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,800
What, you're too cool for us
now that you broke up with cindy?

449
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,700
No.

450
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I don't know.

451
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
It's just
- it's a geeky game.

452
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,300
I mean, what's the point?

453
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,700
The

454
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Point is, you used to like it.

455
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,800
I left my science book in the a.v. room.

456
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,800
See you guys later.

457
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,000
See you later.

458
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,500
Hey!

459
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,500
Hey.

460
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
What's eating you?

461
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
Huh? Nothing.

462
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,600
I just wish i didn't get
into that academic summit.

463
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,100
Just feels like i'm going
back into school again.

464
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,000
Life's tough.

465
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's that supposed to mean?

466
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
It means you've been moping around

467
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Ever since you found out you
got into that stupid thing.

468
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,500
At least you get to get out of this town

469
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,000
For a little while.

470
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,600
Kim, it's summer vacation.

471
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,500
You can go out of town, too.

472
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
You can go anywhere you want.

473
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,000
No, i can't, lindsay.

474
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't have any money.

475
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,000
And besides, daniel never
wants to go anywhere, anyway.

476
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,500
So?

477
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Go without him.

478
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,000
You don't have to stay here.

479
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,400
You know that, kim.

480
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,400
That's easy for you to say, lindsay,

481
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
'Cause you get to leave.

482
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I don't.

483
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,800
Come on, nick, you promised me.

484
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,300
I know. I'm just kinda freaked out about it.

485
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,900
I'm not that good at contests.

486
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,800
Nick, you are a great dancer.

487
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Ok? You're really, really good.

488
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,400
And i swear, i'm not just saying that.

489
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,800
Thanks.

490
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
It's weird. i used to hate disco.

491
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,300
But i guess maybe...

492
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,200
I was just destined for it.

493
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Yeah!

494
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Totally.

495
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,800
Sometimes you end up being the best

496
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,300
At something you hate.

497
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,200
Mm-hmm.

498
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,800
She hate like lindsay.

499
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,800
S math, but she's the head of the mathletes.

500
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,700
Nick, do you still like lindsay?

501
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,100
No, no.

502
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,100
I mean, i still care about her.

503
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Look, i really like you, sara.

504
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,100
I've had a crush on you
since the sixth grade.

505
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Really?

506
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
I always sat behind you,

507
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,600
Even though you were so tall
i couldn't see the board.

508
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,500
Wow.

509
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,500
I just-i can't believe that you like me.

510
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,400
Oh...

511
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,400
Tonight's d&d campaign
is gonna be the best ever.

512
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Ancient babylonia.

513
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,600
Have you guys seen the
drawing of the goddess ishtar?

514
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,000
Hubba hubba!

515
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
You should look at the goddess of vice.

516
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,000
I just h you can see her butt.

517
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,500
Ope you guys are ready
to face the dancing sword.

518
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,000
Bring it on !

519
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,500
What's a dancing sword?

520
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Well, it like-

521
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
It's a sword that can fight
without you holding it.

522
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,200
What, you just send your
sword into battle for you,

523
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,600
And then you stay home?

524
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,200
That's kind of stupid.

525
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
No, no, you have to be
at least 3 inches away

526
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,600
From it when it's fighting.

527
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,200
That way you can fight 2 people at once.

528
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
That's kinda cool.

529
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,700
Hey, daniel.

530
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,200
We're playing d&d tonight. you wanna come?

531
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Why?

532
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I think you'd like it. We
could show you how to play.

533
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
I couldn't do that.

534
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Yeah, you wouldn't like it,
anyway. It's really boring.

535
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,000
No. No, it isn't, neal.

536
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,500
You love it.

537
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
We sit around and crack jokes

538
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,500
And eat junk food all night while we're...

539
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,500
Fighting dragons and
saving princesses and stuff.

540
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
It's pretty fun.

541
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,000
You get and the best part is,

542
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
To pretend to be somebody
you can't be in real life.

543
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,600
Ok, i'll play.

544
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,600
Really?

545
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,700
Yeah, i'll play.

546
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,100
Just...don't expect me to
be good at it or anything.

547
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,500
You can't possibly be any worse than bill.

548
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,400
Hey!

549
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,400
So, sam, how about you? Are you in?

550
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,900
Yeah, i guess.

551
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,900
Thought you were too cool to play...

552
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Logan the huge.

553
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,100
Ken, no. we shouldn't be here.

554
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,000
Just let nick do what he wants.

555
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I can't do that. The poor guy's brainwashed.

556
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I can't let him dance
in this stupid contest.

557
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,500
It goes against everything
that we stand for.

558
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,100
Well, i'm not gonna stop him.

559
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
Just talk to him!

560
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,000
At least tell him that he
doesn't have a chance with you

561
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So he'll break up with sara!

562
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,000
No, it's not gonna work.

563
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Look! Kenny and lindsay
came to cheer you on!

564
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,500
That is so cool! hey, guys!

565
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,500
Hey, nick. Lindsay has something

566
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,000
She wants to tell you.

567
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
No, i don't.

568
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Yes, you do!

569
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,900
Ken, stop it!

570
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,200
Oh, check it out, kids.

571
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,200
It's our little opinionated
rock 'n' roller friend.

572
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,100
Who the hell's he talkin' about?

573
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,100
I think he's talking about you.

574
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,700
Uh...so what do i do?

575
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
First you have to create a character.

576
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,300
Roll your dice and find out
what your ability scores are.

577
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,700
What are those?

578
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,700
Oh, well, that tells you
if you're strong or smart

579
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Or how good you are with a weapon.

580
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,700
What are you, some... super-smart guy?

581
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,200
I don't have a character.

582
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm the dungeon master. i control the game

583
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,700
And act out all the characters
you'll meet along the way.

584
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,700
And, daniel, watch out for him.

585
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
He's sneaky.

586
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Yeah, yeah, he thinks

587
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,700
Being a dungeon master gives him
a license to mess with our heads.

588
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,700
Oh, i'm sorry. Perhaps i should let you

589
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,200
Encounter kittens and grandmas

590
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,100
So as not to upset you.

591
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Come on, daniel, roll the dice.

592
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I wanna see what your character's gonna be.

593
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,700
All right.

594
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Here goes nothin'.

595
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,200
Hey, man, aren't you one of those guys

596
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,100
Who's always yellin' in here

597
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,600
That disco sucks?

598
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,600
What's the matter?

599
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,900
Cat got your bong, man?

600
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,800
Is that how you learned to communicate,

601
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,300
Runnin' in here, yellin' stuff?

602
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,800
Is that what your precious
rock teachers you, friend?

603
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,300
Um...no, man.

604
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
It teaches me that...

605
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,400
Disco sucks!

606
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,300
Ken, don't, all right?

607
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,800
I say that rock 'n' roll sucks, ok?

608
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,700
Hey, have you heard the
stones' new song, miss you?

609
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
Well, guess what? it's disco, man.

610
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Even the stones know it.

611
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,700
They're willing to admit it. why can't you?

612
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,700
This place is empty, man!

613
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,100
Disco is dead. give it up!

614
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Why don't you go back

615
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
To sellin'shirts at the mall there, buddy?

616
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,700
All right, pal. Let's go.

617
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,100
Great. thanks a lot, man.

618
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,600
Disco is alive! it's alive, i tell you!

619
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,300
I know it... and you know it...

620
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,900
And miss gloria gaynor knows it, too!

621
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,800
At first i was afraid

622
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,800
I was petrified

623
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
Kept thinkin' i could never live without you

624
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
By my side...

625
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Where the hell is daniel when you need him?

626
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,900
A dwarf? i don't wanna be a dwarf.

627
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,900
I wanted to be, like, a ninja or a fighter.

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
Well, dwarfs are fighters.

629
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,300
They're really good at it.

630
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Are you a dwarf?

631
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,200
No. I'm kragenmore the destroyer.

632
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,700
You're lucky, man. i want to be

633
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,200
Some huge destroyer guy.

634
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Dwarfs can do a lot of things
that huge guys can't do.

635
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,700
It's true. take it from me.

636
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah, dwarfs are really tough.

637
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
They're good at finding jewels.

638
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,400
All right, fine. i'll be a dwarf.

639
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,900
But my name is carlos.

640
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,300
Carlos the dwarf?

641
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,200
Yeah, you got a problem with that, gorthon?

642
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,200
No.

643
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,500
Thanks a lot, man. Thanks
for embarrassing me in there.

644
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,000
I gotta go dance in
front of those people now!

645
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,400
Best of luck, man. i mean it!

646
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,900
Give me a call when you get
over your saturday night fever.

647
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,400
And you're too tall to be a good dancer!

648
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Hey, i agree with you, man.

649
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,000
That place sucks.

650
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,900
And you're right. They're
closin' the disco next week

651
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,000
And bringin' in foxy boxin'.

652
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,900
You should come back and check it out.

653
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Rock 'n' roll!

654
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,800
What is wrong with that guy? Why does he

655
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
Have to give me such a hard time about this?

656
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Ken's just confused. He's thinks
you're doing all this stuff

657
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,300
To...i don't know, to get me back.

658
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,800
Well, that's not true.

659
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,400
That's what i told him, but
he doesn't want to listen.

660
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,300
I mean, i'm with sara now.

661
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,300
You know?

662
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm not some idiot. You told me to move on.

663
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,300
And so i did.

664
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,300
Yeah!

665
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,800
I know.

666
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,300
I think it's great.

667
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,300
Well, it is great. I mean,
sara's the best, you know?

668
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,300
She opened me up to all sorts of new things,

669
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,800
And she loves me.

670
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
I mean, that's important.

671
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,700
It is.

672
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,700
I'm really happy for you, nick.

673
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,200
Well, you should be, you know?

674
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,200
I even quit smoking pot.

675
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,800
Yeah. I don't even really want it anymore.

676
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,300
It's like i totally cleaned myself up.

677
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,100
Wow!

678
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Really?

679
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:51,900
Mm-hmm.

680
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,900
God,

681
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,400
That's-i knew there
was something different.

682
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
That's so great.

683
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
You seem like you're having

684
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Way more fun with her
than you ever did with me.

685
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Yeah.

686
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,500
I mean, i am.

687
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,000
Tta get going.

688
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,500
I have a lot of studying to
do for that academic summit.

689
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I should probably start studying for finals.

690
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,700
Oh, yeah. i should do that, too.

691
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,700
First i gotta win this dance contest.

692
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,100
Hey, good luck.

693
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,100
Thanks.

694
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,200
Ok, all right, everybody.

695
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,700
We're gonna shake our groove things

696
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,000
Tonight here at frontier lanes.

697
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
It's time for the big disco contest,

698
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
And let's bring up our first
contestant of the night-

00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,000
Nick.

702
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Nicky.

703
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,600
Nick! Come on, baby, it's your turn.

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Time to boogie oogie oogie.

706
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,900
Takin' you on a trip

707
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,400
Ain't no seats

Party hard there and back

719
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,800
Leave your worries behind

720
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,200
Come rain or shine

Yeah, we always give my grandma chocolates

00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,200
When we put her on the bus.

That, and we pin her name

826
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,200
In case she gets lost.

00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,500

Ok. Love you.

840
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,200
I miss you already!

841
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,800
If my words did glow

842
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,300
With the cold warm of sunshine

843
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,300
And my tunes were played

844
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,400
On the farm on the strum

845
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,300
Would you hear my voice

846
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,300
Come through the music?

847
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,800
Would you hold it near

848
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,700
As it grew year-round?

849
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,300
It's a hand me down

850
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,700
But thoughts are broken

851
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Perhaps

852
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,200
They're better

853
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Left unsung

854
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,300
I don't know

855
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,700
Don't really care

856
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,700
Let there be songs

857
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,800
To fill the air

858
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,200
Ripples in

859
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,800
Still water

860
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,700
When there is no apple toss

861
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,700
Nor wind to blow

862
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,000
Reach out your hand

863
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
If your cup be empty

864
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,400
If your cup is full

865
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,000
May it be again

866
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,400
Let it be known

867
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,400
There is a fountain

868
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,500
That was not made

869
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,900
By the hands of men
