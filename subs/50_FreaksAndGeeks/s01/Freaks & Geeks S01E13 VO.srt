00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,400
What is this?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,400
Creamed spinach.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,900
Mm.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,400
And what is this?

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,400
That's salisbury steak.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,400
What makes that different
from the regular steak?

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,400
I don't know.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,900
E salisbury sauce, i suppose.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,300
You want some?

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,300
Uh...

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,200
Nikolai, it's time to go. let's go.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,700
You know, i always notice that...

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,200
The day after we have salisbury steak,

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
We always have hamburgers.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,700
But then the day after that,

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
We always have meatball heroes.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
And a few days after that, we have meatloaf.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,200
So is it the same meat?

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,200
Are you guys...

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,200
Are you guys recycling the meat?

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,200
It's different meat.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,700
Yeah, well...

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,200
I guess you would have to say that, right?

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
I'll have the salisbury steak, please.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,100
Excellent choice, sir.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Thanks.

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,200
All rught yum yum.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,200
Some salisbury dog meat for us, please.

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,200
Hey, nick.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Hey.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,700
Where have you been?

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
You told me we were going to denny's.

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,700
I was waiting for you in the parking lot.

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,200
Did i say that?

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Yeah. After third period.

37
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,700
Third period?

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,700
In the hallway at my locker.

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,700
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Oh, man, i'm sorry.

41
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Do you still want to go, or...

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,400
You're already eating.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,900
Yeah, but that's ok.

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,400
I could eat again. i'm kinda hungry.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,900
You're kinda stoned.

46
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm very stoned.

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Report cards come out in, like, 2 weeks,

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
So i thought i'd try to have some fun

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,300
Before the whip comes down. you know?

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Forget it.

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,900
What's wrong with lindsay?

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,900
I don't know, man. she's crazy.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,000
So?

55
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't have any in yet.

56
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,000
The town can't be totally dry, mark.

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,000
That's sick. Come on.

58
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,000
It happens.

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,500
Don't worry. i'll get you some.

60
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Don't you grow your own?

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
No.

62
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
That's-you are so full of it.

63
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,900
I know that you grow your own.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
Tommy genaro told me that it was amazing.

65
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,400
That's a lie.

66
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
My dad found my grow lights,

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,400
And he ran over them with his car.

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,900
He better have.

69
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,400
The customer is king, mark.

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,900
The customer is king.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
What?

72
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,400
You know what.

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Captioning made possible by
dreamworks television, l.l.c.

74
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't give damn livin' in the
past, 'bout it's a new generation

75
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Go and do what you want to do

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,900
And that's what i'm gonna do

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,200
And i don't give a damn
'bout my bad reputation

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Not me

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,400
Whah! No!

81
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

82
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,400
Not me

83
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,100
Me, me, me, me

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't give a da 'bout my reputation

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,700
I've never been afraid of any deviation

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,700
And i don't really care
if you think i'm strange

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,900
I ain't gonna change

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A i'm never gonna care
'bout my bad reputatio

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Not me!

90
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Pelicans. That looks exciting.

91
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,000
Try 2.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, no. Try 4.

93
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
7.

94
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
Ah, that's it. ok, great.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Thank you, sam.

96
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh, lindsay,

97
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,900
The johnsons want you
to baby-sit on thursday.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
What do they pay?

99
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,900
$1.50 an hour.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's all?

101
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,500
They're so cheap.

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes, l

103
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,600
Indsay, they should pay you a king's ransom

104
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
To lay around drinking pop

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
And watching tv on their couch.

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
What, am i supposed to work for slave wages?

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
I guess keeping their kid safe and secure

108
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Isn't worth that much to them.

109
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
All right. Enough already.
everybody be quiet.

110
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm trying to watch charlie's angels.

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,200
Sam, who's your favorite angel?

112
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,700
I like bosley.

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,700
Bosley?

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,700
Nobody watches this show for bosley.

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,700
He's funny.

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Yeah? Well, he's no kate jackson,

117
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
I'll tell you that much.

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,300
He doesn't care.

119
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,800
He's in love with cindy sanders.

120
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
No, not anymore.

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,300
She's going out with todd schellinger.

122
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,800
Aw. Well, it's her loss, honey.

123
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
She's the one missing out.

124
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Well, has anybody else caught your fancy?

125
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,600
Dad!

126
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Honey, stop, you're embarrassing him.

127
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100
I just think there comes a
time in a young man's life

128
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
When he should begin testing the waters.

129
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,600
What about me testing the waters?

130
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,100
You can test the waters, too-

131
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,100
After you get married.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
Oh, did you hear?

133
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Freshman student government voted
cindy and todd "cutest couple."

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Aw, man! When is she
gonna break up with him?

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought jocks are always
dumping their girlfriends.

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,500
Sam, it may very well be
time to admit to yourself

137
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
That the cindy ship has sailed.

138
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,000
It's time to board another vessel.

139
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
Another what?

140
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Hey! My new binder.

141
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,500
Mm! New tri-folder organizer.

142
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Very impressive.

143
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,500
I have one of those babies myself.

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Could you please watch where you're going?

145
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Hey, sam.

147
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Hey, guys.

148
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,600
Hey, maureen.

149
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Did you guys do the
reading for social studi-

150
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,300
Maureen, come on, let's go.

151
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,300
Ok.

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,300
Um, i'll see you guys in class.

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
See ya.

154
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,700
See, sam? Those are the kinda women

155
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,200
We should be going for.

156
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,700
The cindy sanders of this world

157
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Are just...hors d'oeuvres.

158
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,200
Vicki is a 5-course meal.

159
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Horwhat?

160
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,300
Hey Bill.

161
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Bill, you want some crushed
nuts with your sundae?

162
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,000
My what?

163
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Ohh!

164
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,000
That guy needs a new joke.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,700
For the next week, we're going to be talking

166
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,200
About the civil rights movement.

167
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,700
So that should be fun,

168
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,200
'Cause that was a really exciting time.

169
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,000
Now, most people think
of martin luther king jr.

170
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
When they talk about this time,

171
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
But the movement was sparked by one woman

172
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,000
Who refused to give up
her seat on a public bus.

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Does anyone know her name?

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Rosa parks.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,500
That's right, bill. very good.

176
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Ah-choo!

177
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
God bless-

178
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,600
Whoa. God bless you, miss foote.

179
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,100
Thank you.

180
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,600
Ah. My allergi

181
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Es are really acting up today.

182
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah. Mine, too.

183
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
Do you want me to close the window?

184
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,100
No. Thank you, bill.

185
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Brown noser.

186
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Alan.

187
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,500
What

188
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you allergic to, bill?

189
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,900
Well, a lot of things are on that list-

190
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,900
Like, bees and air and cats and dogs.

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Well, not dogs. well, some dogs.

192
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,400
If i eat a peanut, i could die.

193
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,400
Wow. Really?

194
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Yeah. It happened once in summer camp,

195
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,900
And i had to be taken away in an ambulance.

196
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
So don't eat 'em, dork.

197
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,400
I don't.

198
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,900
If i did, i could die.

199
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,400
You know, bill, that's really unusual.

200
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,600
Not really.

201
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,600
A lot of people have ailments like that.

202
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,600
Like...like, neal has psoriasis,

203
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,100
Which is like lizard skin.

204
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,600
And sam passes out

205
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
If he even thinks about blood.

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ok. So...

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
I can't believe you.

208
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
What?

209
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,100
We're finally starting to
get some respect around here,

210
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,600
D you had to go ruin it.

211
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,100
How ar

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,100
E we gonna get in with
maureen and her friends

213
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,100
If you tell the whole
class about my fainting,

214
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,600
Your dumb allergies, and neal's lizard skin?

215
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Hey. It's called psoriasis,

216
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,100
And 10% of the population
will suffer from it

217
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,100
At some point in their life.

218
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,600
What's the big deal?

219
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,100
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

220
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
You were too busy flirting with miss foote

221
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
To realize you were making fools out of us.

222
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,600
I was not flirting with miss foote.

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
And you're killing my chances with vicki.

224
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
You don't have a chance with vicki.

225
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
You don't have a chance with miss foote.

226
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,300
I got a better chance with miss
foote than you have with vicki,

227
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,800
And i don't have a chance at all.

228
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,500
Fine, bill. Be a geek your whole life.

229
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,500
I'm sick of it.

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
You guys have any pot?

231
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
No.

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The cupboard is bare, man.

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Yeah? I'm running out really quick.

234
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,700
I've been rationing all week.

235
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
I don't know what i'm gonna do.

236
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Um, not be stoned?

237
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Ha ha.

238
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm serious, you guys.

239
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,600
You don't have any pot?

240
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,600
Hey, wait a minute, daniel.
you always have pot, man.

241
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,200
Daniel, don't be a cheap bastard.

242
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,100
I always hook you up.

243
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Oh, yeah? when was that, man?

244
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,100
You haven't passed a joint in your life.

245
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah. You know, it's really, uh...

246
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,000
It's really uncool if you
guys are holding out on me.

247
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm gonna kill mark.

248
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
That guy is turning into a wastebasket.

249
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,200
No kidding.

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
Just look at him. he's a freakin' mess.

251
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,600
Youareholding out on him.

252
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Shh.

253
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,100
Of course.

254
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
But i'm gonna toss the stuff.

255
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,600
You're gonna throw away your weed?

256
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Yeah.

257
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,100
Look, man, this stuff is bad.

258
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,100
I gotta stay sharp if i wanna, you know...

259
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,100
Stay sharp?

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Yeah.

261
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,600
Well, here's a plan.

262
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,100
How about, you know, instead
of letting that go to waste,

263
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
You donate it to a worthy cause.

264
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Like, uh, me.

265
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I can't give it to you.

266
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Why not?

267
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
I care about you.

268
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,100
Just give it to me.

269
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,000
No. Come on, give it to me.

270
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,000
Why don't you give it to me?

271
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll see you in my office.

272
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Hey, nick.

273
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,700
Oh, hey.

274
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
How you holdin' up?

275
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,700
You know, 5 days with no pot.

276
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,700
I almost smoked my mom's ferns last night.

277
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,700
You look really good.

278
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Your eyes are all clear.

279
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Oh, yeah?

280
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
At least i'm saving money on eye drops.

281
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Oh, come on. It can't be that big a deal.

282
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
Nah, nah. it's just a bummer.

283
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Well...

284
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Let's do something fun.

285
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Yeah?

286
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
Yeah.

287
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,700
I'll meet you at lunch and we'll cut out.

288
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,200
Yeah, ok.

289
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Ok.

290
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
And george washington carver
had many accomplishments,

291
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,900
But he was best known for
his work with the peanut.

292
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,900
And for being bill's mortal enemy.

293
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Beca get it, bill?

294
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Use you're allergic to peanuts.

295
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah, that was a good one.

296
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Don't forget your reading assignments,

297
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,100
And your essays are due on monday.

298
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,500
Thank you.

299
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you all right, bill?

300
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Yeah, i...

301
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I just don't like you talking
so much about my allergies.

302
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
It makes me look like a geek.

303
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm sorry.

304
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,400
It's ok.

305
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,900
You know, bill, you're not a geek.

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Tell that to the rest of the world.

307
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,200
Hey, guys.

308
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,700
So, whose mom is gonna drive us

309
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
To the sci-fi convention on saturday?

310
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh, actually, sam and i

311
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
Are going to a cheerleading competition

312
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,100
To see vicki and maureen compete.

313
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Yeah, maureen invited us.

314
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,600
But what about the sci-fi convention?

315
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,700
Um... um...

316
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
Oh!

317
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Yeah, you can ask gordon to go with you.

318
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,700
I mean, he loves science fiction.

319
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
I don't like sci-fi.

320
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
I love, love, love it!

321
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,200
Should your mom drive, or should mine?

322
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Hey, maybe my mom should drive

323
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Because she puts all my
make-up on in the parking lot

324
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,700
Before i go in.

325
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Great.

326
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,100
Come on!

327
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, my goodness.

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Come on, that's not fair!

329
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,600
What? that's easy for me...

330
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,200
And kareem abdul-jabbar.

331
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,700
All right.

332
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,300
All right, let's go

333
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,300
Hit your mark.

334
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Get your foot up.

335
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,100
Ok.

336
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Oh, that's too bad

337
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,200
Go, come on, shoot it.

339
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
The eagle has landed.

340
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,700
I love the eagle.

341
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,700
You know how there was a drought, man?

342
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
Now there's a flood.

343
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,700
Tell your friends we're
having a harvest sale.

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
It's gonna be 40.

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,100
All right.

346
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Enjoy.

347
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Hey, go easy, though.

348
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,600
This is some strong stuff.

349
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
It's hydroponic.

350
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Like the lettuce?

351
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,100
Yeah, like the lettuce.

352
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
See ya later, man.

353
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,100
All right.

354
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,100
Hey. Hey.

355
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,100
Wanna come to my house and smoke this?

356
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,600
Uh...no.

357
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
It'll be fun.

358
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,100
I don't smoke pot.

359
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Come on.

360
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,100
What's the big deal?

361
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
It's from the earth. it's natural.

362
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Why would it be there if we
weren't supposed to smoke it?

363
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,300
Dog crap is here, and we don't smoke that.

364
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,500
All right. you know what? Fine.

365
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
You're too good for pot.

366
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,500
I'm a low life.

367
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,900
Ok, maybe i'll smoke a little.

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,900
Just to see what it's like.

369
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
Yeah? yeah.

370
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
We're gonna have so much fun.

371
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,300
I thought you said this
was supposed to be fun.

372
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,300
Yeah, this is fun, huh?

373
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,800
What's so fun about this?

374
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,800
What'snotfun about this?

375
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Oh, shh... listen to this drum fill.

376
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,300
Ohh! that guy is amazing.

377
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,300
Do you-do you know how hard that is?

378
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Oh...

379
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,800
Hey...

380
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Do you want to go to the market

381
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
And get some drakes cakes?

382
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,800
No.

383
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,300
Why do you do this, nick?

384
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,800
You're an amazing guy
when you're not stoned.

385
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Don't start with that.

386
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,200
You know, i've been waiting for
this moment all week, all right?

387
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,200
Yeah, i know you have.

388
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,700
I think it's sad.

389
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,200
You know what? You don't know
what you're talking about.

390
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,700
You come in here, you take one hit-

391
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,200
And you don't even inhale it-

392
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,100
And then you're gonna criticize me

393
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,100
And you're gonna tell me that i'm lame?

394
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
What do you know?

395
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,600
You've never even been high before,

396
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,100
So who are you to judge me?

397
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,100
Look at you. you are addicted.

398
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,100
Oh, come on, lindsay. please.

399
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,600
You are.

400
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,100
I mean, what's the highlight of your week?

401
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Sitting on your couch eating chips,

402
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
Dreaming of drakes cakes?

403
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,100
You know what? It's
better than sitting there

404
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,600
With a board up my butt, like you.

405
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,600
You don't feel anything.
you don't enjoy anything.

406
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,700
You know what? i got news for you:

407
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
Except you don't wan to admit it.

408
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
You're a drag.

409
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,200
And you know what?

410
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Here, you see it?

411
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,700
I'm really addicted.

412
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,200
How am i gonna live without it?

413
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Why don't you grow up, all right, lindsay?

414
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,700
'Cause you don't know everything.

415
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
And when it comes to pot, you know what?

416
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,200
You don't know anything.

417
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,600
Check out mr. Peanut.

418
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
He's probably eating a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich, the liar.

419
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Hmm. Let's find out if he's lying.

420
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Gordon.

421
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Um, i don't think i can go

422
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,300
To the sci-fi convention,

423
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,200
'Cause my mom wants me to
help her clean the garage.

424
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
What a bummer.

425
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,700
You're gonna miss george takai, you know.

426
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,800
Sorry.

427
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,800
I was gonna lend you my yoda mask, too.

428
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,800
Well...next time.

429
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,800
We'll go next time.

430
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Sit back and watch the fireworks.

431
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Are you guys gonna eat with me?

432
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,800
Yeah. Why?

433
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,300
I don't know, i just thought-

434
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Thought maybe i was too geeky to eat with.

435
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,300
You are, but we're too hungry to care.

436
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
This is crunchy.

437
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,700
So?

438
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Like...like peanuty crunchy.

439
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
You want me to go get ms.
foote so you two can discuss it?

440
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,800
Did you guys put something in my sandwich?

441
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
No.

442
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
Hey, haverchuck, what happens now?

443
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,400
Should we call an ambulance?

444
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Yeah.

445
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,400
Come on, people, move!

446
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,900
Let's go! Get out of the way!

447
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
It's all right, bill.

448
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Mrs. Haverchuck.

449
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey, sam.

450
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
Is bill still alive?

451
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,500
Yeah.

452
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, the doctor's in
there with him right now.

453
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, my god, gloria. i am so sorry.

454
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,000
This hasn't happened in years.

455
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,500
Last time he ate a peanut,

456
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
He was in a coma for 2 days.

457
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,500
The doctor said he almost didn't make it.

458
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,000
Is he gonna die?

459
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,900
No, of course not.

460
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,200
No, sweetie, no.

461
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,700
Sit down.

462
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,200
Sam, could you not use the
word "die" in a hospital?

463
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,200
You asked if he was still alive.

464
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
That's an optimistic question.

465
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,700
Alive is good. die is bad.

466
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Trust me on this. my dad's a dentist.

467
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
So, frank, how's it feel to be back?

468
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
Oh, it's a trip.

469
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,400
Girls are cuter. a lot cuter.

470
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Mr. Russo: OH, HEY, GUYS.

471
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,500
Just finishing up with an old student.

472
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, forgive me, frank.

473
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
This is daniel desario and ken miller.

474
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,000
What's up, guys?

475
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,000
Hey. how's it goin'?

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
You into floyd?

477
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,900
Oh, hell, yeah.

478
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
I saw them at the pyramids.

479
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,900
The egyptian pyramids?

480
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,900
Uh, i don't think they've
ever played the pyramids.

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
Oh, yeah.

482
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
You're right.

483
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,900
It was the dead.

484
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,400
I just got confused because
i was thinking of another guy

485
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,400
I went to both shows with, you know?

486
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,900
His name was tim.

487
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,500
Hey, saw floyd at the laser dome.

488
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,500
They weren't there, but it was their music.

489
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,400
Well, thanks for lunch, frank.

490
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,400
Definitely, jeff.

491
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,400
We'll do it again soon.

492
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,400
Absolutely.

493
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,400
See you, guys.

494
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,400
Shine on, you crazy diamonds.

495
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,400
All right.

496
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,400
Daniel. Ken, have a seat.

497
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,800
That was for your benefit.

498
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
I want you to remember that man.

499
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,200
Why?

500
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,600
'Cause he's fried out of his mind.

501
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,100
He's mr. Wake and bake.

502
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,100
So?

503
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,100
He's your future.

504
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Keep burning the bong at both ends

505
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
And you'll wind up just like him.

506
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,600
Mr. Russo, i told you.

507
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
I was just trying to get rid of my weed.

508
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
How dumb do i look?

509
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,000
Do you really want to know?

510
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,200
I could have you expeed for this,

511
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,100
But i'm gonna give you a break.

512
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,100
Learn from frank...

513
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,700
Or you'llbefrank.

514
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,900
It's your choice.

515
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,900
Right.

516
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Do we understand each other?

517
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,700
As much as that's possible.

518
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,100
Hi-de-ho

519
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,500
Hi-de-hi

520
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,500
Gonna get me a piece of the sky

521
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Gonna get me some of that old sweet roll

522
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm singin'
hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho

523
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,700
Hi-de-ho

524
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,500
Get it, children

525
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Gonna get me a piece of the sky

526
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,900
What if bill's ghost starts to haunt us?

527
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
Then he'll come into our rooms at night

528
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,900
And start throwing things at us.

529
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,400
No, no. Bill wouldn't do that, you know?

530
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,900
He's our friend, right?

531
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
That's true.

532
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,100
I mean, maybe he'd be like
casper the friendly ghost.

533
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,600
He'd you know?

534
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,100
Hang out with us, and no
one would talk to him but us.

535
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,400
I mean, no one would know he was there.

536
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,900
Oh, yeah, yeah,

537
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,700
And people would catch us talking to him,

538
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
And they would think we were crazy-

539
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,600
Like wilbur onmr. Ed.

540
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,500
That would be cool.

541
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,500
My little Bill.

542
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,500
Oh, god, i'm so worried.

543
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Gloria, gloria, he's gonna be all right.

544
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
But it wouldn't be like that, would it?

545
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,500
He'd just be dead and
gone forever, wouldn't he?

546
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
Yeah.

547
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
What-what do people do
when they're not stoned?

548
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't know.

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Relate to one another?

550
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,100
I don't want

551
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,600
I want to relate to lindsay.

552
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,600
She's-he's so smarti don't
think and straightit can work.

553
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Yeah.

554
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,100
Well, it's definitely not gonna work

555
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,600
If you're smoking weed.

556
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Yeah, she's too sweet and perfect for that.

557
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,000
Lindsay ?

558
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Lindsay, you in there?

559
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,500
Yeah.

560
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,400
Lindsay, what are you doing?

561
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,900
Dad, what are you doing home?

562
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
I forgot my wallet.

563
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,400
What areyoudoing home?

564
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
What am i doing home?

565
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,300
What, like, why am i here?

566
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,300
What are you doinghere?

567
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
You're supposed to be
baby-sitting for the johnsons.

568
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
I am?

569
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,400
Yeah, you'd better get over there.

570
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,900
They're gonna be really mad.

571
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Well, dad, i have to cancel.

572
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,900
I have a lot of homework to do.

573
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,700
Lindsay, you're not cancelling on them.

574
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,100
Now, do your homework over there.

575
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Are you all right?

576
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,600
Yeah, i'm fine.

577
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,100
I'm just tired.

578
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I have... woman problems.

579
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,700
I don't want to hear about it.

580
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,700
Just get over there.

581
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,200
Hey idiot, take your time.

582
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,200
Come on, move it.

584
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,800
What is he doing here?

585
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Excuse me.

586
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Which one of you is bill's mother?

587
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
I am.

588
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,600
My son has something
he'd like to say to you.

589
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,100
I'm the one who put the
peanut on bill's sandwich.

590
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,600
I thought he was faking, though.

591
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
He's always lying about stuff like that.

592
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,100
I didn't know he was really allergic.

593
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
I swear.

594
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, my goodness.

595
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,500
Can i talk to him and tell him i'm sorry?

596
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,500
No, you can't talk to him...

597
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,500
Because he's unconscious, and
he's in critical condition,

598
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,500
And you'd better believe
he's not lying about that.

599
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,100
Sit down.

600
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,100
Millie !

601
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,800
Millie, i need your help.

602
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
What is it?

603
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Did you forget your
social studies book again?

604
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
No.

605
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm going baby-sitting, and
i want you to come with me.

606
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,300
Really?

607
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,300
Why?

608
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,300
Because it will be fun.

609
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,200
You're high.

610
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,200
What?!

611
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,700
You're on the pot.

612
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,700
How could you tell?

613
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm not dumb, lindsay.

614
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,100
I know what high people look like.

615
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,600
I went to a seals and
crofts concert last summer.

616
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,100
Ok.

617
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,600
I didn't want to.

618
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Nick talked me into it

619
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,100
And now i'm really stoned, and
i don't know what's gonna happen.

620
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
I really feel weird, millie.

621
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Fine. I'll go with you.

622
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,600
But only for the safety of the child.

623
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,500
Thank you, millie.

624
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,500
No, thank your dealer.

625
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,200
You awake?

626
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,700
Haverchuck.

627
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,700
You're not faking, are you?

628
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,000
I didn't think you were really allergic.

629
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You just always say stupid stuff like that.

630
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,100
Look, i'm sorry. I-i didn't
mean to put you in the hospital.

631
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,600
I was just goofing on you.

632
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,200
You know, it's not like you
guys have ever been nice to me.

633
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,900
I remember, like, in the fourth grade,

634
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,900
I used to think you guys
were, like, really cool.

635
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,400
And this one time, you
brought a model of thesaturn 5

636
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
In for
show-and-tell,

637
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,400
And i asked you guys if i could
shoot off rockets with you,

638
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,900
And you said no.

639
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,900
So, what, i'm supposed to be
all nice to you guys and stuff?

640
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,600
I liked comic books and
science fiction, too,

641
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,600
But you guys never asked me to hang out.

642
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Please don't die.

643
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,700
Ok?

644
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,700
I promise, i'll never be mean to you again,

645
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,300
Even if you do something really stupid.

646
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,300
Just don't die.

647
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
If a balloon bres, make sure
he doesn't put it in his mouth,

648
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
'Cause he could choke on it.

649
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Do you know the heimlich maneuver?

650
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Great.

651
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,900
Don't let him go into
the kitchen tonight, ok?

652
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
If he goes in there, the first thing
he'll do is go after the knives.

653
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,900
Um, he'ss he's hungry

654
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,900
That means he wants junk food,

655
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,900
And the junk food drawer is in the kitchen.

656
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,900
The lower one next to the sink.

657
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,400
He's allowed to have one thing.

658
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,400
He'll say he can have more, but he can't.

659
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,400
Excuse me.

660
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,400
I gotta go to the bathroom.

661
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,100
We'll be back at 9:00.

662
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
We left the number in t
kitchen, where we'll be.

663
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,100
Also on there you'll find
the police department...

664
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,600
My mother, my sister.

665
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
It's all on the refrigerator, ok?

666
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Is poison control on there ?

667
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Poison control is on there.

668
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Ok? And please don't let him ride the dog.

669
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,300
Good-bye, honey.

671
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,300
Have fun.

672
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,400
Sam. neal.

673
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,300
We heard about bill.

674
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh, my god, is he all right?

675
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
We don't know.

676
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,300
How are you guys?

677
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
This is so horrible.

678
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,000
We're ok. We're just worried about bill.

679
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,600
Well, what's happening?

680
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,500
He's in critical condition.

681
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh, my god.

682
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,000
I hope he's ok.

683
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,900
I feel so guilty.

684
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,400
Why?

685
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,500
If i would have taken more care of myself

686
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,000
When i was pregnant with bill,

687
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,500
Maybe he wouldn't even
get allergies like this.

688
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't blame yourself.

689
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We didn't know back then.

690
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,000
When i was pregnant with sam,

691
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,000
I didn't think twice about nutrition.

692
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,000
I was drinng a lot back then.

693
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Oh.

694
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,900
Well, you know...

695
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,900
Gettin' high, poppin' pills.

696
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,400
This is all my fault.

697
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
When sam was 4 months old...

698
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,300
I...

699
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,800
Dropped him on a brick patio.

700
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,800
He had a hairline
fracture of the skulreally?

701
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,300
Yes.

702
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Uhh.

703
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Thanks, jean.

704
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,200

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,000
Millie, the kid is in there.

733
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
He found me.

734
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So you're it.

735
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Well, i can't handle him right now.

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,500
What am i doing here, millie?

737
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I don't like this place.
it's freaking me out.

738
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,400
I don't like it.

739
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,400
Maybe i'll go outside
and lay down for awhile,

740
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,900
And then i'll walk home
when i feel better, ok?

741
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,400
No, lindsay.

742
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,400
Calm down.

743
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
Just go in the living room.

744
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
I'll put ronnie to bed,

745
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,400
And then i'll come take care of you.

746
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Thanks, millie.

747
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Millie?

748
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah?

749
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
How long does this last?

750
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Nick is stoned all the time.

751
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,000
He deals with his parents when he's high.

752
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,900
He goes to class when he's high.

753
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Why would he do that?

754
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,900
Becausthat's right.

755
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,700
He'swe're all unhappy.

756
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,200
That's the thing about life, millie.

757
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,700
That's the hor

758
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,200
I'm not unhappy.

759
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Yes, you are. we all are.

760
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,600
Well, not like you guys.

761
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,100
Why not?

762
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Because i know god's taking care of me.

763
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
I don't believe in god.

764
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,600
I know.

765
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
That's why you're unhappy.

766
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,600
That's why you're stoned.

767
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,000
God doesn't make sense.

768
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,000
It's not lical.

769
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,900
Well, i may not be logical,

770
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,900
But i have faith.

771
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,300
Faith based on what?

772
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,600
What if this is a dream?

773
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,600
What if all of this is a dream?

774
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What if all this is a dream,

775
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
And it's not even our dream,

776
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,400
It's that dog's dream.

777
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,800
Maybe we're just existing in his mind,

778
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,300
And all of a sudden he'll wake
up to go drink out of the toilet,

779
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,800
And we'll be gone.

780
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,800
What would happen to
us if that dog wakes up?

781
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,100
It'll be over.

782
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,500
Life is not that dog's dam.

783
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,500
We live in god's world.

784
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,400
Millie, what are you doing?

785
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,900
I'm gonna wake up this dog.

786
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,900
Millie, no. don't, please.

787
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,400
Lindsay, it'll be ok. Don't worry.

788
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,900
Don't wake up that dog, millie. Please.

789
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,400
I don't want you to.

790
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,800
Lindsay, it's ok.

791
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,800
No, please.

792
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,300
Just have faith, lindsay.

793
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:19,800
Have faith.

794
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,300
No, no, no, no

795
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
, No, no, no, no, no.

796
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,800
Arise, doggy.

797
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Arise, doggy. Arise.

798
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
You see?

799
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,600
Believe, lindsay.

800
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Allright, just for a minute.

801
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,600
Oh, billy! hi, mom.

802
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,600
Oh, my gosh.

803
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,100
You're hurting me.

804
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,600
You're alive! I knew you'd make it.

805
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Did i almost die?

806
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,700
Yes.

807
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,200
That's cool.

808
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,700
He's been through a lot.

809
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,200
His body has a lot of recovering to do,

810
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
So let's let him get some rest.

811
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
That's a good idea.

812
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,800
I gotta call your dad. he was worried sick.

813
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,300
Really?

814
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Yeah, of course. we all were.

815
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Come on, boys.

816
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Get some rest, ok?

817
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,800
Ok.

818
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Bill, are you ok?

819
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,700
Yeah.

820
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,700
I got the smell of bacon in my nose,

821
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,700
But that always happens after i pass out.

822
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,700
Oh, guess what?

823
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,700
Maureen and vicki showed up,

824
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,700
And they were crying.

825
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Really? because of me?

826
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,800
Yeah. They were really worried.

827
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,800
Ever since they thought you were dying,

828
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,300
They've been hangin' all over us.

829
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,500
Wow.

830
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,300
Well, if you want, you can
tell them that i'm still dying.

831
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,200
Really?

832
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,800
Sure. I mean, if it'll
help you guys get a date.

833
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,300
You are the king.

834
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,100
But you guys have to come with
me to the sci-fi convention.

835
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,400
Are you kidding? We were
gonna do that anyway.

836
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,300
Really?

837
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,400
Of course.

838
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Mmm. this is so good.

839
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,900
This is really hittin' the spot.

840
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,400
You know why this is so good?

841
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Because it was made by food scientists.

842
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm gonna go put on some music.

843
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,900
Maybe that'll help get
the monkey off your back.

844
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,300
You're really a good friend, millie.

845
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,300
You really saved me.

846
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,800
I don't know what i would
have done without you.

847
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,700
Oh, this song is the best.

848
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
God.

849
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,100
We used to love mac davis, remember?

850
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,100
We used to watch his show.

851
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,100
Yo yeah.

852
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,100
U used to wish you had a
pillow stuffed with his hair.

853
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,700
Because it was so fluffy.

854
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,700
God, i love mac davis.

855
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,600
You know who else i love?

856
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,600
You.

857
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,600
I love you, millie.

858
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Why aren't we friends anymore?

859
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,100
I thought we were friends.

860
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,600
We are, but just... you know.

861
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
We're not, really.

862
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,600
But we're still the same
people we were when we were 5.

863
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,100
It's just different now.

864
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,600
You're different now.

865
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
You're right.

866
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,100
But i'm not gonna be different anymore.

867
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,600
Ame...

868
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,100
And we're gonna be best friends.

869
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,600
You know what, lindsay?

870
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,600
I feel sorry for you.

871
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,500
Why?

872
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Because tomorrow-

873
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,000
When you're not loaded anymo-

874
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,400
You're not gonna believe in god,

875
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,400
And you're not gonna want
to be my friend anymore.

876
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Millie.

877
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,900
That's not true.

878
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,300
I hope not.

879
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,100
And if there's anything we
can do to make it better,

880
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,600
You know, just let me know.

881
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,600
I think your son could
apologize to bill now.

882
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,600
Consider it done.

883
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,600
What, are you gonna yell
at him from out here?

884
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,600
Come on, come on, come on.

885
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,200
Hey, haverchuck.

886
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,200
Hey, alan.

887
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,900
I knew you wouldn't die.

888
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,900
I can't believe you'd be such
a wuss to die from a peanut.

889
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,200
Aren't you glad i didn't die?

890
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,100
Yeah, i'm glad for my sake.

891
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,100
Think i want to end up
in juvie for killing you?

892
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,100
What are you looking at, dork?

893
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,900
I heard you.

894
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
You care about me. I
heard everything you said.

895
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I dot care about you.

896
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,200
Yeah, you do.

897
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
You think i'm cool.

898
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,700
You want me to pound you?

899
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,400
Do you want to go with us
to the sci-fi convention?

900
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,300
It's this weekend.

901
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
I don't want to hang out with you losers.

902
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,800
Why not? 'Cause you're losers.

903
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,500
You know you want to.

904
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,200
No, i don't.

905
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,800
Yeah, you do.

906
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,300
Come on. It'll be so much fun.

907
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,600
George takai is gonna
be there and everything.

908
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,600
George takai?

909
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,600
Yeah.

910
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
I don't know.

911
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
It'd be kind of weird.

912
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,100
We're all gonna meet at sam's
house at 10:00 on saturday.
