Freaks and Geeks S01E02 Beers and Weirs (VO)

1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:05,839
Lindsay, how would you like to go
buy some new clothes at the mall?

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,799
These old jeans are looking
pretty ragging.

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,676
No thanks, Mom, I like my jeans.

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,845
Dad's the one
who could use some pants.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,346
Who am I to impress?

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:16,182
When it's your house,
you can wear a tuxedo to breakfast.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,393
I called Mrs. Amandala,

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,646
she's gonna stay with you kids
while Daddy and I are in Chicago.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,023
Mom, no!

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,440
We don't need a babysitter,
I can take care of Sam.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,402
I can take care of myself!

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,404
Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,031
I can just see you guys,
eating candy for breakfast

14
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,950
and drawing pictures on the wall.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,786
How old do you think we are, Dad?

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,622
I've been babysitting for the Kellers
for two years already.

17
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,958
Yeah, that's for their kids.

18
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,254
I don't know, maybe they are
a little old for a babysitter.

19
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,339
Maybe they're ready, hon.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,220
Fine. Mrs. Amandala makes the house
smell like an old lady anyway.

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,808
I hear Peter Lemengela
is playing the closing night.

22
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,102
Paul Anka.

23
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,271
Paul Anka...
Can I come?

24
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:07,692
You'd prefer if we listened to that punk
rock music I've been reading about.

25
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,860
You know, those Sex Pistols?
They spit on their audience.

26
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,906
That's terrible.

27
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,159
That's what I wanna do, spend
my hard earned money to be spit on.

28
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,702
That's entertaining.

29
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:19,370
Come on, Dad,

30
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,166
every generation is afraid
of the music that comes from the next.

31
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,460
I'm sure your parents hated Elvis.

32
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:28,088
Elvis didn't expectorate
on his fans.

33
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,381
No, but he died on the toilet.

34
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,175
That's paradise compared to where
those Sex Pistols are gonna end up.

36
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,427
- What's up.
- What's the matter?

37
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,846
John Bonham died.

38
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,724
Yeah, I know, last week.

39
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,146
He's dead.
You know, it's like... he's dead.

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,065
As a result, there's no more...

41
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,942
Led Zeppelin.

42
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,904
Why don't they just
get a new drummer?

43
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,322
What? Are you...

44
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,910
Let's just forget it.

45
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,583
No, what you gotta do is look
for something in the store

46
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,002
that's expensive
but looks really cheap.

47
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,461
Then you switch price tags with
something that is really cheap.

48
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,966
You put the original back on it,
and return it for store credit.

49
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,760
That's how I got this jacket.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,386
Ten bucks, this thing cost me.

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,764
Oh, it's beautiful!

52
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,181
Clearly worth all the effort.

53
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,227
My dad caught a shoplifter once.

54
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,314
He locked him in the store,
and when the cops came...

55
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,819
Well, my dad says shoplifters
cost him a fortune.

56
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,033
If I owned a store,
and caught some little kid shoplifting,

57
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,952
I'd just take 'em out the back,

58
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,080
and then deal with it.

59
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,998
Would you, Mr. Tough Man?

60
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,459
Yeah, I would, Mrs. Tough Man.

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,630
Like that time when John Ergner
kicked your ass, like that?

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,050
Do you mind flapping your lips
somewhere else? You smell.

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,052
Did you guys break up or something?

64
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,054
No, we didn't break up.

65
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,682
I dumped his loser ass.

66
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,643
Is that what happened!

67
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,688
OK, if it makes you feel better.

68
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,818
Does anybody want to come and see
<i>The Wall</i> with me on Saturday night?

69
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,237
I thought I might
try and experiment,

70
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,947
see it straight, once.

71
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,573
Don't do it.

72
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,533
You'll regret it, man. Trust me.

73
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,913
I would, but my parents
are going out of town,

74
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,291
I have to watch my little brother.

75
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,126
Maybe we can all hang out
at your house.

76
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,547
Kegger!

77
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,216
Kegger.

78
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,052
You mean, like a party?

79
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,804
Yeah, right.

80
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,556
Lindsay is too lame to let anyone
enter her precious little house.

81
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,773
Sure!

82
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,902
Why not?
I like parties.

83
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,612
Great.

84
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,949
Who's the too lame one?

85
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,909
Up yours!

86
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,124
OK, guys,
ten bucks each for the keg.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,835
Come on, you too.

88
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,879
No, Lindsay, please.

89
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,589
House drinks free.

90
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,176
Don't worry about anything.

91
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,887
Why does she hang out
with those guys?

92
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,432
I don't know. Why don't you
go over there and ask her?

93
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,392
They're gonna ruin her life.

94
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,479
If you don't care about high school,
you won't get into a good college,

95
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,024
you'll have no future
and you'll wind up dead or in jail.

96
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,525
Really?

97
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,320
Were you asleep
during <i>Scared Straight</i>?

98
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,449
You're in love with Lindsay.

99
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,869
I am not!
What are you talking about?

100
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,705
- Why are you getting so mad?
- I'm not!

101
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,290
Why would you say that?

102
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,309
{\Because }You have your book
in front of your pants.

103
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,378
Shut up. Jerk.

104
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,584
I'm not in love with her.

105
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:24,092
I just care about her
because she's my good friend's sister.

106
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,095
Maybe you should ask yourself
why you don't care.

107
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,472
I care!
Come on, you know I care.

108
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,188
Sam, I'm having a keg party
tomorrow night.

109
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,691
- You are?
- Yes, so you can't tell Mom and Dad.

110
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,402
What if your friends
trash our house?

111
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,739
My friends aren't
gonna trash the house.

112
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:49,158
I'll have {\plenty of }time to clean up
before Mom and Dad get back.

113
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,910
What if Dad finds out?

114
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,204
That's my problem,
don't worry about it.

115
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,831
No, it's not, because Dad will
yell at me for not telling on you.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,501
Are you gonna tell on me?

117
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,090
I guess not. But I'm just...

118
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,884
Thanks Sam!
See you later!

119
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,014
Give me your keys, man.
You're drunk.

120
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,268
I'm not drunk.
Get out of my way, I'm fine.

121
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,728
No, you're not.
And I'm not going to drive with you.

122
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,605
I don't care!

123
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,026
If you try to drive like that,
I'm gonna call the police.

124
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,695
I thought you were my friend!

125
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,822
He is your friend, Daisy.

126
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,784
- Who are you?
- I'm the designated driver.

127
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,245
I made a pledge
not to drink at this party,

128
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,706
so I can help people
like you get home safely.

129
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,793
That's cool.
I should have done that.

130
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,296
The designated driver is pretty hot.

131
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,673
I'd like to get her drunk.

132
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,677
If you drive right now,
you're not only a danger to yourself,

133
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,805
but you're a danger to
everyone else on the road.

134
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,308
You're like a loaded gun.

135
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,811
I didn't wanna hurt anyone.

136
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,646
We know that.

137
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,900
What do you say?
Will you give me your keys?

138
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,111
And... freeze.

139
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,614
Let's hear it for the Sober Students
improv players.

140
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,747
That was a good example
of how to prevent a tragedy.

141
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,416
But there's an even
better way to save lives.

142
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,001
And that's not to drink.

143
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,628
Ken's got the right idea.

144
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:30,092
If other adults drink,
it doesn't mean you have to.

145
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,511
Now, I know what you're thinking.

146
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,764
"Mr. Rosso, you don't understand.

147
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,059
If I don't drink, I won't be cool."

148
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,270
Well, you know what I say to that?

149
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,189
Maybe, if you don't drink,

150
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,566
you <i>will</i> be cool.

151
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,197
And right now, our thespians
Millie, Cindy and Harris,

152
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,657
will show you how you can stay sober

153
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,201
and still be cool.

154
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,620
OK, what I need from you people,

155
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,581
is a kind of party
where drinking might occur.

156
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,875
A sex party!

157
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,964
Alright, I think I heard
someone say "birthday party".

158
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,967
OK, you're at a birthday party.

159
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,843
And... go.

160
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,472
Mary, happy birthday!

161
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,183
Oh, thank you, Bob.

162
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,810
How's it going?

163
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,980
Good. You did a really
nice job decorating here.

164
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,315
You know if anyone here
has any cocaine?

165
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,070
No. Coke does damage to your brain.

166
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,657
I think I can have coke
whenever I want, but...

167
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,785
I can only watch you
open your presents now.

168
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,496
Oh, thank you, Bob.

169
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,790
That's very sweet.

170
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,626
Wanna get out of here?

171
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,920
Sure.

172
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,632
I'm gonna go.

173
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,385
You count to ten, and then come.

174
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,179
- OK?
- This is the best birthday ever.

175
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,518
Come on,
let's go get a glass of pop.

176
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,229
I hope they have orange.

177
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,815
Hey, it's a party, isn't it?

178
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,359
And... freeze.

179
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,570
As you can see,

180
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,656
nothing is more contagious
than good judgement.

181
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,575
Thanks, kids.

182
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,076
Jimmy, lights.

183
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,874
But, if you still think
drinking is cool...

184
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,005
why not ask Jenny Powell
if drinking is cool?

185
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,716
Well, you can't ask her,

186
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,594
she crashed into a phone pole
this winter, driving drunk,

187
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,929
after a New Year's party.

188
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,976
And you can't ask
John Jablowski either.

189
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,897
He died from alcohol poisoning
at a fraternity party.

190
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,693
I love being told not to drink
by a pothead hippie guidance counselor.

191
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,905
There's probably a bar
in the teacher's lounge.

192
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,448
Yeah, probably.

193
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,951
Hey, Strawker,
ten bucks for the keg.

194
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,953
Don't weasel out on me,

195
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,915
or I'll cut that hair off
and I'll sell it.

196
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,587
I hope you don't mind, I invited
my cousin and his friends.

197
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,423
Oh, that's cool.
What grade are they in?

198
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,718
No grade.
They're older.

199
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,056
Cool.

200
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,016
I know.

201
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,812
We gotta do something
about your sister's party.

202
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,106
What's the big deal?
It's just beer.

203
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,316
Yeah, beer at a freak party?

204
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,320
My cousin was at a freak party once,
and someone put angel dust in her drink.

205
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,947
Oh, man...

206
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,283
We gotta go.
To protect Lindsay.

207
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,911
Oh, I can't...

208
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,288
<i>Dallas</i> is on.

209
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,290
What? Bill, <i>Dallas</i> sucks.

210
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,835
You suck. <i>Dallas</i> rules!

211
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:54,171
You're just gonna let Lindsay end up
like one of those pictures?

212
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,965
Fine, I'll go.

213
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,092
But I'm watching <i>Dallas</i> there.

214
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,596
I'm just joking.

215
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,348
I don't watch <i>Dallas</i>.

216
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,355
If the hot water heater makes
that funny noise, call the gas company.

217
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,108
I don't want to come home
to a couple of dead kids.

218
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,194
There's 50 bucks on the dining
room table, that should be enough.

219
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,113
Lindsay, you're in charge of it.

220
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,907
It's not for those <i>Star Wars</i> cards
or those goofy packs.

221
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,410
- Wacky packs.
- Whatever. Don't blow it.

222
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,412
Lindsay, come here, sweetie!

223
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,374
This is dinner for Friday night,

224
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,252
this is lunch and dinner
for Saturday.

225
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:37,381
If you need anything else, Daddy left
50 dollars on the dining room table.

226
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,260
Let's go, I wanna get there
before the welcome mixer.

227
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,221
And turn out the lights when you go out,
I'm not made of money.

228
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,599
Wait!

229
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,518
What is it?

230
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,233
Have a good trip.

231
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,862
Thanks.
We'll be back Sunday night.

232
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,573
- Don't do anything stupid.
- I love you.

233
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,034
Have fun, guys!

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,385
At assembly today,
they did these improvisations

235
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,929
about drinking and driving.

236
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,014
It was pretty funny.

237
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,183
Yeah, I saw, that's why I left.

238
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,311
At assembly today,

239
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,440
they showed these pictures of kids
who died in drunk-driving accidents.

240
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,443
- Did you know any of them?
- No.

241
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,489
One of their moms talked.

242
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,282
She was pretty sad.

243
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,743
It kind of freaked everybody out.

244
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,371
And at assembly today,

245
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,540
they said that if you drink
too much in one night,

246
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,333
you can die of alcohol poisoning.

247
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,377
Sam! You sound like Dad.

248
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,298
I just don't know why you have to
have beer at your party, that's all.

249
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,052
You've never had beer at any of
your other parties and they were fun.

250
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,846
Those were birthday parties, Sam.
We were bowling.

251
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,227
Remember the party where
you had a magician? That was fun.

252
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,647
- Why don't you have a magician?
- We are not having a magician.

253
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,359
Why am I talking to you?
I'm in charge. Leave me alone.

254
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:22,736
Leave <i>me</i> alone!

255
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,074
If F is a differentiable
function of X

256
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,785
and C is a real number, then...

257
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,297
Can I help you, miss?

258
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:44,383
There's an emergency phone call
for Lindsay Weir.

259
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,510
It's her mom.

260
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,929
Linsday, OK.

261
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,516
Come on, let's go.

262
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,313
OK, people, back on me.
The show's over.

263
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,943
- Did they say what's wrong?
- They didn't tell me anything.

264
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,156
Not now, there's some
emergency with my parents!

265
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,078
I know, they want you to
come with them to buy a keg.

266
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,767
- What?
- Thanks a lot, Sarah.

267
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:18,018
No problem.
See you at the party, Nick.

268
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:19,501
It's a cute necklace!

269
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,212
We're cutting.

270
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,467
Daniel is paying his brother 20 bucks
and he's gonna buy us a keg.

271
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,178
They're waiting for us with the car.

272
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,639
Are you OK?

273
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,436
I just... It's that whole
emergency phone call...

274
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:38,646
thing!

275
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,816
Let's go get some beer.

276
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,784
I got it.

277
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,372
Maybe you can call your parents
and tell 'em you fell and hit your head

278
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,957
and have them come home
before the party.

279
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,628
Then what happens when they come
home and see my head is fine?

280
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,673
We have to hit you over the head
and give you a bump.

281
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,384
Like in a Dirty Harry movie?

282
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,303
The bad guy yells to this black guy
so he beat him up?

283
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,681
Then he blames it on Clint.

284
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,516
"It was Callahan!"

285
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,687
No chance.
I'm not gonna let you guys hit me.

286
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,730
Hey, guys...

287
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,484
Whenever my uncle visits,
my mom gives him non-alcoholic beer

288
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,404
so he doesn't get all drunk
and yell at everyone.

289
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,072
What's a non-alcoholic beer?

290
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,034
It's just like beer, but without
the ingredient that makes you drunk.

291
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,119
Alcohol?

292
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,999
That's a great idea.

293
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,628
But we're gonna have to buy
a whole keg of it.

294
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,923
- It's gonna be expensive.
- I don't have any money.

295
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,091
I don't either.

296
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,093
Yes, you do.

297
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:55,139
- Oh, no, no way.
- Why not?

298
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,017
It's my bar-mitzvah money!

299
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,854
I was saving it to go
backpack across Europe.

300
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,939
Come on, this is important.

301
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,068
Everytime you guys have a problem,
wanna dip into my bar-mitzvah money.

302
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,738
It's not like I get
to have another one.

303
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,156
Come on.

304
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,907
For Lindsay.

305
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:17,995
Fine.

306
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,090
Mazeltov!

307
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,417
Shut up.

308
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,465
What if somebody robs this place
while we're in here?

309
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,551
People are always getting shot
in liquor stores.

310
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,803
Do you think they sell yogurt here?

311
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,138
I'm kind of thirsty.

312
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,558
Yeah, Bill, go ask the guy,
maybe he can change your diaper, too.

313
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,226
That was unnecessary!

314
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,190
We're out of Pop Rocks.

315
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,693
A keg of beer, please.

316
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,987
Don't see that happening.

317
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,823
No, we'd like non-alcoholic beer.

318
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,658
Oh, really?

319
00:17:58,204 --> 00:17:59,411
Please?

320
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,829
We really need it.

321
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,290
What for?

322
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,878
We're gonna switch the kegs
at his sister's party.

323
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,968
Righteous!

324
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,519
Bill! Put your jacket on it, so if
someone drives by, they don't see it.

325
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,105
I hope we don't get caught.

326
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,439
Then hurry up.

327
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,067
Bill, push!

328
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,444
I am! I am!

329
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,339
She's in there.
How are we gonna do this?

330
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,801
I'll distract her
while you and Bill switch the keg.

331
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,928
I'm tired of carrying
that stupid keg.

332
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,910
- Why don't you let me distract her?
- I'm distracting her.

333
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,307
Come on, hurry up.

334
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,101
I'm going in.

335
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,238
What are you doing here?

336
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,992
Sam, Bill and I
are just hanging out.

337
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,454
Oh, please, allow me.

338
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,463
Thanks.

339
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,508
Push!

340
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,343
I am pushing.

341
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,636
It's heavy.

342
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,556
Careful, my foot!

343
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,100
It's your foot.
You can watch it too, you know.

344
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,896
So, what kind of music
are you gonna play tonight?

345
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,774
You should play some Chicago,
they have a really hot horn section.

346
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,443
I don't know.

347
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:59,239
I think I'm gonna play
some Zeppelin, Foghat,

348
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,949
maybe some Sabbath...

349
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,620
Friday night, always a good night
for some sabbath!

350
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,373
Cause you know... Friday...

351
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,626
the sabbath...

352
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,669
for the Jews...

353
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,179
- You think Neal's OK in there?
- He's having a great time.

354
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,347
Why?

355
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:26,183
- He's in love with your sister.
- What?

356
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,560
Hey Sam, what was that?

357
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,480
Nothing. Bill fell.

358
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,112
Don't you wanna go play
with those guys?

359
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
No.

360
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,866
I like talking to you.

361
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,917
If Neal marries your sister,
then he'd be your brother-in-law.

362
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,544
And then if you had kids,

363
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,547
Neal would be their Uncle Neal.

364
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,634
And then,
Lindsay's kids would look like Neal.

365
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,177
Bill... Shut up!

366
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,304
He doesn't love Lindsay!

367
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,474
That's not what he told me.

368
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,480
I think Bill's got an ear infection,

369
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,524
it's messing with his equilibrium...

370
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,819
I think you need more M&M's.

371
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,281
- I don't have any more M&M's.
- I saw some right over there.

372
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,746
No, we don't have any more M&M's.
Now, get out of my way!

373
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,622
What are you guys doing...

374
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,585
it's...

375
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,715
No, Bill. It's OK, I...

376
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,467
Neal told me about your...

377
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,264
Help him!
Sam, give him something to wear.

378
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,491
Come in.

379
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,127
So... what do you think?

380
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,796
What do you think we are?

381
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,131
Hippies?

382
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,301
I think it looks great.

383
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,471
It's great.

384
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,349
I like that unicorn.

385
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,643
Well, my house is so boring-looking,

386
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,521
so I wanted to make it
look more party-like.

387
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,067
I'll tell you what will make it
look more party-like.

388
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,485
Point me to the keg.

389
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,029
In the corner.

390
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,281
And I'm in the corner.

391
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,411
Don't be nervous.

392
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,497
This party is gonna be great.

393
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,292
Thanks.

394
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,876
Yeah, so... this is the main room?

395
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,879
Why?

396
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,382
It's probably big enough.

397
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,635
Word's getting around.

398
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,721
So, you mind if
I check out the rest?

399
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,644
People are here.

400
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,522
Alright, it's going down.

401
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,315
You're blocking the TV.

402
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:22,761
What do you think is gonna happen?

403
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:25,529
Hopefully, everybody's gonna drink
a bunch of fake beer,

404
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,532
have to pee a lot and go home
cause they're bored.

405
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,908
This is genius.

406
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,451
It's my idea.

407
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,828
I'm the genius.

408
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,831
Alright, here's the plan.
Bill, you're guarding the keg.

409
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,582
Neal and I will patrol the party.

410
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,626
I'll keep an eye on Lindsay.

411
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,426
I'm the genius.

412
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,431
Come on in.

413
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,355
This beer sucks!

414
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,065
Tastes weird to you?

415
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,775
It's imported.

416
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,111
Nothing's too god for our friends.

417
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,450
Daniel probably bought cheap beer
and kept the extra cash.

418
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,617
Definitely.

419
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,918
So, I think if you look back even,
that song remains the same.

420
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,671
For instance,
he's dressed like a gangster,

421
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,048
and his head got shot off, right?

422
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,469
Now, that multicolor paint and stuff
came out of his neck...

423
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,430
I think what that means is
that he knew,

424
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,724
even then, that he was gonna die.

425
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:36,933
What?

426
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,479
Could you not sit on that, please?

427
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,646
It's glass.

428
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,817
Nah, Neal, you wouldn't want to
trade places with me.

429
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,027
Believe me.

430
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,406
I don't know, I mean, I'm Jewish.
It's no cakewalk either.

431
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,326
I was like,
the school treasure last year,

432
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,036
I didn't even run!

433
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,058
Millie!

434
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,937
I saw the cars out on the front.

435
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,357
Yeah, we're all hanging out...

436
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,944
You missed the pop quiz
in chemistry today.

437
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,946
I did? Really?

438
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,116
Were you skipping out
with your new friends?

439
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,661
Or should I call them
drinking buddies?

440
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,290
Why are you doing this, Lindsay?

441
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,125
You're asking for trouble.

442
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:46,044
Beer, here?

443
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,463
No, thank you.

444
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,007
I prefer to get high on life.

445
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,221
You're that chick
from that thing yesterday!

446
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,849
- Would you give me a ride home?
- Yes, I would.

447
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,435
"Yes, I would!"

448
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,690
Why is it so funny?

449
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,484
I gotta get back to the party.

450
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,986
You wanna stay?

451
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,779
Yes.

452
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,991
And I'm gonna have more fun
than any of you.

453
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:17,702
Sober.

454
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,800
Can I help you?

455
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,219
No doubt.

456
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,764
We're friends of Daniel's.

457
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,975
We're looking for some beer.

458
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,101
Jimmy!

459
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,563
Hey, sweet thing.
Where is your boy?

460
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,273
Hopefully, under a truck.

461
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,275
I dumped his ass.

462
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:52,694
- I know, man.
- That makes you available?

463
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,947
No way, Alvin!

464
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,949
She's mine!

465
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,539
Come on, boys.

466
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,375
Let's go and tear this mother down!

467
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,926
Who are those guys?

468
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,804
They're...

469
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,932
my guests.

470
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,697
Oh, man, I gotta pee!

471
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,701
So you're out of forfeit.

472
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,496
I'm the Lord of quarters!

473
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,879
I've had five beers already,
I'm not even buzzed.

474
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,341
Yeah, man, I don't know what to say.
You're the man.

475
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,843
I haven't had any, and I'm saying,

476
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,304
I'm having more fun than any of you.

477
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,806
Excuse me.

478
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:08,311
Wait a second, man.
Aren't you a Sober Student?

479
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:11,368
I only do that cause it looks good
on my transcript for college.

480
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:12,493
Alright!

481
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,484
Wait, wait... wait til I'm ready.

482
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,614
I wasn't ready!

483
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,037
Hit harder. Harder. Come on!

484
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,164
Beans of steel!

485
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,375
You're tickling me.

486
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,087
Step right up, my big man,
I'm right here.

487
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,048
That was cool, man.

488
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,428
You're sure we put out
the right keg?

489
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,591
It's working better than we wanted.
They think they're drunk.

490
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:47,441
- You think so?
- Look at them. They're wasted.

491
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,062
That's the placebo effect
working for you, my friend.

492
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,605
Look at that guy.

493
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,151
What if they trash the place
cause they think they're drunk?

494
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,360
They won't.

495
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,029
I don't think.

496
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,489
This could be bad.

497
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,118
What are you doing?

498
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,454
I'm just looking at all the stuff.

499
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,749
How old are you here?

500
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,919
I was... younger.

501
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,046
I was really geeky.

502
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,843
You win all that, don't you?

503
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,178
I guess.

504
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,015
I've been meaning to put that
in the basement.

505
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,019
First place of algebra division?

506
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,897
Right, you're one of those...

507
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,023
Mathletes.

508
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,360
Yeah, I know, it's... stupid.

509
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,403
But I don't do that anymore.

510
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,073
Why do you say stupid?

511
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,661
You look pretty happy there.

512
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,417
If I ever won a blue ribbon,

513
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,253
I'd be so pumped.

514
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,423
I mean...

515
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,468
I wouldn't wear it around
or nothing, but...

516
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,807
It's cool.

517
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,144
Thanks.

518
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,227
That's that chick from
the assembly, man!

519
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,939
<i>Jesus is just over right with me</i>

520
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:58,541
<i>I don't care what they may say</i>

521
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,295
<i>I don't care what they may do</i>

522
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,344
<i>Jesus is just all right</i>

523
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,845
Let's do it.

524
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,473
Let's go.

525
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,356
Hi, Ken.

526
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,569
Do you guys like my sister?

527
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,321
Sure.

528
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,201
Then, can you make sure
she doesn't get too much trouble?

529
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,581
Thanks.

530
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,584
Which one is your sister?

531
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,711
She's not that chick
who's singing, is she?

532
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,394
Careful. Careful, JR, it's a trap!

533
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:06,736
- Hey, you wanna go?
- What?

534
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,237
I said, do you wanna go?

535
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,615
I always wanna go, grandpa.

536
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:14,660
You wanna go?

537
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,539
Let's go, fat boy!

538
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,416
That was stupid, old man.

539
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,377
Alright, cool out, man. Not here.

540
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,509
Alright, are we cool?

541
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,762
Whatever.

542
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,940
I didn't know you were coming.

543
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,650
Yeah, Neal invited me.

544
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,238
This is my cousin Beth.
She's visiting from Boca Raton.

545
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,532
So, where's the beer?

546
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,951
It's... it's over there.

547
00:33:57,956 --> 00:34:00,455
Don't worry,
I'm the designated driver!

548
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,461
Good God!

549
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,130
Why did Neal invite her?

550
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,591
Now she's gonna see all
the dumb stuff in my house.

551
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,303
His plan is to distract you
so he can hit on your sister.

552
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,474
Oh, man, he's so dead.
What am I gonna say to Cindy?

553
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,309
Don't say anything.

554
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,643
Be dominant.

555
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,313
It's all about dominance.

556
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,024
I saw this monkey show on PBS...

557
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,528
If you talk to her first,
it's a sign of weakness.

558
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,239
And she will not pick you
to be her mate.

559
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,741
Are you drunk?

560
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,409
I think so, yes I am.

561
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,872
Go into my room, lock the door,
and don't drink any more.

562
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,832
That's very dominant.

563
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,713
Have you guys seen Daniel?

564
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,977
Thanks for the dance.

565
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,655
Watch it, Romeo, you're on my hair!

566
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,323
Hey, we're busy here.

567
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,117
Sorry.

568
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,582
Don't worry. We threw
your teddy bears on the floor.

569
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,672
Daniel and Kim
are making out on my bed.

570
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,510
I thought they broke up.

571
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,013
Yeah, I don't know,
they break up, like,

572
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,764
every week, so...

573
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:31,480
You don't look like
you're having very much fun.

574
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,065
Well, I'm not.

575
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:37,445
This is a party.

576
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,489
OK? So, will you please just...

577
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,950
try to relax and have a good time?

578
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,331
And when it's over,
I'll stay and help you clean up.

579
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:49,375
Thanks.

580
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,168
I'm so glad you're here.

581
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,545
Yeah, me too.

582
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,634
What are you doing?

583
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,760
Nothing.

584
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,095
Ew, stop!

585
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,516
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

586
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:09,977
Oh, my God. I'm really really sorry.

587
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,606
- What are you doing?
- I'm really sorry.

588
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,609
I'm really wasted right now,
you know?

589
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,445
John Bonham died!

590
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,593
Lindsay? Are you OK?

591
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,637
Yeah, I'm fine.

592
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,472
I'll be out in a minute.

593
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,017
Sometimes,
it helps to talk to someone.

594
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,769
I'm too drunk to talk.

595
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,646
No, that's OK.

596
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,690
I speak drunk.

597
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,318
I'm so wasted and I hate my life.

598
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,613
You shouldn't hate your life.

599
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,448
Why not? It sucks.

600
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,450
No, it doesn't.

601
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,703
You're a beautiful young girl,

602
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,705
the world is your oyster.

603
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,832
Please, leave me alone.

604
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,501
Why?

605
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,215
Because you're Sam's sister.

606
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,970
I'm so wasted!

607
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,682
I wish I'd never had this party.

608
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,769
That's alright, it's OK.

609
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,271
It'll be OK.

610
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,071
Sam, right?

611
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,451
Have you seen your sister around,
anywhere?

612
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,453
No, not recently.

613
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,917
If you see her, could you tell her
that I'm really sorry?

614
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,961
Did you break something?

615
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,967
Just forget it, OK?

616
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,099
Oh, God, what is going on out there?

617
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,853
I didn't wanna have this party.
I had it because Daniel wanted it,

618
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,981
and next thing I know,
he's making out on my bed with Kim.

619
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,441
Typical.

620
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,071
All my new friends think
I'm some goody-two-shoes

621
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,573
and all my old friends think
I'm throwing my life away.

622
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,408
How am I supposed to do?

623
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,996
Can I speak freely?

624
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,292
That Daniel guy?
You can do better.

625
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,421
And hey, at least,
people showed up to your party.

626
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,843
When I was in the 6th grade,
my mom threw me a surprise party,

627
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,970
you know what the surprise was?

628
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,806
Nobody showed up.

629
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,558
Except Bill and Sam.

630
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,981
Whoever's in there,
we need five bucks from everyone.

631
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,025
We're gonna get another keg.

632
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,485
Oh, my God.

633
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,239
Forget it, man,
we just found fifty bucks!

634
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,283
You've gotta do something.

635
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,203
I can't. If I go out there
and kick everybody out,

636
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,955
I'm gonna look so lame.

637
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,165
No. Why don't you call the police?

638
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:21,335
That's what my dad always does.
Pretend to be an angry neighbour.

639
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,337
So they can come in
and find the keg?

640
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,047
Not without a warrant.

641
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,425
No, no, I can't.

642
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,553
God, I can't handle any of this!

643
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:34,598
Of course you can, you're Lindsay Weir.
You can do anything.

644
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,976
You're smart and pretty,

645
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,146
you don't take any crap,
and you're the perfect girl,

646
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,731
and I've been in love with you
since I was five years-old.

647
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,281
Maybe I should go.

648
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,124
Hi, police please. Thank you.

649
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,086
Yes, hello. Police?

650
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:08,174
Yes, hi. There is a very loud and
annoying party going on next door.

651
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,758
It's been going on forever.

652
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:13,637
I'm very tired, I'm old, I need my rest.
I gotta work tomorrow.

653
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,683
It's 13, Gnome Drive.

654
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,643
Thank you. Please hurry up.

655
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,103
I'm so tired.

656
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,149
Done.

657
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,695
I'd say that party has a life
expectancy of five minutes.

658
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,491
Thanks, Neal.

659
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,928
Hi Cindy, I didn't see you there.

660
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,306
So, how's it going?

661
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,516
Pretty good.

662
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,977
So, where are all the cute guys?

663
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:04,979
What...

664
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,775
the bus hasn't arrived yet?

665
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,867
Oh, my God, the police are here!

666
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:19,370
Come on, everybody out!

667
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,997
Do you want Lindsay
to get in trouble?

668
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,291
I'm on parole.

669
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,795
Let's get out of here
before they search for the beer.

670
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,757
You don't have to run,
Ken, it's fake beer.

671
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,967
I know.

672
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,427
I won 87 bucks playing quarters.

673
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,304
This party ruled!

674
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,147
Hey, Lindsay, great party.

675
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,149
We had a great time.

676
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,610
Glad you had a good time.

677
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,612
I knew you had it in you.

678
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,491
Let's get out of here.

679
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,786
You were a wonderful hostess.

680
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,705
Have us back again soon.

681
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,674
I should've hired a magician.

682
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,559
Hey, Bill, get up.

683
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,896
That's how the drummer
from Led Zeppelin died.

684
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,025
Did he?

685
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,404
Good night, Lindsay.
