2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,729
(narrator) October, 1940.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,443
Winston Churchill
to the defeated French people:

4
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,561
(Churchill) Good night, then.

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:15,394
Sleep to gather strength
for the morning.

6
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:17,659
For the morning will come.

7
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:21,303
Brightly will it shine
on the brave and true,

8
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:25,634
kindly on all who suffer for the cause.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,705
Vive la France!

10
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:32,044
Allons, bonne nuit.

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,917
Dormez bien.

12
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:39,755
Rassemblez vos forces pour l'aube,
car l'aube viendra.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,969
(narrator) Now, at last,
after nearly four years,

14
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:47,465
that dawn was about to break.

15
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,148
The invasion of the Continent
was at hand.

16
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,071
(narrator) Dieppe, 1942.

17
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:58,314
The first major attempt to land
Allied troops in France was a disaster.

18
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:03,116
Almost half the assaulting force
of 7,000 was lost

19
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:06,263
trying to storm
the port's powerful defences.

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,243
Many troops never got
beyond the beaches.

21
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:16,276
Hundreds of others
walked straight into captivity.

22
00:02:16,355 --> 00:02:20,610
(man) We learnt so much from Dieppe
that I think it was quite invaluable

23
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,756
as far as the final invasion
was concerned.

24
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:27,632
I think everything that could go wrong
went wrong with that operation.

25
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,928
The result of it was that, by the end,

26
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,031
one was appallingly impressed

27
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:37,062
by the dangers and the hazards

28
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,285
of any kind of combined operation

29
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:40,746
on that kind of scale.

30
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,085
We'd never attempted to do a combined
operation on that scale before.

31
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,269
And, really, nobody knew how to do it.

32
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:51,148
There are three conditions necessary
for a successful invasion.

33
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:55,633
First, obviously, to get ashore
against no matter what opposition.

34
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:57,470
Secondly, having got ashore,

35
00:02:57,593 --> 00:03:00,812
to stay ashore no matter
what the weather conditions.

36
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:02,344
Thirdly, to stop the enemy

37
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:05,913
from building up his forces
against you quicker than you can,

38
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,678
otherwise he'll throw you
back into the sea.

39
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,124
(narrator) Given these essentials,

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,163
the two likeliest landing areas
were the Pas-de-Calais,

41
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,423
across the English Channel
at its narrowest point,

42
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:19,259
and Normandy to the west.

43
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:22,869
The choice was the first task
of Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan

44
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,398
and his special Allied staff,
known as COSSAC,

45
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,346
appointed in 1943
to frame the initial invasion plans.

46
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:35,258
Tentative invasion planning
had gone on since 1941.

47
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,025
COSSAC's choice in the end
was Normandy,

48
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:43,122
a 50-mile stretch of shore
just east of the Cherbourg peninsula.

49
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:48,340
Normandy had several advantages
over the Pas-de-Calais.

50
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:53,245
Though farther from England,
it was less strongly fortified.

51
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,700
Its beaches, mostly without cliffs

52
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:58,581
and with a minimum
of clay and depressions,

53
00:03:58,665 --> 00:04:01,731
were more suited
to the landing of troops and supplies

54
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:04,145
and to rapid deployment inland.

55
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:08,712
And it was close to Cherbourg
and the Brittany ports.

56
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:16,150
At Quebec, in August, 1943,

57
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:21,756
COSSAC's outline plan for invasion
was approved by Churchill and Roosevelt.

58
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:25,316
The cross-Channel assault
was now, at last, to become reality.

59
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:30,575
Its codename - Overlord.
Its target date - May, 1944.

60
00:04:34,303 --> 00:04:37,477
The springboard for invasion
would be England.

61
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:41,393
Britons, displaced once by
Hitler's bombs, were on the move again.

62
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:45,655
This time, to make way
for the great invasion armies.

63
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,368
For many, this meant upheaval,
financial loss, personal problems.

64
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,712
But the cause was momentous -

65
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:55,549
the long-awaited second front.

66
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:58,272
(Little Brown Jug)

67
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,267
Already from the United States,

68
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:17,527
the packed troop ships
were streaming across the Atlantic.

69
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,540
By now, the number of Americans
in Britain

70
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,728
approached one and a half million,

71
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:47,611
and London's streets
displayed every known Allied uniform.

72
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:54,434
In this great floating barracks,
morale was all-important.

73
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:00,954
We've had some grand trips.

74
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,756
But it's been wonderful.
I'm very thrilled to be here.

75
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,053
I have nothing new to report
from the States.

76
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,092
You know, the States -
that's where Churchill lives. I...

77
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:15,653
But he really travels.
Boy, he's been around.

78
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:19,713
He's been to Casablanca
more than Humphrey Bogart.

79
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,133
(narrator) On a different stage,
another American,

80
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:25,087
General Dwight David Eisenhower,

81
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:29,194
named by Roosevelt
Overlord's supreme commander.

82
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:34,902
Eisenhower had commanded the Allied
North African expedition in 1942.

83
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:38,709
As well as generalship,
he would need the finesse of a diplomat

84
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:43,576
because he was now
to lead a huge multinational force.

85
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,912
You always have problems,
but General Eisenhower,

86
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:51,054
being the supreme Allied commander,
he had this wonderful knack

87
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,777
of getting along with people
of all different nationalities.

88
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:57,271
He didn't think of himself
as an American,

89
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:02,755
he didn't think of himself as British
or French or Polish or anything.

90
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,287
He just thought what was best
for the whole Allied effort.

91
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:10,313
(narrator) Best known
of Ike's commanders-to-be

92
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,927
was General Montgomery,
victor of Alamein.

93
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,493
Famous for his plain speaking
to his troops,

94
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:19,754
Monty now urged the war workers
to maximum effort.

95
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,542
Why is it...
why is it that today the tide has turned

96
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:29,798
and we are beating the Germans

97
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:34,215
and coming towards
the final climax of the war?

98
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:40,231
I'll tell you why it is. It's because
we've got far the best equipment

99
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:45,108
and we've got far the best men.
And women too. Far the best.

100
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:55,576
If the battle front and the home front
really get down to it this year,

101
00:07:55,663 --> 00:07:58,227
we can get the thing almost finished,

102
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:03,334
we can get it so tight,
that next year we just topple it over.

103
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,474
Goodbye to you all.
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,313
(narrator) Monty's optimism was
infectious, but Britain, like America,

105
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:13,608
was already working at full pressure
with or without music.

106
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,488
("Calling All Workers" by Eric Coates)

107
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,023
The massive effort was straining
towards the final Overlord targets.

108
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,288
Aircraft - 13,000.

109
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,704
Tanks and vehicles - 17,000.

110
00:08:36,787 --> 00:08:41,304
Parachutes - 90,000.
Bombs and shells in millions.

111
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:21,009
And Overlord would also need
4,000 assault and landing craft.

112
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:23,309
But, at first,
they simply weren't there.

113
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,495
(Mountbatten) The absolutely
crucial thing for an invasion

114
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:28,571
is to get the troops across the water.

115
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,833
For that you want
landing ships and craft.

116
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:33,282
They had to be built
in large quantities,

117
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,825
at a time when
all ship-building facilities

118
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,586
were required
to fight the Battle of the Atlantic.

119
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:43,833
(narrator) By the spring of 1944,
the landing craft were built

120
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,826
and ready for intensive,
constantly rehearsed, invasion training

121
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:50,517
in tough battle conditions.

122
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:13,297
Many Overlord troops
would invade from the air.

123
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:15,411
More than 20,000 were earmarked

124
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,513
for the biggest airborne operation
of the war so far.

125
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,073
Some assault troops
would have to scale cliffs.

126
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:30,941
Training in rough Channel waters
could be as deadly as the real thing.

127
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:43,031
Across those waters,
Von Rundstedt and Rommel

128
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:46,592
had divided views
on how to meet the invasion.

129
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,236
Von Rundstedt, the commander-in-chief,

130
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:53,924
wanted a mobile reserve
kept back to fight inland.

131
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:56,876
Rommel, commander
of the anti-invasion forces,

132
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,257
wanted to repel the assault
on the beaches.

133
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:06,050
But Hitler's Atlantic Wall, a chain
of steel-and-concrete fortifications

134
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,958
planned to stretch from Denmark
to the Spanish border, was incomplete.

135
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:18,207
Rommel made belated efforts
to fill the gaps

136
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:21,082
by laying lines of formidable
underwater obstacles,

137
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,381
including millions of hidden mines.

138
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:39,883
To overcome these defences, the Allies
evolved various ingenious contraptions.

139
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:43,640
To help tanks over sand
and mud and concrete,

140
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:46,669
the Swiss Roll and the Carpet Layer.

141
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:05,203
The Panjandrum, supposed to destroy
beach obstacles, was not successful.

142
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:28,786
Pluto - PipeLines Under The Ocean -

143
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:31,553
a flexible pipeline miles long.

144
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:38,998
Pluto would minimise the hazards of
transporting petrol to France by tanker.

145
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:45,712
It could carry over a million tons of
fuel daily to the continent, underwater.

146
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:50,200
Shore pumping stations
were innocently camouflaged.

147
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,645
Still more remarkable was Mulberry,

148
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:01,514
two artificial harbours
each the size of Dover harbour.

149
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:05,928
All the components
had to be towed across the Channel.

150
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:09,260
(Mountbatten) The problem
of staying ashore was a difficult one,

151
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,713
because of weather conditions
in the Channel.

152
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,752
You couldn't expect
more than three or four consecutive days

153
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:17,395
of weather fine enough
to supply across the beaches.

154
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,042
So, obviously, we thought
we'd have to take a port.

155
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,544
That's why we tried Dieppe.

156
00:13:21,622 --> 00:13:24,262
But we found in Dieppe
that we couldn't capture a port

157
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:26,522
without using such heavy bombardment

158
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:29,172
as would destroy the facilities
we wanted to use.

159
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:33,205
So the obvious thing was to bring
our own artificial harbour with us,

160
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:38,030
which we called Mulberry, and which
everybody thought was absolutely crazy.

161
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,059
(narrator) Eisenhower met constantly
with his commanders

162
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,639
to coordinate strategy.

163
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:47,624
His deputy, Air Chief Marshal Tedder,
Admiral Ramsay,

164
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,999
Generals Bradley and Montgomery,

165
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:52,377
and Air Marshal Leigh-Mallory.

166
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,683
A major preoccupation was the weather
that could be expected

167
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,716
for the start of Overlord.

168
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,666
(man) General Eisenhower
made it clear quite early

169
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,434
that he wanted to build up confidence,

170
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,609
not only in what we could do
as forecasters,

171
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:11,720
and I in particular for him personally,

172
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,897
but he wanted to know what reliance

173
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:19,270
he could put on the very words I used

174
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,538
and the tone of voice I used.

175
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:25,684
He could tell,
even before I presented the forecast,

176
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:29,788
almost each time
what I was going to say.

177
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:33,386
He used my face, I think,
as a kind of hall barometer.

178
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:37,994
(narrator) Deception plans
also occupied Supreme Command.

179
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:41,982
Among the most elaborate were fake
preparations for an attack on Norway,

180
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,051
to be launched from Scotland.

181
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,853
And, more credibly, for a main assault
on the Pas-de-Calais

182
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,768
from the southeast ports.

183
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:51,915
Also crucial was the bombing plan

184
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:56,562
to cut German communications
to invasion areas - interdiction.

185
00:14:56,643 --> 00:15:00,822
What one had to do was to
interfere with the communications.

186
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,661
Again, I think this was
a lesson learned from Dieppe.

187
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,575
That we hadn't realised at Dieppe

188
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,562
how absolutely essential it was

189
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:13,936
to have an absolutely overwhelming
weight of firepower

190
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:17,741
both from the air and from the land.
The result of this was,

191
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:21,687
and I think this caused a good deal
of difficulties at high level,

192
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,098
was that Air Marshal Harris,

193
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:28,250
who still thought
that he could win the war on his own,

194
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,734
had to be persuaded
to use his heavy bombers

195
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:36,731
to attack the German
road and rail communications.

196
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:39,677
And I think he resisted very strongly.

197
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:43,395
He thought it was really a diversion
from the whole point of the war.

198
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:48,655
But he was made to do it,
and it was done enormously effectively.

199
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:59,624
(narrator) Spring 1944
saw widespread air attacks

200
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:02,890
on road and rail targets
and on airfields.

201
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:13,627
At the same time, all over the South
of England, camps were springing up,

202
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:18,458
ready for the tens of thousands
of invasion troops.

203
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:22,761
The staging areas for Overlord

204
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:25,711
were spread the length
of England's south coast,

205
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:32,386
round the ports of Falmouth, Dartmouth,
Weymouth, Portsmouth and Newhaven.

206
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,277
All was now prepared
for the great move south.

207
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:50,115
The lines were cleared
for invasion traffic.

208
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:22,524
Amid the rash of military notices,
one telltale sign stood out.

209
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:08,560
The vast concentration
reached its Channel rendezvous.

210
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,245
Some wit claimed
that only the barrage balloons

211
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,200
floating overhead
kept Britain from sinking.

212
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,752
Late May, 1944.

213
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:27,664
The assault troops were sealed within
their marshalling areas, ready to go.

214
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,852
Now - a pause.

215
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:33,303
(man #1) Fear feeds on delay, of course.

216
00:18:33,386 --> 00:18:36,682
And we didn't really know
just when we were going.

217
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:42,015
(man #2) Shot crap, played cards,
lost all our money.

218
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:44,276
Some people won money.
I lost all mine.

219
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:48,035
Didn't do me any good. I had no place
to spend it when I got on the beach.

220
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:53,556
(narrator) Rations, currency,
ammunition, kit.

221
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:57,547
Packing and repacking,
checking equipment.

222
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:00,424
The exact invasion date
was not yet revealed.

223
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,912
Most men still did not know
the beaches they were going to attack.

224
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:08,483
Only officers and NCOs
had been told the precise landing areas.

225
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,397
100 miles across the Channel
in Normandy,

226
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:14,654
these landing areas
comprised five beaches.

227
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:19,066
From west to east, Utah and Omaha
waited for the Americans.

228
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:23,789
Gold, Juno and Sword
for the British and Canadians.

229
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,478
But all now depended on the weather.

230
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:30,885
(Stagg) On the evening
of that Wednesday, 31 May,

231
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,836
even then I advised General Eisenhower

232
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,255
that conditions
for the oncoming weekend,

233
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,169
especially over Sunday night
and Monday morning,

234
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,086
the crucial times for Overlord,

235
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:47,107
were going to be stormy,
but we went on with the meetings.

236
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:50,789
I had to go before General Eisenhower
and his commanders,

237
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:55,471
who met for nothing else twice a day
during those fateful days -

238
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:57,466
1, 2 and 3 June.

239
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:03,879
(narrator) On 3 June, despite Supreme
Command's concern about the weather,

240
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,987
embarkation went ahead.

241
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:08,435
The troops knew nothing
of a possible hitch,

242
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:12,626
though some men thought
it was just another exercise.

243
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:18,102
(man #3) When we first went aboard,
we had no knowledge of the actual day.

244
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,329
We had been aboard ship so many times.

245
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:24,174
For six months,
we were constantly on and off ships.

246
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:32,302
(narrator) In the ports and harbours
of England's Channel coast,

247
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:36,519
the vast and complex process
of loading and embarkation went on.

248
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,633
In the Channel, the worsening weather

249
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:42,969
now faced the supreme commander
with a grave crisis.

250
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:45,656
(Stagg) It was a time
of dreadful tension.

251
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:50,065
We all knew that there could be
only one day's deferment.

252
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,250
If there had to be another day,

253
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:56,009
then all the landing craft
would need to return to base,

254
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,961
so it couldn't be done
on a second day's postponement.

255
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,653
It would have to be deferred
for a whole fortnight

256
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:04,567
until the next tides were right.

257
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:08,672
And at that time, our charts
were so black in the Atlantic

258
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:10,965
that there didn't seem
to be any prospect

259
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:14,118
of getting this operation going at all.

260
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:17,493
(man #4) We didn't know how long
it was going to be postponed.

261
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:21,327
Because the weather looked so bad,
we wondered if it would ever clear up,

262
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,744
and whether the whole thing
would be called off

263
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,282
and we would be taken back off the ship.

264
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,456
(narrator) Troops primed for action.

265
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:35,518
An armada ready to sail.

266
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,050
And, then, anticlimax.

267
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,693
(man #1) We were then told

268
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:46,645
that the invasion had been put back
for at least 24 hours.

269
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:49,947
Of course,
this increased our apprehension.

270
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:53,476
And we used to have
these long conversations with each other

271
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:56,165
about the kind of things
that might happen,

272
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:59,613
whether we'd ever
get off the beach alive.

273
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:05,676
(narrator) Routine continued
under a cloud of uncertainty.

274
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:08,439
All the troops could do was wait.

275
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,065
("Don 't Get Around Much Anymore")

276
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:13,185
As the hours passed, it seemed that only
a miracle could get Overlord going.

277
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,865
(Stagg) Then, mercifully,
the almost unbelievable happened

278
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,481
about midday on that Sunday.

279
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,469
We spotted that there might be
an interlude between two depressions.

280
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:29,109
By the evening, my own confidence

281
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:35,095
in the forecast for this quieter period

282
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:38,772
had so increased from
further reports that had come in,

283
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:42,695
that I convinced General Eisenhower
and his commanders

284
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:46,679
that it would indeed arrive
later on Monday,

285
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:50,166
after the storm of Sunday night
and Monday morning.

286
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:52,970
It would indeed arrive late on Monday,

287
00:23:53,053 --> 00:23:57,341
continue through Tuesday
and probably into Wednesday.

288
00:23:57,427 --> 00:24:01,453
The next morning, early on 5 June,

289
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:04,979
they met again to confirm this decision.

290
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:08,508
When I could tell them
that we were even more confident

291
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,619
than we had been the previous night

292
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:16,183
that the fine, or improved, quieter
interlude would indeed come along,

293
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:17,942
the joy on the faces

294
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:21,322
of the supreme commander
and his commanders

295
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:24,469
after the deep gloom
of the preceding days,

296
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:28,765
was a marvel to behold.

297
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:35,020
I remember it very well.
4:15am on the morning of 5 June.

298
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,895
I wasn't at the meeting,
but I drove him there,

299
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:43,794
and he came out and he really looked
so serious as he got in the car.

300
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:48,247
And he said, "D-day is on.
Nothing can stop us now."

301
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:54,621
(narrator) It was an historic decision.

302
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,378
Overlord's further postponement
might have meant total cancellation.

303
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:04,635
(man #2) The troop commander
read a message from General Eisenhower.

304
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:08,008
"God speed" and all that sort of stuff.

305
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,544
(man #1) We read this
great message from Monty

306
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:14,221
about "good hunting in the fields
of Europe" and all this rubbish.

307
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:19,475
Naturally, being a soldier, we thought
what a load of old cods it was.

308
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,854
(narrator) Never had Channel waters
seen such a mighty force.

309
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:26,655
Heading for France
were some 6,500 vessels of all types,

310
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,409
marshalled and escorted
by the Allied navies.

311
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:35,086
Glider fleets were waiting,
wearing their D-day markings.

312
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:38,161
The first division would go in
by glider and parachute,

313
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,154
dropping behind the invasion beaches.

314
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:44,866
Their losses were expected to be
as high as seven out of every ten men,

315
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:47,365
as Eisenhower well knew.

316
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:50,891
(Summersby)
They all had blackened faces.

317
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:54,037
They were going to jump Nazi-occupied
Europe in a short time.

318
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:57,189
You kept thinking, "I wonder
how many are going to come back."

319
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,987
Later, General Eisenhower said,

320
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:02,791
"You know, Kay, it is very hard
to look a soldier in the face,

321
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:06,349
knowing you might be
sending him to his death."

322
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:17,592
(narrator) In the last hours of 5 June,
the airborne troops set out for France.

323
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:21,397
(man #5) Butterflies in your stomach.
You wonder what you're doing here.

324
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:24,038
"Why am I here? Why did I volunteer?
Am I crazy?"

325
00:26:24,121 --> 00:26:26,151
Everything is going through your mind.

326
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:29,602
You're worried.
You know it's coming up soon.

327
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:37,808
I was afraid.
I was 19, and I was afraid.

328
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:40,763
(narrator) Many men
were afraid that night.

329
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:47,323
They were storming Hitler's vaunted
Festung Europa - Fortress Europe.

330
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:50,282
Across the water the Germans waited,

331
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:54,190
not knowing when or where
the blow would fall.

332
00:26:58,071 --> 00:26:59,981
D-day.

333
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,325
Ahead, the Normandy beaches.

334
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:06,700
After four years,
this was the road back.

335
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:13,103
(man #1) It was a fantastic sight to see
so many ships of all shapes and sizes,

336
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:15,363
and all going one way.

337
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:22,268
(man #4) Quite a few boys wrote letters
and gave it to friends

338
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:26,145
so that they'd take them home
or see that their parents got them.

339
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,487
It was their farewell letter.

340
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,483
(man #6) The sea was rough.

341
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:34,169
They'd put their gas capes
over them to keep dry,

342
00:27:34,246 --> 00:27:38,502
and it made them sick
cos they didn't get enough fresh air.

343
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:44,134
(man #3) I had several men get seasick,
and they upchucked,

344
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,676
and they had to use their helmets
to catch it in.

345
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,247
We'd throw them over the side.

346
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:50,736
They were washed out
and given back to the men.

347
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:53,956
(man #1) One felt absolutely dreadful,
physically,

348
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:57,336
just wishing to God
that the whole thing would be over,

349
00:27:57,494 --> 00:27:59,828
or at least
that we could get onto dry land.

350
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,599
(narrator) At 5:30 the armada
was off the French coast.

351
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:19,781
After a massive air assault,
a devastating naval bombardment.

352
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:32,663
(man #7) As far as your eye could see,

353
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:35,541
you were surrounded
with craft of some sort,

354
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:39,296
and it was just sending out
shell after shell out of its turrets.

355
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:45,666
(narrator) The Germans
were surprised and stupefied,

356
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:48,119
but some batteries soon recovered.

357
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:57,979
(man #8) It was far just more
than sickness.

358
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:00,319
Men loaded their pants
and everything else.

359
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,698
I had rarely seen that before.

360
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:05,540
I know the men were sick,
many of them were very sick.

361
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:17,399
(man #3) By this time the waves

362
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:22,153
were pitching the craft up and down,
I would say, six or seven feet.

363
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:25,715
(man #4) A lot of boys
got caught in the nets.

364
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:30,865
We had quite a time getting them loose.
Their legs got caught in there.

365
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,191
(man #2) Smoke, smoke. There were
a lot of shells coming over us.

366
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:39,074
All smoke, black smoke,
just like a volcano from afar

367
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,257
that one would see in the movies.

368
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,576
(narrator) The run-in to the beaches -

369
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:09,027
6:30 for the Americans,
7:30 for the British and Canadians.

370
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:13,515
After all the waiting,
the training, the toughening,

371
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,586
this was it.

372
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,844
(man #9) We were the first attackers,
we were the initial wave.

373
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:23,574
There's always great losses
in an initial wave,

374
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:28,637
so each of us had to be given at least
30 minutes to live on the beach.

375
00:30:42,832 --> 00:30:46,465
(narrator) Protected by total
air supremacy, the first assault waves

376
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,612
raced and scrambled
for the five invasion beaches.

377
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:54,215
(man #1) The soldiers were so glad
to get off the landing craft,

378
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:56,212
to escape the seasickness,

379
00:30:56,335 --> 00:31:00,317
that they were just ready
to go anywhere by that time.

380
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,033
(narrator) For the men
of the five assault divisions,

381
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:13,666
those first hours of D-day
were hours of death, fear, courage,

382
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:17,504
of plans gone wrong,
of rapid improvisation.

383
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,106
(man #10) We expected a clear beach

384
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:24,984
with an indication
as to exactly how we should proceed.

385
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:27,828
We were even told
the military police would greet us.

386
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:32,162
It became quite obvious that the beach
was in a considerable state of chaos.

387
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:36,224
On the run-in, craft ran into
underwater obstacles and into mines.

388
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:39,636
One of them went over a mine.
The front half of the craft,

389
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:42,559
with the personnel in it,
went straight up in the air.

390
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:46,587
The sea was quite a different colour
when that craft blew up.

391
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:53,953
(narrator) Some units
landed in the wrong area.

392
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:56,715
Some met unexpectedly light resistance,

393
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:59,783
others were cut down
almost on the shoreline.

394
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:02,273
The Americans got the worst of it.

395
00:32:04,197 --> 00:32:06,073
(man #6) I didn't think I'd make it.

396
00:32:06,153 --> 00:32:10,180
I didn't think there was any way
to get across that beach and survive.

397
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:13,204
I really thought it was my last day.

398
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:23,523
(man #4) The first man, the sergeant,

399
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,056
raised up to see how far
we had to go to reach land,

400
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:29,543
and fell back dead.

401
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,227
(man #3) We had been told
that the air force would come in

402
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:35,685
with the heavy bombers

403
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:39,713
and would crater the beaches for us
to give us a place to hide.

404
00:32:39,797 --> 00:32:42,252
And this did not take place.

405
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,036
(man #8) It was bloody awful.
Every time I got up,

406
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:52,522
I thought that it was pure terror
that was making my knees buckle,

407
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:55,293
until I finally hit the shale
and I realised

408
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:58,284
that I had about 100lbs of sand
in those pockets.

409
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:08,826
I remember taking my trench knife
and pressing it in people's backs

410
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:10,211
to see if they were alive.

411
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:12,509
If they were, I'd kick 'em
or say, "Let's go."

412
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:14,658
It dawned on me
after I checked two or three

413
00:33:14,782 --> 00:33:18,808
that some were alive but they wouldn't
turn around. Just absolute terror.

414
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:32,036
(narrator) On the three British
and Canadian beaches, opposition varied.

415
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:36,639
On Gold, while one unit was hammering
at a strongpoint for eight hours,

416
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,595
another was off the beach in 40 minutes.

417
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,200
On Juno, the Canadians suffered
heavy losses but advanced.

418
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,077
On Sword, the fighting
was bloody but brief.

419
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:53,442
Many defenders emerged
from their bunkers to surrender.

420
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:58,045
And on Utah, by the end of the day,
the Americans were doing well.

421
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:01,350
They had taken prisoners,
established a firm foothold,

422
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:04,113
driven five miles inland.

423
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:10,090
But on Omaha,
the Americans ran into difficulties -

424
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:13,166
rough seas, strong defences

425
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:15,962
and a newly arrived
German fighting division.

426
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,874
(man #11) From where I was,
it seemed a failure.

427
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:26,280
(man #3) At that time there were
so many people on the beach

428
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:29,540
you could literally walk on the bodies
from one end to the other,

429
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,765
either the dead or the wounded.

430
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:34,649
(man #6) I saw people laying out there
with no head,

431
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:36,910
and some with arms blown off.

432
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,439
Some of my friends.
It was pretty sickening.

433
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,147
(narrator) At Omaha it took all day,
with grievous losses,

434
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:49,841
to gain a beachhead a mile deep.

435
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:54,900
(man #11) It was the most
heartrending experience that I ever had.

436
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:58,311
I hope I never have another one like it.

437
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:04,147
Look back and see the remains of
a crack battalion strewn over the beach.

438
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:08,483
And men floating in the water, face-up.

439
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:11,203
(man #3) Perhaps it was better
that we were green,

440
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:13,970
because if I'd have known then
what I know now,

441
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:16,766
I'd have got on that boat
and went back to England.

442
00:35:22,373 --> 00:35:27,043
(man #4) A day of continuous thinking
thoughts of home.

443
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,808
A day of prayer.

444
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:34,871
And, without a doubt,
the longest day of my life.

445
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:44,315
You feel that you're...
Well, you've accomplished something

446
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:49,303
that you didn't think you would probably
end up being around after it was done.

447
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,897
I think we were proud in some way
that we'd done it

448
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:57,889
and that the army
we'd been in for so long,

449
00:35:57,973 --> 00:36:03,417
and with all sorts of experiences
of how they could bungle things,

450
00:36:03,535 --> 00:36:07,255
had actually managed this invasion.

451
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:11,588
Oh, we feel very happy. Very happy.

452
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:16,495
Ah, the best day of my life. I think so.

453
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:19,300
La plus grande joie.
How you say in English?

454
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,591
The biggest joys in our life.

455
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,231
And we admire those courageous soldiers.

456
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,876
They came from so far away
to liberate us.

457
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:35,257
And we gave to them
everything we could give them.

458
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,666
Cider and so.

459
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:40,159
Calvados, also.

460
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:45,190
And our... our friendship.

461
00:36:46,193 --> 00:36:47,841
And...

462
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:52,250
It was very... emotional.

463
00:36:52,331 --> 00:36:53,705
And...

464
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:57,007
We, we feel... we became free.

465
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,843
(narrator) By midnight,
130,000 troops had got ashore.

466
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,682
Footholds had been gained
on all five beaches.

467
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,051
Casualties: 9,000.

468
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:16,184
D-plus-one saw the first laying
of the Mulberry harbours.

469
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:20,447
The early build-up of supplies
was vital for the success of Overlord.

470
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,021
It was essential to pour in

471
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,820
the reinforcements of men and material
faster than the enemy.

472
00:37:25,936 --> 00:37:27,616
And pour in they did.

473
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:41,349
By D-plus-seven,
miles of vehicles were ashore,

474
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:44,380
stretching inland from the beaches
bumper to bumper.

475
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:49,134
At some points,
traffic jams extended 15 miles.

476
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,632
At this critical phase,
Mulberry's two harbours -

477
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,310
Arromanches for the British,
Saint-Laurent for the Americans -

478
00:37:57,392 --> 00:38:01,112
were the only ports
available to the Allies.

479
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,522
In the four days before 18 June,

480
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:08,434
the average daily landings were
troops: nearly 35,000,

481
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:13,187
vehicles: 5,000, stores: 25,000 tons.

482
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:22,514
If a single device invented for Overlord
produced results, it was Mulberry.

483
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,074
Only the insistence of Eisenhower
and the king himself

484
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:33,023
had stopped Churchill
from coming over on D-day.

485
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:37,433
Now, within days of the landing, he was
there to see how things were going.

486
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,089
The top commanders were aware

487
00:38:39,168 --> 00:38:41,535
that the Overlord timetable
was falling behind.

488
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:45,027
They were anxious now
about phase two of the operation -

489
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,067
the battle of the bridgehead.

490
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:07,130
The Allies were fighting bitterly

491
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:11,809
for space to deploy the mass of men
and materials assembling behind them.

492
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,647
It was a slow, dogged advance

493
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:17,289
against an enemy
who had recovered strongly.

494
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:28,840
The close-hedged bocage countryside
was difficult for the Allied tanks.

495
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:34,321
By 10 June, the Allies were opposed
by only three panzer divisions.

496
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:36,394
The other seven available divisions

497
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,236
had not been released
by the German high command.

498
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,650
Despite this, the invaders
were little more than inching forward.

499
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:57,040
By 12 June, the five beachheads
had been linked

500
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,748
to give a lodgement 60 miles long
and up to 20 miles deep.

501
00:40:02,873 --> 00:40:05,207
The ancient town of Bayeux

502
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,661
now welcomed the leader
of the Free French, General de Gaulle,

503
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:13,489
setting foot in France
for the first time since 1940.

504
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,707
19 June, and the unpredictable
English Channel struck again.

505
00:40:25,852 --> 00:40:29,299
For four days a raging storm,
the worst in June for over 40 years,

506
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,370
battered Mulberry almost to destruction.

507
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,247
Vessels dragged anchor.
Vital equipment foundered.

508
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:42,260
Unloading was drastically curtailed.
Tonnage was down by four fifths.

509
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:46,413
Frantic efforts were made
to repair the damage,

510
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,396
for the disruption had threatened
the very continuance of Overlord.

511
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,163
Soon the traffic was rolling again.

512
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,722
The Overlord lifeline was restored.

513
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,512
A prime objective
to supplement the Mulberry harbours

514
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:07,586
was the port of Cherbourg
in the American sector.

515
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,884
By 19 June the Americans
had cut off the Cherbourg peninsula

516
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:13,256
and were driving north towards the port.

517
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:16,671
Cherbourg was strongly fortified.

518
00:41:16,758 --> 00:41:21,122
The Germans hoped to delay the Allies
by staging a long resistance there.

519
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:23,269
But by the 21st, after tough fighting,

520
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:26,302
the Americans
reached the port's outskirts.

521
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,996
On the 26th, the garrison surrendered,

522
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,101
leaving only a few strongpoints
to be mopped up.

523
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:49,172
Prisoners streamed out,
among them the garrison commander.

524
00:41:56,615 --> 00:42:01,329
Cherbourg was the first major objective
to be captured in the campaign.

525
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,622
25,000 prisoners
were taken in the Cherbourg area.

526
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:17,555
Some French women
were losing their German lovers.

527
00:42:22,663 --> 00:42:26,798
Right across the front from Cherbourg
was the town of Caen.

528
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:30,635
Caen was the centre for German troops
moving to the beachhead.

529
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,701
Montgomery had been
attacking towards it since D-day.

530
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:42,299
Now at last, in early July,
he prepared for the assault.

531
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,638
First the bombers went in.

532
00:42:45,718 --> 00:42:50,355
On 18 July over 2,000
heavy and medium bombers hit Caen

533
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:55,958
with nearly 8,000 tons of high explosive
and fragmentation bombs.

534
00:42:59,183 --> 00:43:02,052
It was the heaviest
and most concentrated air attack

535
00:43:02,175 --> 00:43:04,968
in support of ground forces
ever attempted.

536
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:40,228
Caen was christened "the crucible".

537
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:45,784
When it fell, the troops entered
a bomb-cratered town choked with rubble.

538
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,233
Half of it was destroyed,

539
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:55,071
several thousand of its inhabitants
killed or wounded.

540
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:11,488
For the people of Caen,
it was liberation - at a grievous price.

541
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:25,802
Now, after seven grinding weeks,
the start of the break-out.

542
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,640
The Americans broke through
at Avranches.

543
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,625
They fanned out west and south
into Brittany and east to Mortain,

544
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:35,501
and swept up to Argentan.

545
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:39,340
From the north,
the British and Canadians

546
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:43,099
edged south towards Falaise,
in an attempt to close the neck of a bag

547
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:46,662
now threatening to trap
the German forces.

548
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:52,157
There were very great
practical difficulties

549
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:55,562
in this closing
of the Falaise Gap quickly.

550
00:44:55,649 --> 00:44:57,678
And it was difficult for the one side,

551
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:59,368
British, Canadian, Polish,

552
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,781
to appreciate the point of view

553
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:03,968
of the other side, the Americans.

554
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,345
We were coming down from the north,

555
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:13,710
launched from the congested, bombed
and difficult areas of the Caen sector.

556
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:19,697
Secondly, the Germans facing us
on that north side of the corridor

557
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,457
they were trying to keep open
for their escape,

558
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,362
were in areas where
they had been fighting against us

559
00:45:27,451 --> 00:45:29,480
for two months or more.

560
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,434
The Americans were coming up
to meet us from the south

561
00:45:33,512 --> 00:45:35,497
in more open country

562
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:39,762
and against much less prepared
and organised German resistance.

563
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:46,476
(narrator) Falaise, one of the bloodiest
battlegrounds of the campaign.

564
00:45:46,593 --> 00:45:48,655
This was Montgomery's next target.

565
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:03,276
Hundreds of rocket-firing Typhoons

566
00:46:03,357 --> 00:46:06,074
strafed enemy communications
and transport,

567
00:46:06,157 --> 00:46:08,918
leaving a trail of burning vehicles.

568
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,275
On 6 August, the Canadians
were on the outskirts of Falaise.

569
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,728
They entered the town on the 16th.

570
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:48,427
By now only a narrow corridor separated
the Canadian and American spearheads.

571
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,028
The remnants of the German 7th army,
some 15 fighting divisions,

572
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:57,714
were pressed into a tiny sack.

573
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,781
At last the trap closed.

574
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:05,416
10,000 died. 50,000 were captured.

575
00:47:06,807 --> 00:47:12,558
For the Germans, Falaise was one of
the worst disasters since Stalingrad.

576
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:22,220
The toll of prisoners rubbed in
the magnitude of the defeat.

577
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:25,327
But 40,000 German troops escaped,

578
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:28,325
and this caused friction
between the Allies.

579
00:47:30,553 --> 00:47:33,390
(American man) Had the British
and Canadian forces

580
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:35,192
been able to move faster,

581
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:38,446
we might have trapped many more
Germans in the Falaise pocket.

582
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:40,671
Very little of their equipment got out,

583
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:42,857
but quite a number of the Germans

584
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,966
were able to escape
toward the Seine river.

585
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:49,346
And this was too bad.

586
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:52,220
I think perhaps the basic reason

587
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:57,519
was that Britain had been in the war
for much longer than we

588
00:47:57,598 --> 00:47:59,889
and had taken very heavy casualties.

589
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:02,775
And the Americans were fresh,

590
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:05,952
and they had had
practically no casualties in comparison.

591
00:48:06,037 --> 00:48:08,721
So while we were anxious
to drive forward

592
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:11,483
and were not too concerned
about the casualties

593
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,700
as long as we could get our objectives,

594
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:17,234
it was natural, I think,
that the British and Canadian forces

595
00:48:17,316 --> 00:48:20,338
did it in a more orderly, pacing way.

596
00:48:20,423 --> 00:48:23,489
And perhaps this was part
of Monty's characteristic,

597
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,325
and one of his drawbacks.

598
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,087
In other words,
that he never did quite drive

599
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:31,962
the way the American commanders did.

600
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:35,647
This was part of his nature, I guess.
He was a more cautious man,

601
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:38,904
combined with the fact
that he couldn't afford the casualties

602
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,598
that we could take
if it was necessary to take them.

603
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,911
(narrator) Falaise earned
the name of "the killing ground".

604
00:48:53,913 --> 00:48:57,710
The carnage and destruction
were appalling.

605
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:06,532
Eisenhower visited the battlefield
and wrote:

606
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,822
"It was literally possible to walk
for hundreds of yards at a time,

607
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:15,347
stepping on nothing
but dead and decaying flesh."

608
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:44,661
Paris.

609
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:48,648
The main Allied drive
was going to bypass the French capital.

610
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,873
The Parisians,
under Nazi domination for four years,

611
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:53,525
sensed liberation at last.

612
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,474
As the Germans began to pull out,

613
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,848
the Resistance forces emerged
into the open to take revenge.

614
00:50:05,764 --> 00:50:10,172
Remembering the oppression,
indignities, humiliations,

615
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:13,465
Parisians gave vent
to long-stored hatred.

616
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,527
In 1940 they had seen Paris fall
without a shot.

617
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:23,782
Now they made up for it

618
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:28,159
in a burst of violence
not seen in Paris throughout the war.

619
00:50:29,165 --> 00:50:31,194
Parisians had one thought -

620
00:50:31,274 --> 00:50:35,988
reprisal against the enemy,
the settlement of old scores.

621
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:50,217
Morning had come.
