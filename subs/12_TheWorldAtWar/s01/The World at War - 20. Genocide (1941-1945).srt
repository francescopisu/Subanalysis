2
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:27,743
(translator) What we went through
will be difficult to understand

3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,782
even for our contemporaries,

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,968
and much more difficult for generations

5
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,191
that have no personal experience
from those days.

6
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:36,258
(narrator) The office of the National
Socialist Party in Munich in 1929.

7
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:40,866
The keen young clerk who now
comes forward has already been noticed.

8
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:44,547
He's marked for promotion,
for high responsibility.

9
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,117
He is Heinrich Himmler.

10
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:52,837
Himmler it is who refines
the philosophy of Nazism,

11
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:56,511
its ideas on politics and on race.

12
00:01:56,598 --> 00:02:00,886
Hitler has appointed him
Reichsführer of the SS.

13
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:03,503
(translator) When I wanted to sign up,

14
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,721
the man in charge asked me, "Were
you a soldier?" I said, "Yes, indeed."

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,866
"In the First World War?"
"Yes, indeed."

16
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,280
"Do you have awards for bravery?"

17
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:16,537
"Yes, indeed."
"What do you have?"

18
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:19,154
Then I said,
"Iron Cross, First and Second Class,

19
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:21,872
and I served in the
Hessian Lifeguard Regiment."

20
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:27,247
Then he said, "Well, just as there was
an elite guard in the Kaiser's time,

21
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:32,803
there is an elite guard now in the
new movement, and that is the SS."

22
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:36,640
"You should join the SS."

23
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,589
So I allowed myself to be persuaded

24
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:44,931
and thereby, if you like,
I came by fate to the SS

25
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,499
to be Himmler's adjutant.

26
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,281
(narrator) Himmler's dream
for his elite guard

27
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:59,043
had roots in the fabled past,

28
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:02,925
in the culture of an older,
Aryan Germany.

29
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,053
When the Nazis came to power in 1933,

30
00:03:12,171 --> 00:03:14,778
he could put his ideas into practice.

31
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:18,336
(translator) Himmler had set out
to achieve a dream.

32
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,555
He would inspire a new awakening of the
Germanic race within the German people.

33
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,415
(narrator) Youth would achieve
the dream.

34
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:41,161
Youth had the nerve and the strength
that would be needed.

35
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:54,173
Fresh air, exercise, good food,

36
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:57,243
to build blood and bone and marrow.

37
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:04,879
There were no limits
to what healthy youth could do.

38
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,513
And the dream
had a pseudoscientific base -

39
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:14,273
Neo-Darwinism,
propagated in films like this.

40
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:16,806
"Only the fittest survive."

41
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,480
"The weak go under."

42
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:27,664
That, after all, was the law of nature.

43
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:32,914
Farmers knew it perfectly well.

44
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:36,481
Horses were bred for pace
or for the plough.

45
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:40,738
Why not pedigree humans, too?

46
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:52,520
It was time to develop a new race,
a better one - a race of supermen.

47
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,587
There was no harm in that.

48
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:58,001
(translator) We must see how we
could return to a more natural law,

49
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:01,000
but only ever through
positive racial thought -

50
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,450
how one can improve something
and breed it.

51
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,471
Never with the thought -
it never occurred to us -

52
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:13,773
that we might arrogantly
talk about exterminating anybody

53
00:05:13,854 --> 00:05:16,876
who didn't happen to have been born
with a white skin,

54
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:22,024
or who was culturally inferior to us
or was undesirable.

55
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,771
(narrator) The SS -
the strongest, the purest, the fiercest.

56
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:32,452
They would do more than survive.

57
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:38,516
With Himmler at their head, they would
create a racially superior Europe.

58
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:45,116
(translator) The SS
was based on the Jesuit order,

59
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:49,374
which had been founded as
the elite guard of the Catholic Church.

60
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,483
And Himmler had taken much from this -

61
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:54,662
the hierarchy,
the strict selection and leadership,

62
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:56,962
and the punishments.

63
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:06,062
(narrator) Himmler himself
exacts the oath of obedience unto death.

64
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:14,040
(translator) They were conditioned
to see themselves as the sons of light,

65
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,491
that they were engaged in a struggle
against powers of darkness,

66
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:21,860
and that it was their duty to feel they
were at all times on duty for the nation

67
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:26,048
and, in a wider sense,
for the new order in Europe.

68
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:32,566
(narrator) "Arbeit Macht Frei."

69
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:38,584
"Work sets you free" on the gates
of Dachau, a model concentration camp.

70
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:42,850
The SS were Hitler's instrument of
terror in the creation of the new order.

71
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,919
It was only logical
that they should run the camps.

72
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,586
Their first prisoners
were dissidents of the Nazi state -

73
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:56,660
political and religious,
as well as racial.

74
00:06:57,545 --> 00:07:00,415
The SS schooled themselves in brutality,

75
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:03,985
systematically reducing their victims
to total subservience,

76
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,750
depriving them of individuality.

77
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,087
No names.

78
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,580
Numbers.

79
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:20,098
September 1935. The Nuremberg Laws.

80
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:25,885
In the Reichstag, Göring spelled out the
purpose of the Reich Citizenship Act,

81
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:30,030
and the Act for the Protection
of German Blood and German Honour.

82
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:33,289
Pure must not mix with impure.

83
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:38,398
From now on, intermarriage was forbidden
and sex declared illegal

84
00:07:38,477 --> 00:07:42,274
between pure Aryan and impure Jew.

85
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:47,483
Appealing to feelings and beliefs deep-
rooted in European Christian culture,

86
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:51,087
Nazi propaganda pilloried the dirty Jew.

87
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:56,085
Dishonest, scheming, money-lending
capitalist and subversive communist,

88
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:59,795
verminous, unclean, racially inferior:

89
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:02,643
"Jews are not wanted here".

90
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:04,784
But for leaders
seeking to unite a people,

91
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,241
they were mighty useful scapegoats
to unite against.

92
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,497
In schools, the Jew-boys
stood by the blackboard

93
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,834
as their classmates
pointed out the difference.

94
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:20,437
German schoolchildren were taught to
despise Jewish culture as soft and evil,

95
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:24,154
to be proud of their own strength,
their own purity.

96
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:31,067
From all over Germany,
the young converge on Landsberg,

97
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,948
the castle where, as a prisoner,

98
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:36,901
Hitler had first set out his theory
of a dominant Aryan race.

99
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,548
(men sing Nazi hymn)

100
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,663
Hitler had dreamed of a youth
as fierce as animals,

101
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:57,954
with Christian tenderness and other
degenerate soft mutations cleansed,

102
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,457
burned out of them.

103
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:03,517
Now that youth
was growing up to manhood.

104
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,505
November 1938.

105
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:11,879
The synagogues burned on Crystal Night.

106
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:23,425
The morning after, Jewish males
were marched off to concentration camps.

107
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:26,915
The Jews were isolated, friendless.

108
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:29,490
It was time to get out, if they could.

109
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,540
Not many countries
opened their doors to the Jews.

110
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,303
In Germany, too, bureaucratic obstacles.

111
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:45,140
Emigrants paid stiff charges
when they obtained permissions to leave

112
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:48,475
from state officials
such as Adolf Eichmann.

113
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,162
(translator) I asked Eichmann,

114
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:54,542
"Why don't you make it easier
for people who want to get out?"

115
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:58,496
"You want to get the Jews out,
they want to leave of their own accord."

116
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:00,755
Eichmann organised it.

117
00:10:01,988 --> 00:10:04,551
And they actually did it
as I had envisaged it.

118
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,576
There was a representative
from the passport office,

119
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,946
one from the finance authorities,

120
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:17,481
one from the shipping offices,
and transport representatives.

121
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:21,359
And this man, this poor Jewish man
who now wanted to emigrate,

122
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,390
could make the rounds in two hours

123
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,420
and could get all his confirmations
and could get out.

124
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,817
And, as I said - I really must say it -
Eichmann said to me once:

125
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:39,692
"You were actually the inventor of the
Central Office for Jewish Emigration."

126
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,904
(narrator) January 1939.

127
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,170
Hitler threatens a new solution
to the Jewish problem.

128
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,239
If world Jewry drags Germany
into another war,

129
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,417
that will be the end of the Jews
in Europe.

130
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,856
September 1939.

131
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:09,580
Germany attacks Poland.

132
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:20,317
The victorious armies parade
through Warsaw.

133
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,651
Poland will be colonised. The population
are not Aryans, they're Slavs and Jews.

134
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,397
(translator) I remember in front,

135
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,931
there was a German band
with musical instruments.

136
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,303
For me, it was very nice.

137
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:40,300
I was happy.

138
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,916
I even remember that I clapped.

139
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:49,851
(narrator) German soldiers, aided by
some Poles, beat up Jews in the streets.

140
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,317
Nazi rule in Poland
is based at once on ruthless terror.

141
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:10,418
Any who resist, object, answer back,
risk instant execution.

142
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:16,592
There are public hangings
by the thousand.

143
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:30,055
The whole of Poland is on the move
to be resettled on a racial basis -

144
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,470
those of German origin to Germany,

145
00:12:32,557 --> 00:12:35,274
the Poles themselves
to designated areas,

146
00:12:35,357 --> 00:12:38,958
a workforce without rights
in their own country.

147
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,597
At the bottom of the heap, the Jews.

148
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:46,634
By order, they will wear
the Star of David at all times.

149
00:12:46,713 --> 00:12:49,702
There are heavy penalties
for not doing so.

150
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:57,982
Wearing it, they're easily identified.

151
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,316
"The Jews started the war."

152
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,931
"Now let them clear up the mess."

153
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,517
German newsreel cameras
could show people back home

154
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:18,932
that Jews at last were being made
to do an honest day's work

155
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:21,773
to earn their daily bread.

156
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,949
(translator) My mother,
may her soul rest in peace,

157
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,974
asked me to go to the bakery
and stand there the whole night

158
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:32,591
to get a loaf of bread

159
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,576
so that there would be something to eat
at home the next day.

160
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:42,911
When I arrived, there were already
masses of people standing in line.

161
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:48,281
Among us, there were little children -
non-Jews, Poles - running around.

162
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,498
They pointed at each and every person,

163
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:55,800
"That's a Jew. That's a Jew.
Das Jude. Das Jude. Das Jude."

164
00:13:55,878 --> 00:14:00,363
So that these people would be
taken out of line and not get bread.

165
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,358
My turn came.

166
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:06,883
I turned around and saw that the boy
was a friend with whom I played.

167
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:09,573
I said to him in Polish,
"What are you doing?"

168
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,832
His answer was,
"I'm not your friend.

169
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:15,132
You're a Jew. I don't know you."

170
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,467
(narrator) In 1940,
Germany struck west.

171
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:22,111
The SS went too.

172
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:31,588
Here again, a brutal terror.

173
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,071
Less so, however,
than in eastern Europe.

174
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:39,948
Many in the west were Aryans too.

175
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,475
In Poland, in 1940 and '41,

176
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,618
Jews were ordered
into recreated medieval ghettos.

177
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,111
(translator) We took a small cart.
I, with my father,

178
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:54,877
built a small cart and we began to move.

179
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:58,632
Thousands and thousands, tens
of thousands of people, were walking,

180
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:03,658
taking their belongings with them, some
on their heads, their backs, shoulders.

181
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,106
There were children,
old people, babies, all of them,

182
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:09,331
Iike the exile of the peoples,

183
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:12,249
the exile from Egypt.

184
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:26,747
(narrator) The ghettos were closed off
behind wire and long, high walls.

185
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,044
In Warsaw, a road divided the ghetto
in two

186
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,687
with a bridge over it
for the Jews to cross by.

187
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:41,829
(female translator) There were
only two water pits in the ghetto.

188
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,979
The ghetto was small.

189
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:49,193
When they brought us into the ghetto,
they put three families into one room.

190
00:15:51,654 --> 00:15:56,171
In one room, three families
with children. We never slept.

191
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:11,562
(narrator) Starvation rations.

192
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:17,690
Harsh punishments for smuggling food.

193
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,769
For resistance or attempts to escape,

194
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:35,036
public execution.

195
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,171
June 1941.

196
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,665
Germany attacks Russia.

197
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,002
SS shock troops in the first wave.

198
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,641
Another racial war, more resettlement,

199
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:09,979
mass deportations, forced emigrations.

200
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:14,320
War against subhumans,
against Slavs and against Jews.

201
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,963
Millions of Jews.

202
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:21,715
(translator) We found a round figure
of three million Jews in Poland,

203
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:24,793
then immediately after that
came the Russian campaign

204
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,085
and we found another
five million Jews in Russia.

205
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,575
How on earth should we manage
to emigrate this eight million

206
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:34,875
by using these long and tiresome
official methods?

207
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:39,478
Now, with the war, we were cut off.
We had no way out.

208
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:42,893
(narrator) To be rid of so many Jews...

209
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:48,421
only one alternative left:
kill them all.

210
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:51,525
The job was begun
by SS execution squads,

211
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,596
Einsatzgruppen.

212
00:17:53,682 --> 00:17:55,176
(gunshot)

213
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,119
(translator) They're shooting.

214
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,408
People are already lying dead.

215
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,633
My daughter was in my arms
the whole time.

216
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,251
Somehow, I found the strength
to carry her.

217
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:15,310
She was so close to me that
I couldn't undress. She wouldn't let me.

218
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:21,647
She said, "Let's run away. They're
killing us. Why do we just stand here?"

219
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,899
"Why do people stand and not run away?
Why are they standing?"

220
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:27,090
I said to her...
I could not really speak.

221
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,619
I think I said,
"Where are we going to run to?"

222
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:35,032
Some people did start to escape,
but they didn't let them.

223
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:41,666
There were many Germans guarding us.
There were many Germans.

224
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:45,698
Not only Germans, they even
got non-Jews from the towns together

225
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:48,107
to guard that we shouldn't escape.

226
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,485
There were some sort of policemen there.

227
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,591
So we undressed.
There was no alternative.

228
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:07,136
There were about 500 people altogether.

229
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,326
Our turn came.

230
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:13,003
I came up and saw how my father went,

231
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:16,270
how my mother is shot,

232
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:20,261
how my sisters are shot.

233
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,472
My sister was very pretty -
absolutely beautiful.

234
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:29,198
The German looked into her eyes
and she pleaded with him to let her go:

235
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,879
"Don't kill me. Just let me live."

236
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:36,639
Nothing helped. She was shot.

237
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,383
Then I, with my daughter in my arms,
came up.

238
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:48,720
He told me to put her down.
I wanted to, but she wouldn't let me.

239
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:53,824
She hid her head so as not to see
what was being done with her.

240
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:58,544
He forcibly, as far as I can remember,
took her, stood her up.

241
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:02,917
He shot, or didn't shoot.

242
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,716
I neither saw nor heard.

243
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,904
Then he shot me.

244
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:11,472
I stood there and heard a shot.

245
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:14,161
It didn't touch me.

246
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:16,344
Then again, a shot.

247
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:18,411
I fell.

248
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,131
I am lying in the pit

249
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:25,781
and I feel that I do feel something.

250
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:30,773
I didn't believe - I couldn't believe -
that I'm alive.

251
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,720
I was lying in a pit of blood,

252
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,744
a pit full of blood.

253
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:44,695
This is how I lay the whole night,
under corpses.

254
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,804
(narrator) In August 1941,

255
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:51,795
Himmler visited
a concentration centre near Minsk.

256
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:05,910
It was crowded with Jews,
Russian prisoners of war

257
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,400
and others who were to die.

258
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:13,076
The SS Reichsführer asked to see
for himself how the killing was done.

259
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,763
(translator) And there,
an open grave had been dug.

260
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:22,674
They had to jump into this
and lie face downwards.

261
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:25,927
And sometimes, when one or two rows
had already been shot,

262
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:29,494
they had to lie on the people
who'd been shot

263
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:33,487
and then they were shot
from the edge of the grave.

264
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:40,552
And Himmler had never seen
dead people before,

265
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:44,459
and, in his curiosity, he stood right up
at the edge of this open grave -

266
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:48,142
a sort of triangular hole -
and was looking in.

267
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:53,286
While he was looking in,
Himmler had the deserved bad luck

268
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:56,311
that from one or other of those
who'd been shot in the head,

269
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:58,769
he got a splash of brains on his coat,

270
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,797
and I think it also splashed
onto his face.

271
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:06,366
And he went very green and pale.

272
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,814
He wasn't actually sick,

273
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:13,848
but he was heaving
and turned around and swayed.

274
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:18,988
And then I had to jump forward
and hold him steady,

275
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:22,395
and then I led him away
from the grave.

276
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:38,165
(gunshot)

277
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:56,578
(gunshot)

278
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:05,905
(translator) After the shooting,

279
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,272
Himmler gathered
the shooting commanders.

280
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:16,108
Standing up in his car so he'd be higher
and be able to see the whole unit,

281
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:18,097
he made a speech.

282
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:22,547
He could not relieve them of this duty.
He could not spare them.

283
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:27,073
In the interests of the Reich -
in this planned thousand-year Reich -

284
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,717
in its first decisive great war
after the takeover of power,

285
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:32,560
they must do their duty.

286
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:48,826
(narrator) But shooting was messy,
distressing, inefficient.

287
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,587
So vast an undertaking
required careful planning.

288
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,239
At Wannsee in January 1942,

289
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:58,994
Himmler's deputy, Heydrich,
convened a conference.

290
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:02,753
Senior civil servants attended
from various departments of state.

291
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:06,742
There were representatives of the
ministries of justice and of transport.

292
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:10,851
Formal minutes were kept,
and lists of Jews, country by country -

293
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,956
in Poland, over two million,
in Norway, 1300,

294
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,566
England, 330,000,

295
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,782
Russia, five million.

296
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:22,967
Grand total: over 11 million.

297
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:27,882
Eichmann, with his experience
in transportation,

298
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:30,024
was appointed permanent administrator

299
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:33,668
for this final solution
of the Jewish problem.

300
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:39,538
It had been decided that all the Jews
in Europe were to be gassed.

301
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,070
All Occupied Europe
had a concentration-camp system

302
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:49,130
based on the model camp, Dachau.

303
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:51,817
The camps were not only
an instrument of terror,

304
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,890
they were an important factor
in war production,

305
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:58,144
each with its cluster of labour camps
attached.

306
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,714
Now, they were also to be the means
of the Final Solution.

307
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:06,472
In the occupied east,
new camps were specially built

308
00:25:06,554 --> 00:25:09,696
and old ones
equipped with new industrial capacity.

309
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:13,378
They were to be machines
to kill human beings by the million,

310
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:17,601
utilise the by-products,
dispose of the waste.

311
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,509
The camps were sited on railway routes
to facilitate transportation.

312
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,148
Eichmann chartered rolling stock
from the state railways.

313
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:30,718
The biggest camp was built astride the
main railway line from Cracow to Vienna,

314
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,279
in the outskirts of the Polish town
of Oswiecim -

315
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,047
Auschwitz.

316
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:42,259
In summer 1942, Himmler visited
Auschwitz to inspect progress,

317
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:45,979
to see for himself
how things were getting on.

318
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:49,088
Work was under way.

319
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:51,934
Manufacturers' tenders
had been called for, choices made.

320
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:53,693
Plans and architects' drawings

321
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:57,913
for the new combined gas chambers
and crematoriums were ready,

322
00:25:57,997 --> 00:26:03,977
with their carefully designed chimneys
and specially patented furnaces.

323
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:20,431
Outside, construction workers -
slave labourers -

324
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:22,697
were striving to keep to their schedules

325
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,457
in the warm summer weather.

326
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:32,248
The gassing would be done
with poisoned pellets

327
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:34,894
developed from a commercial pesticide,
Zyklon B.

328
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,886
The pellets were shaken
through a roof grille.

329
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,112
Exposed to the air,
they gave off cyanide gas.

330
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:46,973
In the occupied territories,
the roundups began.

331
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:07,459
In some countries - this is Holland -
no stampede.

332
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:11,453
The Jews gathered for resettlement
in orderly fashion,

333
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:14,946
the order of their going
worked out by their community leaders.

334
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:18,901
Behind it all, the SS and the Gestapo.

335
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,538
Jews everywhere were told -
and they were ready to believe -

336
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:27,450
they were being transported
for resettlement.

337
00:27:27,917 --> 00:27:32,357
In the starving ghettos of the east,
those who volunteered to go got bread.

338
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:37,768
To escape starvation, they willingly
paid railway fares for the journey.

339
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:50,501
Bewildered, under armed guard,
they walked to the station.

340
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:54,379
The cattle trucks were waiting.

341
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:58,065
There were soldiers on the platform.

342
00:27:58,146 --> 00:28:01,058
They climbed aboard.

343
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:05,279
(translator) The minute we got in, the
minute they closed it on us with a bolt,

344
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:07,725
terrible cries began inside

345
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:11,108
in Polish, Yiddish, German -

346
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,174
pleading, requests:

347
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,206
"There's no air. We're suffocating."

348
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:19,357
"Suffocating. Suffocating."

349
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,457
Here suddenly you had a hell on wheels,

350
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,414
and people suddenly stopped
to be preoccupied

351
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:29,707
either with the past or with the future,

352
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:32,511
but with surviving the journey.

353
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,106
(translator) The first to faint were
children, women, old men and women.

354
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,987
They all fell down like flies,
exactly like flies.

355
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,505
Father was standing next to me.

356
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,656
All of a sudden, I see that
he is falling. He has collapsed.

357
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:54,916
I cried, "Father, Father!"

358
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,925
Then I found a piece of wood
on the floor of the wagon.

359
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,566
I got up and began to beat
with the piece of wood.

360
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:14,020
It was a club or something.

361
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,391
I began to beat the people who were
standing around me in the wagon

362
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:24,491
so that they would make room for Father,
so that Father could get up.

363
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:27,902
I remember that I didn't care
about the suffering of others,

364
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:29,636
their cries, their threats,

365
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:32,082
only that Father should get up.

366
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:46,133
We had read the name of Auschwitz
on the label on the trucks -

367
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,462
in the trucks or the wagons. Trucks.

368
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:56,332
But nobody of us knew
what Auschwitz meant.

369
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:06,380
(man) I could see two rows
of barbed wire

370
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:08,647
which were obviously electrical.

371
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:15,402
And then I saw a row of people
with carbines

372
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,731
and a row of dogs -
very disciplined dogs.

373
00:30:18,856 --> 00:30:22,304
And I was more amused
than uneasy.

374
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:26,527
I didn't think they would shoot me
because I couldn't see a reason.

375
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:33,200
(translator) The car was opened.
They undid the bolt.

376
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,343
The first moment it was opened,
there was a sudden gust of air.

377
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:42,974
It was good. We began to
throw out the dead bodies.

378
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:47,507
But all of a sudden,
there were voices:

379
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:50,152
"Raus, raus.
Schnell, schnell, schnell."

380
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:52,647
"Quick, quick. Out, out, out."

381
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:57,249
I was afraid then for the first time,
and you know why?

382
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,857
There were flames until the sky

383
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:04,883
and a strange smell.

384
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:10,030
The smell I remember from home when
my mother burns on Friday a chicken.

385
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:17,657
(narrator) On the platform to greet
them, an SS reception committee.

386
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:20,840
New arrivals were divided
into two columns.

387
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:24,291
A quick medical inspection
by the camp doctors.

388
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,827
Those fit to work were put to one side.

389
00:31:36,423 --> 00:31:38,911
In the other column, all the rest -

390
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:40,979
the old,

391
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,788
the sick,

392
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:44,929
the lame,

393
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:47,422
pregnant mothers,

394
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,419
women with children.

395
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,708
Some suspect the worst.
Most have no idea.

396
00:31:56,793 --> 00:32:00,929
(Rudolf Vrba)
The idea of a mother being told,

397
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:05,230
after this terrible journey,
that her children are going to be gassed

398
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,179
was an utter outrageous idea
in her mind,

399
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,871
because after all that she'd suffered,

400
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:14,473
here comes a gangster
who wants to increase her suffering.

401
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:19,344
So she was tempted to go immediately
to the next neat officer

402
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:25,559
and say, "This man says, sir, that
my children are going to be gassed."

403
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:29,122
And he says, "Madam,
do you think we are barbarians?"

404
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,839
(narrator) Those to be gassed
were told they would be deloused

405
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,603
in the showers before starting work,

406
00:32:39,682 --> 00:32:42,551
then they would rejoin their families.

407
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:48,079
They waited their turn,
sometimes for hours.

408
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:53,184
(translator) Höblinger said to me,
"You are interested in the actions?"

409
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,403
I said, "Yes, very interested indeed."

410
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:59,430
He said, "I'll take you with me
this evening."

411
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,995
The new arrivals had to get undressed.

412
00:33:05,077 --> 00:33:08,066
When a certain number had gone inside,
they shut the doors.

413
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:11,058
And that happened three times.

414
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:16,846
Every time, Höblinger had to go out to
his ambulance and they took out a tin.

415
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:19,877
One of the SS Blockführers did that.

416
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:25,135
Then he climbed up the ladder
and at the top there was a round hole,

417
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:30,394
and he opened a little iron door
and held the tin there and shook it.

418
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:32,687
And then he shut the little door again.

419
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:35,108
Then a fearful screaming started up.

420
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:40,745
Approximately, I would reckon, after
about ten minutes, it slowly went quiet.

421
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:46,158
I said to Höblinger, "Can we get nearer
when they're taken out?" We went closer.

422
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:49,610
They opened the door - that was
the prisoners' squad who did that -

423
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:51,567
then a blue haze came out.

424
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:54,103
And I looked in and I saw a pyramid.

425
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,544
They'd all climbed on top of each other
until the last one stood on the top.

426
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:04,609
All one on top of the other. It was a
pointed heap. It all came up to a point.

427
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,938
And then the prisoners
had to go in and tear it apart.

428
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:20,832
They had to tug and pull very hard
to disentangle all these people.

429
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,897
Then we went back to the hall and it was
the turn of the last lot to undress -

430
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:29,277
the ones who'd managed
to hang back a bit all the time.

431
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:33,569
The prisoners had to check where small
children had been hidden and covered up.

432
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:38,792
They pulled them out and opened
the doors quickly again and whoosh,

433
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:42,242
they threw all the children in
and slammed the doors.

434
00:34:42,324 --> 00:34:44,811
"Oh, ugh! I'm going to be sick," I said.

435
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:49,804
"I've never seen anything like it
in my life. It's absolutely terrible."

436
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:53,830
Imagine, when they threw the children
in, how the people inside screamed

437
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:57,013
because then they suddenly realised
what was happening.

438
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:01,687
And I said, "Karl, can we leave soon?
I can't stand it any more."

439
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:05,990
And he said,
"You do get used to anything in time."

440
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:14,239
(narrator) A few - the strong,
the young -

441
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:17,110
would work till they died.

442
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:21,944
Some would die of exhaustion,
some were beaten to death,

443
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:27,243
some, too weak to work another day,
were gassed in their turn.

444
00:35:27,897 --> 00:35:30,352
And prisoners had other uses -

445
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:33,687
medical experiments.

446
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,874
Some, their hearts broken,
chose to die on the electrified wire.

447
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:53,512
Outside that wire, SS men,
free to go home to their families

448
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:56,201
at the end of the day's work.

449
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,375
And I remember when we passed
10,000 naked women on a frosty morning,

450
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:06,443
already sorted out, you see,
and put on the lorries.

451
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:09,015
And they knew -
they were all prisoners already -

452
00:36:09,174 --> 00:36:13,124
and they knew that they are now going
to the gas chamber, and they were quiet.

453
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:17,567
Somehow, people were accustomed
to live with the moment,

454
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:19,791
with the knowledge that death will come.

455
00:36:19,915 --> 00:36:23,516
But when the motors started -
you know, this noise -

456
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,660
this created a panic between the women,

457
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:30,149
and a terrible noise
went up from those lorries, you see.

458
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,798
The death cry of thousands
of young women

459
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:36,634
who were already reduced
to skeletons, and their...

460
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:41,933
their futile attempts, which they knew
by any logic that they can't succeed,

461
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:45,569
to jump out from the lorries
which take them to the gas chambers

462
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:48,564
which are only, perhaps,
less than a mile away,

463
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:53,362
and which were already stoked and the
fire was coming out from the chimneys.

464
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,658
This means everything was prepared.

465
00:36:55,745 --> 00:37:00,110
This was the moment
when the rabbi's son spoke to his God:

466
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:03,720
"God, show them your power."

467
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,825
"This is against you."

468
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:07,896
And nothing happened.

469
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:10,274
And then he said, "There is no God."

470
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:17,872
(translator) We used to say, "Where is
the world? Where is the United States?"

471
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:20,674
"Where is Russia?"

472
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:25,012
"Do they know what is happening here
in the extermination camps at all?"

473
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,881
There had, of course,
been only too much evidence

474
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:37,136
of the persecution of the Jews, before
the war began, in Hitlerite Germany.

475
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:40,007
And then, as the war progressed,

476
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,156
some horrifying reports
began to come out.

477
00:37:45,155 --> 00:37:51,407
At first it was very difficult,
naturally, to assess their accuracy.

478
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:55,511
They were, indeed, so horrible that it
was hard to believe they could be true.

479
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:02,646
(narrator) Among the working prisoners,
a resistance movement.

480
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:07,242
They smuggled out photographs with
a plea to the great powers for help.

481
00:38:07,366 --> 00:38:13,498
The evidence was so extensive,
one could hardly fail to give it credit,

482
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,603
and we decided that
one of the things we must do

483
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:20,016
was to make a joint statement

484
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:24,052
in each of our capitals
at the same time,

485
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,345
declaring what our information was

486
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:29,651
and what this horror was
that was being perpetrated,

487
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:33,867
and also making plain
our detestation of it

488
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,744
and our determination
that those responsible for it

489
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:40,625
should be punished
when the war was over.

490
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:44,335
And that we got agreement upon
after some negotiation,

491
00:38:44,462 --> 00:38:48,062
and it was near the end of 1942

492
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:51,625
when I made the statement
in the House of Commons

493
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:58,117
with, I must say, a dramatic effect far
exceeding anything that I'd expected.

494
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:01,568
And the Speaker -
a very fine speaker, Algy FitzRoy -

495
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:03,557
he got up and he said,

496
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:07,549
"It is for the House to rise if it
so wishes to express its feelings."

497
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:12,499
And the whole House got up. Lloyd
George came to me afterwards and said:

498
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:16,530
"In all my years in parliament,
I have never seen anything like this."

499
00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:18,868
He was deeply impressed, and so was I.

500
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:21,819
Well, that was something
that we could do.

501
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,158
(narrator) In April 1943,

502
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,575
the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto rose,

503
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:31,831
led by young men and women
who knew the truth about resettlement,

504
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,446
and determined to fight.

505
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:37,774
They had pitifully few arms.

506
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:40,120
They fought bravely.

507
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:47,637
It took the Germans 33 days
to crush the ghetto.

508
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:53,199
The survivors were marched off
to share the fate of those who had gone,

509
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:56,075
unresisting, before them.

510
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,449
Theresienstadt.

511
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:05,855
The Nazi cover story - resettlement in
the east - was elaborately documented.

512
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:08,124
This propaganda film made in 1943

513
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:12,079
was designed to show the German public
and the International Red Cross

514
00:40:12,157 --> 00:40:16,521
what conditions in the resettlement
camps were really like.

515
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:19,786
By the time this film was released,

516
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:22,857
most of the people seen here
were already dead

517
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:25,658
in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.

518
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:30,563
By 1944, the Germans
were losing the war.

519
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:33,014
The SS speeded up the rate of killing.

520
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:39,386
The railway tracks
now led straight to the gas chambers.

521
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:45,184
And still the trains rolled in
from Italy, from Greece, from Hungary.

522
00:40:45,263 --> 00:40:49,780
(translator) They took us
to Crematoria III and IV.

523
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:53,275
There we saw hell on this earth -

524
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:56,689
large piles of dead people,

525
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:02,017
and people dragging these bodies
to a long pit,

526
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:06,697
about 30 metres in length
and 10 metres in width.

527
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:11,189
There was a huge fire there
made of trees.

528
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:17,284
On the other side, fat was being
taken out of this pit with a bucket.

529
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:21,088
We immediately had to begin working.

530
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:24,464
Four people would take hold
of one dead person.

531
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:30,414
But the SS came and said,
"No. Each one of you will take one."

532
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,429
He showed us how
with a simple walking stick.

533
00:41:36,514 --> 00:41:38,423
One was to take the body under the chin,

534
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:41,727
put the stick on the neck
and drag the body to the pit,

535
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:45,136
Iike you would drag a rag
or a piece of wood.

536
00:41:45,222 --> 00:41:51,277
At the edge of the pit, were still more
people who pushed the dead into the pit.

537
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,186
Some of our group threw themselves
and jumped into the pit alive.

538
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:03,280
They apparently thought it better to be
burned alive rather than do such a job.

539
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:08,809
There were only four or five SS men
altogether.

540
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:15,595
They were so well-organised that there
were just four or five of them with us.

541
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:22,352
But there were electric fences, and
beyond this fence there were SS guards.

542
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:24,418
Escape was impossible.

543
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:33,672
After a week, they suddenly
took me one night to Crematorium I.

544
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,157
There, the whole job
was more mechanical.

545
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,379
All around, there were
water installations as if for showers.

546
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:49,468
Everyone crowded around these showers.
They still didn't know.

547
00:42:49,554 --> 00:42:55,686
Some who did not dare to believe
that they were going to be poisoned.

548
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:01,093
They would put about two thousand,
two and a half thousand people in there.

549
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:04,009
If there wasn't room,
the small children would be thrown

550
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:07,006
on top of the people's heads.

551
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:09,991
There were invalids.

552
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:14,060
They would take out their service cards
showing that they had fought in WWI

553
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:18,247
with all kinds of distinctions and
medals which they had from that time.

554
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:22,461
They shouted, "We fought for Germany,
now they're going to burn us, kill us."

555
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:26,876
"This is impossible.
We protest against such a thing."

556
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:29,717
But everyone just laughed at them.

557
00:43:29,796 --> 00:43:32,665
They didn't take it seriously,
these SS men.

558
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:35,357
They laughed at the whole thing.

559
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:40,802
There were invalids I helped to undress
as they couldn't do it by themselves.

560
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:44,941
There were many of us who helped.
I would talk to these people.

561
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:48,091
There were cases
where I saw acquaintances.

562
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:52,535
My heart wouldn't let me walk over
to them to let them recognise me.

563
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:57,988
No one who hasn't gone through such
a thing can imagine the will to live,

564
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,435
what a moment of life is.

565
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,736
Every person, without exception,

566
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:08,301
is capable of doing the worst things
just to live another minute.

567
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:23,262
Many women miscarried
during the poisoning.

568
00:44:23,348 --> 00:44:27,298
People hit each other.
People scratched with their nails.

569
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,782
There were fingernail marks on people.

570
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:34,849
Everyone wanted to survive,
but it was impossible there.

571
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:43,630
We went in to take out all the corpses.

572
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:47,122
We took them up by lifts to the ovens.

573
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:56,181
Near the ovens upstairs, there was a man
who removed gold teeth and false teeth.

574
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,060
They would shave the women's hair

575
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,657
and look for valuables in
the most intimate of places,

576
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,351
especially on the women.

577
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:10,487
In the oven,
it took 15 minutes to burn them.

578
00:45:10,572 --> 00:45:15,208
Only a few ashes were left
from all those corpses.

579
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,122
(narrator) The industry of death
had useful by-products.

580
00:45:19,203 --> 00:45:22,727
Women's hair was packed in bales,
gold teeth melted down,

581
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:28,438
artificial limbs and spectacle lenses
recycled for the German war machine.

582
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,510
It all helped.

583
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,982
In July 1944,

584
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:45,280
the Russians liberated Lublin
in eastern Poland.

585
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:49,311
Close by, they found
the extermination camp at Majdanek,

586
00:45:49,432 --> 00:45:52,072
where tens of thousands had died.

587
00:45:58,907 --> 00:46:02,202
The proofs of horror were all too clear.

588
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:05,959
Only 170 miles away,

589
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:09,446
the ovens of Auschwitz
were busier than ever.

590
00:46:12,027 --> 00:46:14,394
(translator) There were two shifts
at work,

591
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:18,039
from six in the morning to six at night.

592
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:25,563
I was present when they brought
the Gypsies one night for burning,

593
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:27,784
for poisoning.

594
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,281
It was a terrible sight.

595
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:36,462
There were cries to the sky.

596
00:46:42,294 --> 00:46:44,902
The cries in the bunker,
in the crematorium,

597
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:47,969
in the gas chamber, were horrible.

598
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:50,993
Horrible.

599
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:55,633
I still wonder today
how God didn't hear these cries.

600
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:01,851
(narrator) The German army
was now retreating on all fronts,

601
00:47:01,974 --> 00:47:04,810
leaving fire and destruction behind.

602
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,606
It tried to destroy evidence
of the camps,

603
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:11,519
pulling up railway lines,
dismantling equipment.

604
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,527
Yet even now, Himmler urged
the master race to fight on.

605
00:47:25,604 --> 00:47:29,478
Defeat was unthinkable,
their task unfinished.

606
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:36,990
(translator) Eichmann said at that time
six million people had been killed,

607
00:47:37,995 --> 00:47:41,944
four million in concentration camps
and similar setups,

608
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:47,581
and two million by shooting -
Einsatzkommandos.

609
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:50,608
And he told me at that time...
It was fantastic, really.

610
00:47:50,693 --> 00:47:55,330
I had thought a lot of people
had been killed, but six million?

611
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:00,360
Well, he said - and just imagine,
that was still too few for Himmler.

612
00:48:00,437 --> 00:48:03,229
Himmler said to me,
"'There must be more than that.'"

613
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:05,452
And he set up his own statistics unit -

614
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:09,488
today, one would say computer people -
who were to check up on this.

615
00:48:11,293 --> 00:48:15,581
(narrator) The Russians reached
Auschwitz in January 1945.

616
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:20,340
The Germans had moved most
of the surviving prisoners back west,

617
00:48:20,423 --> 00:48:21,917
into Germany.

618
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:25,945
Some, too old or too sick to be moved,
remained.

619
00:48:43,517 --> 00:48:49,496
And there were the relics and belongings
of those who had been brought here.

620
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,966
Then rescuers reached
the camps in Germany itself,

621
00:49:02,045 --> 00:49:03,572
where, by now,

622
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:08,026
the survivors of the extermination
camps had been abandoned.

623
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:25,670
They found the stench of rotting
corpses, cholera, typhus.

624
00:49:26,558 --> 00:49:30,432
Many who were rescued
were too weak to survive.

625
00:49:40,906 --> 00:49:45,161
Some lived to bear witness.

626
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:50,570
(translator) When the Americans
entered, I weighed 42 kilos.

627
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,946
I was skin and bones.

628
00:49:56,634 --> 00:49:59,089
I walked around the camp naked.

629
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,883
I had a belt with a plate,

630
00:50:02,887 --> 00:50:05,418
spoon and revolver.

631
00:50:06,531 --> 00:50:09,597
This was all my property
after the liberation.

632
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,716
I bless every day
that I continue to live,

633
00:50:37,796 --> 00:50:40,742
because every day that I live
is pure profit.

634
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,922
I could say that today I'm 27 years old.

635
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,113
The years before the camp don't count,

636
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:52,519
as I was dead in the camp
and reborn after the liberation.
