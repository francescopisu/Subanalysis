(birdsong)

3
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:18,523
(narrator) Russia. The summer of 1942.

4
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,773
The Germans are on the move... again.

5
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:35,251
The Sixth Army, Hitler's largest,
victorious in France,

6
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:39,316
almost victorious in the first year
of the Russian campaign.

7
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,201
Now it has a new task -

8
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:45,110
to fight further east than the Wehrmacht
has ever fought before,

9
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:49,559
to cut Russia in two, on the Volga.

10
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:52,398
The German army's plan to destroy Russia
by a blitzkrieg in 1941 had failed.

11
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:56,283
And, in the attempt,
they'd lost a million men.

12
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,267
In 1942, they were not strong enough -
even with the help of their allies -

13
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:02,800
to attack along the whole front.

14
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:05,795
Hitler turned south, to the Caucasus.

15
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:09,438
Three-quarters of Russia's oil
was there.

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,662
He divided his forces into two groups -

17
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:17,227
the Sixth Army and
the Fourth Panzer Army would move first.

18
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:24,324
His plan was to encircle and destroy
Soviet armies in the Don bend,

19
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:26,778
drive east towards Stalingrad,

20
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,690
and cut off the Caucasus
from the rest of the country.

21
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:32,574
Then in the main campaign,

22
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,796
the other army group
would capture Rostov

23
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:39,357
and strike south to the oil fields.

24
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:43,118
The offensive started late.

25
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,844
It was high summer
before the Sixth Army,

26
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:48,874
under Friedrich von Paulus,
began to move.

27
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,636
The armour in front, as usual,

28
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:56,122
the motorised supply columns
close behind.

29
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:04,754
The foot soldiers
slogged along in the rear.

30
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,772
At first, the Russians
seemed to melt away.

31
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,758
No matter how far the Germans advanced,

32
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:22,483
the Red Army always eluded them.

33
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,128
The Germans didn't take many prisoners.

34
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:46,043
They captured territory and towns.

35
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,296
The army wanted to keep pressing ahead
to encircle the Russians, but couldn't.

36
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:09,676
Time and again, its spearheads had to
pause and wait for supplies to catch up.

37
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:17,000
One soldier, Wilhelm Hoffman,
was keeping a diary.

38
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,570
He thought the war might soon be over.

39
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:23,330
"Perhaps we'll be home by Christmas",
he wrote.

40
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,590
(artillery fire)

41
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,380
The Russians had lost a quarter
of a million troops in the spring.

42
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:22,410
Now they could not afford
pitched battles,

43
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,862
so they kept retreating.

44
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,314
To the Russian commanders,
it was a skilful planned withdrawal.

45
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:36,142
To the Russian troops,
it was a demoralising rout.

46
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,103
To Hitler, it was a crushing victory.

47
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:44,240
He thought the Russian armies
had been wiped out.

48
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:48,847
So, with the offensive
barely two weeks old,

49
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:51,803
he started to shift his armies south.

50
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:54,642
At the end of July
his troops entered Rostov,

51
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,514
the key to the Caucasus.

52
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:40,792
Hitler now gave absolute priority
to the thrust towards the oil fields.

53
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:44,245
He unleashed his fresh, southern armies.

54
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,196
He diverted
the Fourth Panzer Army south.

55
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,609
He stripped the Sixth Army of its fuel
and most of its armour,

56
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,910
and sent them south, too.

57
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:57,444
But he still expected the Sixth Army
to carry on as before.

58
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:02,816
By mid-August, the Sixth Army
had been on the march for six weeks.

59
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:04,886
Late in the afternoon of the 23rd,

60
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,841
a panzer column reached the Volga
just north of Stalingrad.

61
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:13,130
It cut off river traffic and brought
the opposite bank under fire.

62
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:21,422
The infantry dug in along the railway
and waited for reinforcements.

63
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,659
Though the Sixth Army's original mission
was now accomplished,

64
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,075
Hitler now expected them
to take the city.

65
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,866
Stalingrad was built on bluffs
overlooking the Volga,

66
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:46,010
and stretched 15 miles
along its western bank.

67
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:51,036
The old town - log huts
and wooden buildings - in the south,

68
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,448
a modern centre, steel and concrete.

69
00:07:54,573 --> 00:08:00,476
To the north, three large factories,
with workers' housing nearby.

70
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:06,002
The whole city lay on hilly ground,
scored by deep ravines.

71
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:10,599
A Soviet showpiece,
Stalin had named it for himself.

72
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,278
Stalin had determined
to defend the city.

73
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,654
He decided not to evacuate
most of the civilians.

74
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:27,365
The troops would fight better, he said,
for a live city than for a dead one.

75
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,492
Air defences were improvised.

76
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:44,015
Half the anti-aircraft guns in the town
had women crews.

77
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,169
A workers' militia was recruited.

78
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,232
Stalin had coined the slogan,
"Not one step back."

79
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:54,528
Troops and security police
patrolled the streets.

80
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:59,140
It wasn't all coercion.

81
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:04,510
There was fear of the Germans,
and patriotism, and communist zeal.

82
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,216
"Comrades and citizens of Stalingrad,

83
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,667
each of us must apply ourselves

84
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,974
to the task of defending
our beloved town,

85
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:20,738
our homes, and our families."

86
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:24,952
"Let us barricade every street,
transform every district,

87
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:29,980
every block, every house,
into an impregnable fortress."

88
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:54,000
The Sixth Army had not reached the Volga
in enough strength

89
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:56,992
to take Stalingrad on its own.

90
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:00,750
(gunfire)

91
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,858
Its reserves were still far behind.

92
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:12,715
(siren)

93
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:18,238
The Luftwaffe was called in
to help the ground forces.

94
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,222
For three days, from August 23,

95
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:28,560
every aircraft available
on the Russian Front attacked the city.

96
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,887
Almost the only defence
came from the gun boats on the Volga

97
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:41,875
and from the batteries
on the opposite shore.

98
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,923
(man shouts)

99
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:56,648
The city did not fall to air attack,

100
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:01,799
and the shattered buildings
were transformed into fortresses.

101
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,315
The beginning of September.

102
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:12,152
Russian artillery
could harass the Germans

103
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,919
from the east bank of the Volga.

104
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,060
But the Russian reserves were useless

105
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,754
unless they could cross the river
and get into the city.

106
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:21,826
There were no bridges

107
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:26,541
and by day river ferries
were under constant Luftwaffe attack.

108
00:14:26,622 --> 00:14:29,535
As long as the Russians
held any of the western bank,

109
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:32,452
they could send troops into the city.

110
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,519
Once across, they could use tunnels
dug into the high bluffs

111
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:40,624
and force the Germans
to battle for every foot.

112
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:47,871
The German armies held the initiative,

113
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,132
but they were at the very end
of a precarious supply line.

114
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,043
All their troops were committed
to the offensive.

115
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:59,536
They had no reserves left
if anything went wrong.

116
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:08,434
The Germans launched their first attacks
early in September.

117
00:15:09,438 --> 00:15:12,231
September 11, Wilhelm Hoffman:

118
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:15,796
"Our battalion is fighting
in the suburbs of Stalingrad."

119
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,256
"Firing is going on all the time."

120
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:21,099
"Wherever you look is fire and flames."

121
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:25,198
"Russian cannons and machine guns
are firing out of the burning city."

122
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:27,192
"Fanatics!"

123
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:29,230
(machine-gun fire)

124
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,199
(explosions)

125
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:54,392
(gunfire continues)

126
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,953
(gunfire)

127
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:08,327
Hoffman, September 16:

128
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:12,084
"Our battalion plus tanks
is attacking the grain elevator."

129
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,655
"The battalion
is suffering heavy losses."

130
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:16,842
"The elevator is occupied not by men

131
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:20,950
but by devils that no bullets
or flames can destroy."

132
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:23,058
September 18:

133
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,932
"Fighting is going on
inside the elevator."

134
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:29,312
"If all the buildings of Stalingrad
are defended like this,

135
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:33,145
then none of our soldiers
will get back to Germany."

136
00:17:33,229 --> 00:17:35,182
September 20:

137
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,590
"The battle for the elevator
is still going on."

138
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,127
September 22:

139
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:45,502
"Russian resistance in the elevator
has been broken."

140
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:48,757
"Our troops are advancing
towards the Volga."

141
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:54,212
"We found only about 40 Russians
dead in the elevator."

142
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:58,585
The German army high command,
1,000 miles away,

143
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,032
was beginning to have second thoughts.

144
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,684
General Halder, chief of staff,

145
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:07,445
had not seriously opposed
Hitler's directives earlier in the year.

146
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:11,084
Now, with the original
strategic objectives accomplished,

147
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:14,772
he urged caution - but in vain.

148
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:17,310
A member of Halder's staff observed

149
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,566
that the Führer used to move his hands
in big sweeps over the map:

150
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,478
"Push here, push there."

151
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:27,546
It was all vague and took no account
of practical difficulties.

152
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,193
Halder refused to take responsibility
for continuing the advance

153
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,414
with winter approaching.

154
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,094
Hitler said:
"We now need National Socialist ardour,

155
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,738
rather than professional ability,
to settle matters in the east."

156
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:45,229
"Obviously I cannot expect this of you."

157
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:49,919
He sacked Halder
and replaced him by General Zeitzler,

158
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,605
who was thought to be
a genius at logistics -

159
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:57,435
a man who would know how to move
armies where Hitler wanted them to go.

160
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,573
(explosions)

161
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,030
In Stalingrad,
the Sixth Army's commander

162
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:07,061
was having second thoughts too.

163
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,640
Von Paulus's troops

164
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:12,668
were not used to fighting
hand to hand in bombed-out cities.

165
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,063
Here, their tanks
moved at a snail's pace,

166
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:28,582
yet Hitler insisted, demanded,
that they take the city.

167
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:04,421
A Russian soldier, Anton Gošnik:

168
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:08,375
"We moved back,
occupying one building after another,

169
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:11,399
turning them into strongholds."

170
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:14,583
"A soldier would crawl out
of an occupied position

171
00:20:14,668 --> 00:20:20,298
only when the ground was on fire beneath
him and his clothes were smouldering."

172
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:46,622
September 26, Hoffman complained
about the way the Soviets fought:

173
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,885
"We don't see them at all."

174
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:52,916
"They've established themselves
in houses, in cellars,

175
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:56,475
and they're firing from all sides,
including from our rear."

176
00:20:56,601 --> 00:21:00,201
"Barbarians! They use gangster methods!"

177
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,307
(machine-gun fire)

178
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,521
Zeitzler, Hitler's new chief of staff,

179
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:13,512
took a long look at the situation
and told him:

180
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:16,618
"The most dangerous positions
on the whole Eastern Front

181
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:18,537
are the north front at Stalingrad

182
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:21,339
and the eastern flank
of the Fourth Panzer Army."

183
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:24,794
"If steps are not taken in good time
to rectify the situation,

184
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:26,752
there will be a disaster."

185
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:30,662
Hitler replied,
"You're too pessimistic, Zeitzler."

186
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:36,267
"We've been through worse periods
than this and we've survived."

187
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:39,521
"We'll get over
our present difficulties, too."

188
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:43,399
The German position was dangerous.

189
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:47,203
20,000 men a week
were being lost in Stalingrad.

190
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:53,031
They could only be replaced by stripping
the army's flanks of German troops.

191
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:56,745
Romanians were moving in here.

192
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,746
This area was now held by the Italians.

193
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:02,968
Next to them were Hungarians.

194
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,809
The most precarious position of all
was here,

195
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,992
where the Russians
held both banks of the river Don.

196
00:22:09,072 --> 00:22:11,057
They faced the Romanian Third Army,

197
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:15,508
which had no heavy anti-tank guns
and no tanks either.

198
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,659
Hitler wasn't worried. He thought -

199
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:21,691
and the high command's
intelligence confirmed this -

200
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,791
that the Russians
had no strategic reserves left.

201
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:31,891
In October, the Germans attacked again,
towards the Volga.

202
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,651
Unless they captured
the entire river bank,

203
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:40,100
the Russians would bring in
troops and supplies at night.

204
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,783
(gunfire)

205
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:05,543
Wilhelm Hoffman, October 4:

206
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:08,873
"A lot of Russian Tommy-gunners
have appeared."

207
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,720
"Where are they bringing them from?"

208
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:13,631
Another German wondered:

209
00:23:13,716 --> 00:23:18,627
"Were we going to have to fight through
another dreadful Russian winter?"

210
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,229
Hoffman, on October 14:

211
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:25,796
"It's been fantastic since morning."

212
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:27,831
"Our aeroplanes and artillery

213
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:31,315
have been bombing
the Russian positions for hours."

214
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,153
A panzer Leutnant, Weiner, wrote:

215
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:09,108
"Stalingrad is no longer a town."

216
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:13,786
"By day it is an enormous cloud
of burning, blinding smoke."

217
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:18,587
"It is a vast furnace,
lit by the reflection of the flames."

218
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:24,222
"And when night arrives - one of those
very hot, noisy, bloody nights -

219
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:26,064
the dogs plunge into the Volga

220
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:28,866
and swim desperately
to gain the other bank."

221
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,201
"The nights of Stalingrad
are a terror for them."

222
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:35,157
"Animals flee from this hell."

223
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:38,766
"The hardest stones
cannot bear it for long."

224
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:41,063
"Only men endure."

225
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:16,476
Hoffman's diary, October 22:

226
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:22,734
"Who would have thought three months
ago that instead of the joy of victory

227
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:26,796
we would have to endure
such sacrifices and torture,

228
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:29,641
the end of which is nowhere in sight?"

229
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,732
"The soldiers are calling Stalingrad
'the mass grave' of the Wehrmacht."

230
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:40,374
From far behind Stalingrad,

231
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:45,481
long columns of Russian tanks and men
came that autumn.

232
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:51,042
But only a trickle went to Stalingrad -
just enough to keep it from collapsing.

233
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:56,300
The rest went to assembly areas
north and south of the city.

234
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:58,991
(men sing in Russian)

235
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:14,749
Newsreels told Russians
what their leaders wanted them to know -

236
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:20,467
that small arms factories were working
round the clock from Moscow to Georgia.

237
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:43,370
Sweethearts were writing letters
about production quotas,

238
00:26:43,457 --> 00:26:46,097
or wrapping parcels for the front,

239
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:49,585
and delivering them
by special messenger.

240
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:59,142
Youth groups could
adopt their own tanks

241
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:02,214
and even pose with their crews.

242
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:07,006
Groups of workers
could buy their own Stormovik

243
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,647
and send it off
to shoot down Hitlerite invaders.

244
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:17,136
But the underlying message was clear -
the terrible days of shortage were over.

245
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:21,888
Now, at last, the Red Army
was getting all it needed.

246
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,077
When it seemed likely

247
00:27:23,164 --> 00:27:27,376
that Stalingrad would hold out,
its generals were filmed.

248
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,977
General Yeremenko,
commander of the Stalingrad front,

249
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:37,856
found time to distribute medals.

250
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:44,638
Stalin's speeches
were much read to the troops.

251
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:48,556
There was even a Stalingrad oath:

252
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:54,765
"Its burnt-out houses,
its ruins, its very stones, are sacred."

253
00:27:58,997 --> 00:28:01,638
The war went on.

254
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:06,928
The Russians ferried their troops
across the Volga and the Don

255
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:11,805
and crammed them into the bridgeheads
they had held since the summer.

256
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:19,745
The Russians dug in and waited.

257
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,861
The Germans now held
nine-tenths of the city.

258
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:53,891
On November 8, Hitler made
an after-dinner speech in Munich.

259
00:28:53,974 --> 00:28:56,341
(Hitler) Ich wollte zur Wolga kommen.

260
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,190
(narrator) "I wanted to get
to the Volga at a point

261
00:28:59,268 --> 00:29:04,407
where stands a certain town...
bears the name of Stalin himself."

262
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:07,356
"I wanted to take the place
and we've done it."

263
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,842
"We've got it really, except for a few
enemy positions still holding out."

264
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:17,749
"People say, 'Why don't they
finish the job more quickly?'"

265
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:21,470
"Well, I prefer to do the job
with quite small assault groups."

266
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:24,739
"Time is of no consequence at all."

267
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:02,413
But time was creeping up
on the Germans.

268
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:04,861
Even before Hitler's speech,

269
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:07,938
the Russian winter had begun.

270
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:10,003
(wind howls)

271
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:25,203
The Germans knew what was coming.

272
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:31,066
Soon it would be 30, 40, 50 degrees
below freezing.

273
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,556
Equipment and men would freeze.

274
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,308
But the Russians would keep going.

275
00:30:57,278 --> 00:30:59,996
The Russians tried to keep
their build-up a secret,

276
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,916
but they could neither
move all their men by night,

277
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:06,748
nor hide completely
three-quarters of a million new troops.

278
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:18,063
On November 10, Von Paulus asked Hitler
to let him withdraw from Stalingrad.

279
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:20,363
Hitler told him to keep attacking.

280
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,122
The Russian build-up went on.

281
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:46,800
On November 19, the Russians struck.

282
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:57,236
They attacked the Romanians
from the north

283
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:00,156
and, two days later, from the south.

284
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:05,331
Within hours,
the Russian tanks were through.

285
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:29,047
The Russian plans were ambitious.

286
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:33,489
Their two pincers would cut through
the Romanians and link at Kalach.

287
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,978
That would trap the German Sixth Army.

288
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:39,476
They would reduce the Stalingrad pocket,

289
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,505
and could then strike south-east
towards Rostov.

290
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,689
That would trap
all the Germans in the Caucasus.

291
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,445
Just four days
after the offensive began,

292
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,246
the two Russian armies did link up.

293
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:57,581
It had all gone so quickly
there was no time to film it,

294
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,308
so it was re-enacted for the cameras.

295
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,415
(men cheer)

296
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:36,912
The Russians thought
they had trapped 75,000 Germans.

297
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:40,711
In fact, 250,000 men were cut off.

298
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:44,848
All the Sixth Army,
some of the Fourth Panzer Army,

299
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:49,144
Romanians, Croatians,
and even Russian volunteers.

300
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:54,325
The commander on the spot, Von Paulus,
asked to be allowed to break out.

301
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:59,003
Hitler told him to stay put.
He would send troops to break in.

302
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:01,194
And he sent him a cheery message:

303
00:34:01,276 --> 00:34:05,226
"I know the brave Sixth Army
and its commander-in-chief,

304
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:08,862
and I also know
that it will do its duty."

305
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:19,914
But the army still had to eat.

306
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:27,900
Göring, the Luftwaffe's
commander-in-chief.

307
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:29,734
Earlier that year, his planes

308
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,383
had supplied a whole army
cut off for 60 days

309
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:35,107
with fuel, ammunition and food.

310
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:37,563
Now he thought they could do it again.

311
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:41,476
Providing the weather was good
and the distances not too great,

312
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,581
they could fly in 500 tons a day.

313
00:34:48,618 --> 00:34:50,494
Hitler thought that would do,

314
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:55,632
though he knew the army said
it needed at least 800 tons.

315
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,468
The Russians were waiting.

316
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,695
Bombers were used as transports.

317
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,595
The weather was vile.

318
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:48,926
The airlift brought in
only a tenth of what was needed,

319
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:52,223
though it did once deliver
a planeload of ground pepper

320
00:35:52,304 --> 00:35:55,403
and 12 cases of contraceptives.

321
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:03,466
The Russians did not attack

322
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:06,337
the 250,000 troops
in the pocket directly -

323
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,451
they were not yet strong enough.

324
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:12,973
Instead, their armies drove westwards,
and the further they drove,

325
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:16,584
the wider grew the gap between
the Germans besieged in Stalingrad

326
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:19,541
and their would-be rescuers.

327
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:21,643
(gunfire)

328
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:02,888
German troops inside the pocket
were cold and hungry, but confident.

329
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:07,761
They settled down, ready to move
when their rescuers got close enough.

330
00:37:07,882 --> 00:37:09,944
But they never came.

331
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,977
The Germans fighting their way
to relieve Stalingrad

332
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:18,157
turned back to meet a new threat
to the entire southern front.

333
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:28,206
The Germans in the pocket
were on their own.

334
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,863
The Russians had the upper hand.

335
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:45,785
Even the quality
of their medical care showed it.

336
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,776
German wounded,
except the few airlifted home,

337
00:37:48,856 --> 00:37:51,038
died in their dugouts.

338
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,995
The Russians at Stalingrad

339
00:37:53,076 --> 00:37:57,407
had the best recovery record
of any Russian armies.

340
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:23,881
The Russians now had mastery of the air.

341
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,757
Their bombers were virtually unopposed.

342
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:32,739
Hitler was obsessed by Stalingrad.

343
00:38:32,822 --> 00:38:34,851
The Russians too.

344
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,883
They could have left the men there
to freeze and starve.

345
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:41,334
Instead, they massed seven armies
round the pocket.

346
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:55,073
In Stalingrad itself,
fighting went on in the same bloody way.

347
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,900
(explosion)

348
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:25,986
On Christmas Eve in Germany

349
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:30,137
the radio broadcast this live message
from the troops in Stalingrad:

350
00:39:30,254 --> 00:39:33,855
Achtung.
Ich rufe noch einmal Stalingrad.

351
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:37,233
Hier ist Stalingrad.
Hier ist die Front an der Wolga.

352
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:39,146
(narrator) But it was a fake.

353
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:43,029
Broadcasts from Stalingrad
had stopped a week before.

354
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:02,860
On Christmas Day, Radio Moscow
broadcast to the Germans in Stalingrad:

355
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:06,891
"Every seven seconds,
a German soldier dies in Russia."

356
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:09,610
"Stalingrad is a mass grave."

357
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:11,678
(clock ticking)

358
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:19,284
The ticking and the message
went on all day.

359
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:22,045
(ticking)

360
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:49,089
The Germans were now eating
raw horse flesh.

361
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,771
On January 8,
the Russians offered surrender terms -

362
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:55,843
warmth, medical care, food.

363
00:40:56,345 --> 00:41:00,174
Officers could even keep
their ceremonial daggers.

364
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:06,969
Hitler refused.

365
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,766
"Every day the Sixth Army holds out",
he said,

366
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,374
"helps our situation
everywhere else on the front."

367
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:20,202
January 10.
The final Russian assault.

368
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:31,868
They thought it would take
about four days.

369
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,874
But two weeks later,
they were still fighting.

370
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,329
On the 24th,
Von Paulus signalled Hitler:

371
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:21,429
"Troops without munitions or food."

372
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:24,810
"Effective command no longer possible."

373
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:26,996
"Collapse inevitable."

374
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,870
"Army requests permission to surrender

375
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:33,054
in order to save lives
of remaining troops."

376
00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:37,046
Hitler still forbade surrender.

377
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:42,421
"The Sixth Army will do its historic
duty at Stalingrad until the last man."

378
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:50,973
But German soldiers and German officers

379
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:54,078
were already giving themselves up.

380
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:18,520
On January 31,
Hitler made Von Paulus a field marshal,

381
00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:23,012
knowing no German field marshal
had ever been taken alive.

382
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:37,587
The same day he was promoted,
Von Paulus surrendered.

383
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:45,604
His captors had never seen
such a senior German officer before.

384
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:48,756
General Shumilov,
who took the surrender,

385
00:44:48,835 --> 00:44:50,897
didn't quite know what to do,

386
00:44:50,984 --> 00:44:54,704
so he asked Paulus
for proof of his identity.

387
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:59,038
Then for proof that he was
commander of the Sixth Army.

388
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:02,527
Then whether he really was
a field marshal.

389
00:45:05,217 --> 00:45:09,964
They talked a while.
Von Paulus cheered up.

390
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:13,226
He even proposed a toast
to the Red Army.

391
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:19,447
Hitler had expected him...
to shoot himself.

392
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:32,874
It was not an ordinary defeat.
It was a catastrophe.

393
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,730
Two German armies -

394
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:20,179
24 generals, 2,000 officers,
90,000 soldiers -

395
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:22,015
prisoners.

396
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,090
And 150,000 dead.

397
00:46:26,129 --> 00:46:31,377
The Romanian, Italian,
and Hungarian armies destroyed.

398
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:37,943
Enough material lost to equip
a quarter of the whole German army.

399
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:43,085
This was the same Sixth Army
which, two years before,

400
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:45,192
could not imagine defeat.

401
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:30,195
Prisoners were marched off to camps.

402
00:47:30,274 --> 00:47:36,025
50,000 died within weeks
of cold, malnutrition and typhus.

403
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:43,499
Of all but 100,000,
only 6,000 ever returned home.

404
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:05,754
The people of Stalingrad

405
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:10,282
came back to look for
what was left of their homes.

406
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:31,809
When it was all over,
a Russian soldier said:

407
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:34,150
"Germans are funny fellows,

408
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:38,181
coming to conquer Stalingrad
in shiny leather boots."

409
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:41,206
"They thought it would be a joyride."

410
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,320
(wind howls)

411
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:09,329
When it was all over, Hitler said:

412
00:50:09,412 --> 00:50:13,209
"What is life? Life is the nation."

413
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:16,233
"The individual must die anyway."

414
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:20,338
"Beyond the life of the individual
is the nation."

415
00:50:22,494 --> 00:50:25,593
On February 3, 1943,

416
00:50:25,678 --> 00:50:29,967
the German radio announced
that Stalingrad had fallen.

417
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:33,157
The Sixth Army had fought courageously,

418
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:38,299
but had succumbed
to vastly superior enemy forces,

419
00:50:38,377 --> 00:50:42,633
and to unfavourable circumstances.
