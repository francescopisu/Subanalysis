00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:13,128
(narrator) Anne Frank,
in her diary, June 6 1944:

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:17,088
"Would the long-awaited liberation,
which still seems too wonderful,

4
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,416
too much like a fairy tale,
ever come true?"

5
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:24,180
"Could we be granted victory
this year, 1944?"

6
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:28,288
"We don't know yet,
but hope is revived within us."

7
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:34,117
"Now more than ever we must
clench our teeth and not cry out."

8
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:40,330
The people of Holland had lived under
Nazi occupation for four long years.

9
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:39,715
(narrator) On May 10, 1940,
without a declaration of war,

10
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:43,282
Germany struck against neutral Holland.

11
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,811
Paratroopers and panzers
overpowered the Dutch peacetime army,

12
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:48,846
with its obsolete weapons.

13
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,008
Using Holland's excellent roads,

14
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,959
Hitler's columns raced
across the flat countryside

15
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:05,651
before the Allies
could come to the rescue.

16
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:12,049
At lunch time on May 14, 50 Heinkels
attacked the port of Rotterdam.

17
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:17,153
In 15 minutes they started fires
which destroyed the city centre

18
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,379
and struck terror into the population.

19
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:27,133
Rotterdam capitulated,
and only a few hours later

20
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:31,117
Holland decided to surrender to save
other cities from a similar fate.

21
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:37,904
That night, as Rotterdam blazed,
the Dutch people were leaderless.

22
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,705
The queen, with her cabinet,
had escaped to Britain

23
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,888
to carry on the government in exile.

24
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,919
Faced with the prospect of Nazi rule,
more than 300 Dutchmen, mainly Jews,

25
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,792
preferred to commit suicide.

26
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:55,249
People were stunned,
bewildered, fearful.

27
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,741
(speaks Dutch)

28
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:03,191
(translator) Holland hadn't been
involved in a war since Napoleon.

29
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:06,599
We were completely stunned,

30
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,785
and psychologically broken.

31
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:14,043
We had read what Hitler said, and...

32
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:27,128
As to the Jews, I had a firm belief
in what he prophesied.

33
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:31,038
I actually believed that, yes.

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,717
He would do away with us.
Yes, I believed that.

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,316
We were not so very alarmed. We didn't
believe all the things they said, no.

36
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:45,843
My brother - Eddy, the oldest one -

37
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:49,148
came to our house

38
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,876
in the days the war started,

39
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:55,548
and he said, "Come with me.
Let's try to escape."

40
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,890
And I remember that
my mother said, "Escape? Why?"

41
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,653
"I must wait for the man
who brings the laundry."

42
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,641
"What do you want me to escape from?"

43
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:08,905
Maybe they were the enemy to us,
but, really, true,

44
00:04:08,984 --> 00:04:12,126
they didn't see us an enemy
at that moment at least,

45
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:17,455
you see, because we were
just hotel employees,

46
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:21,451
and so long as we didn't bother them,

47
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,863
they accept everything, you see.

48
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:27,011
Like, the doorman
opened the door for anybody,

49
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:30,462
Iike he'd do today,
like he'd done years before.

50
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:33,718
I mean, and the bellboys
did the things they had to do,

51
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:36,019
the porter did the things
that he has to do.

52
00:04:36,106 --> 00:04:41,278
Anybody, from the highest to
the smallest, did his job what he did.

53
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:47,761
(narrator) Germany imposed
a new administration

54
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:49,448
headed by a Reich commissioner

55
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:53,668
personally responsible to Hitler
and empowered to rule by decree.

56
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:59,967
The new supreme ruler of Holland
was Dr Arthur Seyss-Inquart,

57
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:01,844
a Viennese lawyer.

58
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:07,057
He had helped organise Austria's
absorption by Germany in 1938.

59
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:10,550
In the Hall of Knights at The Hague,
he addressed German officials.

60
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,773
The 12 most senior Dutch civil servants
were also present.

61
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:17,725
(speaks German)

62
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:30,191
(narrator) He tried
to reassure the Dutch

63
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,028
by declaring that Nazi ideology
would not be imposed.

64
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,719
Germany had no imperialistic designs
on Holland.

65
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,808
Dutch laws would remain in force
until further notice.

66
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,494
Seyss-Inquart made it clear

67
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:49,720
that the country would still
be administered by Dutch civil servants.

68
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:52,630
Anyone who wished might resign.

69
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,743
Few were to do so.

70
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,648
He called for cooperation between
two Germanic peoples of the same blood.

71
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,257
- Sieg...
- (audience) Heil!

72
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:08,357
(orchestra plays
"Deutschland über alles")

73
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,770
(narrator) As a conciliatory gesture,

74
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:30,653
Hitler ordered the release
of all Dutch prisoners of war.

75
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:36,435
People started to relax.

76
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,283
The Germans promised
to maintain living standards

77
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,195
and to cure unemployment.

78
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,735
The occupation
might not be so bad after all.

79
00:06:51,906 --> 00:06:55,277
The Reich commissioner
Seyss-Inquart himself

80
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:00,836
saw off a trainload of children
on a free holiday to his native Austria.

81
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,113
For the Dutch Nazi movement, the NSB,

82
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:19,523
this was a moment of jubilation as they
gathered to welcome the invaders.

83
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:22,898
The NSB had been holding rallies
here in Lunteren for years,

84
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:26,847
but now, for the first time, instead
of protesting against the regime,

85
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,883
they were its champions.

86
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,212
The NSB membership
quadrupled to 80,000,

87
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,092
although still only 1%
of the population belonged.

88
00:07:39,513 --> 00:07:43,571
Like Hitler's Nazi Party, the NSB
was born of the economic depression,

89
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:48,096
fear of Bolshevism,
and the promise of a revived Europe.

90
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:56,041
It stood for order, discipline
and an authoritarian state.

91
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:59,571
(crowd sings)

92
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:05,826
Patriotic in their fashion,

93
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,775
the Dutch Nazis
extolled ancient traditions,

94
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:13,644
glorified the fatherland
and promised national self-respect.

95
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,142
(song continues)

96
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:24,080
(crowd sings Dutch national anthem)

97
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:28,149
Saluting the Dutch flag

98
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:31,178
and singing the national anthem
were part of the ritual.

99
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:34,209
All references to the royal family,
the House of Orange,

100
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:37,053
were, however, omitted.

101
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,400
(anthem ends)

102
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:51,470
(crowd chants)

103
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:53,656
Anton Mussert, the NSB's leader,

104
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:57,343
was an engineer with an outstanding
record in the civil service.

105
00:08:57,425 --> 00:08:58,767
He saw this as the moment

106
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:01,757
for the rebirth of the Netherlands
as a great power.

107
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,590
Mussert moulded himself on Mussolini.

108
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:08,847
Hitler was the Messiah
sent to save Europe.

109
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:12,999
(Mussert speaks Dutch)

110
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:02,213
(narrator) A German bomber
flew low over the crowd in salute.

111
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,206
It was just six weeks

112
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:09,313
since the Luftwaffe had spread
fire and death in Rotterdam.

113
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:19,787
(Mussert speaks Dutch)

114
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,481
(crowd sings)

115
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,482
(narrator)
But there was another Holland.

116
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,825
Astonishingly,
on Prince Bernhard's birthday,

117
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:53,502
only one week after France had fallen,
thousands of ordinary Dutchmen

118
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,918
spontaneously demonstrated
their defiance.

119
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:01,255
Soldiers saluted as
people sang the Orange anthem

120
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:06,925
and placed white carnations, Bernhard's
favourite flower, on national monuments.

121
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,591
Some saw no point in open opposition.

122
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:20,315
A new German-approved
political organisation,

123
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,155
the Netherlands Union, was formed

124
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,924
to unite patriots in loyalty
to the occupying power.

125
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:27,141
With most other parties gagged,

126
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:30,631
it seemed to be a respectable
alternative to the NSB.

127
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,746
15% of the population joined.

128
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,073
Holland was a religious country.

129
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:43,635
Despite Hitler's claim to be
the saviour of the Christian West,

130
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:48,360
the churches were hostile to Nazism
because it placed man above God.

131
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:52,271
In some churches,
Dutch Nazis were denied communion.

132
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:01,972
Everyone had to be fingerprinted
and photographed and registered.

133
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,312
The Dutch government
had left instructions

134
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,080
for civil servants to stay at work

135
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:09,383
as long as they thought it was
in the best interests of the people.

136
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,828
Now they were systematically issuing
identity cards to the entire population.

137
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:20,003
The Germans introduced
a racial questionnaire.

138
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,882
(speaks Dutch)

139
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,574
(translator) Very shortly
after the occupation,

140
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,718
two men from the German security police
came to me and asked,

141
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:31,405
"Are there any Jews
in your municipality?"

142
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:35,465
I told them it was true
there are no Jews in my municipality.

143
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,342
But that was my first mistake.

144
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:45,439
Because by answering that question
you accept racial discrimination.

145
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:48,054
And you had to fill in a form.

146
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,969
One passage was if you had
any Jewish grandparents.

147
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,033
I had none, so I said no.

148
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,416
Then you went home and didn't realise

149
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:58,982
that you'd helped in cornering the Jews

150
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,094
and making them vulnerable

151
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,822
and bringing them in a position

152
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:05,771
where they could later on
be transported and gassed.

153
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,840
You didn't realise.

154
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:12,749
After a year of being politicised
a little bit better,

155
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:17,015
you got more agitations on what
such a declaration really meant.

156
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:21,269
But the first impression is:
your age, your address,

157
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:24,572
grandparents of Jewish origin? No. OK.

158
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:28,142
You see? It is so... It was a process.

159
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:35,885
Step by step the process of infiltration
of this Nazism in the society was there.

160
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:41,989
(narrator) All Jews were dismissed
from public office.

161
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,516
The Germans began
to segregate Jews from other Dutchmen.

162
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:48,739
They were banned from cafés and parks.

163
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:58,792
In Amsterdam, black-shirted NSB men
marched into a working-class area,

164
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,159
pulled Jews out of pubs
and beat them up in the streets.

165
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,337
Jewish self-defence groups fought back.

166
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:14,895
A Dutch Nazi was killed,
a Gestapo man injured.

167
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:22,000
As a reprisal, the Germans
snatched 400 young Jews

168
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,567
at random off the street, beat them up,

169
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:29,636
and sent them off to Mauthausen,
already known to be a death camp.

170
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:35,460
A Communist street cleaner, Piet Nak,
following his party's instructions,

171
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:39,985
stood up in the street
and urged Amsterdammers to protest.

172
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,056
(speaks Dutch)

173
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,704
(translator) What drove me personally,
but I think the other people too,

174
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,996
we were filled
with an overwhelming hate.

175
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,614
We'd never seen anything like that
in Amsterdam.

176
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,103
Lots of people,
just because they were Jewish,

177
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:59,288
men, women and children -
there were no exceptions.

178
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,356
People just arrested and beaten up.

179
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:06,724
You see... Well, what would you do
if you saw someone in the water?

180
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:09,758
Of course you'd dive in and get him out.

181
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,789
You don't ask if the water's clean
or dirty. You are filled with anger.

182
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:16,323
There was nothing we could do
but go on strike.

183
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,535
I wouldn't have known what else
we could do. There was no other way.

184
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:24,868
(speaks Dutch)

185
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:32,543
(translator)
Thousands in a tightly packed column

186
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:34,885
marched through the streets
in Amsterdam,

187
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:38,218
while the Germans circled
round them in tanks.

188
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:44,200
Of course
the demonstrators weren't armed,

189
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:47,387
yet they found a weapon
in marching and singing.

190
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:53,026
So they marched along the Rozengracht
singing the Internationale.

191
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,213
(Nak speaks Dutch)

192
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,559
(translator)
The second day of the strike

193
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,510
we held a meeting
at the cleansing department.

194
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:05,497
The boss there wanted us to start work
in the afternoon of the second day,

195
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:11,062
but we had already decided
we would only go back on the third day.

196
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:16,626
(narrator) The trams,

197
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:21,373
which had signalled the start
of the strike, signalled its end.

198
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:25,410
The Germans had shot down nine people.
To continue would mean a bloodbath.

199
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:28,860
For 48 hours, workmen,
shopkeepers and businessmen

200
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:31,854
had staged a unique strike
in defence of the Jews.

201
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,919
(Nak speaks Dutch)

202
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,138
(translator) My personal opinion is,

203
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:44,968
put yourself in the place
of the Jewish people of Amsterdam.

204
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,584
They felt they'd been deserted,
left on their own,

205
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:50,684
but because of this strike
there must have been many Jews,

206
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,645
well, you can't really say many,

207
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,638
but if you ask
if it did any good, I say this:

208
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,627
if just one Jew in the gas chamber

209
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:00,778
felt that the workers of Amsterdam
had not deserted him,

210
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,887
then it wasn't for nothing.

211
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:06,913
(narrator)
Faced with such bold opposition,

212
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:10,018
the Germans now abandoned
what was left of conciliation.

213
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:13,169
The mayors of three towns
who had been lenient with strikers

214
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,616
were replaced by Dutch Nazis.

215
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:18,999
NSB leaders, though not allowed
to form a government,

216
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,331
were installed in positions of power.

217
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:26,013
The head of the Netherlands Bank
was Rost van Tonningen.

218
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:30,808
(woman)
My husband joined the NSB in 1936.

219
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:33,230
He was very interested
in the work of Hitler,

220
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:36,454
what he was doing in Germany.

221
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:42,470
In Holland, the situation
was quite different from Germany.

222
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:45,350
We have big poorness here in Holland,

223
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,496
we have no buildings,

224
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:52,601
three-quarters of the population
had no work,

225
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,899
and they had bad clothes,

226
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:59,317
so it was really not
a very good situation in Holland.

227
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:03,069
Before I joined the NSB,
I was in the youth movement.

228
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:06,528
The only difference between the NSB
and the youth movement

229
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,901
was that it was not
a political movement.

230
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:16,928
The Jeugdstorm was to bring the children
who came from poor parents together,

231
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:23,062
to give them ideals,
to work in teamwork for another person.

232
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,704
Of course, we looked
to the youth movement in Germany.

233
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:31,157
It was quite different, because a German
has a German character

234
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:33,998
and a Dutchman has a Dutch character.

235
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,946
So we tried in the movement of the NSB,

236
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,326
because we saw the ideal,

237
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,937
we saw the danger of the Bolshevism,

238
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:49,573
and our thinking was to work there,
to make them a big movement,

239
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:51,910
to try to help Europe,

240
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:57,927
as a big united Europe from several
kinds of countries who work together.

241
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,044
(man speaks Dutch)

242
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:02,535
(narrator)
Another Dutch Nazi, Woudenberg,

243
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:04,641
was put in charge of the trade unions.

244
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:11,471
My father, I think, worked
and he lived from a religious base,

245
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:15,004
without calling it God

246
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:17,267
or some other religion's name.

247
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,909
My father was a well-known man.
He was a hated man.

248
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,897
There was a possibility
for me to go to Germany,

249
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:29,848
to this National Socialistic
educating institute.

250
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:34,842
It was a school,
like Eton school or something like that.

251
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:40,592
We wore uniforms,
and we had the feeling

252
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:44,076
that we were a selected group,
better than the others.

253
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:47,960
And, you know, you feel happy
when you have that feeling.

254
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:54,126
And in a very short time
I was educated in this SS thinking,

255
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:58,393
a great Germanistic empire,
and there was no reason

256
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:03,294
for me to think about Holland
and the Netherlands in school.

257
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:09,056
I knew there should be one thing done -
this war had to be won.

258
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,656
When I had the age,
I had to be a soldier,

259
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:19,147
to fight so that we could leave behind
that little small country

260
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:25,052
and we come to new situations,
this great Germanistic empire.

261
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:28,429
- (man) Heil der Führer!
- (crowd) Heil!

262
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,648
(narrator) June 1941.

263
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,990
The NSB called for support
for Germany's attack on Russia.

264
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:38,397
Mussert urged Dutchmen
to unite for Hitler,

265
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:42,160
against Stalin, against Churchill.

266
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:45,036
(Mussert speaks Dutch)

267
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:48,294
(crowd chants)

268
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,552
(repeated drumbeat of "V"
in Morse code)

269
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:03,491
(man) Beep beep beep beep.

270
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:05,677
(conversation in Dutch)

271
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,436
(translator) First it would start,
"Beep beep beep" and "Radio Orange".

272
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,351
There you were, sitting in the dark.

273
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,425
You could only have a little light,
a candle or something,

274
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,770
and we would listen.

275
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:19,251
(radio crackles)

276
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,940
(narrator) Hundreds of thousands
risked arrest

277
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:24,479
to listen to Dutch broadcasts
from London,

278
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:26,350
their only trusted source of news.

279
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:31,608
The radio urged patriots to daub up
signs "OZO" - "Orange will win",

280
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,676
and "V" for "victory".

281
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:36,784
Goebbels started
a not very convincing countercampaign -

282
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,630
"V" stood for
"German victory on all fronts".

283
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:43,735
(man) Early in '41,
we decided to start a political cabaret.

284
00:21:43,813 --> 00:21:47,610
We looked in all the gramophone shops

285
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,946
in London for old Dutch records.

286
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,940
We used the tunes of these records

287
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,929
and put new words to the tunes,

288
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,622
so that every Dutchman
could whistle the tune

289
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:02,065
and then every other Dutchman knew
he had heard that from Radio Orange.

290
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,750
(piano plays song intro)

291
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,433
(woman sings "Lied van de watergeus")

292
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:43,074
(woman) There were two boys
who came over to England in a canoe.

293
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,264
They were introduced to me,

294
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:48,641
and they realised
all of a sudden who I was.

295
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:54,929
They looked at me in such a strange way,

296
00:22:55,012 --> 00:23:00,839
and they said, "Is that you,
this girl, this voice?"

297
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,746
And I said, "Yes."
And they said, "May I touch you?"

298
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:09,697
And I said, "Certainly." They were...

299
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:12,923
Something happened, something strange,

300
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:16,762
and all of a sudden
I realised what I meant.

301
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,748
Not I, but what this voice,

302
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:26,461
the whole thing we meant to do with it,
what happened in an occupied country.

303
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,473
(narrator) On the surface, life
in Holland seemed to go on as usual.

304
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,623
Under the patronage of Seyss-Inquart,

305
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,621
Holland's most famous conductor,
Willem Mengelberg,

306
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:46,298
still gave dazzling performances
with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.

307
00:23:46,417 --> 00:23:49,406
("Egmont Overture" - Beethoven)

308
00:23:56,851 --> 00:24:01,762
(narrator) But all the time the Germans
were steadily tightening their grip.

309
00:24:01,877 --> 00:24:05,051
By 1942, the invaders
began to fortify the coast.

310
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:09,845
They evacuated resorts where people
had holidayed only two years before.

311
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:15,639
The Germans conscripted
more and more workers for forced labour.

312
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:19,704
Those who resisted,
they imprisoned and shot.

313
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:28,075
There was no sign of an Allied victory,

314
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:31,870
no sign of when Holland
would again be free.

315
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:37,207
("Egmont Overture" - Beethoven)

316
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:45,261
German promises not to impose
their ideology were now forgotten.

317
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,515
All performing artists,
writers and painters

318
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:51,547
had to join Nazi-controlled
cultural guilds.

319
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:55,996
Only music approved by the censors
could be played.

320
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:19,282
Jewish composers were banned
and players of Jewish origin sacked.

321
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:23,622
Slowly, resistance was organised -

322
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,801
weapons and explosives for sabotage,

323
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:31,021
an underground press, printed
and distributed at terrible risk.

324
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:36,279
The few thousand men
in resistance groups

325
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,543
became Holland's conscience.

326
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:42,912
(man sings
"Kleine Greetje uit de polder")

327
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,864
(narrator) The illegal papers
urged people not to attend

328
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,966
German-sponsored all-Aryan
sports meetings.

329
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:59,262
But attendances rose -
people wanted to escape the war.

330
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,369
(song continues)

331
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:14,371
The Resistance also urged people
not to listen to German-controlled radio

332
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:17,291
which poured out pop songs
and propaganda.

333
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,933
Popular entertainers
like Eddy Christiani

334
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:23,426
walked a tightrope
between collaboration and resistance.

335
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:27,032
You must live. So to listen to music,

336
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:30,866
I know it's maybe collaboration,

337
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,205
but then the whole Dutch people
have collaborated.

338
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:39,114
You couldn't listen to another station
than the German station.

339
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,678
See what I mean?
And you can say maybe,

340
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:46,944
"I don't like the German music. I never
listened during the war to music,"

341
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:52,195
but if for one week you're at home
and it is in absolute silence,

342
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,002
you don't hear nothing at all,

343
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:59,330
then in one weak moment
you put on your radio and you hear music

344
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:02,251
and you don't care
if it's German or Chinese.

345
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,625
It's much better than to hear still
the bombing or the aeroplanes

346
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,276
or the shouting of the Germans.

347
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,226
(band plays marching tune)

348
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:12,453
It was allowed for the Dutch people
to sit down

349
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,792
and just listen to music,
but no dancing.

350
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:17,711
It was also forbidden
to make show with your orchestra.

351
00:27:17,789 --> 00:27:20,811
It was not allowed for a trumpet player
to play a muted trumpet,

352
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:26,986
you see, like, let's say,
Duke Ellington, to crow.

353
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:30,553
It was forbidden for a trumpet player
or for a saxophone player

354
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,888
to make a movement
with his instrument, like swaying.

355
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:41,876
It was forbidden to play
a higher note than a C, a written C,

356
00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:44,412
because that was all Negro music,

357
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:48,160
and they say in Germany
Negro music was music of the devil,

358
00:27:48,248 --> 00:27:52,230
and we are now a cultivated people,
and so were the Germans,

359
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:56,990
so we have to play
proper, cultivated music.

360
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,603
At that time, of course,
you had some officers

361
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,436
who were looking for nice girls.

362
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:05,002
Today you have customers in the hotel
all looking for nice girls.

363
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,188
If they want some nice girl,
you could find some nice girl.

364
00:28:08,273 --> 00:28:12,452
I still can find some nice girls today
for them if they ask for it, you know?

365
00:28:12,531 --> 00:28:16,012
But I must say, there was...

366
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:19,203
He was... How do you call it?

367
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,422
He had his office at the Museum Square

368
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:26,374
and he was, you may say,
town commander of Amsterdam,

369
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:28,557
and he was a guy, you know...

370
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:32,243
I mean, today they would say
a playboy, you know?

371
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:35,277
He was a German playboy in uniform.

372
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:39,989
He had his own two seats in one of
the cinemas and the City Theatre.

373
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:46,163
And later on, I have been many times
to the City Theatre with his card,

374
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:50,125
because those seats
was not allowed for anybody to sit down.

375
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:54,414
But two employees, like me,
youngsters, you know,

376
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,404
sat down there
at the invitation of the commander.

377
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:01,356
So we had fun about it.

378
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:04,624
(narrator) One film which had
to be shown in every Dutch town

379
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,427
was The Eternal Jew.

380
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:11,328
(Dutch newsreel) They have always moved
over the Earth like parasites.

381
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:13,484
Their journey started in Asia.

382
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:19,118
From there they moved via Russia
and the Balkans into Europe.

383
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:23,873
Halfway through the 18th century,
they were spread across Europe.

384
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,797
Towards the end of the 19th century,

385
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:30,204
they used ships
to take over America too.

386
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:37,035
Where rats appear,
they bring death and depravity.

387
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,185
They destroy human property and food.

388
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:44,475
They spread pests, leprosy,
typhus and cholera.

389
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:48,892
They're vicious, cruel cowards,
who prefer to move in big groups.

390
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:56,720
(narrator) Made in Germany,

391
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,253
the film was part
of the carefully prepared campaign

392
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,741
to foster fear and loathing of the Jews.

393
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:06,265
(Dutch newsreel)
The assimilation has reached its maximum

394
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,220
here in the second
and third generations.

395
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:13,559
They try to imitate the host people
in their appearance.

396
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:18,702
The host people
sometimes let themselves be fooled

397
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,189
and consider the Jews
to be their equals.

398
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,375
That's where the danger lies.

399
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:28,437
(narrator) In each occupied country,

400
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:32,429
the film's message was sharpened
by inserting local material.

401
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:36,037
(Dutch newsreel)
These assimilated Dutch Jews

402
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,148
are and always will be strange elements

403
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:41,753
in the organism of the host people,
no matter how hard they try.

404
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:44,627
(narrator) The Germans
were now putting into effect

405
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:47,778
their plan to destroy
all the Jews in Europe.

406
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:51,958
The local population
had first to be won over to cooperation,

407
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:53,987
or at least to acquiescence.

408
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:56,636
There were 140,000 Jews in Holland.

409
00:30:56,719 --> 00:31:01,279
In May 1942, they were ordered
to wear the yellow Star of David.

410
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,230
By that autumn,
they were being rounded up

411
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:06,529
and on their way to concentration camps.

412
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:09,524
It was forbidden for Jewish people
to go to the movies,

413
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,786
to go to the park, to go to anything.

414
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,352
But my brother discovered
it was for a long time possible

415
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:18,461
to rent a boat
and do some sailing on the Amstel.

416
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:21,110
One Saturday a little boy
fell in the water

417
00:31:21,194 --> 00:31:25,252
and immediately my brother jumped
after the boy and brought him out,

418
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:29,706
and it was the son of a Fascist
living in our street.

419
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,427
The mother of that little boy

420
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:39,177
was very, very thankful to
that Jewish boy who saved her only son,

421
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:44,325
and she said to him,
"If I ever can do something for you,

422
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,235
then come to my house."

423
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,768
And he went away but...

424
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:55,065
He was not yet downstairs,
immediately he went back, and he said,

425
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:58,090
"You said something maybe I can use."

426
00:31:58,174 --> 00:32:00,705
"Please write me a note
that I saved your son."

427
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:04,001
"That's the only thing I ask."
She said, "I'll do that for you."

428
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:05,805
And I remember her letter,

429
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:09,605
in which she wrote that that boy
saved her only child,

430
00:32:09,683 --> 00:32:13,435
with German greetings, Heil Hitler,
she wrote under that letter.

431
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,279
And I remember my mother,
she was so mad at him.

432
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:18,463
She hit him. She said, "You are crazy."

433
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:22,069
"Why did you do that for?
Now they know your address."

434
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,441
"Maybe they are coming tomorrow."

435
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:27,900
She didn't realise
they had all the addresses.

436
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:29,705
And...

437
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,003
Well, one day we were actually hauled,
all of us,

438
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,764
and were brought to the theatre.

439
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,641
There were tables
and there were people writing things,

440
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,678
and there were sacks, and there was...

441
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,322
It was terrible. But anyhow...

442
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:47,081
There was a man
looking at us, looking...

443
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,730
"Is that your family?"

444
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,638
"All right.
You can go home, all of you."

445
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:58,046
And this was really unbelievable,

446
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:01,581
to walk on the street again
at six o'clock in the morning,

447
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:02,808
to be free again.

448
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:08,411
But for the first time,
now we were absolutely safe.

449
00:33:08,491 --> 00:33:11,557
We were in their hands
and they sent us home.

450
00:33:11,637 --> 00:33:15,314
We were tired, but we never go to bed.
No, my mother made coffee.

451
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,807
We felt so safe, yes.

452
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,879
They hauled us from our house,
you know how many times?

453
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:25,977
11 times they played
that game of cat and mouse with us.

454
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:30,468
We knew exactly how it went.
Then the man came, he sent us home.

455
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:33,266
The last time he said
it was now long enough,

456
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:37,179
that game ten times, 11 times,
for only one child.

457
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:40,633
The whole family Koopman
must go to Vught now.

458
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,664
(narrator) Loads of Jews
in goods wagons

459
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:47,116
arrived at transit camps
at Vught and Westerbork.

460
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,773
Their names and papers
were checked by clerks,

461
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:04,034
some of them themselves Jews.

462
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:08,064
Then they were sent east,
supposedly to be resettled.

463
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:13,206
In fact, to be gassed and cremated
in Sobibór and Auschwitz.

464
00:34:16,238 --> 00:34:19,915
The Resistance
called for strikes and sabotage.

465
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:24,978
Railwaymen and police,
under German control, did not respond.

466
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,744
The trains ran on time.

467
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:36,367
Of Holland's 140,000 Jews,
105,000 perished.

468
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:42,784
(Van Der Deen) I came there on
the platform and there were 24 people -

469
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:46,734
young and old, ladies, children, men -

470
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:50,609
chained together in an iron chain.

471
00:34:50,686 --> 00:34:54,483
And they were, of course,
transported to Germany to be gassed.

472
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,703
Four Germans were there -
three at one side with Tommy guns,

473
00:34:57,783 --> 00:35:00,467
and one on the other side of the group.

474
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:04,026
I was alone, it was 12 o'clock,

475
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:07,561
you were in the midst of a city
on a railway platform.

476
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:11,395
What could you do?
If I could, by surprise,

477
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:14,162
shoot down the three,
the other man was there.

478
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,848
With my pistol, I was helpless.

479
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:18,726
But even when you got all four,

480
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:23,290
what can you do with 24 people
who are all linked together

481
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,781
in the midst of the day
after a shooting party

482
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:28,930
in a place that's crowded with Germans?

483
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,465
So you walk away.

484
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:35,022
And that is absolutely terrible,

485
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:37,749
and if you have that experience,

486
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:43,845
you have a new stimulus to risk yourself
for the few possibilities we had.

487
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:46,496
I stayed for a long time in Vught.

488
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:52,024
Till the last Jewish prisoners,
I stay in Vught.

489
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:54,133
And...

490
00:35:54,213 --> 00:36:00,116
Well, you see, Maurice,
the boy who tried to save us,

491
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:03,144
must leave me, which was terrible.

492
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:07,025
My parents after four weeks,
but he after...

493
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:08,935
Nine months, we stayed together.

494
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:13,734
And he took care of me like my father
should have done, or my husband.

495
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:15,654
I had not a husband at that time.

496
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:19,029
It was touching, the way
he tried to take care of his sister.

497
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,827
He worked in the night.
He was very left-handed.

498
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,125
He tried to sew things
for other prisoners

499
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:29,542
just to get a little bit more food -
that dreadful food - for his sister.

500
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:35,327
And after nine months he had to go,
and I should have gone with him,

501
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:38,709
but it was not allowed
because I had roodvonk.

502
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:41,970
I don't know...
scarlet fever, I had that.

503
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,076
And that was one of the dirty things
of the Germans -

504
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:49,952
when you were sick
you couldn't go to the gas chamber.

505
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:52,059
No. First you had to recover.

506
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:54,550
They gave you the illusion
nothing happened

507
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,924
because they don't send you
on a transport

508
00:36:57,011 --> 00:36:59,345
when you are sick. So I had to...

509
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,567
My brother, he came
to say goodbye to me.

510
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,758
I was looking at him and I was thinking,

511
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,171
"For heaven's sake, he can't go,
not in these poor clothes."

512
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:13,499
He was small, you see,
and I gave him one of my jackets,

513
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:17,762
and I was thinking, "It's closing
the other way around, but who cares?"

514
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,364
And I gave him a pair of my boots.
And...

515
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:29,417
I looked at him when he walked away
from the barrack, at his back,

516
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:32,373
and from the back he looked like me,

517
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:36,560
and I was sure I'd never see him again.

518
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,624
I was sure.

519
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:41,889
We failed as a nation.

520
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:45,342
We didn't make one milieu with the Jews.

521
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:51,599
We did it, a part of the group did it,
of the Netherlands, far too late.

522
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:54,317
We had been neutral
in the First World War,

523
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,389
we thought we should be neutral
in the Second World War -

524
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:59,073
all this stupid nonsense.

525
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:04,372
And then, having a sense of protest

526
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,702
isn't the same thing
as translating it to relevant action.

527
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,240
(marching music)

528
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,753
(narrator) As the war went on,

529
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,519
the Germans stepped up appeals

530
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:22,670
for recruits to fight with them
in Russia.

531
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:25,619
In all, 25,000 Dutchmen volunteered -

532
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:30,068
in proportion to its size, the biggest
contingent from any occupied country.

533
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:34,372
Only half returned.

534
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:57,886
At the same time,
German decrees forced able-bodied men

535
00:38:57,965 --> 00:39:02,068
to report as conscript labour
to work in German war factories.

536
00:39:07,402 --> 00:39:09,769
Rather than be separated
from their families,

537
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:12,459
tens of thousands
now tried to go into hiding.

538
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:18,900
Police spot checks on papers
made draft-dodging difficult.

539
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,786
Another problem
was the ration-card system

540
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:25,351
administered by Dutch civil servants.

541
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:29,763
One of their tasks was to keep
a vigilant lookout for irregularities.

542
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:33,477
This was because the Resistance,
now bigger and better organised,

543
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:38,082
forged stamps and stole ration books
to feed the growing numbers in hiding.

544
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:43,416
(woman) We had special organisations
providing people with hiding places,

545
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,759
and they knew our address.

546
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:52,627
So when they had somebody
who had to be hidden at once,

547
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,347
they knew they could always
bring them to us

548
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:59,184
because we always had
two sleeping places

549
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:04,439
reserved for such urgent cases, you see?

550
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:08,243
And most of the time
they were people who didn't stay long,

551
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,190
sometimes for a weekend,
and then, in the meantime,

552
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:15,759
they tried to find another safer place
for them where they could stay.

553
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,556
(man) In a small room, I think...

554
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,001
Well, some... four yards, five yards,

555
00:40:25,084 --> 00:40:30,714
there were nine people, I think,
sometimes 11,

556
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,813
and people from other surroundings.

557
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:41,271
We hadn't to do a single thing.

558
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,944
Peeling potatoes,
that kind of thing, you could do.

559
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,510
Reading books
from the Christian library.

560
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:51,473
I played chess with my wife.

561
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:59,148
I studied chess with the books
my friends sent from Amsterdam.

562
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:05,588
But it was horribly like hell itself,

563
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:11,225
as Sartre puts it in Huis Clos,

564
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:18,473
sitting together with people
who you get to dislike more and more

565
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,699
every minute of the day,

566
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,493
with all tensions.

567
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:31,985
And the only one way of escape
was going to sleep.

568
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:37,083
Early in the morning
you went to the bureau.

569
00:41:37,166 --> 00:41:39,151
We had a Bible institute at the bureau.

570
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:42,794
It was very good because we were hiding
all our explosives and weapons

571
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:45,980
behind the library
of the Bible institute.

572
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:49,743
And then at nine or nine-thirty,
you had to be there, and not later,

573
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:52,695
for that would already be...

574
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:55,768
well, uncertainty in the group -
"Where is he?"

575
00:41:55,848 --> 00:42:01,751
And then we tried to do
what was the programme of the week.

576
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:04,363
The RAF dropped plastics.

577
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:08,161
So we got such a plastic bomb,

578
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:13,912
and found a beautiful German lorry
and put it in.

579
00:42:13,993 --> 00:42:18,903
You have to destroy something
inside that bomb,

580
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,733
and then in half an hour's time
it will explode.

581
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:26,913
Now, we had no training in that,
and we didn't press too fast,

582
00:42:26,998 --> 00:42:30,369
and after nearly an hour,
it still didn't explode.

583
00:42:30,489 --> 00:42:35,082
So we went back to the bureau we had
and made another bomb,

584
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:37,700
and pressed that a little bit better.

585
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,997
It was a little bit risky to put it in

586
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,487
because if the other one would trigger
off just by a little movement,

587
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:47,938
well, I couldn't tell you
the story then. But it didn't.

588
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:52,461
And half an hour later the two of them
went together, and it was a real fire.

589
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:55,493
You need some joy to go on

590
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,907
because we had other days also

591
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:00,482
when some of the friends
would never come back.

592
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:03,204
(Bruin Slot speaks Dutch)

593
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:06,583
(translator) There were several
illegal newspapers in Holland.

594
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:08,464
(speaks Dutch)

595
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:12,176
(translator) Once, the Germans
had taken 40 of our people prisoner,

596
00:43:12,264 --> 00:43:15,984
they'd been put
in Vught concentration camp.

597
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:20,394
They interrogated one of them
and then released him

598
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,612
and sent him to us with this message:

599
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:25,454
"If you close down the paper..." -

600
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:29,525
this was near the end of the war,
probably 1944 -

601
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:35,310
"If you stop producing your paper,
then we won't shoot these people."

602
00:43:35,396 --> 00:43:37,382
(continues in Dutch)

603
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:51,658
(translator) We called a meeting
and talked it over very carefully.

604
00:43:55,536 --> 00:43:59,289
We reached the conclusion
that we had to go on.

605
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:10,112
(Van Der Veen) As soon
as some of your friends are shot,

606
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,838
you take things more serious.

607
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:15,512
If you know that this man is penetrating
into the underground forces

608
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,392
and you can shoot him
and save so many lives,

609
00:44:18,476 --> 00:44:23,387
it is terribly difficult
and a terrible responsibility.

610
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:27,642
We had the orders to kill a couple,

611
00:44:27,722 --> 00:44:30,482
a dangerous couple.

612
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,054
We were asked to shoot them
on the streets -

613
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:36,763
when they crossed a bridge,
to shoot them there and run away.

614
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:40,147
But we had a school
very near to that place,

615
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:42,715
and there were so many people
on the streets,

616
00:44:42,798 --> 00:44:46,550
that we thought,
"Let us bring them in that school

617
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:49,317
and kill them in the cellar."

618
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:54,764
And as soon as they came in that cellar
and the light was on,

619
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:57,680
we saw that the wife was pregnant.

620
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:00,476
And then we couldn't do that.

621
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,425
So we arranged - the commander
of our group and I -

622
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:07,842
that we should threaten them.

623
00:45:07,925 --> 00:45:10,871
And we did so. The man first.

624
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:14,021
We gave him a hell of a time,
I promise you.

625
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:15,933
But just threatening.

626
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:22,271
And then his wife also,
but in relationship to her situation.

627
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:27,176
We took the risk of their promises,

628
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:31,165
of stepping out of that practice
and waiting till after the war

629
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:34,041
when people could do with them
what was necessary.

630
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:38,300
(narrator) Spring 1944.

631
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:42,639
The second front,
leading to the longed-for liberation.

632
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:45,555
The Germans put up posters
warning that Allied invasion

633
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:47,582
would mean death and destruction.

634
00:45:47,705 --> 00:45:52,616
"Mother, is this the second front
Father was always talking about?"

635
00:45:56,605 --> 00:45:58,438
But the invasion came,

636
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:02,473
and by the autumn of 1944
the Allies were racing north.

637
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,843
On September 13, the first Dutch city,

638
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,570
Maastricht, in the extreme south,
was liberated.

639
00:46:07,654 --> 00:46:11,374
Resistance fighters arrested Nazis
and punished women collaborators.

640
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:17,428
But while the southern tip
of Holland rejoiced,

641
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:21,724
the rest of the country
impatiently waited for their liberation.

642
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,364
Days later, their hopes were dashed -

643
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,440
the Allies were beaten severely
at Arnhem.

644
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:38,527
The Dutch government in exile
called for a railway strike

645
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:40,826
to deny supplies to German armies.

646
00:46:40,913 --> 00:46:44,055
Railwaymen, who had hesitated before,
now came out in force,

647
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:47,163
bringing all transport to a standstill.

648
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:49,572
The Germans retaliated by cutting off

649
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:53,260
all supplies of fuel and food
to cities in western Holland.

650
00:46:56,411 --> 00:46:58,321
Soon people were scavenging

651
00:46:58,406 --> 00:47:02,388
along silent and deserted railway tracks
for bits of coal.

652
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:08,108
Shops ran out of food.
Prices soared on the black market.

653
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:10,796
People kept alive by eating tulip bulbs.

654
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:18,076
Despite the privations,
the strikers held firm.

655
00:47:19,198 --> 00:47:23,835
Using forged securities, their wages
were repaid by the Resistance,

656
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:26,829
which was by now
also hiding 300,000 men

657
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,516
wanted by the Germans for forced labour.

658
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,886
There was no electricity or gas.

659
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:38,491
Houses left vacant by Jews
were stripped of wood for use as fuel.

660
00:47:52,649 --> 00:47:54,679
As the winter got worse,

661
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:58,818
the Germans relented
and allowed emergency soup kitchens.

662
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,459
Still, it was clear
that many would starve

663
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:22,529
unless Holland was liberated.

664
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:28,894
(man) I did ask my friend Bedell Smith
to ask General Eisenhower

665
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:31,809
could they not start a separate action

666
00:48:31,893 --> 00:48:35,842
to liberate the rest of Holland,

667
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:38,452
where we had got up to the Maas

668
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,130
and then up to Nijmegen,
and that was it,

669
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:47,385
and the rest was really getting
in worse and worse trouble this winter.

670
00:48:47,468 --> 00:48:50,381
Well, at that time, pretty soon,

671
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:56,243
almost simultaneously, the German
counterattack came in the Ardennes,

672
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:59,548
which upset almost everything
one had hoped for.

673
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,374
(narrator)
Hitler now stripped Holland bare.

674
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:10,325
From Rotterdam alone
in two days in November 1944,

675
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:15,700
50,000 able-bodied men were rounded up
and removed to Germany.

676
00:49:17,543 --> 00:49:19,344
(speaks Dutch)

677
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,751
(translator) When the doorbell rang
there were two Germans.

678
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:24,713
They both came upstairs.

679
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:28,623
One stayed at the top of the stairs
and the other one came into the room.

680
00:49:28,707 --> 00:49:30,125
He looked round the room,

681
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:33,574
and the two men who were there
had to get dressed and go with them.

682
00:49:33,694 --> 00:49:37,141
And we, being women,
were crying of course, both of us -

683
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:42,247
one woman with a baby in her arms,
another hanging on her skirt.

684
00:49:42,325 --> 00:49:45,194
And I can still remember vividly
the one German

685
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:48,836
who was inside the room, he was crying.

686
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:51,487
Tears were streaming down his face
and he said,

687
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,596
"I am so terribly sorry
that I'm not alone."

688
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:58,468
"I'd love to be able to help you,
but I can't do anything

689
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:01,421
because there's someone with me
and I don't know him."

690
00:50:01,506 --> 00:50:05,303
He couldn't do it. He'd have tried
very hard to leave those two men there

691
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,402
because he thought it was terrible.

692
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,888
That was the first time
I'd ever seen a German cry.

693
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:20,947
He really cried,
big tears rolling down his face.

694
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:30,391
(narrator) That winter,
16,000 Dutch men, women and children

695
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:32,345
died of cold and hunger.

696
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,431
Still the liberators did not come.
