2
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,103
(narrator) Winston Churchill
once told Stalin:

3
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,743
"The Mediterranean is the soft
underbelly of the crocodile."

4
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:14,512
Churchill and the British
Chiefs of Staff believed

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,273
that attacking German-occupied
Europe through Italy

6
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,566
would help shorten the war.

7
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:22,258
The Americans were not convinced,

8
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:25,902
preferring to focus on the decisive
blow across the English Channel.

9
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:30,468
Only reluctantly did they agree
to join their British allies

10
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:31,693
on the road to Rome.

11
00:01:30,738 --> 00:01:32,494
November, 1942.

12
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:35,181
11 months after Pearl Harbour,

13
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:39,400
the American army prepared for its
first encounter with the Wehrmacht.

14
00:01:44,624 --> 00:01:48,105
Operation Torch - codename
for the Anglo-American landings

15
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:51,792
in the French North African colonies
of Morocco and Algeria.

16
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,544
They met little or no resistance
from the forces of Vichy France.

17
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:02,151
The French command soon broke
with the government of PÃ©tain

18
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:06,139
and their troops
became part of the Allied army.

19
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,820
An American general,
Dwight D Eisenhower,

20
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:13,848
was supreme commander.

21
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,802
The American planners
were never keen on the operation,

22
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,178
but President Roosevelt was determined

23
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:23,596
to get his ground forces
into action against Hitler in 1942.

24
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,469
Attacking the Germans in Tunisia

25
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:30,154
was the next best thing to
a second front in Europe.

26
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:42,088
At Casablanca,
within two months of the landings,

27
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:47,077
an impressive array of British
and American top brass assembled.

28
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,433
The Russians were not present,

29
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,878
but everybody there knew
they had to do something

30
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,105
to take the pressure off the Red Army.

31
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:07,865
Churchill and Roosevelt had now to
decide where they went from here.

32
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:11,468
At the beginning of 1943,

33
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:15,381
the British and Americans
were firmly established in North Africa.

34
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:18,182
Hitler reinforced Rommel's forces
in Tunisia,

35
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,407
but with the British Eighth Army
closing from the east,

36
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,359
it could only be a matter of time

37
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:27,044
before the entire African coastline
was in Allied hands.

38
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,392
What then?

39
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:33,025
We have to face the fact that there was
a big difference between the two sides

40
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:37,977
about what the future strategy
of the war would be.

41
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:43,614
The British, the British
Chiefs of Staff, Churchill,

42
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:48,985
were all in favour
of the future of the campaign

43
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,284
being carried out through Italy

44
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:57,383
and hitting at the underside
of the underbelly of the Germans,

45
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,995
moving up and eventually joining up
with the Russians.

46
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:05,179
The Americans held
exactly the opposite view.

47
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:09,475
They felt the only way
that you could defeat Germany

48
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:14,148
was to take the shortest way into the
centre of Germany, across the Channel,

49
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:19,827
and advance into the areas
of the Ruhr and Saar,

50
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:21,974
the great industrial areas,

51
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:26,310
and then destroy the German forces
by that means.

52
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,497
(narrator) The British,
led by Sir Alan Brooke,

53
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:31,450
Chief of the Imperial General Staff,

54
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:35,365
came to Casablanca determined
to have their way. They got it.

55
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,201
The Americans, under Marshall,
were persuaded that the next objective

56
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:41,008
would be the invasion of Sicily,

57
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:43,728
leading, it was hoped,
to the surrender of Italy.

58
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,448
Thus the main second front
was postponed for another year.

59
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,054
At the time, however, the big news
from the Casablanca conference

60
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:55,540
was an unexpected pronouncement
by the American president.

61
00:04:55,627 --> 00:05:00,035
(man) Mr Roosevelt began by saying
that when he was a young man

62
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:05,636
the great reputation in the American
military was General Grant,

63
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:07,855
who had once sent an order

64
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:12,458
saying that he would accept no terms
but unconditional surrender,

65
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:17,455
and that these in fact were the terms
that the Allies, or the United Nations,

66
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:20,368
wanted to present to their enemies.

67
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,318
He then went on
as though he did not understand

68
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,691
how important a statement he had made.

69
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:32,645
Mr Churchill looked
considerably surprised at this.

70
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:35,515
And I think that Mr Churchill felt that

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,269
it was not the best way to present
the Allied position to the enemy.

72
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:44,535
However, as he said then and later,
he was Mr Roosevelt's ardent lieutenant

73
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,982
and he would go along with it.

74
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:59,300
(narrator) After the talking, Roosevelt
appeared in his other capacity -

75
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:03,061
commander in chief
of the American armed forces.

76
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,911
If this confident-looking American
army crossed the Atlantic

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,909
expecting to carry all before it,

78
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:19,398
it was very soon cruelly disillusioned.

79
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:29,602
In a sudden onslaught
through the Kassarine Pass in Tunisia,

80
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,440
Rommel inflicted on the American army
one of its worst defeats of the war.

81
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:57,574
The Afrikakorps was far too
well-equipped and experienced

82
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:02,641
for the lightly armoured
and underpowered American tanks.

83
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:09,316
The morale of these raw young
Americans was badly shaken.

84
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,761
Many were taken prisoner.

85
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,638
(Middleton) It brought the troops
face to face

86
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,669
with the fact that this
was going to be a long war

87
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,012
and a tough one
and the Germans were very good.

88
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:40,272
Armies never learn from other armies,
they have to learn by themselves,

89
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:44,334
and a lot of the tactics
that we used disastrously at Kassarine

90
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:47,752
were those that the British army
had used equally disastrously

91
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:51,051
two years before in the western desert,
then discarded.

92
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:54,273
I think it helped our army
and made them realise,

93
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:57,190
because the British came down
from the north and did help,

94
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,066
that this was going to be a cooperative
effort, that we couldn't win it alone.

95
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:04,624
Also, it got the average GI
accustomed to the fact

96
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,084
that there would be one battle
after another.

97
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,807
(narrator) But Rommel lacked
the strength to exploit his victory.

98
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:16,751
The Allies, under Alexander, regrouped
and within ten days retook the path.

99
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,823
The Germans in Tunisia
were now hemmed in.

100
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,433
The Allied sea and air blockade
of the coastline

101
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,348
made large-scale evacuation impossible.

102
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:28,416
In the south, a forward patrol
of the Eighth Army

103
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:31,059
linked up with the American
Second Corps.

104
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,172
The trap closed.

105
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:40,152
Two Allied forces, once separated
by 2,000 miles of mountain and desert,

106
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:45,144
joined hands for the final onslaught
on the German position in Africa.

107
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,443
The Allied armies, vastly superior
in numbers, drove the enemy,

108
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,244
now without Rommel who had been
invalided home, back towards the sea.

109
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,131
The Allied air forces
had undisputed control.

110
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:24,464
In seven days it was all over.

111
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:59,906
Finally, the Afrikakorps saw no point
in fighting to the last man.

112
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:02,900
They surrendered in droves.

113
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,915
The unfortunate General von Arnim,
who succeeded Rommel,

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,142
also surrendered with all his staff.

115
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:16,474
Nearly a quarter of a million men
were taken prisoner -

116
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,964
a victory to rank alongside Stalingrad.

117
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:26,106
This was a major boost for the British
and their Mediterranean strategy.

118
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:35,426
Sicily, as agreed at Casablanca,
was the next item on the agenda.

119
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,423
Only two months
after the German collapse in Tunisia,

120
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:44,329
the British and Americans began
landing troops on Sicilian beaches.

121
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,458
The British were led by Montgomery,
the Americans by General Patton -

122
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:57,946
the first time these
egocentric personalities

123
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,749
had been involved
in the same campaign.

124
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:22,071
It was the British Eighth Army which
met the fiercest German resistance.

125
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:27,712
On their left, Patton's Americans
swept across Sicily in style.

126
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:35,047
They found useful allies in the Mafia

127
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,031
and family connections
among the civilian population.

128
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:41,645
(man) The situation was relieved
somewhat

129
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:44,974
by the fact that there
was hardly a family in Sicily

130
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,510
that didn't have relatives
in the United States.

131
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:51,345
(narrator) The Sicilian landing,
bringing the war on to their own soil,

132
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:54,298
convinced most Italians
that theirs was a lost cause.

133
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,022
Giving themselves up,
if possible by the regiment,

134
00:11:57,106 --> 00:12:01,590
became the first objective
of Italy's armed forces.

135
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,485
Allied raids on Rome provided another
argument for getting out of the war.

136
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,424
Benito Mussolini, il Duce for 20 years,

137
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:22,303
was outvoted in his own
Fascist Grand Council.

138
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:29,933
On July 25th,
he was toppled from power.

139
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,113
King Victor Emmanuel approved
the elderly Marshal Badoglio

140
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:37,876
as head of the government.

141
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:42,064
Badoglio declared publicly
that the war would go on,

142
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:44,477
but immediately began
secret negotiations

143
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,850
with the Allies for surrender.

144
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:57,746
By now Sicily, after only a few weeks,
was almost all in Allied hands.

145
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:06,961
This time there was to be no great haul
of German prisoners.

146
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,975
German evacuation across the narrow
Straits of Messina was very successful.

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,255
Most of the Wehrmacht's personnel
got away to the mainland.

148
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:29,509
Even the last guard dog.

149
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,176
General Patton beat Montgomery
into Messina.

150
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,779
The Allies had landed in Sicily
not knowing where they would go next.

151
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:49,810
At the prospect of Italian collapse, the
British were for attacking the mainland.

152
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:54,406
The Americans agreed, but insisted
that Overlord, the invasion of Normandy,

153
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:57,362
must take priority for resources.

154
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:01,775
A secret envoy, General Castellano,
was sent by Badoglio

155
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:05,421
to find out on what terms
Italy could join the Allies.

156
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:07,913
But the Allies simply wanted
Italian surrender

157
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:10,756
and refused to tell Castellano
of their invasion plans -

158
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,475
partly because they didn't want
the Italians to know

159
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:15,161
how limited their forces were.

160
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,235
(Strong) All we could say
to General Castellano was this:

161
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:24,905
"Well, we will tell you
two or three hours before it happens,

162
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,132
so that you can give any assistance
you can

163
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:32,315
to the British...
to the Allied operations.

164
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:38,023
Eventually, on the 3rd September,
these terms were signed.

165
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:43,859
(narrator) On that day,
the Allies invaded.

166
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:48,272
Montgomery went across the Straits
of Messina to attack the toe of Italy,

167
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:50,152
but found no resistance.

168
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:52,184
The Germans had moved north

169
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:56,825
to counter the threat of an
Allied landing further up the coast.

170
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,382
The Italians had wanted a landing
to safeguard Rome from German attack,

171
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:06,074
but this was impossible.

172
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:09,676
The furthest north the Americans
and British felt it prudent to land

173
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,016
was nowhere near Rome,
but at Salerno,

174
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:17,122
as far as the Allied air cover
operating from Sicily could stretch.

175
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,955
The operation had been mounted
at great speed

176
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,794
to take advantage
of the confusion in Italy.

177
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,512
The forces of the American general
Mark Clark

178
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:31,196
were barely adequate
for the job they had to do.

179
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,134
On the way,
the troops heard a broadcast

180
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:41,473
- by General Eisenhower.
- (Eisenhower) The Italian government

181
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:44,893
has surrendered its armed forces
unconditionally.

182
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:49,534
As Allied commander in chief,
I have granted a military armistice.

183
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,223
The armistice was signed
by my representatives

184
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,832
and the representative
of Marshal Badoglio.

185
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:57,517
And it becomes effective this instant.

186
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,580
(cheering)

187
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:09,900
(narrator) The surrender of his allies
did not take Hitler by surprise.

188
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:13,051
He'd already moved reinforcements
into northern Italy.

189
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,313
Here the Italians were quickly disarmed

190
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:19,725
under a plan ironically codenamed
Operation Axis.

191
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:25,283
At this point, Hitler had not decided
just where he would hold the line.

192
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:29,889
The Germans entered Rome to find it
a capital without a government.

193
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:33,845
Badoglio and his ministers had avoided
the risk of being shot for treachery

194
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:37,523
by leaping into their cars
and driving away.

195
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,079
South of Rome, Clark's invasion force
was nearing the beaches.

196
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,801
(man) Salerno, if you go in on a boat,

197
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:53,521
you look at the mountains that hem you
in and the passes through which you go.

198
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:55,817
The enemy would be
looking down your throat.

199
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:00,958
(narrator) The Germans
were ready and waiting.

200
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:18,572
After 48 hours, the Germans
launched a furious counterattack.

201
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,638
The situation became so precarious,

202
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,665
Clark ordered plans
for possible re-embarkation.

203
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,964
But with massive support
from air and sea,

204
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:48,142
the Salerno invaders
just managed to hold on.

205
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,855
After a week of savage fighting,
the Germans withdrew.

206
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:23,745
(Strong) It required the intervention
of all the air forces

207
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,932
to save us at Salerno.

208
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,924
Of all General Eisenhower's battles,

209
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:37,166
that is the one where I think
we were nearest to a tactical defeat.

210
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:39,544
I've never had any doubts in my mind

211
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:42,850
that it was a completely successful
operation.

212
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,069
We were ordered to go in there,

213
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:48,876
we were ordered to seize a bridgehead.
We did it.

214
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:54,856
We were ordered to capture the port of
Naples - we did that within three weeks.

215
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,540
(narrator) So far, so good.

216
00:19:57,623 --> 00:20:01,497
At least a large part of southern Italy
was in Allied hands.

217
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,866
(cheering)

218
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:16,991
Naples was desperately short of food.

219
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:20,903
There were bread riots.

220
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:27,194
Water was scarce.

221
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:41,581
There was a typhus epidemic.

222
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:57,313
The advance continued, but just ahead
lay the line of real German resistance.

223
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:01,449
The Allied commanders had hoped
Hitler would withdraw further north.

224
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:04,675
Instead, greatly encouraged
by his near-victory at Salerno,

225
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:09,780
he had decided to fight here,
in the mountains south of Rome.

226
00:21:19,755 --> 00:21:22,515
Like a bad lira,
Mussolini turned up again.

227
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:26,119
He was hoisted from his hiding place
by a German rescue party

228
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:28,922
and taken to Hitler.

229
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,983
The FÃ¼hrer was aghast
at his appearance,

230
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:36,094
but thought he might come in useful

231
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:40,004
to encourage the Fascists
in German-occupied Italy.

232
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:57,803
The German forces in Italy
were led by Kesselring,

233
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,756
one of the war's ablest
defensive commanders.

234
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:03,558
Kesselring had a lot going for him.

235
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:07,012
The rocky spine which runs
almost the whole length of Italy

236
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:12,341
meant the Allies had to advance along
the coastal plains on either side.

237
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:16,714
The only way to outflank the Germans
was by amphibious landings.

238
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,436
But by now the necessary landing craft
were earmarked for Normandy.

239
00:22:41,197 --> 00:22:44,492
As they went north
to their prepared defensive positions,

240
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:49,242
Kesselring's men destroyed
the only lines of communication.

241
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:04,594
In the towns, the Germans
left booby traps. This was Naples.

242
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:26,492
They were well-trained troops. They were
tenacious troops, they were well led.

243
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:31,603
And one point I like to make is
they were homogenous -

244
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:34,441
they were all of one nationality.

245
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,044
They were all equipped with the same
weapons and ammunition.

246
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:42,413
They ate the same food. They believed
pretty much in the same god.

247
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:47,097
I had 16 different nationalities
with me,

248
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,054
some of whom couldn't eat this
and couldn't eat that,

249
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:54,464
and some that didn't want to fight on
Fridays or some other day of the week,

250
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:58,832
and the British,
with their infantry weapons

251
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:01,940
and your artillery
completely different from ours.

252
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:07,240
You couldn't move them with ease from
front to front like the Germans could.

253
00:24:09,812 --> 00:24:13,915
(narrator) Winter. The Allied ground
commander Alexander and his colleagues

254
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:18,663
were faced with the unpleasant realities
of their Mediterranean strategy.

255
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:23,194
The Eighth Army, accustomed to swift
advances across the desert,

256
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:26,834
could only manage
a few hundred yards a day.

257
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:41,649
Across the mountain,
Clark's Fifth Army was also mud-bound.

258
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:45,984
(man) They issued us galoshes
after the rains had stopped.

259
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:48,781
If anybody was in the galoshes business,

260
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:52,160
he could have found millions
along the roadside,

261
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,460
because you couldn't walk with them.

262
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:57,073
It was impossible
to go through that mud.

263
00:24:59,184 --> 00:25:03,133
(narrator) This was not the sunny Italy
of the travel posters.

264
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:10,490
(man) The only way an infantryman
was coming out of those mountains

265
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:11,793
was to be carried out.

266
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:16,595
That's why it was actually desirable
to get wounded.

267
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:26,140
(narrator) Dreadful weather, difficult
terrain, determined German resistance.

268
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:30,746
To the men in the mud, this combination
did not match up to Churchill's vision.

269
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:35,349
(Clark) I can see him now at his map
and his persuasive way with his pointer,

270
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:39,614
pointing out the "soft belly"
of the Mediterranean.

271
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:43,752
After we got in there, I often thought
of what a tough old gut it was,

272
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,897
instead of the soft belly
he had led us to believe.

273
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:03,782
(narrator) Before the end of 1943,

274
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:06,851
the Allies were hammering
at Kesselring's Winter Line.

275
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:12,484
Alexander had 11 divisions, Kesselring
nine, with eight more in reserve.

276
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:36,843
Every small mountain village
had to be fought for.

277
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,446
In December, the American 36th Division
tried to take San Pietro.

278
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:18,736
(man) It was one of the things
that most of our fighting was in Italy.

279
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,806
You got into a position, you dug in
and you just stayed.

280
00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:27,833
I mean, we'd shoot at them
and they'd shoot at us.

281
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:33,433
And it was only when they were ready
to leave that we moved forward.

282
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,370
(narrator) After ten days,
the Americans took San Pietro -

283
00:27:43,448 --> 00:27:45,433
at heavy cost.

284
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,803
In any unit, you would have
a Graves Registration Unit,

285
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:11,136
and their job was to go round
picking up bodies.

286
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:15,553
And what they would do,
if someone had been hastily buried,

287
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,241
they would disinter him,
or if he was just lying there,

288
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,491
they'd pick him up and slide them
into the mattress covers,

289
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:25,145
pile them up into the trucks

290
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:29,282
and take them off
to a temporary cemetery somewhere.

291
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:34,036
I suppose some people got buried
as many as four or five times that way,

292
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:38,641
which is kind of unfortunate, really.

293
00:28:38,765 --> 00:28:43,053
I always thought people
should be left where they were.

294
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:18,545
(narrator) The Italian people
had once been told by Mussolini:

295
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:24,679
"War puts the stamp of nobility on those
who have the courage to meet it."

296
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,769
At Tehran in November 1943,

297
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:51,034
Roosevelt and Stalin overruled Churchill

298
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:54,062
and at last fixed a definite date
for the landing in France:

299
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:56,251
May 1944.

300
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,050
Italy was to become a sideshow.

301
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:02,930
But after Tehran, Churchill refused
to accept the deadlock in Italy.

302
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:07,143
He got on to Roosevelt
and persuaded him to lend landing craft

303
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:09,257
for a new amphibious landing.

304
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:12,281
The plan was in two stages.

305
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:16,426
First, Mark Clark's Fifth Army
would attack the Germans at Cassino,

306
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:19,762
draw their forces southward,
drain their reserves.

307
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:23,722
Then the amphibious troops would strike
behind their lines at Anzio,

308
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,255
just 22 miles south of Rome.

309
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:30,128
At Cassino, the Germans
held the high ground.

310
00:30:30,206 --> 00:30:33,119
They could see everything
that moved in the valley below.

311
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,220
The Fifth Army attacked
on January 20th.

312
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:41,444
Its troops had not been reinforced.
They were cold, wet, exhausted.

313
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,359
The attack failed disastrously.

314
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:47,384
But the second stage of the plan
went ahead two days later -

315
00:30:47,469 --> 00:30:49,454
the assault on Anzio.

316
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,941
Having gone into Salerno
with not enough troops -

317
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:58,430
no commander ever has
what he thinks he ought to have -

318
00:30:58,517 --> 00:31:02,499
I was determined that if I was to be
the commander going into Anzio,

319
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:06,380
or be the overall commander, that we
should not go in on a shoestring.

320
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,431
I went in with one and two-thirds
division, which was totally inadequate.

321
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,614
But that's the way
the ball bounces in war.

322
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,839
You do what you're told to do,

323
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:22,144
or they'll get somebody else
that will do it.

324
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:29,732
(narrator) The Germans
expected the landing,

325
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,696
but had no idea where it would come.

326
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:35,110
They did not have enough troops
to cover all possible beaches.

327
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,562
The Anzio force
was completely unopposed.

328
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:43,012
(man) Nothing. An odd bang
in the distance, but nothing.

329
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:46,967
And when dawn broke,
we'd got complete surprise.

330
00:31:49,346 --> 00:31:53,557
And a few minutes later, along the road,
there came a marvellous drunken car,

331
00:31:53,642 --> 00:31:55,017
swaying back and forth,

332
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,203
full of happy Germans who'd had a night
out in Rome and were staggering back,

333
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:01,540
and couldn't believe they were captured.

334
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:05,222
They said, "Kameraden"
and they kept on embracing me.

335
00:32:05,304 --> 00:32:07,257
Finally they put them in the clink too.

336
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:10,288
And that was the landing -
complete surprise.

337
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:18,262
(narrator) The Anzio beachhead
was consolidated in an eerie calm.

338
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:38,294
After Salerno, it seemed incredible that
there was no instant German riposte.

339
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,903
Perhaps now was the time
for a lightning dash,

340
00:32:40,981 --> 00:32:43,927
in the style of General Patton,
for the gates of Rome.

341
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:47,001
But the American commander at Anzio
was no Patton.

342
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,065
General Lucas was a cautious man

343
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,632
who believed the beachhead
must be secured before striking inland.

344
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:55,360
Alexander did not overrule him.

345
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:13,119
Churchill complained, "I thought we'd
flung a wildcat into the Alban Hills,

346
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:16,346
but instead we got a whale
floundering on the beach."

347
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,329
There were only two battalions

348
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:29,693
and some very old-fashioned
coast batteries

349
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:32,423
at the coast for defending.

350
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,446
If the Americans

351
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:41,046
had realised the situation,

352
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:46,729
they could stay on the evening
of the landing day in Rome.

353
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:51,948
General Lucas could, but he would have
soon been met by an overwhelming force

354
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:55,163
which would have defeated him,
no question about it.

355
00:33:55,249 --> 00:34:00,541
So we had to dig in on the biggest
perimeter we could possibly digest,

356
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:02,910
and wait for the onslaught which came.

357
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:09,898
(narrator) Caught off-balance,
as he often was by Alexander,

358
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,703
Kesselring recovered fast.

359
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,460
Spurred on by Hitler's demands

360
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,725
for the immediate liquidation
of the "Anzio abscess",

361
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:21,864
he threw all he had
into the counterattack.

362
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:23,704
If Anzio were eliminated,

363
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,776
perhaps the Allies would think again
about crossing the English Channel.

364
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:05,141
Allied advance units which
had spread out from the beaches

365
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,897
were overwhelmed
by the weight of the German attack.

366
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:13,503
(Vaughan-Thomas) There was one unit
that simply packed in -

367
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,223
folded their coats
and handed themselves over.

368
00:35:16,307 --> 00:35:17,834
They couldn't take it any more.

369
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:20,787
They were young and hadn't
seen this sort of thing before.

370
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,125
And I don't blame them one little scrap.

371
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:35,095
(narrator) Two American Ranger
battalions were captured

372
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:38,705
and humiliatingly paraded
through the streets of Rome.

373
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,425
The beachhead could only be relieved

374
00:36:10,512 --> 00:36:13,272
by breaking through
the German defensive line

375
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:15,921
which ran through
the monastery of Monte Cassino.

376
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:18,027
Perched high above the valley,

377
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:22,438
an observation post here could see
everything that moved for miles around.

378
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,457
The Allies believed, wrongly,
that the monastery had been fortified.

379
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,676
(man) It was the general view

380
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:36,668
and the general belief of the troops
involved on that front

381
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:39,239
that the monastery at Cassino

382
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:42,616
was being used for military purposes
by the Germans.

383
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:45,419
That being the case,

384
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:50,053
and it also being part
of my military philosophy,

385
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:51,939
and a great many other people's,

386
00:36:52,057 --> 00:36:54,741
that you must not put troops into battle

387
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:59,730
without giving them all possible
physical and material support you can

388
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:02,599
to give them the best chance
of getting a success.

389
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,999
On February 15th, 1944,

390
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:15,525
over 200 Allied bombers
pounded the monastery into rubble.

391
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:52,968
The air and ground attacks
were badly coordinated,

392
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:58,377
giving the Germans time to swarm into
the rubble - ideal cover for defence.

393
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:02,905
The Gustav Line was held.

394
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:15,569
At Anzio, Kesselring
flung ten German divisions

395
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,638
against the Allies' four and a half.

396
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:21,745
Hitler hoped Anzio would be a
turning point in Germany's fortunes.

397
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:24,158
He promised the unit
that broke through

398
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,266
the honour of escorting Allied prisoners
through the streets of Berlin.

399
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:49,169
Massed waves of German infantry
were flung in.

400
00:38:49,252 --> 00:38:53,355
(Vaughan-Thomas) They came over a
moon landscape, pitted, wrecked tanks,

401
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,309
abandoned Jeeps along the road,

402
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,718
and I still to this day
don't understand the German tactics.

403
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:02,023
There was a moment you could see them
leaving their lines

404
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,362
Iike the old films of the Somme battle,

405
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:07,051
and falling down as our machine guns
took them.

406
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,515
(narrator) The German offensive
lasted four days.

407
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,930
In the end, the Allied superiority
in heavy guns tipped the balance.

408
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:31,177
It was finally beaten back.

409
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,326
The Germans had pulled back,

410
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,247
but the Allies still lacked
the strength to break out.

411
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,354
It was stalemate.

412
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:09,844
(Vaughan-Thomas)
We then had to form trenches,

413
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:15,289
and Anzio then became an old-fashioned
World War I trench system.

414
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,556
And they were bombed
and they were mortared

415
00:40:17,637 --> 00:40:19,547
and then they had to do
trench patrols

416
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,417
and occasionally, keen generals used
to send up people to try and find out

417
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:26,876
who was opposite us
and do a trench raid.

418
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:30,058
It was right out of Journey's End.

419
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:36,352
(narrator) The two front lines
were only yards apart.

420
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,765
A couple of fellows were cleaning this
machine gun, got it all to pieces and...

421
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,976
An Irish fellow named Tommy McGough
was there and he looked up and said:

422
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,861
"Bloody Jesus Christ!"

423
00:40:49,017 --> 00:40:52,116
He rushed for this gun,
trying to put the barrel back on,

424
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:54,263
he put it on upside down and all sorts.

425
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:57,797
Of course, I just looked and I said,
"Quite all right, Tommy."

426
00:40:57,878 --> 00:41:03,552
I could see this fellow was... I go down
to the wire. He speaks good English.

427
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,464
He says, "Where's Fred?"
I said, "He's gone."

428
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:09,347
I said, "It's quite all right,
what have you got?"

429
00:41:09,464 --> 00:41:11,220
Danish pork and fresh lemons.

430
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,487
Of course,
I gave him a tin of bully beef.

431
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:17,442
We got talking to him about
the position and the war and all that.

432
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,041
- He come from a place near Emden?
- (man) Emden, yes.

433
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,917
And at the time,
this city had a thousand-bomber raid.

434
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:29,521
I said,
"Oh, you've had the bugger then?"

435
00:41:29,603 --> 00:41:31,284
"You've had it."

436
00:41:31,368 --> 00:41:34,619
"No, no," he said, "I come from
a little village near Emden. Me OK."

437
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:41,263
He showed me his photos of his wife. She
was a bus conductor in Emden and that.

438
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:46,939
And I said, "Why don't you pack in?
You've had it now."

439
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,849
He said, "No, Germany will not be beat."

440
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:55,220
"We shall go right down like that,
till we get near to the bottom,

441
00:41:55,306 --> 00:42:01,558
and then we shall join forces with
Britain and America and fight Russia."

442
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:04,199
After that he just went.
I never seen him any more.

443
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:06,344
He must've got relieved the next night.

444
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:24,069
At meal time, the cooks would shout,
"Grub up."

445
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:27,372
You'd go with your mess tins
down for your grub.

446
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:30,213
Before you could get down
to the cookhouse,

447
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:33,052
Anzio Annie would send one over,
a big one,

448
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,115
one of these clouds raised, you know,

449
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:40,875
and you automatically, as soon
as that burst, you'd drop to the floor.

450
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:44,130
You were always used to it.
You walked crouched.

451
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:48,314
They called it, when you were walking
about, you'd got "the Anzio crouch".

452
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,506
And as you lay there,

453
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:06,498
you used to tune in - on the radios
that you shouldn't have had -

454
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,337
and... to the voice of Sally.

455
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,595
Sally lived in Rome
and she was a great...

456
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:16,663
Well, she sounded
the most wonderful, sexy female ever.

457
00:43:16,747 --> 00:43:18,733
And she gave messages to the troops.

458
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:21,153
(deep) "Hello, hello..."

459
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:25,791
Women always think that the lower
they speak, the more sexy they sound.

460
00:43:25,877 --> 00:43:28,561
And she had the lowest register
of any woman.

461
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,346
She said, "Hello, this is Sally.
Why don't you come over and see me?"

462
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:39,375
"Private Fox - you remember him last
night? He stepped on a shoe mine."

463
00:43:39,496 --> 00:43:41,067
"Nasty things, shoe mines."

464
00:43:41,145 --> 00:43:44,473
"You could hear Private Fox yelling
for most of the night."

465
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,237
"Don't be like Private Fox,
come over to see Sally."

466
00:43:51,656 --> 00:43:53,609
There would be a smart crack overhead,

467
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,057
and down would flutter
propaganda pamphlets,

468
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:59,211
saying, "The Yanks
are lease-lending your women."

469
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,389
"They're having a lovely time
in jolly old England."

470
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,082
A picture of a naked woman
embracing an American,

471
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,063
or an American tactfully knotting
his tie while she did up her panties.

472
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:17,970
(narrator) At Cassino,
the Allies maintained the pressure,

473
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:21,377
their aim to tie up as many
German troops there as possible.

474
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:23,569
A third attempt to take the monastery

475
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,672
opened with a massive bombing attack
on Cassino town.

476
00:44:26,757 --> 00:44:31,427
500 planes went in under the sporting
codeword "Bradman Batting Tomorrow".

477
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:36,615
Among the places knocked for six was the
headquarters of the British Eighth Army.

478
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:06,958
Once again, there was poor coordination
between air and ground forces.

479
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:19,958
After the bombing,
the Germans came out of the ground

480
00:45:20,042 --> 00:45:25,214
and were in position again before the
New Zealanders launched their attack.

481
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:35,422
The German defenders
were elite paratroops.

482
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:57,788
The battle raged from house to house,
room to room, cellar to cellar.

483
00:46:14,592 --> 00:46:17,461
The New Zealanders lost 4,000 men.

484
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:25,860
The Germans still held out.

485
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:32,501
Three assaults on Monte Cassino,
three bloody failures.

486
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:37,106
Allied commanders realised they must
crush the defence by weight of numbers.

487
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:40,438
They massively reinforced
the Fifth Army.

488
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:46,156
They used, too,
an elaborate deception plan

489
00:46:46,278 --> 00:46:47,729
to make the Germans think

490
00:46:47,813 --> 00:46:51,533
they were preparing another
amphibious landing north of Rome.

491
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:55,713
The Germans weakened their
mountain defences to prepare for it.

492
00:46:55,792 --> 00:47:01,804
In May, the Allies at last outnumbered
the Germans at Cassino by three to one.

493
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,683
After an artillery barrage
by 2,000 guns, the monastery fell.

494
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:12,359
Polish troops
were the first to reach the ruins,

495
00:47:12,441 --> 00:47:14,732
where they raised their national flag.

496
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,244
The eyes of the captured Germans
told the story of their ordeal.

497
00:47:36,494 --> 00:47:38,785
The Germans were now
in headlong retreat.

498
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:41,207
Kesselring declared Rome an open city

499
00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:44,082
and attempted to regroup
north of the capital.

500
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:49,229
On the 25th of May, the Cassino front
linked up with the Anzio beachhead.

501
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:53,714
Alexander's plan was for Clark
to cut off the Germans' retreat.

502
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:57,395
Instead, Clark threw everything
into a drive for Rome.

503
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:03,873
He was determined to get there
before anyone else, and he did.

504
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:07,027
On the evening of June 4, 1944,

505
00:48:07,106 --> 00:48:09,637
the first Allied troops
entered the city.

506
00:48:19,075 --> 00:48:23,985
Those Romans who had backed
the wrong side now paid the price.

507
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:51,676
Clark's Roman triumph was short-lived.

508
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:54,934
Kesselring would succeed in regrouping.

509
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,584
Another Italian winter lay ahead.

510
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,620
And in less than 48 hours

511
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,071
the world's attention
would turn to another theatre of war -

512
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,215
the beaches of Normandy.
