00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:04,341
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:09,078
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:13,247
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,094
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,801
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,341
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:38,139
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,623
What happened here?

12
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,131
They came from nowhere.

13
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:33,889
They left as mysteriously as they came.

14
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:41,006
To the east. They left to the east.

15
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,895
<i>They appeared out of nowhere.</i>

16
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:44,092
<i>First came explosions.</i>

17
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:56,745
<i>We tried to defend ourselves.</i>

18
00:03:57,048 --> 00:04:00,313
<i>But our attempts were futile.</i>

19
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,711
<i>And then there was fire.</i>

20
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,833
<i>We didn,t stand a chance.</i>

21
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:58,601
<i>They were relentless.</i>

22
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:02,304
<i>They destroyed the city. All of it.</i>

23
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,110
<i>Then left as mysteriously as they came.</i>

24
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:12,154
Madness. This senseless destruction
must be stopped.

25
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,315
<i>They, they, they...</i>

26
00:05:14,492 --> 00:05:18,155
<i>...left to the--</i>
<i>To the east.</i>

27
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:05,042
Hello!

28
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:08,004
Hello!

29
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:24,917
ls there no end
to this senseless destruction?

30
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:47,796
Why? Why did you destroy
all of those villages?

31
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:51,908
<i>To lure you to us. To draw you out.</i>

32
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:55,911
-What?
-Y<i>es. We have been hunting you.</i>

33
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:59,278
<i>We have come to destroy you.</i>

34
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:04,254
Your search is over. Come and get me.

35
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:57,667
Run. Run. Run!

36
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:12,677
You can't hide forever.

37
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,910
-Who's there?
-l am Extor...

38
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:20,319
-...the one who created those monsters.
-What?

39
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:26,259
l set out to construct the ultimate assassins
to hunt you down and destroy you.

40
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:32,301
<i>I worked tirelessly day and night until</i>
<i>my machines of doom were completed.</i>

41
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:37,403
<i>Each were designed with a unique tool</i>
<i>of destruction.</i>

42
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:42,512
<i>Countless days were spent analyzing</i>
<i>your fighting technique.</i>

43
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,172
<i>They were the deadliest war machines</i>
<i>ever created.</i>

44
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:52,051
<i>And their power source came from</i>
<i>the world,s most ultimate evil:</i>

45
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:55,021
<i>Aku.</i>

46
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:10,329
You have outdone yourself, Extor.

47
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:14,069
Now to test their power of destruction.

48
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:20,279
-Test them? How?
-By destroying your village.

49
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:23,545
No. You can't. We had an agreement.

50
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:29,887
Fool! Now, my children, destroy.

51
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,757
No, no, no!

52
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:57,417
Aku promised to spare my village
if l would build the assassins for him.

53
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:00,648
l was a fool to trust him.

54
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:03,259
Now l want to correct my mistake.

55
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:06,488
l want to destroy my creations.

56
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:10,964
And with your help,
the assassins can be defeated.

57
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:14,799
l'm sorry. But l cannot help you.

58
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,598
What?

59
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:23,179
Your creations are too powerful.
Any form of attack that l attempted failed.

60
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:26,942
The blade of my ancient sword cannot
cut through the futuristic technology...

61
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,177
...that you have created.

62
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,845
lt seems Aku has finally won.

63
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:34,321
Wait, wait, wait.

64
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:37,893
-Your sword can cut them.
-What?

65
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:40,656
Of course, on your own
you are not strong enough...

66
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:43,198
...to cut through
their adamantium metal.

67
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:49,500
But with my last scientific invention,
you can cut through them like butter.

68
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,266
-What is it?
-Well, quite simply...

69
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,433
...it's a cybernetic,
synaptically linked...

70
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:57,240
...dino-dexteric, isometric poly-duritanium
power gauntlet.

71
00:13:57,415 --> 00:13:59,747
How will this help me?

72
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,112
You see, this arm will enhance
your strength...

73
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,720
...to give enough power to cut
through any metal...

74
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,256
...even the adamantium
that the assassins are built of.

75
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:13,864
With your skill and this arm,
you are the only one who can defeat them.

76
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:15,589
Will you help now?

77
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:25,937
Yes, l will help.

78
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,044
-High-five.
-What?

79
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:29,702
-High-five.
-What?

80
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,679
-High-five.
-l do not understand.

81
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,875
Never mind.

82
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:02,443
<i>We see you have made</i>
<i>some modifications.</i>

83
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:06,140
<i>Altering your original combat chassis</i>
<i>will not help you.</i>

84
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:09,582
<i>-Do not prolong the inevitable.</i>
-Enough.

85
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:33,307
Yes!

86
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:24,814
Wow! Hey, watch it.

87
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,838
Oh, no. The power is drained.

88
00:18:57,448 --> 00:19:00,178
Y<i>ou are no match, samurai.</i>

89
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:20,732
<i>Fool.</i> Y<i>our sword does not match</i>
<i>the power of Aku.</i>

90
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:27,410
Wrong. This sword carries the history
and strength of my people.

91
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:30,069
lts power is immeasurable.

92
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:34,509
Great ancestors, hear my plea.

93
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,016
What are you doing?

94
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:39,679
lf l am worthy,
grant me the strength...

95
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:44,021
...to vanquish this evil abomination
and send it back to--

96
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:46,390
Jack!

97
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,427
Jack, snap out of it.

98
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:56,198
l honor all who trust me.
My cause is worthy, great ancestors.

99
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:57,863
Jack!

100
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:02,274
Let my sword be your instrument
of justice.

101
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,209
<i>All too easy.</i>

102
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,726
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

103
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,044
Yes!

104
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:40,200
The sword. The samurai.

105
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:48,712
High-five.
