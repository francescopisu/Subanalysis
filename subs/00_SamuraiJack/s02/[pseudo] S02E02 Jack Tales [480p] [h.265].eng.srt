1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:04,373
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,578
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:13,247
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,094
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,801
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,341
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,240
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:43,150
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:35,770
<i>This land.</i>

12
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:41,371
<i>The land of the magic worm.</i>

13
00:01:45,484 --> 00:01:48,817
<i>Legend has it the worm can grant</i>
<i>any wish.</i>

14
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:50,420
<i>My wish:</i>

15
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:55,922
<i>To return to the past.</i>

16
00:02:11,243 --> 00:02:13,768
Worm, l summon you.

17
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:41,237
-Who beckons me?
-l do.

18
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,499
-Jack.
-You know of me?

19
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:48,510
Of course l do. l'm magic.

20
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,014
Magical, isn't it?

21
00:02:56,488 --> 00:03:01,357
You've come for a magic wish,
haven't you?

22
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,427
Yes. l--

23
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,699
lt's not that simple.

24
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:18,571
You see, only one of us
is the real magic worm.

25
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:23,271
And you're going to have to guess--

26
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:26,645
-Which one--
-ls which.

27
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,254
-Then l get my magic wish?
-Not quite--

28
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:31,855
Big boy.

29
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:36,858
Either one you choose gets to eat you.

30
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,258
Eat me? What magic is that?

31
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,228
Let me explain.

32
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:46,632
lf you guess right, you will be transported
to a magical place...

33
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:51,504
...where your innermost desire
will be granted.

34
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:58,081
But if you guess wrong,
you'll be digested for 500 years.

35
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:05,923
-So all l have to do is guess?
-That's right.

36
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:11,393
No, wrong. You have to play
a little game.

37
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:13,758
Smashing idea.

38
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,264
Oh, jolly.

39
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:21,530
Knock-knock.

40
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:27,837
-You're supposed to say, ''Who's there?''
-Who is there?

41
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,208
Banana.

42
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:33,774
Now you say, ''Banana who?''

43
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:36,420
-Knock-knock.
-Who's there?

44
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,146
-Banana.
-Banana who?

45
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:40,018
-Knock-knock.
-Who's there?

46
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,853
-Banana.
-Banana who?

47
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:45,793
No, wait. Scratch that. Try again.

48
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:48,091
Knock-knock.

49
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,366
-Who's there?
-Now you're asking the questions.

50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,474
Okay, you start.

51
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:01,808
-Knock-knock.
-Who's there?

52
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:10,580
-Enough.
-Okay, we'll ask you a question.

53
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:14,191
What's your favorite color?

54
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:16,987
-What trick is this?
-No trick.

55
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:19,528
Answer it.

56
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,191
-Blue?
-Wrong.

57
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,097
l mean red. Red.

58
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:28,301
-Too late.
-Final question.

59
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:32,637
-Very well.
-One of us tells only lies.

60
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:35,211
The other tells only truths.

61
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,213
By asking us only one question...

62
00:05:38,383 --> 00:05:42,979
...you must decide which
is the real magic worm.

63
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,719
-Only one.
-Only one.

64
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,187
My question will be--

65
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:26,330
Yes?

66
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:32,368
lf you were your brother, which one would
you say is the magic worm?

67
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:37,505
-Which one are you asking?
-lt doesn't matter.

68
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:44,113
-That's easy. lt's him.
-Of course, it's me.

69
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:46,716
Then l choose you.

70
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:48,250
He knows.

71
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,184
What made you choose me?
l told you it was him.

72
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,051
Yes, me.

73
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:55,215
lf you were the truth-telling one,
what you said is a lie.

74
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:58,157
You will answer truthfully
what your lying brother will say.

75
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,128
So l can say the answer will be
the opposite of what you say.

76
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:02,664
But if you're the lying
worm...

77
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:06,031
...you'll say what your truthful
brother will say. But it'd be a lie.

78
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:08,764
So the answer will also be
the opposite of what you say.

79
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,602
Understand?

80
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,576
-We--
-Of course.

81
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:17,742
Go on, sir.

82
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:24,313
Hey, don't hog it all.

83
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:30,619
Little did he know we're both liars.

84
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:35,732
Magic? l haven't done that since
l was a little larva.

85
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:47,338
When does the magic begin?

86
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:53,340
There's no magic, is there?

87
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,698
Excuse me.

88
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,967
We heard a noise coming from over here.

89
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,477
How did--? Where did you come from?

90
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:33,708
My family and l have been lost
in these woods for a very long time.

91
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:36,046
You must be very hungry.

92
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:40,986
Yes, we are very hungry.

93
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,024
You are welcome to share my food.

94
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:46,254
That is very kind. Thank you.

95
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:55,669
Our village was attacked and destroyed
by robot bandits.

96
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,742
We were one of the few families
who were lucky to escape.

97
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:04,414
We have been hiding in these woods,
hoping the bandits wouldn't find us.

98
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:08,344
lt has been a long time
since we have eaten.

99
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:14,787
But it seems like luck has looked kindly
upon us once more.

100
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,395
l am sorry. l wish l would have found
your village earlier.

101
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:21,157
l might have been able to help.

102
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,627
Be careful.

103
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:30,069
This sword is very sharp.
You can hurt yourself.

104
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,241
The food is ready.

105
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:37,244
l have been able to find
some good--

106
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:51,459
My sword.

107
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,530
Get him!

108
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,102
This is not your--

109
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:29,158
Give us the food,
and your life will be spared.

110
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:34,035
You mean my sword?

111
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:49,385
Hungry?

112
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,320
Come get some.

113
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,009
That smell.

114
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,450
lt smells like...

115
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,547
...metal.

116
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,456
What's going on?

117
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:14,536
Why are you looking at me like this?
What are you doing?

118
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,511
<i>It is told that there is a fairy...</i>

119
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:07,249
<i>...that has the power to grant</i>
<i>one wish in her lifetime.</i>

120
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:13,364
l finally got me the one and only
magical wish-giving fairy.

121
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:17,433
<i>But she was captured</i>
<i>by a greedy gargoyle.</i>

122
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:24,034
And when l wake,
l'm gonna wish me wish.

123
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:26,740
Goodnight, me pretty.

124
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,355
l'll see you in the morning.

125
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:24,951
Do not be afraid.

126
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:26,426
Who are you?

127
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,259
They call me Jack.
l've come to help you.

128
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:33,096
lf you free me, l will grant
any wish you desire.

129
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:35,171
Thank you.

130
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:37,738
No, wait.

131
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,578
What sorcery is this?

132
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:49,083
You shouldn't have done that.
l tried to warn you.

133
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:52,552
Now we're both stuck,
and we'll never get out.

134
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:54,054
There must be a way.

135
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:58,559
-Well, he has the key.
-Yes.

136
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:02,460
But you must be careful,
or we will never be free.

137
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:05,625
Do not worry. l will get us out.

138
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,799
Wait. Jack.

139
00:18:47,972 --> 00:18:51,408
Please, lower your voice,
or you'll awaken him.

140
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,072
How does this work?

141
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:06,580
So you think you can just sneak in here
and steal me fairy.

142
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:09,817
Nobody steals my fairy!

143
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:11,723
-Are you all right?
-Yes. But--

144
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:14,262
Do not worry. This won't take long.

145
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:24,541
Stop. You'll get the sword stuck too.

146
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:33,174
Jack, what did you do?

147
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:37,838
-l saved you. l destroyed the gargoyle.
-But we're still trapped.

148
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,918
-l have the key.
-But you don't have the magic words.

149
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:46,181
Magic words? What magic words?

150
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,450
The ones the gargoyle knew.

151
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:17,476
Now we'll never get out.

152
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:36,768
l wish we were free.
