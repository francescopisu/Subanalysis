1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:04,373
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,613
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,224
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:18,796
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:21,899
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:07,131
Turn back while you still....

12
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:13,195
Poor unfortunate creature.

13
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:15,305
-l'm not poor!
-What?

14
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,534
l might be unfortunate,
but l'm not poor.

15
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,702
Look at my necklace.
That's genuine fox tooth, that is.

16
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,305
-You're alive.
-Of course l'm alive...

17
00:03:24,483 --> 00:03:26,974
...but that's no reason to call me poor.

18
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:29,712
Tell me, where is this horrible stench
coming from?

19
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:33,153
You must mean the stench
that ruined our crops...

20
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:36,294
...that rendered generations
of backbreaking labor...

21
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,328
...completely and utterly useless, that--

22
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,056
Yes, that stench.

23
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:44,600
They say.... They say it comes from--

24
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:48,895
Oh, mother of mercy....

25
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,585
To the shelter! To the shelter!

26
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:15,351
Tell me, villager.
How far is it to this shelter?

27
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:17,586
Right around the next block. Hurry!

28
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:21,561
lt's right over here.

29
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,833
Oh, good gracious, help us out!

30
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,731
The shelter, it's full!

31
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:58,668
Mother of mercy....

32
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,607
Scissorsmith. Scissorsmith!

33
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:46,376
How can you be so cheerful
while your town lives in such misery?

34
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,048
Somebody say something?

35
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,552
l was simply wondering how you--

36
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,621
Never mind.

37
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:58,695
A customer. Top of the morning to you.

38
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:01,388
-Actually, l--
-Right this way. Right this way.

39
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:05,058
Just keep that door shut.
Keep that miserable smell out.

40
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,698
Fresh sausages,
only three for a ninepence.

41
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:14,174
No, thank you. Actually,
l was wondering about that smell outside.

42
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:15,779
Then it's a rag you want.

43
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:19,280
We've got burlap ones, flannel ones,
seersucker, gabardine!

44
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:22,878
Have you had your palm read lately?
Got any pets who need grooming?

45
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:26,820
How about some flint and tinder?
Never know when you'll need some fire--

46
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:28,789
Fire! Rhymes with liar!

47
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,188
Liar!

48
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:33,230
Quiet, you!

49
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:36,366
-Your pet speaks very well.
-My pet? That's my wife!

50
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:38,798
Never sell a wizard
an expired fishing license.

51
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:41,702
How about some pickled camel feet?

52
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:45,365
No, thank you. l just want to know
where that stench is coming from.

53
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,704
Then it's information that you're after.

54
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,608
-So you'll tell me?
-For a price.

55
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:52,875
But the lives of your fellow villagers
are at stake.

56
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,344
Come with me.

57
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:58,712
Look up there.

58
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:05,589
Now, do you see the words
''free information'' anywhere on that sign?

59
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,233
-No.
-Try using this magnifying glass.

60
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:13,800
-See it now?
-No.

61
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,964
Well, that's because
l don't sell free information!

62
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:29,114
Enough of this foolishness! You will tell me
where the stench comes from, now!

63
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:32,620
All right, l'll tell you for a loaf of bread
and a ride on a wagon.

64
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,022
Wagon! Rhymes with dragon! Dragon!

65
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:38,185
Quiet! You'll give it all away!

66
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,660
Give what away? What dragon?

67
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,857
Nothing. There's no dragon.

68
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:46,003
Dragon! Dragon!
The smell comes from a dragon!

69
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,468
Why, you....

70
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,369
So where does this dragon live?

71
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:53,135
Nowhere. l'll never tell.

72
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,279
You're beginning to arouse my ire.

73
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,278
Spire! Lives on top of the spire!

74
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,112
You mangy pigeon,
l'll have you for dinner!

75
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:04,619
So tell me, wise crow,
where might l find this spire?

76
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,120
You ungrateful beast.

77
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,920
You'd better keep that beak shut.
l mean it!

78
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,792
Looks like that shut her up.

79
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,261
Beast? Beast?

80
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,957
The spire lies to the east!
To the east!

81
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:21,303
That's it!
You've squawked your last squawk!

82
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:25,705
-Get back here, you mangy bag of germs!
-So the spire lies to the east, eh?

83
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:38,149
Wait! Warrior!

84
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:41,724
Warrior, wait!
l have something for you!

85
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:49,728
Warrior, do you really mean
to fight this dragon?

86
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,229
lf l have to, yes.

87
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,564
Then you'll need this.

88
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,570
l've had enough of your bartering.

89
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:58,333
This one's on me.

90
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,841
Sheep's bladder.

91
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:03,777
lt'll help you breathe up there
in those fumes.

92
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:07,509
Place it over your head like this
and breathe calmly.

93
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:11,519
lf you have any small children with you,
secure your mask first, then the child's.

94
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,920
You will find exits located
to the east and south end of the cabin.

95
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:17,357
Beverages will be served shortly.

96
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:19,590
Thank you?

97
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,698
Just take care of that dragon.

98
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:25,934
Years ago,
l lost a daughter to that beast.

99
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:37,005
At the fork in the road,
follow the rocky path.

100
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,707
lt will take you to the dragon's lair.

101
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:43,149
-Where will the other one take me?
-''Space Ace'' !

102
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:34,872
Whoa!

103
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:04,822
The pain.

104
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,656
You can talk?

105
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,563
Yes.

106
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,436
You must help me.

107
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:19,006
Yes, l will help you, dragon.

108
00:13:19,177 --> 00:13:21,168
l will put you out of your misery.

109
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:23,337
No, wait.

110
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:25,812
You don't understand.

111
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:30,044
There's something inside me
that is causing this.

112
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,882
lnside of you?

113
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,804
Those poor....

114
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,101
Those unfortunate people.

115
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,676
All right, dragon, l will help you.

116
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,603
Yes.

117
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,510
You have to enter me...

118
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:03,086
...and destroy
whatever is responsible for this.

119
00:16:58,296 --> 00:16:59,695
Dragon?

120
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:02,059
Am l near the source of the problem?

121
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:07,034
No. You must go lower.

122
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,053
lt's a baby.

123
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:40,351
A baby dragon.

124
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,588
Please hurry.

125
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:51,132
l cannot stand much more.

126
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,461
Thank you.

127
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:50,823
Look!

128
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:54,128
Huzzah!

129
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:01,933
Well, l gotta hand it to you, robed one.

130
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,734
l never thought you'd get rid
of that stench.

131
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,968
Hooray, the smell is gone!

132
00:21:07,144 --> 00:21:08,338
We're saved!

133
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:13,644
Hooray! At last, we can breathe again!

134
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:24,688
Now all l have to do
is put out these fires.

135
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:28,298
For the right price,
l can tell you how to put out this fire.

136
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,456
Liar! Fire rhymes with liar!

137
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:32,968
Why, you....

138
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:35,537
You rotten, dusty bag of germs!

139
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,808
l'll tear every feather out of you!
