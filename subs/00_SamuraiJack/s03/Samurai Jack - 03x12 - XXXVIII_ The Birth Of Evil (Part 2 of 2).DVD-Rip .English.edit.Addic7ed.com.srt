1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:05,911
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:10,651
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,593
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,392
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,059
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,399
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,039
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,703
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:32,541
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,070
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,449
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:44,446
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,085
Gotta get back, back to the past

14
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,890
Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:49,987
Watch out

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,328
Gotta get back, back to the past

17
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:53,458
Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,990
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,935
Gotta get back, back to the past

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,335
Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,669
Watch out!

22
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:01,731
Gotta get back, back to the past

23
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,174
Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,609
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:05,804
Gotta get back

26
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:08,007
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

27
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,242
Watch--watch out!

28
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,613
Gotta get back

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,810
Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,479
Samurai Jack

31
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:31,143
You have been chosen.

32
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,675
A force of ultimate evil...

33
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,054
has resurrected itself on thy world.

34
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:42,323
This evil must be destroyed.

35
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:45,263
Only through the strength
of the human spirit...

36
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:47,789
and the virtue
of human righteousness...

37
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,667
can this evil be vanquished.

38
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,371
This blade was forged...

39
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:08,744
from the righteous energy
within thee.

40
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:14,276
lt possesses the power
to destroy this evil force.

41
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,015
But be warned--

42
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:19,218
this evil is not
of the human world.

43
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,989
lt has magic beyond
your understanding.

44
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:27,193
Trust not what you see,
but what you feel.

45
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,022
What is this?

46
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,028
What form of insect is this?

47
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,198
lt is you.

48
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,598
Yes, Aku.

49
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:45,536
Your evil cannot abolish
the power of righteousness.

50
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:49,701
Your evil grasp on my land
and its people ends now.

51
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:55,472
Have you learned nothing?

52
00:13:55,515 --> 00:14:00,452
Your mortal blade cannot harm me.

53
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,222
How can this be?

54
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,990
This sword was forged...

55
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,897
from the strength and power
of the human spirit.

56
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,299
lt represents all that is good.

57
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:19,168
lts purpose is to destroy you.

58
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,568
Bah!

59
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:25,895
Bah!

60
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,405
You will not escape.

61
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:46,552
Now let the sword forever banish
this evil abomination.

62
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:54,021
l will return!

63
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:58,986
We must learn from this day.

64
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:02,558
We must be prepared
should this evil ever return.

65
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,799
We must have a plan.

66
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,648
Gotta get back, back to the past

67
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,314
Samurai Jack

68
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:24,515
Watch out

69
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,649
Gotta get back, back to the past

70
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:27,852
Samurai Jack

71
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,383
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

72
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:31,419
Gotta get back, back to the past

73
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:32,987
Samurai Jack

74
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:34,226
Watch out!

75
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:39,363
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

76
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:43,801
Watch out!

77
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,742
Gotta get back

78
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,871
Samurai Jack

79
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:49,312
Watch--watch out!
