1
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:06,306
Long ago
in a distant land...

2
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:11,006
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness...

3
00:00:11,046 --> 00:00:14,675
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:17,481
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,148
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,488
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:28,229
Before the final blow
was struck...

8
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:30,892
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,764
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:35,168
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:39,538
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:44,535
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,070
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:47,173
Back to the past

15
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,979
Samurai Jack

16
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:50,076
Watch out

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,417
Gotta get back,
back to the past

18
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:53,979
- Samurai Jack
- Jack

19
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:55,081
Jack, Jack, Jack

20
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,183
Gotta get back,
back to the past

21
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:58,352
Samurai Jack

22
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:59,691
Watch out!

23
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,719
Gotta get back,
back to the past

24
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:03,254
Samurai Jack

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,664
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,689
Gotta get back

27
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:08,225
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

28
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,294
Watch--watch out!

29
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,464
Gotta get back

30
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,996
Jack, Jack, Jack

31
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,269
Samurai Jack

32
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:14,799
Watch--watch out!

33
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,511
ls this a lodging facility?

34
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:39,612
Y-Yes.

35
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,685
l wish to lodge here.

36
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,997
OK.

37
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:02,967
Oh! This is the bed.

38
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:07,642
And this is the bathroom.

39
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:11,375
And--and this...

40
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,082
is the window!

41
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,869
ls there something wrong?

42
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:31,632
The music.

43
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,307
Music?

44
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,235
Olivia!

45
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,333
Olivia!

46
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,071
Olivia!

47
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,272
Olivia!

48
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,773
No, Olivia! Please!

49
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:52,016
Aw, honey,
don't you recognize me?

50
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,988
Olivia!

51
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,490
lt's me, your father.

52
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,094
Please snap out of it, dear.

53
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,439
No, honey! No!

54
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,340
This isn't who you are!

55
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:37,692
No, wait!

56
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,701
They're children!

57
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:14,198
No, Olivia! Don't go!

58
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:16,363
Come back!

59
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,344
Who were they?

60
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:35,856
The children...of Aku.

61
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:37,449
Aku!

62
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,255
Truly his evil has spread...

63
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:41,159
through even
the youngest of souls.

64
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,027
Yes.

65
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,332
My daughter was innocent once--

66
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,463
but she came home with this.

67
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,305
My little girl...

68
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:55,333
was never the same
since that night.

69
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,605
She became...

70
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,806
one of them.

71
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,647
Wait. Where are you going?

72
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:09,350
To free your daughter
and the rest of the children...

73
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:10,983
from Aku's evil grasp.

74
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:59,362
Somebody scream

75
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:06,034
Somebody scream

76
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,792
lt's the ultimate,
l can't go for it

77
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,595
lt's the ultimate,
l can't go for it

78
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,124
lt's the ultimate,
it's the--

79
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:18,672
Welcome...

80
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:21,676
brothers and sisters!

81
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:24,907
Can l get a kazaam?!

82
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:27,073
Kazaam!

83
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:30,744
l, DJ Salvatore...

84
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:34,380
am once again here
to drop upon you all...

85
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,687
the majestical,
sounderrific beats...

86
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:41,253
of the master...

87
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:45,665
Aku.

88
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,894
Skizz, yeah!

89
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:53,237
Let your ears feast
to the flavor...

90
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,175
of the Aku-stic sound!

91
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:16,316
Children of Aku!

92
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:22,159
Samurai Jack is in the house!

93
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:25,997
Jack...

94
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,935
And for public enemy
number one...

95
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,667
the scratch in Aku's groove,
Samurai Wack...

96
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,505
let's mix it up
with a taste of the bass...

97
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,010
beats in his face...

98
00:14:37,045 --> 00:14:39,513
the brand-new hard-core track...

99
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,344
<i>Jack Attack!</i>

100
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,037
There are too many!
l must stop the music.

101
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,274
Oh, no!

102
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,711
lt won't be that easy.

103
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,320
Music-maker man...

104
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:02,016
your beats are bad.

105
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:05,025
That's right. They're bad!

106
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,687
Not bad good, bad bad!

107
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,356
Whatever!

108
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:12,457
Aku's control
on these innocents will stop!

109
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,799
Aku will never be silenced!

110
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:34,945
Let the sounds
form your ultimate destruction.

111
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:03,233
Ooh!

112
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:22,756
No!

113
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,262
Aku's evil music...

114
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:40,070
will be no more!

115
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:05,764
You have been
pawns of Aku's evil.

116
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,325
But now you are free.

117
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,996
Return to your homes...

118
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:13,131
and never dance
to this evil beat again.

119
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:28,116
Father?

120
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:29,713
Olivia?

121
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:31,782
- Father?
- Olivia?

122
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:32,815
Father?!

123
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,454
Olivia!

124
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:43,827

125
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:47,201
Thank you, stranger.

126
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,799
