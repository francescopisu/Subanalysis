1
00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:04,372
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,613
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,794
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,553
<i>Come.</i>

12
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,964
<i>Come.</i>

13
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,989
<i>Come.</i>

14
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:13,035
<i>Come to me.</i>

15
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,313
<i>Come.</i>

16
00:03:27,486 --> 00:03:29,010
Who is there?

17
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,568
<i>Come.</i>

18
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,106
<i>Come.</i>

19
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,108
<i>Come.</i>

20
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:56,978
Show yourseIf.

21
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:59,149
<i>Come to me.</i>

22
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:01,012
Coward.

23
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:07,922
<i>Come.</i>

24
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:15,394
<i>Come to me.</i>

25
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:39,757
Something eviI has ravaged these Iands.

26
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:44,117
A very famiIiar eviI.

27
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:48,960
<i>Yes. Come to me.</i>

28
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,523
<i>Come.</i>

29
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:52,419
<i>Come.</i>

30
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,912
<i>Come.</i>

31
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:35,570
<i>Come.</i>

32
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,140
The voice beckons me further in.

33
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,302
SureIy he takes me for a fooI
to foIIow deeper into his trap.

34
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:47,280
A fooI I be!

35
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,594
<i>Come.</i>

36
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:51,134
WeIcome to your doom.

37
00:10:20,798 --> 00:10:23,460
Many warriors have been
Iured here to their end.

38
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:25,034
Why have you done this?

39
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:29,162
My purpose is to battIe.

40
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:58,194
Yes.

41
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:04,103
At Iast, after aII these years,
a worthy opponent.

42
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,869
Enough of this pointIess battIe.

43
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:09,707
I wiII continue to fight you no more.

44
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:12,349
I say thee nay!

45
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:20,015
No! I wiII not do battIe with you for
your amusement. There is no honor in it.

46
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:24,218
Honor? What do thee know of honor?

47
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:30,334
A miIIennium hath passed,
and now my goaI is within my grasp.

48
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:34,028
This battIe wiII continue to the end.

49
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,317
I said, I wiII not fight you, monster.

50
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:56,657
I shaII not be denied!

51
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,135
Strike me down if you must...

52
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:08,898
...but I wiII not fight.

53
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,302
Nay.

54
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:14,673
I cannot strike the defenseIess.

55
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:19,647
This battIe must be concIuded
by the warrior's code.

56
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,182
I beg thee.

57
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:26,551
Rise, unsheathe your sword,
continue this fight.

58
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,758
-Why?
-For freedom.

59
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,965
The master of this kingdom of rock
is just a man.

60
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:40,065
A cursed man trapped in a rock body.

61
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,834
It happened Iong ago.

62
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:48,001
So Iong ago now.

63
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,206
'Twas once a time where I, too, was a man.

64
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:54,408
A mighty warrior Iike thee.

65
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:13,199
I have engraved a recording
of my past...

66
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:18,536
...so that I wouId never forget
the Iife I had, the man I was...

67
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,147
...so thy peopIe wouId not be Iost
to the dust of time.

68
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:27,683
<i>Let me take thee on a journey</i>
<i>into the past.</i>

69
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:31,948
<i>This land 'twas not always</i>
<i>parched and burnt.</i>

70
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:36,253
<i>Once, a beautiful city thrived</i>
<i>in the lush countryside.</i>

71
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:39,726
<i>'Twas truly a sight to behold.</i>

72
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,063
<i>A jewel of all the northern lands.</i>

73
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:49,468
<i>My happiness was a beautiful family</i>
<i>of a wife, two sons...</i>

74
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,040
<i>...and a faithful canine.</i>

75
00:13:54,712 --> 00:14:00,116
<i>Times were good, game was plentiful,</i>
<i>and my people prospered.</i>

76
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:07,247
<i>'Twas on return from a successful</i>
<i>hunting trip when an omen appeared.</i>

77
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:11,020
<i>A black moon blocked out the sun.</i>

78
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:16,360
<i>It grew and grew,</i>
<i>until it ate the sky and land.</i>

79
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:24,472
<i>The darkness now loomed over my kingdom.</i>

80
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:31,038
<i>A horrible monster,</i>
<i>born from within the darkness, attacked.</i>

81
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,610
<i>My army retaliated.</i>

82
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:42,587
<i>But our efforts were to no avail.</i>

83
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:48,291
<i>'Twere I alone who was left</i>
<i>to destroy the monster.</i>

84
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,799
<i>My weapons were worthless.</i>

85
00:14:55,973 --> 00:15:00,034
<i>My attempts to avenge</i>
<i>amused the monster...</i>

86
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,645
<i>...and he struck me down.</i>

87
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:08,675
<i>I lay before him,</i>
<i>ready to battle for the last time.</i>

88
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:11,287
<i>But the villain did not destroy me.</i>

89
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:15,256
<i>Nay, the fate dealt to me</i>
<i>was much more cruel.</i>

90
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:19,692
<i>He imprisoned me</i>
<i>within an unbreakable crystal...</i>

91
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:24,028
<i>...denying me a warrior's end.</i>

92
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:27,599
<i>Helpless was I as the beast destroyed...</i>

93
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:31,230
<i>...what was left of my beloved kingdom.</i>

94
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,709
<i>Then he came for me again.</i>

95
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:44,648
<i>'Twas his enjoyment that day</i>
<i>to punish me for eternity.</i>

96
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:49,191
<i>Thrust me, he did,</i>
<i>into the core of the mountain.</i>

97
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,559
<i>'Twas his plan for me to spend</i>
<i>all of eternity in the mountain...</i>

98
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:58,566
<i>...never to join my fallen comrades</i>
<i>in Valhalla...</i>

99
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:02,797
<i>...the resting place of all great warriors.</i>

100
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:05,966
<i>Through countless eons I laid still...</i>

101
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,236
<i>...but my will was strong.</i>

102
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:12,075
<i>I found a way to manipulate</i>
<i>the material around me.</i>

103
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,778
<i>Out of the rock, I formed the body</i>
<i>thou seest before thee.</i>

104
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:21,857
<i>Then I created a passage so full</i>
<i>of peril and danger...</i>

105
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:25,484
<i>...that only the greatest of warriors</i>
<i>can pass.</i>

106
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:29,155
<i>For, you see,</i>
<i>the only entry into Valhalla...</i>

107
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,861
<i>...is to fall in combat to another warrior.</i>

108
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:41,545
And thou are the onIy one to survive.

109
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:49,877
As written, the truth has been toId.

110
00:16:50,087 --> 00:16:53,716
My fate is at your mercy.

111
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:59,289
Prepare yourseIf.

112
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:05,891
At Iast, the gates of VaIhaIIa open to me.

113
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:32,729
Rise, warrior! Rise!

114
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:36,731
HonorabIy I must be defeated.
I cannot Iet up.

115
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:44,832
Do not worry.

116
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:47,409
I have onIy begun to fight.

117
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,582
After aII these years...

118
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,153
...my freedom has arrived.

119
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:37,392
Accursed monster, your speII is broken!

120
00:18:56,747 --> 00:19:00,183
I am free!

121
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:05,578
At Iast, my fIesh is restored.

122
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:09,920
The curse is Iifted.

123
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:30,471
Warrior.

124
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,746
I.... I....

125
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:35,681
Don't worry, my friend.

126
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,822
PIease, hand me my sword.

127
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,992
Thank you.
