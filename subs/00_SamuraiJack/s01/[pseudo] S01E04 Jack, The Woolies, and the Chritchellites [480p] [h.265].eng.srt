1
00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:04,373
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,613
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,794
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,172
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:49,696
-Not a bad job with the beast.
-I guess.

12
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:54,073
We wouId've caught him anyway
with our modified tridentaI incapacitators.

13
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,942
Whatever. Secure the beast!

14
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:59,379
This beast is aIways trying to escape.

15
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,052
Your days are numbered, wiId one.

16
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:09,751
Thanks to this brave warrior,
you'II never escape again.

17
00:04:09,928 --> 00:04:13,420
We must ceIebrate its capture.
Come back to our viIIage with us.

18
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,862
-WeII, I don't know if I--
-You shouId.

19
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:18,366
-There'II be a feast.
-With rare deIectabIes.

20
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,442
WeII, I have not eaten in days.

21
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,413
I suppose no harm couId come of it.

22
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:39,886
Our peopIe have dweIIed in this Iand
for many decades.

23
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:43,789
Much of it was barren wasteIand
when the first settIers arrived.

24
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,931
Our ancestors worked Iong and hard
for many seasons...

25
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:50,261
...to cuItivate it into the beautifuI pIace
it is now.

26
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:54,962
These WooIies, as we caII them,
once roamed the Iand wiId.

27
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,543
These bIoodthirsty creatures threatened
the survivaI of our earIy settIers...

28
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,609
...nearIy driving us to extinction.

29
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,272
Anyway, with our great courage
and determination...

30
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,146
...we managed to tame
these savage beasts.

31
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,881
It took many years,
but now they are dociIe and cooperative...

32
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,150
...heIping us with our everyday duties.

33
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:18,092
And in turn, we provide them
with the sheIter and safety of our viIIage.

34
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:20,629
WeII, here we are.

35
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:22,565
Pretty impressive, huh?

36
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,525
-These buiIdings seem quite oId.
-Thank you.

37
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:09,471
Secure the beast untiI I devise
the proper punishment for his escape.

38
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,343
-Come on.
-Move it. Let's go.

39
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:15,282
-Step it up. Go on, fatty.
-Move it.

40
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,862
Let's eat.

41
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:52,152
Wait. What are you doing?

42
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,754
You can't get this one anymore.

43
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:58,362
It's the Junga Import Edition.
Theirs is better.

44
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,693
I guess, but I got the exact one
in Sarsyphis...

45
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,358
...for onIy 1 0 pieces, stiII wrapped.

46
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,933
Oh. Why, thank you.

47
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,476
Bring on the entertainment.

48
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,914
Up, you worthIess beast.

49
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,963
I notice your treatment of the WooIies
is somewhat harsh.

50
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:12,535
Not reaIIy. It's no different than the way
you humans treat--

51
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:15,571
What do you caII them? Horses?

52
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,211
Such huge structures.

53
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,343
Hey, come back here.

54
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:26,040
For such smaII creatures.

55
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,456
It is aII right. I wiII not hurt you.

56
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,331
Here.

57
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,848
You're not so bad, are you, big feIIow?

58
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:01,741
WeII, sIeep weII, my friend.

59
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,288
HeIp me.

60
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:06,590
-What?
-Hey, you! Get away from there!

61
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:13,594
You shouId be carefuI.
The beasts are tricky.

62
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,427
Their mind controI wiII fry your brain.

63
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,592
Come. Dessert is served.

64
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:01,573
HeIp me.

65
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,181
HeIp me.

66
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:14,408
Do you understand me?

67
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:19,679
Yes. PIease, heIp us.

68
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:24,157
-What do you want me to do?
-Free me. AII can be expIained.

69
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:45,243
So I says to CharIie, I have three of those--
What was that?

70
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,408
-What was what?
-Oh, nothing. So anyway....

71
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,096
Must unIock.

72
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:29,320
-What is this pIace?
-It's where we're kept at night.

73
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,038
Up.

74
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,933
Up.

75
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:25,573
I am Lazzor, the eIdest of WooIies.

76
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:29,712
<i>Countless seasons ago...</i>

77
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:36,457
<i>...before the darkness fell,</i>
<i>we were a happy people.</i>

78
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:41,059
<i>We had discovered a way of life...</i>

79
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:46,329
<i>...that most creatures only dream about.</i>

80
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:48,802
<i>Paradise.</i>

81
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:56,044
<i>Ours was not a culture</i>
<i>based on technology.</i>

82
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,920
<i>Our village was prosperous.</i>

83
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,726
<i>Then they came.</i>

84
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:16,356
<i>The pestilence that rained</i>
<i>out of the sky.</i>

85
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>The Chritchellites were upon us.</i>

86
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,711
<i>At first, we tried to defend ourselves...</i>

87
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:36,945
<i>...but we were no match</i>
<i>for their technology.</i>

88
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,321
<i>Using the power of the orb...</i>

89
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:45,121
<i>...the Chritchellites have enslaved us</i>
<i>to their service.</i>

90
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:52,762
<i>For decades they have abused our land.</i>

91
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:55,599
<i>And if they are not stopped...</i>

92
00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:58,367
<i>...I fear my people...</i>

93
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:03,310
<i>...will soon fade from history.</i>

94
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:09,420
WiII you heIp us?

95
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,214
I wiII.

96
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:42,011
Stay here.

97
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:40,040
What?

98
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,781
HaIt, beast.

99
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,909
There is no escape.

100
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,948
For I have captured you once,
and wiII now see...

101
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:54,523
...that you wiII never escape again.

102
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:43,570
We've been tricked! Get them!

103
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:03,989
Destroy!

104
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:16,399
There's too many.
We have to destroy the orb.

105
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:21,573
Get him!

106
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:38,921
It is time.

107
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:06,587
And what do you think you're doing?

108
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:10,890
-Get back in your ceIIs.
-This is it.

109
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,593
We must destroy the orb!

110
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:25,770
Up.

111
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,144
CIimb.

112
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,678
Hey, they're going for the orb.

113
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,442
Don't Iet them reach the orb.

114
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:48,721
We are aImost there.

115
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,034
I'm too weak.

116
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:16,190
The orb. He broke the orb.

117
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,920
I can't beIieve-- Huh?

118
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,752
Stay back!

119
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:54,755
Your weapons are worthIess now.
This is our home.

120
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:35,270
We are forever gratefuI, great warrior...

121
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:38,636
...to your deeds done today.

122
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:42,244
If there is anything that you seek...

123
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:46,907
...pIease honor us by Ietting us heIp you.

124
00:21:47,084 --> 00:21:50,178
There is one thing that I quest for.

125
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:54,848
Yes. I understand.

126
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,858
TraveI north, samurai.

127
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:01,896
There you wiII find a magicaI pIace...

128
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:07,163
