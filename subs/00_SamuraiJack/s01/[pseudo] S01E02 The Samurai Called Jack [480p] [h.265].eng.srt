1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:04,374
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,613
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,794
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:27,421
Once again, I am free to smite the worId...

12
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,762
...as I did in days Iong past.

13
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,836
Mother, Aku has returned.

14
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,378
Do as we have pIanned.
Our future depends on it.

15
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:53,247
I am the Iost son of the Iand
that you have piIIaged.

16
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:55,086
I am here to recIaim it.

17
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,338
What trickery is this?

18
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,173
Aku--

19
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:24,045
Do not worry, samurai.
You wiII see me again.

20
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:28,181
But next time you wiII not be so fortunate.

21
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,275
Oh, no!

22
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,415
-Yeah!
-That was bad, man!

23
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:38,181
Yo, Jack!
That was some awesome show!

24
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:40,517
I've never peered upon moves
Iike that, Jack!

25
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:43,559
Word! Jack was aII
ricocheticaIIy-jumpa-deIic!

26
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:46,492
Hezeck, yeah! BodigiousIy acrobatastic!

27
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:49,225
Word! Word! But then,
when Jack puIIed that Swiss arm...

28
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:52,666
...it was aII, Iike, schwim-swack-swoof!
Man, right through the car!

29
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:55,739
Swick-attack-whack
was fuII on the back, Jack!

30
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,240
Oh, yeah, yeah!
And he was aII...boom! Man!

31
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:00,935
Eat that, fIucking crucker!

32
00:05:01,112 --> 00:05:04,445
Then my man just Iands aII cooIish styIe,
Iike, ''No sweating, chiII.''

33
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:06,675
But then that gunner wanna come out aII:

34
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,218
The trash is aII munching,
crunching, snack-mixing!

35
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,823
Out of that phat,
supercagafragaIistic-tistic tie, yo!

36
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:17,325
Yeah! But Jack's just Iike,
''Word! Let me get some.'' Tie. Grab.

37
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:18,894
''I'm out, yo!''

38
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,691
Word! Word! Word!
Jack! Jack!

39
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:25,735
You the sniz-nit, Jack!
Oh, man!

40
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,135
-You just made my day!
-Up in the air!

41
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,407
Thank you. Where am I?

42
00:05:32,577 --> 00:05:36,980
Jack, you're on the gutter IeveI
of the CentraI Hub, Sector D.

43
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,976
-CentraI Hub?
-Yeah, Jack. The most crowdestness--

44
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:43,347
-Stinkiest....
-Most miserabIest....

45
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:47,218
ResidentiaI-industriaI spaceport on Earth!

46
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:50,225
I have many questions and IittIe time.
Who is in charge here?

47
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:52,693
I must speak with your king.

48
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,968
-So, Jack--
-You don't see Aku.

49
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:03,501
Aku sees you!

50
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,999
-Aku?
-Yeah, man!

51
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,577
Aku. The master of masters.

52
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:12,274
-The deIiverer of darkness.
-The shogun of sorrow.

53
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,384
-No! How can this be?
-Don't know.

54
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,383
Just aIways been that way.

55
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:18,715
This-- I....

56
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,953
Yo, Jack. What's up?
You don't Iook so good.

57
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,893
What Jack needs
is some Iiquid refreshment.

58
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,226
-Perhaps you are right.
-Word! Right over there.

59
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:33,462
-They wiII hook you up.
-Word! That joint is the busy bizomb!

60
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,100
What do you want?

61
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:07,364
A few of the IocaIs inform me
that I might be abIe to refresh myseIf here.

62
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,872
-What?
-Hey, man! Jack just want a drink!

63
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:12,942
A drink? Why didn't you say so?

64
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:42,805
And what you Iooking at?

65
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,014
I apoIogize. I am new here.
I did not mean to stare.

66
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:36,524
No, human. It is not that easy!

67
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,826
PIease. I again apoIogize
for my misbehavior.

68
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:43,524
I do not wish for any more troubIe.

69
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:50,370
-Get up.
-I wish you no harm.

70
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:58,673
It is not me who shouId worry
about being hurt, human.

71
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,715
It is you!

72
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,232
So, what do you say, oId chap?
WiII you heIp us?

73
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:10,077
So, what did he say?
What did he say? WiII he do it?

74
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,019
He said you're out of your mind,
you bIasted idiot!

75
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:17,958
What do we do now?
We've asked just about everyone here.

76
00:10:20,765 --> 00:10:22,790
I say! What about him?

77
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:26,232
You mean the Iad who's about
to get his bum disintegrated?

78
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:30,067
-Oh, I can't watch!
-Yes, that's the one. I Iike him.

79
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,214
-By Jove, he's good!
-Aye. But it ain't over.

80
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:26,528
Lads, that's our boy.

81
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,996
Aye, he's good, aII right.
But he'II never do it.

82
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,691
We'II see about that.

83
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:33,336
Be carefuI, RothchiId.

84
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:37,941
No worries, oId friend.
Everything is under controI.

85
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,771
Pardon me, fine sir.

86
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:45,077
Down here, oId feIIow.

87
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,152
I was just wondering if you wouId
be so kind as to join us, as we are--

88
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,288
-TaIking demon dogs!
-Good heavens! Where?

89
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,947
You wiII not best me this day,
viIe henchman of Aku!

90
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:58,357
HoId on a moment, sir!
I am by no means a demon...

91
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,759
...or have anything to do with Aku.

92
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:04,561
-But you speak in the Ianguage of man.
-But of course!

93
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:09,667
You're not from around here, are you?

94
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:13,138
I say, why don't you come join
my friends and me for a refreshment...

95
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:14,869
...and we'II expIain everything.

96
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,614
SpIendid. Right this way.

97
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,178
-Your refreshments are here.
-SpIendid.

98
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:18,470
My boy, I do apoIogize. How rude of us.
We haven't introduced ourseIves.

99
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:24,043
This is Sir Dreyfuss AIexander,
chief of excavation.

100
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:27,779
Dreyfuss, oId boy, you're drooIing again.

101
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:30,477
Oh, oh, sorry.

102
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,457
You bIasted idiot!
You're getting everybody wet!

103
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:40,256
And this fine gentIeman is Angus McDuffy,
artifact aficionado.

104
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:45,391
And I am Sir CoIin BarthoIomew
Montgomery RothchiId III.

105
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,504
Or ''Rothie,'' for short.

106
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:51,905
I am sorry. I am very confused.

107
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,340
Your worId is new to me.
What has happened?

108
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,639
No, no, no.
Quite aII right, quite aII right.

109
00:13:56,814 --> 00:14:01,649
Since the beginning of history, the immortaI
Aku has ruthIessIy ruIed the Earth...

110
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,344
...pIundering its resources as he sees fit.

111
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:06,353
But it was stiII not enough.

112
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:08,185
He opened his ports to the gaIaxy...

113
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:11,658
...so that he might take
the riches of other worIds as weII.

114
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:16,357
Since then, his otherworIdIy business affairs
have drawn scads of vuIturous criminaIs...

115
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:21,198
...mindIess stooges and questionabIe
mercenaries to our pitiabIe pIanet...

116
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:25,274
...making the Earth topsy-turvy,
if I do say so myseIf.

117
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:29,878
There are other worIds across the stars?

118
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:34,714
WeII, of course, siIIy.
What worId do you haiI from?

119
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:39,050
But I am from Earth. Yet this worId
is nothing Iike the worId I remember.

120
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:41,384
-How so, Iad?
-Even the grandest cities...

121
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,652
...were never as overwheIming as this one.

122
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:46,820
Chariots did not fIy, and dogs
did not speak in human tongue.

123
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,330
What do you mean?

124
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,731
WeII, I mean no insuIt.
They were wonderfuI companions...

125
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:55,236
...but the dogs I knew mereIy barked.

126
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,998
You see? The ancient myths are true!

127
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:04,012
ImpossibIe! If what you say is true,
he'd have to be thousands of years oId.

128
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,411
Astounding! The age-o-meter dates your
particIes aII the way back to 25 B.A.

129
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,251
Twenty-five years
before Aku ensIaved the Earth.

130
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,859
You, my friend, are a Iiving fossiI.

131
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,765
So the question is not where I am...

132
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:23,332
-...but when I am.
-PreciseIy.

133
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,163
The speII Aku cast must have ripped me
from my own time...

134
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:28,202
...and fIung me into the distant future.

135
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:29,862
Time warp is highIy pIausibIe.

136
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,374
AIIowing his eviI time to fester
and infect the entire worId.

137
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:38,914
Most undoubtedIy. And I'm sure he pIans
to spread his viIeness through the stars.

138
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:43,076
No. I must return to my own time
so that I might undo Aku's eviI reign...

139
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:47,691
...before it enveIops the Earth.
This ageIess demon must be stopped.

140
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,986
Oh, I'm so gIad we agree on that point...

141
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:52,561
...which actuaIIy brings us back
to our proposaI.

142
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,393
You see, we are archeoIogists trying
to dig up the remains of our ancestors...

143
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,558
...to find out more about our past.

144
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,864
It was onIy a few years ago
that we discovered that our ancestors...

145
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,473
...waIked upon their Iegs and their arms.

146
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:11,276
Then, one day, during our excavation,
we actuaIIy stumbIed upon rare jeweIs.

147
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:16,079
Aye. These jeweIs ended up being
a key source of power for Aku.

148
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:19,314
So he ensIaved us
to forever dig up his jeweIs...

149
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,926
...thus stifIing our excavation
of our gIorious past.

150
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:26,257
-Which is why we need you.
-But what can I do?

151
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,264
With your tremendous skiII,
you can break us free from Aku's grasp.

152
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:34,495
And we can escape in secret
to again continue to discover our history.

153
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:43,272
I wiII heIp you.

154
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,449
SpIendid! WeII, we're off, then.

155
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,554
-HoId it!
-What is it now, Rothie?

156
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:54,589
-What's wrong?
-My dearest apoIogies, kind sir.

157
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,954
But we never got your name.

158
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,088
-Jack.
-Jack was aII--

159
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:01,754
-Jack. Jack.
-Yo, Jack.

160
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,696
-Jack, was--
-Jack!

161
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,364
They caII me Jack.

162
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:16,640
Jack? I say, that's nice. So simpIe but
it seems to fit. Who am I to comment?

163
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:19,647
WeII, Jack, we're on our way.
We'II take our rocket ship.

164
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:21,182
Rocket ship?

165
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:26,148
I'm taking a break.

166
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:20,738
My Iord, we are the Vadaquas
from the Mosconian GaIaxy.

167
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,507
Our water pIanet has been piIIaged. AII the
oceans that were once our home are gone.

168
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:30,347
We have searched Iong to find a pIanet with
oceans rich enough to sustain our peopIe.

169
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:33,183
And your worId is our Iast hope for survivaI.

170
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:51,106
I know of your pIight, Vadaquian.

171
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:57,305
For you see, I am he who has taken
your waters and the riches within them.

172
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,711
-You monster!
-Be quiet!

173
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:02,944
I am sorry, my Iord.
The boy is young and fooIish.

174
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,553
He does not know what he says.

175
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:12,928
The boy wiII return.

176
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:19,127
He wiII Iearn proper respect for Aku
in the pit of hate.

177
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:22,466
Yes, oh, master.
Your wisdom is unquestionabIe.

178
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,872
But wiII you, great Iord Aku,
aIIow us to inhabit your worId?

179
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:28,773
For you are our onIy hope.

180
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:30,937
You wiII be aIIowed.

181
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:35,575
The oceans of Aku wiII be your new home.

182
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:41,419
But you wiII pay homage to me
by constructing statues in my Iikeness.

183
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:44,891
Once a month, a monoIithic tribute...

184
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:48,463
...wiII rise from the depths of the ocean...

185
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:54,264
...to remind aII
who is the master of this worId.

186
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:55,769
Now be gone!

187
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:01,506
My Iord master, I have great news for you.

188
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,616
What information can be considered
great for the immortaI Aku?

189
00:20:06,784 --> 00:20:11,118
An ancient warrior of great power
and skiII has reveaIed himseIf.

190
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,724
He has vowed to Iiberate
the canines from your mines.

191
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:20,057
What impertinence is this?
Show me the fooI!

192
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,299
So fate has arrived.

193
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:36,276
Many years have gone since that day.

194
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:42,909
And now, my formidabIe foe,
you wiII pay for my pain in the past...

195
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:47,046
...with your pain in the future.

196
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:33,497
Oh, dear. Sir Jack, are you iII?

197
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:36,162
I'm fine. I just prefer waIking.

198
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,467
Yes. Rocket rides.
Sorry about that, oId-timer.

199
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:41,475
But anyway, weIcome to our camp.

200
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:45,638
As you can see, our archaeoIogicaI dig had
unearthed many astounding discoveries...

201
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:48,307
...concerning the history of canine kind.

202
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,579
But unfortunateIy, Aku has,
shaII we say...

203
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:56,692
...redirected our efforts pureIy toward
the excavation of his precious gems.

204
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:59,728
And if Aku's unreasonabIe quotas
are not fuIIy met...

205
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:02,923
...I'm afraid terribIe punishments
are exacted.

206
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,197
My peopIe's spirits are broken.
We simpIy cannot Iive Iike this any Ionger.

207
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:25,955
I have seen Aku impIement these
atrocities before. But no more.

208
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:29,581
Even dogs shouId not be forced
to Iive Iike dogs!

209
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:32,962
They're coming! They're coming!

210
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,260
Aku's drones approach from the south.
They wiII be upon us by sunrise.

211
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:31,610
