00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:04,282
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:09,580
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:13,247
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,128
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,175
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:14,271
Pay up, sucker.

12
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:22,541
You want something?

13
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:25,373
Hot water, pIease.

14
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,947
Hey!

15
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,818
You got some kind of nerve.

16
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:07,080
Hear what I'm saying?
I'm taIking to you!

17
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,626
You got some gump coming here.
You know what I mean?

18
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,991
Better finish that drink quick.

19
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,225
Because you might not Iive much Ionger.

20
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,508
Aku's offering two googoIpIex
for your head.

21
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:30,341
Two googoIpIex. That's a Iot of money.

22
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,155
And we aim to coIIect it...

23
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:52,128
...right about now.

24
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,739
Samurai Jack!

25
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,339
This you?

26
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:49,049
Yeah. Look Iike you.

27
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:17,487
You're Samurai Jack?

28
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:19,419
What a joke!

29
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:24,555
This'II be the easiest googoIpIex
I've ever made.

30
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:49,011
GoogoIpIex.

31
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:58,759
Looks Iike there'II be no money for you,
crazy round man.

32
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:08,270
Samurai Jack!

33
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,737
You're mine!

34
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:19,661
UseIess bounty hunters!

35
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,322
Is there no fighting styIe...

36
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,401
...that can defeat his?

37
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,907
Yes.

38
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:33,236
No fighting styIe...

39
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:37,245
...can defeat his.

40
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,911
Who eIse wants some?!

41
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,473
What sorcery is this?

42
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:22,374
-Who are you?
-Don't be such a fooI.

43
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:25,812
-I'm you.
-If you are me, then who am I?

44
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,879
You're so stupid.

45
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,954
-You are you aIso.
-Enough!

46
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:36,355
You are my mirror image. Yet your speech
is fouI with eviI and disrespect.

47
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,859
Who are you?
And how have you come to be me?

48
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,089
I am the son of Aku's magic.

49
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:44,291
He has Iooked deep within you
and has spawned me...

50
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,596
...from your own burning hatred.

51
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,466
I am your dark side.

52
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,767
And I possess aII the powers
that you wieId.

53
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:55,140
And I have onIy one purpose
in my existence:

54
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:58,544
To destroy you.

55
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,513
Hurts, doesn't it?

56
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:37,620
Not as much as this
is going to hurt you.

57
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:07,122
What the...?

58
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:34,181
-What the heck is going on?
-You have Iost. The battIe is over.

59
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:36,945
-What?!
-You are my inner demon.

60
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,783
You have been born
from the hatred within me.

61
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:42,517
But now that hatred is no more.

62
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,821
Thus, you do not exist.

63
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,690
FooI! I am reaI.

64
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:53,667
Now feeI the reaIity
of my coId, hard steeI!

65
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,999
I know you're watching.

66
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:01,660
These tricks are starting to annoy me.
