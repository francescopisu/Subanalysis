00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:15,805

<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:31,456
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,
present, and future.</i>

6
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:35,332
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

7
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:39,542

back to the past.</i>

No!
They chose the path!

20

They chose!

21
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,192
Die! Die!

22
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,796
Why won't you die?!

23
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:32,032
Scum!
Aku will be triumphant!

24
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:35,297
I will undo the evil
that is you, samurai!

25
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:37,829
I will kill you!
As long as I have

26
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,440
breath in my body,
I will strike you down!

27
00:03:40,442 --> 00:03:43,282
Long live the glory of Aku!

28
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:46,308
You are very troubled.

29
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,375
And very confused.

30
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:50,517
Aku is the evil one, not me.

31
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,452
I've met machines
that are programmed

32
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:55,124
with such hate and lies,
but never a human.

33
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,893
Deceiver!
Worm! Scum!

34
00:03:57,928 --> 00:03:59,993
Now you're
just repeating yourself.

35
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:07,225
I wonder if it is possible
for her to ever believe

36
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:11,441
- that Aku is the evil and not me?
- Lecherous snake!

37
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:12,773
Mm, perhaps not.

38
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,214
Are you kidding me?

39
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,551
Whew.

40
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:49,898
My Lord and master, Aku,

41
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:52,565
may it please you for all eternity ...

42
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,284
the samurai is dead.

43
00:05:56,844 --> 00:05:59,910
Um...
I'm right here.

44
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:02,945
Fool! We've been swallowed
by a monolithic creature.

45
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:04,684
You're dead.

46
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:08,589
I've been inside giant creatures
before. I'll find a way out.

47
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,920
Stop. Enough!

48
00:06:10,926 --> 00:06:12,856
No! I will never stop!

49
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,731
Yes, yes, I know ...
till your dying breath.

50
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,800
But once you see
how misguided you are,

51
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,429
you will see the truth about Aku.

52
00:07:21,462 --> 00:07:22,860
Be still!

53
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:24,258
Crazy woman!

54
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,596
Can you not see
that I am saving your life?

55
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:28,844
Aaaaaagh!

56
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:33,035
Uh, hello?

57
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:43,276
<i>Ashi?
Ashi?</i>

58
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,246
<i>Ashi?
Kill the samurai!</i>

59
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:04,934
<i>Jack?
What are we doing, Jack?</i>

60
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,699
Waiting.

61
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:13,636
<i>Waiting for what?</i>

62
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:16,042
<i>You know the way out.
Let's just go.</i>

63
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:18,662
No.
She's another innocent.

64
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:21,280
<i>"Innocent"?
Are you mad?</i>

65
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,750
<i>She's pure evil.</i>

66
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,217
She's lost her way.

67
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:27,619
<i>You'd know
about that, wouldn't you?</i>

68
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:30,122
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

69
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,833
<i>Well, then, maybe you'll talk to me.</i>

70
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,363
Leave me alone.

71
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,828
<i>I don't want to talk to you, either.</i>

72
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,203
I don't know why
you keep bringing this up.

73
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:54,352
<i>Look, why do you
always have to get involved?</i>

74
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,582
<i>She chose her way,</i>

75
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:58,177
<i>and now she has to live
with the consequences.</i>

76
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:01,816
You'll never understand
that it's all my fault!

77
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,393
She's here because of me.

78
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:08,568
- She's gone.
- What?

79
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:17,098
<i>Okay, well, that's that.
Lets get out of here.</i>

80
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,005
No.

81
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,007
<i>Ugh, you're going to save
her life again, aren't you?</i>

82
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:24,011
Yes.

83
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,730
You're welcome.

84
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,333
I'd be happier
as that creature's excrement

85
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,735
than be grateful to you.

86
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:54,809
<i>What did you expect,
a hug and a kiss?</i>

87
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:06,095
By Aku's will, you will die in here.

88
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,599
There is no hope for you,
foolish samurai.

89
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:13,271
Aku is the master of masters
and will end you!

90
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,141
No matter
what you have planned for me,

91
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,543
I will never buckle,
never waiver.

92
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,605
Your death is certain!
Aku desires it!

93
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,045
Aku has made
a world of wonders,

94
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,981
and you have soiled it!

95
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,316
Aku is the father of all fathers!

96
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,722
His greatness cannot be measured!

97
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:36,627
You are a parasite, samurai,
feeding off Aku's generosity!

98
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,128
Aku, my master,
this fool knows not

99
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:43,627
of your greatness,
your kindness,

100
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,638
- your understanding!
- Enough!

101
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,769
Every thing,
every word,

102
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,477
every thought
that you know... is wrong!

103
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,312
Aku ... Aku is the one
that has laid waste

104
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,218
to the beauty of this world!

105
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:59,350
He has destroyed
mother nature!

106
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,448
Where do you think we are?!

107
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,622
Aku has unleashed
these monstrosities

108
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,527
upon our world, and they
feed off his carnage.

109
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,662
- Liar!
- Believe what you may.

110
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,374
But if you open your eyes
and let go of the hate,

111
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:18,604
you will see the truth.

112
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,158
Die.

113
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:26,941
Rain?

114
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,196
Well, um...

115
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:54,274
I guess we should
get this over with.

116
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,741
You know, uh, many
people pay money for this.

117
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:28,468
It's called acupuncture.

118
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,343
Never mind.

119
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,282
Whew.

120
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,937
- I like the back fur.
- You look hideous.

121
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,839
From you, "hideous" is
quite acceptable. Thank you.

122
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,003
We're close.

123
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:15,573
Even in the bowels
of the darkest of creatures,

124
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,374
there is beautiful light.

125
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,645
Seems simple enough ...

126
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,579
use the flying creatures to escape

127
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:03,046
and not fall into the
pool of acid. Right.

128
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,404
Whew.

129
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,725
We're slowing down.

130
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,230
No, please, faster.
Faster!

131
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:38,939
Wait!
