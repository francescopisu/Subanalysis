00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:06,325
50 years have passed,

2
00:00:06,327 --> 00:00:09,897
<i>but I do not age.</i>

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:17,373
<i>Time has lost it's effect on me.</i>

4
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:24,882
<i>Yet, the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:28,833
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

6
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,090
<i>present, and future.</i>

7
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:35,917
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,430
<i>Got to get back,
back to the past.</i>

9
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:42,558
Samurai Jack.

Ha-ha!
We found him!

13
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:53,011
- We're ready, dad!
- Wha?!

14
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,680
Flora! What in Bonnie
blazes are ya' wearing?!

15
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,217
I take you out

16
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,752
and ye dress like
you're going dancing!

17

Cover yourself!

18

- You'll catch your death of cold!
- Dad!

That goes for all of you!

<i> Dad!</i>

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:16,630
Now we....
charge!

22
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,261
Can somebody please

23
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,070
stop all that noise!

24
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,473
<i>I'm sorry, master, but it
seems we are under attack.</i>

25
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,748
Under attack?

26
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:20,367
Hmm, perhaps
annihilating this scum

27
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:25,774
will break me out of my
melaise.

28
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:34,415
Wha?!

29
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:46,328
You know what?
This was a bad idea!

30
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:49,124
- Time to go, girls!
- But, dad...

31
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,060
No arguing!
Go!

32
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:56,935
I'll stall him while you escape.

33
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:03,907
Meh.
Oh!

34
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,010
Eh, better to make it
a complete annihilation.

35
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,552
<i> Hold it!</i>

36
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,555
You're not going anywhere,
ya' big buffoon!

37
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:22,460
I'm sorry, old man.
I think you're lost.

38
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,029
I ain't lost, ya tree ogre.

39
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,894
I might be old,
but I've lived long enough

40
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,530
to see the world rise
against your tyranny!

41
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,735
Admit it, ya big oaf!
You're scared.

42
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,505
The samurai is still out there
inspiring people by the thousands.

43
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,571
<i>After all these years,
you're powerless against him.</i>

44
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:45,111
You've been shivering like
a wee baby, hiding in your crib,

45
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,018
<i>afraid to show yourself
'cause ya know he's out there,</i>

46
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,580
<i>and you can't do anything about it!</i>

47
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,758
You're just a big baby!

48
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,493
<i>Why don't you go cry to your mama?</i>

49
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,038
No.

50
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:19,214
Dad.

51
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:25,724
Ah, why did he
bring up the samurai?

52
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:48,647
We will avenge you, father.

53
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,388
And we will never forget you.

54
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,251
<i>I be back,
and in me prime no less!</i>

55
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,797
Dad?
Oh, you live!

56
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,632
<i>Ha! Eh, kind of...</i>

57
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,334
But, how?

58
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:15,306
<i>Oh, my darling Heather
blossoms ... Celtic magic.</i>

59
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,409
What's next, father?

60
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:22,444
<i>We regroup and plan
to fight another day.</i>

61
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,148
<i>We'll amass a bigger army.</i>

62
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:29,583
<i>We'll find Jack, and finally
defeat that big baby!</i>

63
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:50,208
<i>Aku is the creator
of this world and everything in it.</i>

64
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,177
<i>Aku is the one
that has ravaged this world.</i>

65
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,212
<i>The samurai is
the poison killing the land.</i>

66
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:01,856
<i>If you let go of your hate, 
you will see the truth.</i>

67
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,320
<i>Ashi, what are you doing?</i>

68
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,994
<i>The samurai sleeps.</i>

69
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:14,236
<i>Kill him in his slumber
 before he wakes.</i>

70
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,468
No.
I have questions, mother.

71
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,203
The samurai ... he saved my life.

72
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,390
- He ...
- How dare you?

73
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,575
<i>You know he is deceitful.</i>

74
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:28,077
<i>He will do everything in
his power to defy the master!</i>

75
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,210
<i>You were always the weak one
... distracted, unfocused.</i>

76
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,959
<i>May Aku punish you for your sins!</i>

77
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:38,419
I just want the truth.

78
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:42,007
<i>You have failed us.</i>

79
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,588
Get on.

80
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,211
Hold on.

81
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,045
Thank you, friend.
I shall not forget your kindness.

82
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,762
Goodbye.

83
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,151
Please, no more, please.

84
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,659
- What do you want?
- The truth.

85
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,226
- I have already told you the truth.
- Show me.

86
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,835
- No.
- No?! What do you mean, no?!

87
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,537
You tell me that everything
that I know is wrong,

88
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,570
but refuse to prove any of it.

89
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:14,175
You're afraid ... afraid
that I will see you're a liar!

90
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,582
You are too blinded by Aku's hate.
You won't change.

91
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,417
What do you know of me,

92
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,189
everything I have endured
up until this moment?!

93
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,090
You know nothing, samurai.

94
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:30,328
- You are just a lowly, soulless pig.
- Very well.

95
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,693
I will show you.

96
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,507
Please sit.

97
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:48,219
- Well, when do we start?
- In the morning. Have patience.

98
00:10:56,921 --> 00:11:00,121
<i>Samurai, the stars.</i>

99
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,756
<i>They are Aku's creation, yes?</i>

100
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,393
- You th... no!
- Then who?

101
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,303
When I was very young,

102
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:10,468
my mother told me a story

103
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,979
of when all the earth
was covered in darkness.

104
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:16,973
<i>But a little magical boy named "Sun"</i>

105
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,806
<i>and his little sister named "Moon"</i>

106
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,741
<i>rode a Phoenix up into the darkness.</i>

107
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,251
<i>They shot enchanted arrows</i>

108
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,186
<i>that exploded and filled the dark sky</i>

109
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,791
<i>with an infinity of stars.</i>

110
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,546
- That tree...
- One of many.

111
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:03,087
The trees stretched as
far as the eye can see.

112
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,459
It was a testament to nature's wonder

113
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,556
until Aku destroyed everything.

114
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,624
He left but one ... a reminder
of his power and oppression.

115
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:18,565
- Why?
- Aku is evil personified ...

116
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,268
the darkest soul from the pit of hate.

117
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:25,503
To him, all that is good and
innocent must be decimated.

118
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:28,808
That is his will, his desire.

119
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:31,571
Here is your truth.

120
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:37,981
A city of Aku ... a gateway to evil.

121
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:45,558
Come quickly!

122
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:49,221
My friend, trust me.
It is a thing of beauty on you.

123
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:52,831
Fresh shoes, freshly made every day.

124
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:57,337
Vintage, period coats ...
16th, 17th, 18th centuries.

125
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:06,744
There.

126
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:25,332
We are criminal banished from our world.

127
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:30,877
We hear that Aku welcomes
those that are like us.

128
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:33,507
Most enthusiastically.

129
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:37,272
Your new home will be
coordinates 6-12-71.

130
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:47,226
- It is occupied.
- Is that a problem for you?

131
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,620
No. No problem.

132
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:57,539
The innocent and weak
always preyed upon.

133
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:03,372
Catastrophe.

134
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,343
<i>Devastation.</i>

135
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,170
<i>Carnage.</i>

136
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:15,813
Enough.
I've seen enough.

137
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:17,885
Do you believe now?

138
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,852
Yes. What can we do?

139
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,290
- Nothing.
- What?!

140
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,820
What do you mean, nothing?
We have to do something!

141
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,430
I've fought Aku for ages.
I've seen countless innocents die.

142
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:34,502
I've lived this nightmare for
what seems like an eternity.

143
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:37,203
There is no way to defeat him.

144
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:41,571
There is no hope.
No way out.

145
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:44,847
<i>Help.</i>

146
00:14:44,882 --> 00:14:47,122
<i>Help.</i>

147
00:14:57,358 --> 00:15:02,328
You've come back at last, Samurai Jack.

148
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:07,064
- You've come.
- What happened?

149
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:16,573
They ... they took all the children.

150
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,484
- Where?
- The factory.

151
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,785
- Do you hear that?
- No. Run.

152
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,186
What?

153
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,828
Run!

154
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,269
Something has to be
controlling them ... that sound!

155
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,849
Destroy the source!

156
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:25,466
Wha...?

157
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,320
Well, what do we have here?

158
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:50,597
A little samurai sympathizer.

159
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:53,866
And quite the pretty one.

160
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:54,923
Sorry, Princess.
Ran out of juice.

161
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,460
No worries, though.

162
00:18:56,465 --> 00:19:00,035
A quick re-charge and
then back to the fun.

163
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,151
Would you look at that.

164
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,889
Righteous fool.

165
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,751
After everything, he still
can't hurt an innocent.

166
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:28,121
Turning those little
brats into weapons ...

167
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,890
pretty ingenious, right?

168
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:34,968
Children are foolish
little things, easily manipulated.

169
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,930
Surgically implant a chip in their neck,

170
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:39,739
and the right audio
frequency does the rest.

171
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:43,471
Well, back to the fun.

172
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,487
What the...?

173
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,566
Oh, no, you don't!

174
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,750
Ah! Ooh!
Oof!

175
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,540
No!

176
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,487
N-o-o-o-o-o!

177
00:21:02,424 --> 00:21:05,054
