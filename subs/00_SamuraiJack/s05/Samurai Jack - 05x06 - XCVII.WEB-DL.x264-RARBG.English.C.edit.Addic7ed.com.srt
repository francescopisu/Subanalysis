50 years have passed.

<i>But I do not age.</i>

3
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:16,697
<i>Time has lost its effect on me.</i>

4
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:24,633
<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:28,491
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

6
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:32,071

7
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,748
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

8
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:40,417
<i>Got to get back ...
back to the past.</i>

9
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,089
<i>Samurai Jack.</i>

00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,199
- Are you sure she was the one?
- Yes.

13
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,455
I specifically saw her
asking about him.

14
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,321
- Aku's bounty hunter?
- I sense her evil.

15
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:24,268
Gotcha!

16
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,463
We will not let you
hurt the samurai.

17
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,968
Hurt?
No, I...

18
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,169
Look, I'm not
trying to hurt him.

19
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:35,376
I'm trying to find him.
He might be in trouble.

20
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:39,843
- You are his friend?
- I... don't know.

21
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,626
We are his friends.

22
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,647
It was long ago.

23
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,369
We were slaves.

24
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:55,238
Down, down,
you miserable beast!

25
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,669
Now go!

26
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,541
Come on! You're not
moving fast enough.

27
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:05,712
<i>But then Jack came.</i>

28
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:29,221
He risked his life to save ours.

29
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:35,742
Miss, the bearded fella you
inquired about... he got off here.

30
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:39,342
Thank you
for sharing your story.

31
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,480

schmuck broke my phone.

35
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:23,624
I got to tell Aku
that Jacky boy lost his sword.

36
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,278
Oh, well, I guess
I'm bunny hopping my way there.

I seek the samurai.

41

No, I seek to help him.
He might be in danger.

42
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:09,453
A friend of Samurai Jack
is a friend of ours.

43
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:11,579
Come.

44
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:22,488
Welcome to our home.

45
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:28,556
None of this would exist
if it wasn't for him.

46
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:40,436
We were cursed...
bound to guard a magical portal.

47
00:04:58,183 --> 00:05:00,553
<i>The samurai was able to defeat us,</i>

48
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,723
<i>but instead of using it
to fulfill his quest...</i>

49
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:09,528
<i>...he freed us.</i>

50
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,039
An act of unmeasurable sacrifice.

51
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:23,541
Later, we learned the curse
was of Aku's doing.

52
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:30,916
Have you seen him?
Has he passed through here?

53
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:34,944
No. Since that day,
we have not seen him.

54
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:38,021
But we now stand against Aku.

55
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:43,112
- If he is ever in need, we will be there.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,669
I have to go.

57
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,243
Oh, man.

58
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,944
Oh. All this walking
is hard on my neck.

59
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,418
Hey, I made it!
I finally made it!

60
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,666
What is the problemo, babe?

61
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:27,074
<i>"No shirt, no shoes,

the assassin with the sassin'.

64

00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,492
One day, you're
the star of the show,

70
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:50,163
the next, you're the third act
of a two-act play.

71
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:53,063
Well, this star is a headliner, babe,

72
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:56,816

00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:56,600

00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,994
Okay, little puppy,
you looked in a mirror lately?

138
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,334
Now, go get somebody their slippers
or something. I'm on the line.

139
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:40,024
So I wanted to tell ya, Aku,
Jacko has lost ...

You're looking for the samurai?!

154
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:58,376
Little girl, Samurai Jack is
the toughest S.O.B. out there.

155
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:03,488
Last time we fought, he did...
this to me.

156
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:06,557
<i>Ha! That's nothing!
Check me out!</i>

157
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:10,562
These things are literally
holding me together!

158
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:13,097
Dude, really?

159
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:17,908
I used to go to the bathroom,
but now I go in a bag!

160
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,418
<i>He busted me eye!</i>

161
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:26,334
Man... those robotic cats
got nothin' on me!

162
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:31,773
'Cause back in the day,
I was a bad-ass sa-mu-rai!

163
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:33,718
I was Da' Samurai!

164
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:40,613

<i>The whack-a-hack!</i>

<i>And, of course,
the ever famous...</i>

<i>Turkey carve!</i>

170
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,909
<i>But Samurai Jack enlightened me</i>

171
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,170
<i>to the true meaning
of being a samurai.</i>

172
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,715
Shortly after,
I gave up my blade and top knot

173
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:08,022
and became the bartender here

174
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:12,390
- at the place where we first met.
- Uh...

175
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:14,659
that doesn't sound bad at all.

176
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,016
That's because you ain't got
no soul, you robot fool!

177
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:22,096
<i> I have returned!</i>

178
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:29,303
I, Demongo,
have come to collect

179
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:33,071
the souls of the greatest warriors.

180
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:41,386
But I see I have come
to the wrong place.

181
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:45,344
We got some straight-up
freaks coming through this place.

182
00:16:53,364 --> 00:16:56,434
Are you the one
looking for the samurai?

183
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:00,730
- Yes.
- Are you his friend?

184
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:06,479
- Yes.
- Follow the path north.

185
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:11,516
Who...?

186
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,826
Samurai...

187
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,028
Jack?

188
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:15,175
<i>You may witness, but you cannot
proceed any further.</i>

189
00:18:15,881 --> 00:18:18,015
Witness what?

190
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,556
<i>The end.</i>

191
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:34,198
<i>Great warriors of past,
I welcome you.</i>

192
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,344
<i>This samurai has
failed his purpose</i>

193
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,614
<i>and has accepted his fate.</i>

194
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:03,360
Stop!

195
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:07,565
<i>This does not concern you.</i>

196
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:10,236
<i>There is no hope.</i>

197
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:12,103
No!

198
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:15,339
Hope lives.
It is everywhere.

199
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,040
I've seen it,
everyone you have touched,

200
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:21,378
the people you have helped.
You saved them!

201
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,349
<i>Enough!</i>

202
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,820
<i>Hope is just
a fleeting sentiment.</i>

203
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,930
<i>Your failure is real.</i>

204
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:47,106
<i>You must face the consequences
or continue to bear the guilt</i>

205
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:50,076
<i>of your dishonor for all eternity.</i>

206
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:55,119
Jack, don't listen!

207
00:19:55,313 --> 00:19:58,582
You're being misguided!
I've seen it.

208
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,113
You've saved
countless innocents.

209
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:04,655
And most of all...

210
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,196
...you showed me the truth!

211
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:13,899
You made me see that
there's so much more to me

212
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:16,439
than I knew existed.

213
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:19,892
You made me way more
than what I was.

214
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:30,585
The hope you gave me
saved my life!

215
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:35,904
<i>Death follows in your wake ...</i>

216
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:39,124
<i>men, woman, children.</i>

217
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:46,395
<i>Yes. All those children
dead because of you.</i>

218
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,535
No!
The children ... they're alive!

219
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:54,276
You saved them!

220
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:58,803
<i>No more words!</i>

221
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:42,086
I, uh...
I like your hair.

222
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:44,627
And dress.

223
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,805
What now?

224
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:52,391
It's time to find my sword.
