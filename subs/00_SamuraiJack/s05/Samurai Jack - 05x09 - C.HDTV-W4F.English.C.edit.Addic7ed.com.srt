<i>But I do not age.</i>

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:15,137
<i>Time has lost its effect on me.</i>

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,012
<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,831
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

6
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,753
<i>present, and future.</i>

7
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:34,690
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

8
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:38,861
<i>Got to get back ...
back to the past.</i>

Ohh!

13
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:01,917
Ugh!

14
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,624
I'm so sorry.
It's not ...

15
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:10,915
No, I know, not from the thing
that we did, but ...

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,928
- But it's the creature's...
- ...the residue that is...

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,134
- Mm-hmm. There's still some left.
- Oh, right. Oh, yes.

18
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,173
Oh! Wait.
I still have your robe.

Gi!

20
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,147
Y-You should still wear that.
Uh, it's very drafty in here.

21
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:39,522
I'm gonna find some clothes.

22
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:42,872
Very well. I'll, uh,
meet you outside, then?

23
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,362
Yes.

24
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:53,536
Well, I better go, 'cause,
you know, it's very drafty,

25
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:56,639
and you're not wearing
any clothes, either.

26
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,840
Yes.

27
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:02,445
- I'll see you in a bit, then.
- Bye.

28
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,849
Bye.

29
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,322
Where am I gonna
find some clothes?

30
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,583
Hmm.
Well... this could work.

31
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:09,705
<i>Be careful.</i>

32
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:15,244
I know. This... has
never happened before.

33
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:17,680
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

34
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,716
I don't know.

35
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,072
- Ashi.
- Hi.

36
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:47,209
- This all looks quite lovely.
- Thank you.

37
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:48,777
You're welcome.

38
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:52,425
- S-Should we sit?
- Yes.

39
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:59,455
- Oh, and I have food.
- So do I.

40
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,416
- A little chewy.
- Yes.

41
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:32,387
Oh, but still very good.

42
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,324
- More?
- No, thank you.

43
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,972
Jack, do you ever
think about home?

44
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,507
Every day.

45
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:56,484
My family, my home ...
all of it.

46
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,889
<i>My father was the emperor,</i>

47
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,892
<i>so we lived in the palace
overlooking the whole village.</i>

48
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:13,095
<i>It was so high up in the air
that it touched the clouds.</i>

49
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:19,401
<i>I would just stare out at the
beauty of the seasons changing.</i>

50
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:20,969
<i>The summer sun
blanketed the valley</i>

51
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:25,433
<i>with long, beautiful shadows.</i>

52
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,645
<i>The fall leaves
brought a bounty of color.</i>

53
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:33,849
<i>Winter was so white.</i>

54
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,853
<i>And the cherry blossoms
in the spring.</i>

55
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:51,259
- And... was there a girl?
- Yes, many.

56
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:53,835
Oh!
Wait.

57
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:57,925
I ... You mean "a girl?"

58
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:06,682
No, no. I was only 8 when Aku
came and then everything...

59
00:07:06,684 --> 00:07:11,486
Jack, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

60
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:16,959
It is nice to remember
the time before Aku.

61
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:21,430
It is the only way
I will ever see it again ...

62
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:22,864
as a memory.

63
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,291
Jack?
Jack?!

64
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:50,792
Jack.

65
00:07:58,836 --> 00:07:59,901
Aha!

66
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,873
Yeah, baby!
I really made it!

67
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:05,941
Whoo!

68
00:08:10,648 --> 00:08:13,449
Wait.
What's that up ahead?

69
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:17,753
Aku?
What a welcome!

70
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:23,819
Aku, baby, I'm back.
Scaramouche has returned!

71
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,029
What the ...

72
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:33,902
<i>Hello. You are now
hearing the voice of Aku!</i>

73
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:38,840
<i> Unfortunately,
I will no longer be available</i>

74
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:41,710
<i> for any more appointments.</i>

75
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:45,784
<i>I'm sorry for any inconvenience</i>

76
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:49,017
<i>this may have caused you.</i>

77
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,486
<i> Now, go!</i>

78
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,355
Oh, no, baby.

79
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:56,792
I did not come all this way
for nothing.

80
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:01,196
Luckily,
Scaramouche knows scarymuch

81
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:03,532
<i>about all the ins and outs, babe.</i>

82
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,541
Aku!

83
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,380
<i>Go away. Didn't
you hear the recording?</i>

84
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,849
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

85
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,352
Oh, but, Aku-kachu,
I got some info on Jack-o

86
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:26,922
that's outta this world, babe!

87
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:28,523
<i>Ugh.</i>

88
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,868
Whaaaat?!

89
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,069
Feast your ears on this.

90
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,804
I mean, do you even have ears?

91
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:45,107
Like, can those antler things
even hear?

92
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:48,657
- Get on with it!
- Dig this, boss ...

93
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:52,380
Jack-o has lost his sword-o.

94
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:56,618
Are you sure?!

95
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,454
Yes! Yes!
I'll bet my life on it!

96
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:03,225
What joy!

97
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:09,431
Yeah!
I'm back, baby!

98
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,866
Oh, yeah!

00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,735

100
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:14,936

00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,668
I know this place.

107
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:47,656
<i>Jack... why?</i>

108
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:50,091
Why did you just leave
like that?

109
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,760
You shouldn't
have followed me.

110
00:12:51,762 --> 00:12:54,863
- You need to go back.
- Go back?

111
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:57,399
No.
I'm not going anywhere.

112
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,969
- What's going on?
- You don't understand.

113
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:05,158
So help me understand.
Jack.

114
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:07,676
All these years,

115
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,979
I have seen so many innocents
fall victim to Aku ...

116
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,948
kind and decent people ...

117
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,851
my friends, my family ...
every one of them.

118
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:21,556
His evil has taken everything
I've ever... loved.

119
00:13:21,558 --> 00:13:25,260
All I have left...
are memories.

120
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:31,362
I do not want you
to become just a memory.

121
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:36,004
Jack, don't you see?

122
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,139
Everything that has
happened in our lives

123
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:42,644
has brought us here ...
right now, together.

124
00:13:42,846 --> 00:13:47,048
And together,
we're going to defeat Aku.

125
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,720
<i>Samurai Jack!</i>

126
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:59,127
- Aku!
- Aku?

127
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,599
It has been too long ...
far, far too long.

128
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:07,268
But you're probably saying
to yourself,

129
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,039
"Why? Why now 
for our sudden reunion?"

130
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,910
Well, a little birdie told me...

131
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:22,584
...that Samurai Jack has lost

132
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:27,722
the one thing in the entire
universe that can destroy Aku!

133
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:41,836
You foooooooool!

134
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,540
Ugh?!

135
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:48,280
Oh, but, master I ...

136
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,815
Well, it has been nice
catching up, but I should go.

137
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:58,053
I don't want to interrupt
you and your lady friend.

138
00:14:58,055 --> 00:15:00,622
Pretend I was never here.

139
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:04,959
- I'll let myself out.
- Aku!

140
00:15:04,961 --> 00:15:07,896
Wait a minute.

141
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,735
I smell something ...
something very familiar.

142
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:20,508
I smell me!

143
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,946
- Madness!
- Hold it! Time out!

144
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,548
Really!

145
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,685
There's more Aku here,
besides me.

146
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,189
Stay back!

147
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:41,396
Yes.
I smell me inside of her.

148
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:45,200
- Ashi...
- Jack.

149
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:49,737
But how can that be?
I never ... Oh, wait.

150
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:52,807
There was that one time.

151
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,946
<i>Aaaaaaakkkkkkkuuuuuu.</i>

152
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,893
Not bad.

153
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:14,362
<i>Aaaaaaakkkkkkkuuuuuu.</i>

154
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,932
Yes, an attractive replica,

155
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:21,636
but it pales to the original.
Here!

156
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:28,576
Worship me,
daughters of Aku!

157
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:33,181
So she must have...

158
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:35,617
drank it?
And then...

159
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:43,791
Here you are,
a true daughter of Aku.

160
00:16:47,264 --> 00:16:51,199
- No!
- Aku!

161
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:52,133
Oh?!

162
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,937
Yaaaagh!

163
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:04,579
- Ashi?
- I-I didn't do this!

164
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,582
Yes, you did.

165
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:10,652
Jack!

166
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:14,856
- Ashi?
- It's not me!

167
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,492
Of course it is, sweetheart.

168
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,295
You wouldn't let
your daddy get hurt

169
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:23,729
by that bad ol' Samurai.

170
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:28,803
Jaaack!
I can't stop this!

171
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:31,372
I can't control myself!

172
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:34,475
You must fight it!
Fight!

173
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:38,846
I'm trying!

174
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:43,981
Ashi, focus!
Break free!

175
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:51,893
I mean,
you try and raise them right,

176
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,862
then they run off
with your mortal enemy.

177
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,599
What's a dad to do?

178
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:04,239
Jack!
Nothing is working!

179
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:05,607
Don't give in.

180
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,743
Fight, Ashi.
Fight it!

181
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,594
Ashi, you are not your father.

182
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:28,463
You are not your mother.

183
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:32,400
You are your own person.
You are good.

184
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,502
You can defeat him from inside.

185
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,539
Boring!

186
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:58,960
Sweetheart, you have to bring
out your best to defeat him,

187
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:03,131
and your best part
is meeeee!

188
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,467
Ashi!

189
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:09,604
Nooooo!

190
00:19:15,945 --> 00:19:17,045
Ashi!

191
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,127
Ashi...

192
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,807
That's my girl.

193
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:34,689
Ashi?
Ashi!

194
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,226
Jack!
Kill me, Jack!

195
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:41,696
- Kill me, then destroy Aku!
- Ashi!

196
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,400
You have to do it.
Do it now!

197
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,113
Kill me!

198
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,421
I can't.

199
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:15,263
Stooooooop!
