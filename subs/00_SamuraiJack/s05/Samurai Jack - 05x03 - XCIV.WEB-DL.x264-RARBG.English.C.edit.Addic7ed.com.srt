50 years have passed.

2
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:09,769
<i>But I do not age.</i>

3
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:16,552
<i>Time has lost its effect on me.</i>

4
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:24,524
<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:28,589
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

6
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,185
<i>present, and future.</i>

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,099
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

8
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:38,333
<i>Got to get back ...</i>

9
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,268
<i>back to the past.</i>

10
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:42,004
<i>Samurai Jack.</i>

13
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,369
They're coming!

14
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,082
Huh?

15
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:53,058
<i>Look at you.</i>

16
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:59,527
<i>You've survived worse.</i>

17
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:05,295
<i>This isn't about
your pathetic little cut.</i>

18
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:07,465
<i>It's about that girl you killed.</i>

19
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:12,172
<i>We've never killed a human
before, have we?</i>

20
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:17,149
<i>Sure, mountains of robot corpses.
But this?</i>

21
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,050
<i>This was the first human being.</i>

22
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,023
<i>Real flesh and blood.</i>

23
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:26,047
<i>What happens
when the others find you?</i>

24
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,887
<i>You'll have to kill them, too.
Can you?</i>

25
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,886
<i>Will you be able to
when the time comes?</i>

26
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:35,429
<i>Maybe they will kill you.</i>

27
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,733
<i>Or is that what you want?</i>

28
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,438
No.

29
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,645
<i>Emperor!</i>

30
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:07,817
<i>Your guards are dead,
and you are next!</i>

31
00:07:12,662 --> 00:07:17,298
<i>Your choices have
clearly led you here, as have mine.</i>

32
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,834
<i>I will give you a new choice.</i>

33
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,169
Leave now and live

34
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,935
or stay and face your destiny.

35
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:30,006
Ha! Your Bushido nonsense
means nothing to us.

36
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:33,176
Your destiny is death!

37
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,332
Huh?

38
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:44,438
The decisions you make
and the actions that follow

39
00:10:44,474 --> 00:10:47,884
are a reflection of who you are.

40
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:51,151
You cannot hide from yourself.

41
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,719
Death is failure.

42
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:14,865
Follow the river.

43
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:36,421
I'll take watch.

44
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,164
Samurai blood.
The river guides our way.

45
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,935
- What... is that?
- Quiet!

46
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,213
Mother told us there
would be other creatures.

47
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:07,722
Wait.
Something else approaches.

48
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,345
Is it with the Samurai?
Should we kill it?

49
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:20,060
Aku.
It is surely one of his minions.

50
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:22,126
It will devour the weaker one.

51
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:32,944
- What madness is this?
- What are they doing?

52
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,550
- I... don't know.
- Well, I don't like it.

53
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:42,684
Look.

54
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,496
<i>You have chosen this path.</i>

55
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,935
<i>Life works in strange ways.</i>

56
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:40,382
<i>Your choices have clearly
led you here, as have mine.</i>

57
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:44,414
<i>I will give you a new choice.</i>

58
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,947
<i>Leave here now and live</i>

59
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:50,153
<i>or stay and face your destiny.</i>

60
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:52,816
Our destiny is your death!

61
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:57,063
<i>So... I guess you're staying.</i>

62
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,596
<i>Perhaps I was unclear.</i>

63
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:10,139
Enough words! Show yourself,
Samurai, so you can die!

64
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:13,544
<i>Very well.
The decisions you make</i>

65
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,614
<i>and the actions that follow</i>

66
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:17,845
<i>- are a reflection of ...
- Shut up!</i>

67
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,550
<i>...of who you really are.</i>

68
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:13,408
You worthless scum!
I will kill you!

69
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:17,081
You can never escape from Aku!
You will die!

70
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:20,478
<i>You will die a horrible death,
and then Aku will sing,</i>

71
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:23,746
<i>for he is free
from the parasite that you are!</i>

72
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:26,621
<i>Die, Samurai!
Die, die, you scum!</i>

73
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:29,024
<i>Die! Die!
Die, Samurai!</i>

74
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:32,837
<i>You will... diiiiiie!</i>
