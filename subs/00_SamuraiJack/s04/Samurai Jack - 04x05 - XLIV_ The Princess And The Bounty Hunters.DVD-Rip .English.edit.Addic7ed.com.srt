1
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:05,783
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:10,924
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:14,594
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:20,097
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:23,440
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:28,147
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:32,677
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,553
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,492
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:44,487
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,927
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,130
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:54,039
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:58,671
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,713 --> 00:00:59,839
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,180
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:07,177
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:09,516
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:13,823
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,836
OK, so you want
a little off of the top?

21
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:27,364
Yes, sir, it's no problem.

22
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:32,141
Well, we don't get many people
up in these parts, kind of slow, you know...

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,308
but l will make you look sharp.
Yes, sir!

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,480
You are in good hands with Tonino
'cause l'm the best!

25
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:41,989
l've been cutting hair all of my life.

26
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:46,289
No matter how big or small,
l cut them all.

27
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:48,124
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

28
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:52,190
lt's Jujunga,
the aboriginal bounty hunter.

29
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:56,499
His blowgun has captured
the most elusive prey.

30
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:59,166
A tattooed terror!

31
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:03,300
What is he doin' this far north?

32
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,073
Must be on some kind of hunt.

33
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,775
Certainly ain't here for the night life!

34
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,680
So, as l was saying...

35
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:15,146
lt's l and Am,
the infamous twins...

36
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,988
bounty hunter legends.

37
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:21,325
Their techniques are so cunning...

38
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:23,796
their abilities so in tune...

39
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:28,165
it's rumored
that they share the same mind.

40
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,003
That reminds me, back in the old days...

41
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,372
how l used to hang around
the barber shop...

42
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:36,001
with all of the customers...

43
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:40,447
some with nice, black, thick hair,
you know, like all of...

44
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,813
Sorry! <i>Zabaglione!</i>

45
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,341
lt's The Gentleman.

46
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:48,446
He's a nice fella but deadly.

47
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,686
This bounty hunter dueled with many...

48
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,320
but none could escape his skill.

49
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:57,058
The knives are his weapon of choice.

50
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:01,797
Look at him so stylish, oh, so fancy!

51
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,599
Great hair!

52
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,799
What's this?

53
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:09,370
l never seen this one before.

54
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,037
Curious.

55
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:19,318
A strange fella. l wonder...

56
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,861
Oh, my!

57
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,669
You...you...you're...

58
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:41,232
Boris, biggest, baddest
bounty hunter of all!

59
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>Da!</i>

60
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:17,703
What is up here?

61
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:21,573
lt seems there is a problem
you cannot deny.

62
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,407
We are all here
for the same samurai.

63
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:30,383
lndeed we are,
but l see no reason to discuss this...

64
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:33,285
in the most frigid
of temperatures.

65
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:36,415
l suggest that we confer
on this delicate matter...

66
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,858
inside this nearby
vacant structure.

67
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,759
<i>Da!</i> lt is cold.

68
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,770
lt seems we have amassed
quite a committee.

69
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:03,417
But only one of us
can claim this bounty.

70
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,510
lt seems that
the one who goes first...

71
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:09,045
will have the best chance
of collecting everything.

72
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:16,625
l have come here before everyone.

73
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:18,791
l will go first.

74
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:26,466
He has no chance
against the power of Jujunga.

75
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,702
As the Samurai approaches...

76
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:32,406
l shall sit by the roadside playing the flute.

77
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,281
He will pause a moment
and listen to the beautiful sounds...

78
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,017
slowly being lulled
into false security.

79
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,926
At the moment he's
at his most vulnerable...

80
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,434
my trap is sprung.

81
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,138
My flute is really a blowgun...

82
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:02,905
with darts dipped
in the most lethal of poisons.

83
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,640
This bounty will be mine!

84
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,614
You will fail.

85
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,412
Your plan is flawed.

86
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:15,013
How? lt has never failed me before.
lt cannot be defeated.

87
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:17,183
The Samurai's senses are too acute.

88
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,693
He will hear you take a breath
before you fire...

89
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,854
and easily avoid your dart completely.

90
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:23,864
You wouldn't stand a chance!

91
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:29,359
The Gentleman reluctantly must agree
with our mysterious friend.

92
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:33,499
You lack a certain style,
a <i>savoir-faire...</i>

93
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,568
that is required
for this particular bounty.

94
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:43,107
Whereas l, on the other hand, have
all the wit and panache necessary...

95
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,483
to take on such a worthy adversary.

96
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:56,486
For l shall meet
my most studious of samurais...

97
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:59,295
out on the field of honor..

98
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:04,430
in a duel,
a duel of epic proportions.

99
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:07,669
lt is true the Samurai has great skills...

100
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,972
that no one can deny...

101
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,411
but on this day, my friends...

102
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:15,381
it is The Gentleman who will prevail...

103
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,352
for my talents are far superior...

104
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:23,847
and my strategy
is as sound as l am elegant.

105
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:29,852
Yes, l will take advantage
of his intense concentration...

106
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:32,024
and split his focus...

107
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:37,402
forcing him to choose
between life and death.

108
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:42,731
My cloak acting
as shield and decoy...

109
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,870
for the <i>coup de gr√¢ce</i>.

110
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:46,641
Now, l'm not one to brag...

111
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:51,778
but l must say that my blades
fly faster than any bullet.

112
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:54,310
He will not be able
to escape them.

113
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:56,380
l assure you, indeed...

114
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:58,654
this bounty will be mine.

115
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:01,127
lt is definitely the end for you.

116
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:03,190
Pardon me?

117
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,790
He is too disciplined
to fall for your tricks.

118
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,324
Your decoy alone
is not strong enough.

119
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:12,970
A stylish plan it sounds, indeed.

120
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:14,497
But he is right.

121
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:17,204
An attack like that will not succeed.

122
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:22,205
- Listen to our plan.
- And you will see.

123
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:25,980
- lt is ''l''.
- And ''Am'' who will claim this bounty.

124
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,287
As the Samurai enters the town...

125
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:36,262
we will wait for the final showdown.

126
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,356
Concealed we will be.

127
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:42,969
Our surprise he will never see.

128
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:48,303
l will attack from the rear...

129
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:52,941
and Am from the sun will appear.

130
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,882
A thousand bombs
will fall from the sky.

131
00:09:56,917 --> 00:10:01,786
ln his confusion,
the Samurai will surely die.

132
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:11,055
You're on the right track,
but the two of you can never defeat Jack.

133
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:13,464
Jack is cunning and hard to restrain.

134
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:17,164
By leaving him a sword
he stays in the game.

135
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:20,132
Enough with this kiddie talk.

136
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:25,603
Boris is best.
Bounty belongs to Boris.

137
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:33,653
Little man is coming.
l do not wait.

138
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,415
He will attack with sword.

139
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,860
lt breaks against my belly.

140
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:44,091
Then l break him!

141
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,828
Break him! Break him!
Break him!

142
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:52,601
That's how Boris gets the bounty!
Any questions?!

143
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,699
Have you always been this stupid?

144
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,039
Yes!

145
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,477
What? What? No...

146
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:01,003
You've underestimated your opponent.

147
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:03,278
You have no idea
what you're up against.

148
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:08,653
You will all run headlong into death!

149
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,054
What?!

150
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:26,138
Your skills are most impressive...

151
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:30,234
and your talents certainly
seem to match your wisdom.

152
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:35,305
lf you would be so inclined,
kind sir, to reveal yourself to us.

153
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:42,849
A woman?!

154
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:50,425
Oh, my!

155
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,564
l am Princess Mira
of the Andaluvians.

156
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:02,337
l've heard of her.
She's powerful.

157
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:06,506
ls she the one
who captured that guy...

158
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:08,811
on that planet...

159
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,544
- Yes.
- Oh, my!

160
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,381
Well, she <i>is</i> good.

161
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,320
l have more power and skill
than all of you.

162
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:18,985
lt seems her tongue
bites as hard as her stick.

163
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:22,325
But even <i>l</i> cannot defeat
the Samurai on my own.

164
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:25,230
- What's that?
- The only way to defeat him...

165
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:28,326
is to join forces
and attack him together, all at once!

166
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:31,964
A wise and powerful plan
this would be.

167
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:35,373
But who is the one
to claim the bounty?

168
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,139
- l am!
- No woman will!

169
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,171
Silence!
l must claim this bounty.

170
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,411
But not for the money.

171
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,346
For freedom.

172
00:12:47,388 --> 00:12:51,484
The freedom of my people
and my kingdom.

173
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,859
Aku has enslaved my nation
for many years...

174
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,524
plundering our wealth
and resources.

175
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:01,057
l will collect this bounty,
and for payment...

176
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:05,128
l will ask for my people to be freed,
and my kingdom restored.

177
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,835
ln return for your help,
