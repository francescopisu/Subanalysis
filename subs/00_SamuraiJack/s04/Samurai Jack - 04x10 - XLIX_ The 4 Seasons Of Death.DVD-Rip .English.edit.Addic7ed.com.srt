1
00:00:02,814 --> 00:00:05,806
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,947
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,989 --> 00:00:14,618
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:20,120
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:23,464
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:28,171
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:32,700
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:35,577
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:39,550
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:44,521
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,951
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:50,154
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:54,063
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,695
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,737 --> 00:00:59,863
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,203
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,200
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,540
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:13,847
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:43,582
Will these visions never cease?

21
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,085
l see you.

22
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:07,256
l see inside of you.

23
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:10,994
A gentle soul.
A compassionate heart.

24
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:14,061
A warrior's spirit.
A selfless service.

25
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,197
Yes.

26
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,439
lt is in your nature to sacrifice all
for what is right.

27
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:23,105
Forever giving.

28
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:25,581
You are a hero.

29
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:27,846
Well, l...

30
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:33,245
- But what replenishes you?
- Well...

31
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:54,741
What is your quest, young servant?

32
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:58,612
What brings you
through such bitter lands?

33
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,479
My destiny.

34
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,216
But it continues to be elusive.

35
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:08,622
And so, l journey on.

36
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,686
You have suffered for far too long.

37
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,459
Who are you?

38
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:17,092
- Why...
- To aid you in your cause.

39
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:22,333
l have come to give you nourishment,
to provide for you.

40
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:26,934
- But l...
- You are tired, weary of battle.

41
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:32,415
Like a weight upon your shoulders,
your quest offers you no peace.

42
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:35,612
Well, yes, but...

43
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:39,213
Stay a moment where it is peaceful.

44
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:43,989
Rejuvenate your senses
and regain your strengths.

45
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:48,123
There is water to drink and food to eat.

46
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:50,133
Be at peace, young servant.

47
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,828
Be at peace.

48
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:53,530
l am...

49
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,301
l thank you but l do not think l can...

50
00:19:57,341 --> 00:20:02,973
ls it not true that even the gods
must rest from time to time?

51
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,675
lt is true.

52
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,844
And you are not a god.

53
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:10,444
No.

54
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:14,719
Then why deny yourself?
lt serves no purpose.

55
00:20:17,027 --> 00:20:18,358
Fear not.

56
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:23,765
Your destiny will still be there for you,
even after you've rested.

57
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:27,464
Well, maybe for just a moment.

58
00:20:27,504 --> 00:20:29,995
l am weary from travel.

59
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:17,251
- l should go.
- Stay. You must not leave, not yet.

60
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:19,778
Stay. Rest.

61
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,554
No, l must go!

62
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,722
No! You will stay!

63
00:21:58,962 --> 00:21:59,951
" Watch out! "

64
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:05,128
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

65
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:12,835
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

66
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:14,002
" Watch out! "

67
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:17,810
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

68
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:22,649
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

69
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,210
" Watch out! "

70
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:33,418
" Watch out! "

71
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:37,126
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

72
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:38,191
" Watch out! "
