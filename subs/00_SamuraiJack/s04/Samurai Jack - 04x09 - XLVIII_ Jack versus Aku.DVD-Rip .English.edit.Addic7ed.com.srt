1
00:00:02,826 --> 00:00:05,818
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:10,959
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,630
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:20,132
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:23,476
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:28,183
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:32,712
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:35,589
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:39,561
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:44,533
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:48,963
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,165
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:54,075
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:58,707
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,749 --> 00:00:59,875
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,215
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:07,213
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,551
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:13,859
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,618
Yes, l can hold.

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,960
Yes, l would like to place
an order for delivery.

22
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:47,987
Aku.

23
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:52,524
l think l'm in the computer.

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,063
Yes, that's it!

25
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:59,007
l'd like a large... What?!

26
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:03,004
Extra thick!

27
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:07,540
Thirty minutes or it's free? Excellent!

28
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:22,056
You're early.

29
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,403
l suppose you know
why you're here.

30
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:35,341
Right.
Well, let me refresh your memory.

31
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:38,905
Destroy Samurai Jack!

32
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:04,771
Stupid!

33
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,306
ldiotic!

34
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:51,644
Stupid bounty hunters!

35
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,477
lt's just like people say...

36
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,685
if you want something done right,
you've got to do it yourself.

37
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:08,697
Do it yourself?

38
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:13,826
Yes...

39
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,909
- Aku!
- Yes, it is l, Samurai Jack.

40
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:28,645
How incredibly observant you are.

41
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:33,756
Put that thing away, Samurai.

42
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,850
We all know
what's gonna happen.

43
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:40,090
You'll swing your sword,
l'll fly away...

44
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,758
and probably say something like...

45
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:46,132
''l'll be back, Samurai!''

46
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,570
And then l'll flutter off
over the horizon...

47
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:53,064
and we won't see each other
for about a week...

48
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:58,570
and then we'll do
the same thing all over again.

49
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,917
Your word play will not trick me, villain!

50
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:04,579
No, wait!

51
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:10,787
l'll be back again, Samurai, you'll see.

52
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,460
See what l mean?

53
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,503
All right, Aku, what is this about?

54
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,168
- A duel!
- A what?

55
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,906
You heard me!
Think about it, Jack.

56
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:33,279
We could settle this thing
once and for all.

57
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:35,181
Man to man!

58
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,345
No armies...

59
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:40,151
no bounty hunters...

60
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,158
but more importantly...

61
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,217
no sword!

62
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,627
No sword?

63
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:52,533
How do you reply, Samurai?

64
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:13,782
Very well.

65
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:16,018
But you will follow three conditions.

66
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,751
Name them.

67
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:21,730
One: no superhuman powers.

68
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:28,369
Two: no evil minions to assist you.

69
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:36,634
And three: no shape-shifting.
You come in human form.

70
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,044
- That was four things!
- The last one was a two-parter.

71
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:57,764
l accept.

72
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,701
We shall meet before the rising sun...

73
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:05,071
at the ancient ruins
beyond the Valley of the Corpses.

74
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:06,939
Agreed.

75
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:12,742
Was that east or west
of the Crimson Hall of the Ogre?

76
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:15,512
- East.
- East, right.

77
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:16,849
You know where that is?

78
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:21,915
- Yes, yes. l will find it. Do not worry.
- You sure?

79
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,325
No, no. Don't worry.
l remember now.

80
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,965
- l can give you a ride if you...
- l will find it!

81
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:35,102
Then l'll see you there!

82
00:08:35,138 --> 00:08:37,197
- ln human form.
- What?

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,767
ln human form.
l will see you there in human form.

84
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:49,607
- l'll be in human form.
- Right.

85
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,620
Of course, l thought you meant...

86
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:56,955
Never mind.
Human form. Got it.

87
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,722
- Right.
- Right.

88
00:08:58,761 --> 00:08:59,887
Right.

89
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,693
- And no sword.
- Right.

90
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:06,410
What?

91
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:14,715
Enough of this foolishness!

92
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:18,784
lt is time
to let fate determine our destiny.

93
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:05,058
You seem a bit strong for a human,
don't you think, Aku?

94
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:07,001
Well...

95
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:10,164
Oh, wait. That's right.

96
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:14,438
You said no superhuman...strength.

97
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,936
l understand now.

98
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,815
Your reign of terror is over, Aku!

99
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:12,218
You are finished.

100
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,620
This fight is...over?

101
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:21,363
- That pillar did not move by itself, Aku!
- Yes, it did.

102
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,367
What was that, Aku?

103
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,080
We agreed
there would be no shape-shifting!

104
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,685
l knew he could not be trusted.

105
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,130
All right, Aku...

106
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:02,035
if you cannot follow the rules,
then neither will l!

107
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,501
What?

108
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,417
My sword!

109
00:18:24,193 --> 00:18:27,924
Wrong!
lt <i>was</i> your sword.

110
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:30,488
The rule was no minions allowed!

111
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:34,094
l wasn't the one
who went for the sword.

112
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:37,299
But that was because you would...

113
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,967
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.

114
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:44,378
lt's all part of life's sweet sorrow.

115
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:48,044
You're so lucky, Samurai.

116
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,678
Most of us have to live
with our mistakes...

117
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,383
but you get to die by yours!

118
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:03,121
Say good-bye to your little toy, Jack.

119
00:19:03,165 --> 00:19:06,134
Once and for...

120
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:09,998
- A fake!
- That's right, Aku.

121
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:14,567
You see, l'm smart,
and you are pure evil.

122
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,475
And l knew you would cheat.

123
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:21,381
So l had a fake sword made,
and hid it under that rock over there.

124
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:24,784
Then l hid the real
sword right down...

125
00:19:27,356 --> 00:19:28,380
here.

126
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,156
You see, Jack...

127
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:36,961
l knew that you knew l would cheat,
so l came prepared.

128
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:41,993
And now you will learn
what it means to be a fool!

129
00:19:42,037 --> 00:19:45,939
- l am afraid that <i>you</i> are the fool, Aku.
- Why?

130
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:48,068
Because l knew
that you knew that l knew...

131
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,546
that you knew that l knew
you would cheat.

132
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,378
So l hid fake swords
all over this place.

133
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,750
Now all you have to do, Aku...

134
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:03,246
is figure out which one of these swords
is the real one.

135
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,261
That's easy. lt's...this one!

136
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:10,698
l mean, this one!

137
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,828
lt's this one.

138
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:19,274
This one?

139
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:25,704
OK. lt's this one!
This one! This one!

140
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:30,242
This one! Wait! This one!
lt's this one over here!

141
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:31,310
This one! No!

142
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:34,220
OK, this one! This one!

143
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:52,471
All right, Jack,
where is the sword?!

144
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:40,213
l'll be back, Samurai!

145
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,655
l'll be back!

146
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,159
And l will be waiting, Aku.

147
00:21:45,194 --> 00:21:49,392
For no matter how long it may take,
l <i>will</i> destroy you.

148
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:54,758
" Watch out! "

149
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:59,934
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

150
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:07,709
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

151
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,842
" Watch out! "

152
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:12,615
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

153
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:17,455
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

154
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,017
" Watch out! "

155
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:28,225
" Watch out! "

156
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,933
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

157
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:32,998
" Watch out! "
