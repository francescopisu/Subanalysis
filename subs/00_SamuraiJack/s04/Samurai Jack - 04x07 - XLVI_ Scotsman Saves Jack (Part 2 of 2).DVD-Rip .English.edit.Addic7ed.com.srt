1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,858
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:10,925
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,598
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,100
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:23,443
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:28,151
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:32,714
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:35,521
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,496
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:44,525
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:48,964
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,167
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,076
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:58,708
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,876
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:03,217
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:07,147
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,393 --> 00:01:09,553
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:13,860
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:25,902
l'm just trying to find your lost brain!

21
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:37,716
Like, l'm not Samurai Jack.

22
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:02,335
All right, then. All aboard!

23
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:13,808
- lt's calm.
- Aye, sir.

24
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,115
- Dead calm.
- Aye, sir.

25
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,452
- l don't like it.
- Aye, sir.

26
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,048
Refreshments!

27
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:29,700
Like, somebody call the weatherman!

28
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,510
That was sudden.

29
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:45,948
- Keep your wits about you, men.
- Aye, sir.

30
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:41,698
Sounds like someone's stepping on a cat.

31
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,766
Sounds like someone's
stepping on a lot of cats.

32
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:59,180
- Beautiful.
- Aye, captain.

33
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:02,886
- Music...go!
- Aye, captain.

34
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,452
Have you all lost your brains?!

35
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:09,155
Lovely.

36
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:34,651
Well, now.
You don't see that every day.

37
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,565
Tribute.

38
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:49,155
Yeah. Keep walking, zombie boy.

39
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,970
So, you're the cause of all this racket!

40
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,372
Nice thing you got going here...

41
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:14,037
turning people into mindless zombies...

42
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:16,171
with a sound that can gag a yak!

43
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,546
" One seems to resist "

44
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:23,952
" Are you not affected by our song? "

45
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:28,322
" Don't you love us? "

46
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,851
" Adore us? "

47
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:37,626
You're all tone-deaf!
A banshee can at least carry a tune!

48
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,296
The sound of breaking glass
has more rhythm!

49
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:44,398
l've heard pigs squeal better than you!
You call this singing?!

50
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,002
Now, my wife, she can sing!

51
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,946
Her angelic voice floats
such melodious and heavenly tunes...

52
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,006
it makes angels weep.

53
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,043
The sun rises just to hear
her morning melodies.

54
00:09:57,088 --> 00:10:00,285
Even the sweetest of birds
can learn a thing or two...

55
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:03,054
from my precious bonnie lass.

56
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:07,827
But you! You cough out wilted notes
not fit for a whistle!

57
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:09,890
So, what did you do to me friend here?!

58
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,334
" Oh, yes "

59
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:16,271
" He was most troublesome "

60
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:22,769
" Trying to free our slaves "

61
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:29,412
" Until we sang the song
that robbed him of his mind "

62
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:36,188
" And set him out
to wander the world as a fool "

63
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:39,424
" For ever "

64
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:46,300
" While keeping his treasure as a prize "

65
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:53,268
That's it!
She-dogs must pay!

66
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,301
You robbed your last brain...

67
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:58,315
you deadly wailing
tune-screeching women!

68
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,716
All right, all right.

69
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:41,919
Now look.
l don't want to hurt you.

70
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:43,449
Snap out of it!

71
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,292
lt's the music
that's making you crazy!

72
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,958
lt's making me crazy it's so bad with...

73
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,990
lf it's music you want...

74
00:11:51,702 --> 00:11:55,570
get a load of me pipes!

75
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:56,064
l remember now.

76
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,349
We sure showed them, eh, buddy?

77
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,025
l am forever in your debt.

78
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,585
Don't mention it.
So, how you been?

79
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:28,496
- Like, totally cool.
- What?!

80
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,171
So, there you were...

81
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,081
shivering like
a gold-dean hootin' daddy...

82
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,051
No? Really?

83
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,713
..and out comes the beast...

84
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:53,814
and you're screaming
like a wimpy man, and then...

85
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,449
How embarrassing!

86
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,955
And then you faint dead away.

87
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:03,557
With a little whimper at the end.

88
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,645
Where do you think you're going?!

89
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:23,085
You ungrateful guinea-wolf taddies!
Come back here!

90
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,385
We saved you
from a fate worse than death!

91
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:31,258
You could at least give us a lift,
you milk-drinkin' silpit!

92
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,922
Well, my toonie bloot!

93
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:38,924
Sorry-faced, plookie...
curly breeked stoogies!

94
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,373
Can you believe that?
We missed the boat.

95
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:58,616
- Laddie, we're in luck!
- How fortunate!

96
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,885
l shall do the honors
of rowing us back.

97
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:03,688
Nope, l'll row! Least l can do.

98
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:06,287
My friend,
you have done so much already.

99
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,266
l am forever in your debt.
Allow me to honor your deeds.

100
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,700
l shall row back.

101
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:14,863
Nice try. l'm driving.

102
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:17,271
But l am afraid l must insist.

103
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,298
No. l insist.

104
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,937
- l must row.
- l'm rowing!

105
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,215
- l'm rowing!
- l must row!

106
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,016
This will not do.
We must decide through contest!

107
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:32,180
Well, what do you have in mind?

108
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,690
A test of strength perhaps.

109
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,193
Oh, no! l remember last time.

110
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,489
- You cheated.
- l do not cheat.

111
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,092
Perhaps not,
but you sure don't play by the rules.

112
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,228
Here, take a stone,
so you can't pull no wily tricks.

113
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:52,606
The man who throws it
the farthest wins.

114
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:53,940
Very well.

115
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,152
Good luck.

116
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:40,685
All right. Best two out of three, then.

117
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:43,954
Feat of speed!

118
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:47,691
First man round the island
crosses this line rows.

119
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,029
On the count of three.

120
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:52,160
Ready?

121
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,898
Three!

122
00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:51,925
l...got another one...for you.

123
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:54,860
That branch.

124
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:00,134
- Jump good.
- Yeah, yeah.

125
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:52,383
All right!

126
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,186
Give me your hand, laddie.

127
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:02,557
We'll wrestle for it!

128
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,931
Thumb-wrestle.

129
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:24,070
One.

130
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,919
Two.

131
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,722
Three!

132
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,658
No!

133
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,132
- One, two, three.
- All right.

134
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,769
" Watch out! "

135
00:20:57,814 --> 00:21:02,945
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

136
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:10,923
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

137
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,019
" Watch out! "

138
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,759
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

139
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,600
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

140
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:22,161
" Watch out! "

141
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,369
" Watch out! "

142
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:35,077
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

143
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,142
" Watch out! "
