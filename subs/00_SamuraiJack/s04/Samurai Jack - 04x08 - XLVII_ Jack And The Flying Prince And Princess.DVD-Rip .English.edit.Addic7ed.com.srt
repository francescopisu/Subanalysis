1
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:05,741
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:10,883
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:14,553
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:20,055
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,399
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:28,106
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:32,635
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,512
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,679
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,453
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,886
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,089
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,998
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:58,630
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,672 --> 00:00:59,798
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,139
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:07,112
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,475
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:13,782
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:38,795
Not again after all these years.

21
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,349
Your Highness,
l'm afraid the city guard...

22
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,552
is no match
for these Squoomian gunships.

23
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,151
Contact Admiral Lantana!

24
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,959
We must recall our fleet
from the Pydian System.

25
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:41,331
Sire, the Deep Space Antenna Array
has been destroyed!

26
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:44,565
Radio contact with the Star Navy
has been severed.

27
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:47,505
Blast those Squoomian devils!

28
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,874
We have no sign of them for a decade,
yet they re-surface...

29
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:54,711
just when our defenses
are most compromised.

30
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:59,207
Captain, begin evacuation!

31
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:01,379
My children, come.

32
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:05,858
Verbina, Astor, you two
must get word to Admiral Lantana...

33
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,918
on errand
deep within the Pydian System.

34
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,021
You must bring back our navy.

35
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,931
You are our only hope.

36
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,935
You can count on us, mother.

37
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,529
We will not fail our people.

38
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:21,063
Chitron 6, make ready the ship.

39
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:25,476
- Oh, my! Yes, sir!
- Wing well, my children. Wing well.

40
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,245
We're clearing Chrysalis ionosphere.

41
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,816
Chitron, calculate jump vector
for the Pydian System.

42
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:44,091
Triangulating...
and entered now, Your Majesty.

43
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,361
Oh, my!
Your Majesties' sensors detect...

44
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,027
Squoomians!

45
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,273
Three vessels bearing 1 mark 08.

46
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,743
Shields down to 35% !

47
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:06,183
Mulch! We're totally outgunned.

48
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:10,087
We can't take any more hits!
Astor, we've got to shake them.

49
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,421
l know. l know.

50
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,894
l bet l could lose them in The Ring.

51
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:18,794
Oh, my!

52
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,363
We lost one of 'em.

53
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,431
Great, Astor, but don't get cocky.

54
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,190
- Watch out!
- Hang on!

55
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:05,734
- Nice work, brother!
- Stunning flightsmanship indeed!

56
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,408
Thanks. Now, Verbina,
we should be clear for that hyperjump.

57
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,980
lgnition ready.
Deploying hypervibe wings.

58
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,889
Prepare to jump in three, two, one.

59
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:25,723
- No! Come on, come on!
- Now what?

60
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:29,565
One of those hits severed the vibrodrive
uplink to the starboard hyperwing.

61
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:33,595
A relatively simple fix, but we will have
to set down before l can effect repairs.

62
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,507
Where in the silk
are we gonna land around here?

63
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,636
Chitron, what about...

64
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,875
the third planet
in this yellow star system?

65
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:45,351
A largely nickel-based planet,
molten core, solid crust...

66
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,081
with a generous amount
of surface moisture.

67
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:51,989
No fog layer, no dewsphere.
lt's just a wet rock?

68
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:54,084
l'm afraid it's not very hospitable...

69
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:56,652
but atmosphere and temperature
are compatible.

70
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,596
lt'll have to do. Set course.

71
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:39,939
So glad to see you conscious again,
Your Majesties.

72
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:42,567
- We'll be all right.
- The ship?

73
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,373
l regret l was unable
to initiate a proper landing...

74
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,903
but l did get to the helm in time
to keep the nose up, if you will.

75
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:51,280
Good job, Chitron. We should...

76
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:56,484
l feel like l weigh a ton.

77
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:59,515
Yes. The planet's gravity
is much heavier than our own.

78
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:03,461
You two should rest, save your strength.
l'll have that wing relinked as quickly as...

79
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:06,260
Oh, my! l detect natives
approaching our position.

80
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:17,239
We can't fly, Astor.

81
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,169
This gravity is just too strong.

82
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,593
Greetings, fellow Chitron units.

83
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:46,435
l am Chitron 6 in service
to the royal house of Chrysalis.

84
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,167
lt seems my masters and l...

85
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:57,140
..and we'll be on our way
as soon as it's repaired.

86
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:00,810
You will see Aku.

87
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,618
l've got a bad feeling about this.

88
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,340
Yes, chamberlain.

89
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:14,080
What pitiable persons
have you brought...

90
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,989
before my all-enshrouding Akuness?

91
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:21,926
Trespassers
who invaded the Wasteland shore...

92
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,522
without proper clearance
and tariffs, my lord.

93
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,103
Well, what have you
to say for yourselves?

94
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,504
Great lord Aku, l am Verbina,
Princess of Alepidopterans.

95
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:42,139
My brother Prince Astor,
and our assistant Chitron 6.

96
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:47,244
Salutations, o most majestic one!
l must say, it's an honor.

97
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,846
We humbly beg
your forgiveness for our trespass.

98
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:53,290
We meant no offense
and certainly no conspiracy.

99
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:56,989
We are on an urgent mission,
for our homeworld, Chrysalis...

100
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,429
is under attack.

101
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:01,058
Our ancient enemies,
the vile Squoomians...

102
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,002
have returned from the depths
to lay siege on our capital!

103
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:08,235
As the palace burned,
our parents sent us into space...

104
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:11,505
with orders to recall our star navy
and bring them home...

105
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,569
to repel this heinous attack.

106
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:16,980
But our ship was damaged
and forced us to land.

107
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:20,713
Again, we appeal to you,
most wise and powerful one.

108
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,482
We ask only time enough...

109
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,457
to repair our ship,
so that we may depart...

110
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:29,655
and trouble you no more,
o gracious Aku.

111
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:37,264
Such a sad story!

112
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:43,242
Whatever can l do
to put an end to this tragic tale?

113
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,038
l know!

114
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,447
Chamberlain,
have their ship confiscated!

115
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:54,249
Captain, throw them in irons
and take them into the mines...

116
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:58,155
where they can live
miserably ever after!

117
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,855
You can't do that!

118
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:06,456
These are royal heirs
to the throne of Chrysalis! You can't just...

119
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,727
Chitron!

120
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:11,635
l certainly can!

121
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:16,870
l am Aku, this world is Aku,
and everything in it is Aku!

122
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:21,372
Now, shoo these moths away.

123
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,611
You beast! You devil! Villain!

124
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,305
Strange.

125
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:54,370
l thought l sensed a presence.

126
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,504
Take him!

127
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:47,064
Aren't you a little short
for a demonic minion?

128
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:50,836
The uniform.

129
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,465
l am called Jack,
and l'm here to rescue you.

130
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,639
Quickly. We must reach your ship
before Aku's drones.

131
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,258
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

132
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,834
Please slow down!

133
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,215
You don't know
how to fly this thing, do you?

134
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,014
l like to walk.

135
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:42,077
Do you even know
where our ship is?

136
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,885
Yes. l heard you crash,
and when l saw you captured...

137
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,324
l followed,
thinking you might need some help.

138
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,693
Good.
Then you navigate, and l'll drive.

139
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,981
- Your Majesties.
- Yes, Jack. Come...

140
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:16,353
Hello? Prince-- Ver--ina,
can --ou --ear me?

141
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,916
Yes, Jack. What is it?

142
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,259
Verbina, l ca--not hear --ou!

143
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,060
Do you read --e?

144
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,595
Jack, don't keep pushing the button.

145
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:34,663
Let go of the button to listen,
push down the button to talk!

146
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:38,268
How are the repairs going?

147
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,074
Slow.

148
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,207
Your gravity doesn't help much.

149
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,718
But we'll do it.
We're almost there.

150
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,515
Good work.

151
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,385
Now it is my turn.

152
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,532
Wing link reconnected.

153
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:59,214
Main power on-line.

154
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:15,733
- All systems are go.
- We're clear for launch.

155
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,936
Oh, my silk. Look outside!

156
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,407
Jack, the repairs are done. Hurry!

157
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:29,085
Good, princess.
Make your escape now.

158
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:30,986
l will keep the drones at bay.

159
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,752
We can't leave you!

160
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,386
Jack, the top hatch is open. Hurry!

161
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:38,864
The drones would swarm the ship
before l could get inside. Now, go!

162
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,365
Go!

163
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,697
Jack!

164
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:46,534
Jack? Can we help him somehow?

165
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,972
With the ship's artificial gravity back on...

166
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:52,102
l feel strong enough
to take those drones myself.

167
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,611
Maybe we can.

168
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:56,877
lf we recalibrate the gravity generator
to full negative...

169
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,077
and reroute it through
the transmission dish...

170
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,177
We could extend
the ship's force field out...

171
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,245
far enough
to encapsulate the drone horde...

172
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,156
Negating the gravity
within the entire bubble!

173
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,558
Jack, we did it.

174
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,432
Look. We really did it!

175
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,270
Oh, thank you, Jack.
Thank you!

176
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:29,069
Yes, thank you, Jack.

177
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,874
You risked your life to help us,
yet we are strangers.

178
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:36,211
How can we possibly
show our gratitude?

179
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,648
- Save your home.
- What?!

180
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:42,552
We are not such strangers, l think.
Our stories are much alike.

181
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,988
For l, too, was a prince...

182
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,822
given charge to save my land.

183
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,260
But l...

184
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,527
l could not let your story end like mine.

185
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:55,557
With Aku!

186
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:00,667
Your story's not over yet.

187
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,300
Go to your people.
There is no time to lose.

188
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,209
Yes, Your Majesty.

189
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:10,647
- Wing well, Jack.
- We won't forget you!

190
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:45,472
" Watch out! "

191
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:50,648
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

192
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,857
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

193
00:21:58,897 --> 00:21:59,989
" Watch out! "

194
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:03,763
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

195
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:08,603
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

196
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,165
" Watch out! "

197
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,373
" Watch out! "

198
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:23,081
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

199
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,146
" Watch out! "
