1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:05,207
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,252 --> 00:00:10,349
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,019
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:19,522
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:22,865
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:27,572
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:32,101
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,978
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:38,917
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:43,912
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:48,352
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:49,555
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:53,464
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:58,096
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,264
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:02,605
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,568
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:08,941
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:13,248
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,338
Very good,
my Warrior of the Night.

21
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:27,114
You are truly
a master of darkness.

22
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:29,144
You have passed the test.

23
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,650
You may have the power
to finally destroy the Samurai.

24
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:42,533
Now go and rid my world of that fool,
once and for all!

25
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,619
What were those things?

26
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:26,029
They're attacking my village.
You must help us!

27
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,829
Show me.

28
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,844
My mother!

29
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,426
You must leave now!

30
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,062
Run!

31
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,894
My boy!

32
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:34,899
My boy is gone!

33
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:24,798
Run!

34
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,524
Shinobi, Warrior of the Night.

35
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,563
Trained to use
the darkness of the shadow.

36
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,766
l know your arts as well.

37
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:43,343
But l have been trained
to use the light.

38
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:39,032
" Watch out! "

39
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,844
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

40
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,610
" Watch out! "

41
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:51,984
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

42
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:53,116
" Watch out! "

43
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:56,889
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

44
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,730
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

45
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,291
" Watch out! "

46
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,499
" Watch out! "

47
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:16,207
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

48
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:17,272
" Watch out! "
