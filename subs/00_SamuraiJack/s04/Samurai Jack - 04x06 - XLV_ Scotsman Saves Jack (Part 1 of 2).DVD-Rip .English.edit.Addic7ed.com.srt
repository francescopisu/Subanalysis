1
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:05,801
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:10,942
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:14,613
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:20,115
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,459
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:28,166
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,695
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:35,572
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:39,510
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:44,506
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:48,946
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,148
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,058
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:58,689
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,857
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,198
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:07,172
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:09,534
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:13,842
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,739
Tickets, please!
Tickets!

21
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:09,060
Can you not see
l'm trying to get a tan you gall-dern...

22
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:23,014
ls this a full-service boat or what?
l need me a refreshment!

23
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:29,419
- Like, here's your refreshment, sir.
- Thanks, laddie!

24
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:37,661
You're, like, totally welcome, sir.

25
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,491
Gross!

26
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:46,832
lt's you, me old friend!
lt's grand to see you!

27
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:48,864
Never would l expect such a thing!

28
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:52,901
You and me,
a caber-toss away on the same boat.

29
00:02:52,946 --> 00:02:54,971
l see you changed your wardrobe.

30
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:58,313
Got tired of wearing
your granny's jammies, did you?

31
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:02,014
Like, you must be confused.

32
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:04,751
My name's Brent Worthington.

33
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:08,653
What kind of a name is Brent?

34
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:12,722
Brent is what you call a sword
after you hit a rock with it...

35
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:15,495
or after my wife sits on it.

36
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:19,232
Only don't go telling her that,
you know how mad she gets.

37
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:23,971
l don't know what you're talking about.
Like, l just work here.

38
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,144
You're funny!
You work here!

39
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:31,707
l don't know you, mister!

40
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:35,011
That's right. Work here!

41
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,750
What?
What did you say, laddie?

42
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:44,957
Like, you have me mistaken
for, like, somebody totally else.

43
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:51,497
Water boy, over here!
Hey, pal, water!

44
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:57,067
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you're not Samurai Jack.

45
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,169
Like, l'm not Samurai Jack.

46
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:05,315
Some slimy, toothy goat took your brain!

47
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,342
- Did Aku do this?
- Who?

48
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:10,652
Where's your sword?
Did Aku get your sword?

49
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,918
What sword?

50
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,119
You remember your sword, don't you?

51
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,891
Your sword, your soul,
that wee bit of enchanted steel...

52
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,955
that's supposed to save the planet.

53
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,024
Like, l don't believe in weapons.

54
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:25,868
You're the greatest warrior
that's ever lived, besides me.

55
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:29,636
You don't just up
and go soft and mushy on me.

56
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,701
You've mastered countless
fighting styles and weapons.

57
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:36,772
You're the defender of truth,
freedom and talking dogs.

58
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:38,283
Armies fear you!

59
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:40,842
There's no stopping you
once you get cooking.

60
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:44,880
Everyone's looking for you.
There's a huge price on your head.

61
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:48,860
Oh, yeah, you're Samurai Jack,
all right, and l can prove it!

62
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:49,987
Hey, you!

63
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,301
Yeah, you, tiny.
Would you be looking for Samurai Jack?

64
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:59,395
Yes.

65
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,236
Well, who's that?

66
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,807
Samurai Jack.

67
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,708
You're in for it now, buddy.

68
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:15,380
Go on, teach this Neanderthal
with bad breath a lesson.

69
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,857
Twist his arm and make him dance
like an alligator on hot coals.

70
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:23,693
Me buddy!

71
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,602
Did you see the looks on their faces?

72
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,696
Just like old times, eh, old buddy?

73
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,403
Oh, yeah.

74
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:26,416
- What happened?
- You lost a fight.

75
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:29,155
What? l don't remember
being in a fight.

76
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:32,221
Must have been sun glare.
That would make sense.

77
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:34,961
You were blinded,
happened to me once. Wha--?!

78
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:42,870
l've got a bad feeling about this.

79
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:20,110
Fish Men! l don't like Fish Men.

80
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:23,411
Hold on, laddie.
This could get rough.

81
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,542
Too tight, too tight!

82
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,518
What's with all the bubbles?

83
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,685
Dude, it's, like, the way they talk.

84
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,627
They, like, heard an explosion.

85
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:51,205
Now they're all blowing bubbles!

86
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:54,643
Like, this guy
who looks exactly like me...

87
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,740
was, like, on this boat passing over
their undersea kingdom?

88
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:00,013
And they, like, asked this guy for help?

89
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,920
OK, so, l guess he, like,
totally freed them from Aku's minions...

90
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:08,256
so, like, they owe this guy,
who looks exactly like me, everything.

91
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:11,286
But he, like, got back on his boat
and continued on his way...

92
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,423
and they never got a chance to thank him.

93
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,564
Like, don't salute me.
l'm not the guy.

94
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,771
See, l told you!
Even Fish Men know you're Jack.

95
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:30,748
Like, l'm not Samurai Jack, Fish Man. OK?

96
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:34,310
Shut it! What'd you do,
bump your head or something?

97
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,352
What?

98
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,330
No, wait, where do you...

99
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:15,454
OK, well, like,
thanks for the ride and everything.

100
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:18,220
l'll see you later.

101
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:21,461
Nice try, twinkle toes.
You're with me.

102
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,402
l have to retrace your steps
and find out how you lost your brain.

103
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,531
Not to mention find your sword.

104
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,836
Can l have, like, a moment here, OK?

105
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:33,572
This is, like,
way too much for me to take in.

106
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:38,379
Of course, of course.
Take all the time you want.

107
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:41,511
l'm just trying to find your lost brain!

108
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:44,421
And when l find it,
l'll stuff it back in your cranium...

109
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:47,551
so you can finally remember
who you are! Get me?!

110
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:51,461
Well, like, how are you gonna find it
if it's, like, lost?

111
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:55,934
Wait. l need just one lead, a clue.

112
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,936
Now, shut up and let me think!

113
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,837
You don't have to be, like, so rude.

114
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,705
- A scar!
- Scar, like, what scar?

115
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,736
Still fresh, too.

116
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,547
There is only one creature alive
that can make a mark like that.

117
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,610
The Tango Beast!

118
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:19,249
lt's a doozy!
And l know just where to find it.

119
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:12,038
Tango Beast territory.
This is where you fought the beast.

120
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:15,103
- Look familiar?
- No, l've told you!

121
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:18,947
Look, OK, like, l'm sure
this guy is, like, real cool and everything...

122
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,282
but you have got the wrong guy!

123
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,017
- Like, l'm Brent, OK?
- Humor me.

124
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:28,925
We just have to reenact the fight
to find another clue.

125
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:33,022
- Like, you're gonna fight it?
- No, you daft man, <i>you</i> are!

126
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:37,161
What? As if!
You don't even know if it's in there.

127
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:41,833
lf there's one thing this creature hates
more than any other thing...

128
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:46,243
it's the stench of the wily jubjub plant.

129
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,271
Just a whiff can send it into a frenzy.

130
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:42,132
Do you recognize this man?

131
00:12:46,272 --> 00:12:49,435
Yeah. l remember him well.
Yeah, really straightened me out.

132
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,279
- Out with it!
- OK, just don't hurt me!

133
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:58,341
All right. lt was a few moons ago, OK?

134
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:01,876
l was terrorizing this town
until one night, he came along and...

135
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,287
well, we had, you know, a confrontation.

136
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:07,053
He beat me,
and then we started talking...

137
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,957
and showed me
the root of my problem...

138
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:11,861
that l was attacking the village
to make myself feel better...

139
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:13,797
to compensate
for a lack of self-esteem.

140
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,460
You're playing with me, Tango.

141
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:19,130
No, no, it's the truth.
l feel great now.

142
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:23,232
l got my old job back,
l'm going out more. l wash.

143
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,799
Which way did he go?

144
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:43,590
- Like, what happened?
- You fainted!

145
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:46,655
Tango's stench
must have overwhelmed you.

146
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,998
That's logical.
Happened to me once.

147
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,502
What?!

148
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:53,266
Sandal tracks.

149
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:57,173
- Sandals?
- You wear sandals.

150
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,677
- Like, never!
- Shut it!

151
00:14:20,432 --> 00:14:22,764
Heck's Bucket Seaport.

152
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:30,134
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy...

153
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:33,303
and the crab cakes aren't bad, either.

154
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:35,540
Gross!

155
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:38,414
lt makes perfect sense you'd come here.

156
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,509
- l don't think so.
- Shut it!

157
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:57,331
Really disgusting worms for sale!

158
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:02,806
- Barbecued lizard on a stick!
- Freak!

159
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:07,545
Have you seen him here before?

160
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:09,703
No.

161
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:15,951
You seen him before?

162
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:20,890
You seen him?

163
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,087
How about you?

164
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:25,930
You?

165
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:29,332
You? You?

166
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:30,357
You?

167
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,494
You? You?

168
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:32,663
You guys?

169
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:34,263
You? You?

170
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:36,570
You? You? You?

171
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,611
Can we go now?

172
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:49,884
Now, that's what l'm talking about!

173
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:57,689
Has anybody seen this man before?!

174
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,180
Right.

175
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:38,768
Now, now, boys...

176
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:42,035
l was just trying
to clear something up.

177
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,042
lt's a long story.

178
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:47,512
Let's just put the guns down
and have a cup of tea.

179
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,383
l guess you don't like tea.

180
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:56,884
Fine.

181
00:16:58,657 --> 00:17:02,354
How about six feet of blazing steel?!

182
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,755
What's that, laddie?

183
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,230
l hear you, buddy.

184
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:16,826
These stupid blokes
ain't worth dulling my sword on.

185
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,429
Time to finish with a bang, aye!

186
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:36,249
You wanna hear a story?

187
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:39,849
- Does it look like my bedtime?
- No, no, no. lt's a great story.

188
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:42,827
You never heard it before.
lt's epic, amazing!

189
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:46,160
lt's got action, drama, tragedy,
ghosts, irony, repentance...

190
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:50,328
gambling, death, questionable ethics,
and an albatross and the walking dead!

191
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:53,805
And the best part is, it's all true.

192
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:58,139
l'll tell you a story about
the old man who got in my way...

193
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:00,303
and it's not a happy ending.

194
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,108
- lt'll just take a second.
- No!

195
00:19:02,147 --> 00:19:04,775
- Let me tell you the title.
- All right.

196
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:07,683
<i>The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.</i>

197
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,743
l've heard it!

198
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,586
l don't care if you think
it is interesting!

199
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,620
Gosh, you're, like, really, really old.

200
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:22,794
l remember you!
Come back for a repeat performance?

201
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,825
- What?
- You've seen him before?!

202
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,599
He's been here before?

203
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:30,836
Yeah! lt was a while ago.
He was looking to hire a boat out of here...

204
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:33,674
for a long journey, somewhere far.
l don't know.

205
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:36,806
- And he liked my story!
- As if.

206
00:19:36,848 --> 00:19:40,215
Look, l don't remember
you or your story, OK?

207
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:41,776
Like, l'm so sure.

208
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,685
Great, it'll be like new!

209
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,555
<i>The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner!</i>

210
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,559
Nope, we're gone.

211
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:52,529
Wait, stay here and listen
to the nightmares of the sea!

212
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:59,501
All right.

213
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,369
One more time, but slow.

214
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,337
We're here.

215
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,941
The lines here
are regular shipping lanes...

216
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:13,975
well-established routes of travel.

217
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,317
He could have gone on any of these.

218
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:21,051
Where would, let's say, Fish Men live?

219
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:26,588
Well, their kingdom
is located here under the sea.

220
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:29,759
What's right above it?
''The Great Unknown''?

221
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,826
l don't know, it's The Great Unknown.

222
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,668
- We'll sail there.
- Like, no way.

223
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,539
lt's uncharted waters, dangerous.

224
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,339
They say pirates, magic...

225
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:41,903
mystery, and death
run rampant out there.

226
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,812
No one returns.

227
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:46,545
My friend here,
he returned from there.

228
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,519
And that's where we're goin'!

229
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:51,750
Like, didn't you hear the man?
lt's not a tropical paradise.

230
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,452
- lt's spooky, and l don't like spooky...
- Shut it!

231
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,451
ls she a fast ship?

232
00:20:57,496 --> 00:21:00,158
She's fast enough for you, Scotsman.

233
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:02,758
- Where are you headed?
- The Great Unknown.

234
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,039
That's the real trick, isn't it?

235
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:11,133
And it's gonna cost you.
10,000. ln advance.

236
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:12,734
Like, 10,000?!

237
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,542
Dude, we could, like,
almost buy our own ship for that.

238
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,070
Dude, l know this guy...

239
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:20,175
Yeah, but who's gonna sail it, kid? You?

240
00:21:20,218 --> 00:21:23,881
Well, like, yeah. l could.
l've worked on a boat before.

241
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:26,481
That'll do you.

242
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:31,025
All right, then.
All aboard.

243
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:56,518
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

244
00:21:56,555 --> 00:21:57,579
" Watch out! "

245
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:01,422
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

246
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:06,224
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

247
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:07,731
" Watch out! "

248
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,729
" Watch out! "

249
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:20,438
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

250
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:23,676
" Watch out! "
