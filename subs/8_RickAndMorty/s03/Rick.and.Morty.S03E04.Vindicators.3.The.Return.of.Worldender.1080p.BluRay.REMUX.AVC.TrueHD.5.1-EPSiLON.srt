1
00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,378
Don't let any of those
things get away, Morty.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,005
It their DNA gets
into Earth's food chain,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,632
our entire species could be sterilized.

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,133
Then why aren't we killing them?

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,135
Right, next time I need
a species sterilized,

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,345
who's gonna do it for me, <i>you</i>?

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,721
Whoa! Rick!

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,473
I-Is that the Vindibeacon?

9
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:16,517
We're being called to assemble
by the Vindicators!

10
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,852
I refuse to answer a literal
call to adventure, Morty.

11
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,354
- Let it go to voicemail.
- Rick,

12
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,981
the Vindicators only call when
the universe itself is at stake.

13
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,025
They're the first line
of defense against evil.

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,401
They're the guardians of the unguarded!

15
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,403
They're the writers of their own
press releases, Morty.

16
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,697
They're a bunch of drama queens
that spend an hour talking

17
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,658
and 20 minutes jumping
around while shit blows up.

18
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,409
They're a phase.
We did one.

19
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,994
It was the big event of that summer.

20
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,870
Let it die.

21
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,997
I, Morty Smith, invoke my right

22
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,916
to choose one in every 10
Rick and Morty adventures.

23
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,335
- God fuckin' damn it!
- Read 'em and weep.

24
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,296
Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.

25
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,466
Yes! Vindicator Command Ship...
beacon received.

26
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,636
We're doing Vindicators Twoooooo!

27
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,096
Whoops.

28
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,139
Uh, Morty, you might want
to freeze some sperm.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,466
Vindicators, Worldender is back,

30
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,136
and this time he's out to end
more than worlds.

31
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,930
We have reason to believe
his stronghold is located on...

32
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,889
- My balls.
- Rick!

33
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,474
...the Terraneous system.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,061
Once in range, Million Ants
will scan for pheromone activity,

35
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,230
which should lead us
to the location of the base.

36
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,274
Oh, that's Million Ants.

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,650
I can't see the ants from over here.

38
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,571
I just assumed that was, uh,
turd man, wiggly turd man.

39
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:53,572
- Rick, stop!
- Rick,

40
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,365
you have something
to add to the briefing?

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,492
Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.

42
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,287
Um, this guy, the, uh... the, uh...

43
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,997
I am Crocubot.

44
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,665
Right, Crocubot.

45
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,085
So, you're half cold,
unfeeling reptile, half...

46
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,420
also cold...

47
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,547
- equally unfeeling machine.
- Yes.

48
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,424
Wow. So, your origin is what?

49
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,468
Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?

50
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,428
Got damn!

51
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,013
Noob Noob, we're having a briefing.

52
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,681
If I can continue, Rick.

53
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,184
I anticipate sophisticated
security measures.

54
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,061
I trust you can be of service there.

55
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,104
Well, let me check my list
of powers and weaknesses.

56
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,066
Ability to do anything
but only whenever I want.

57
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,567
Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.

58
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,111
I wish he had the ability
to check his attitude.

59
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,488
Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen.

60
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,573
After his parents' tragic death
in a railroad accident,

61
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,575
he gained the power
to summon ghost trains.

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,743
It's not all bad, though.

63
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,913
They were spared having to see
their grown son wear a whistle.

64
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,748
Got damn!

65
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,708
Thanks, Noob Noob.
This guy gets it.

66
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,130
Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier.

67
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,133
Sorry I'm late.
It was happy hour.

68
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,302
Happy hour.

69
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,262
Uh, I was also late
because of my drinking

70
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,223
and mentioned it to zero applause.

71
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,433
Rick Sanchez. Tinkerer of Terror.

72
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,768
Man, that's hard to say.

73
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,561
And... Morty, right?

74
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,772
- Whoa, yeah!
- I never forget a kid.

75
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,274
What do you say, Vindicators?
Let's make this three for three.

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,192
- Haha!
- Yes!

77
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,777
Did he say "three for three"?

78
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,445
Did he say he never forgets a kid?

79
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,489
You mean two for two, right, Vance?

80
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,994
Actually, we assembled
a second time last summer

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,955
to fight Doomnomitron.

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,833
So this is... Vindicators Three?

83
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,920
And you guys did Vindicators Two...
without us?

84
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,674
I sense... insecurity.

85
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,509
Are you sure there's not
just a picnic nearby?

86
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,554
I guess he found his crowd.

87
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,597
Pretty toothless stuff, guys.

88
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,686
I hope you're happy
with the adventure so far, Morty.

89
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,521
These guys are even lamer
than last time.

90
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,815
We weren't here <i>last</i> time, remember?

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,692
They did a whole Vindicators without us.

92
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,277
A bunch of them got killed, too.

93
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,822
They lost Lady Katana,
Calypso, Diablo Verde...

94
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,908
Yikes. Yeah, things did feel
less diverse in there.

95
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,494
This article says the reason
we weren't involved was...

96
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,329
"personality conflicts."

97
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,290
Don't worry, Morty.
They love you.

98
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,001
Superheroes need a wide-eyed
unremarkable to tag along

99
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,170
and react to everything
like it's mind-blowing.

100
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,256
I... think the personality
conflict might have been...

101
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,299
you?

102
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,385
Jesus.

103
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,887
How awesome is that?

104
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,472
I mean, they wanted
to not need me so bad,

105
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,265
they murdered three
innocent heroes of color

106
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,017
and they still had to bring me back?

107
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,102
Rick, since it's my adventure and all,

108
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,645
could you do me a favor?

109
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,939
Uh, the adventure <i>is</i> the favor, Morty.

110
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,317
Me sleeping on these
linens is the favor.

111
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,028
I mean, w-w-what...
what are we vindicating? Comfort?

112
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,571
Rick, this really bums me out.

113
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,240
It-It's embarrassing to find out
these guys don't like us.

114
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,493
Why? Morty, I defeat gagoos

115
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,203
more powerful than these
guys every week.

116
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,746
Yeah, but not heroes.

117
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,998
Oh, please, they just call
themselves heroes so they can...

118
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,919
I'm calling them that, Rick!
They're my heroes. Mine!

119
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,799
Huh, no accounting for taste.

120
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,467
I'm gonna go get a drink.

121
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,060
<i>Good morning, Vindicators.</i>

122
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,312
<i>Ship has arrived at Terraneous system.</i>

123
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,857
<i>All Vindicators report to the...
briefing room.</i>

124
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,318
<i>The... The room from the, uh... the...</i>

125
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,195
<i>Uh, it's the d...
it's a different room than...</i>

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,905
<i>than conference room.</i>

127
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,449
<i>I'm sorry, it's my first day
as a PA System.</i>

128
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,952
<i>First-day jitters.</i>

129
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,497
Oh, God.

130
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,333
Good morning. Looks like your
grandpa had a long night.

131
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,961
Crocubot, why don't you
escort Mr. Sanchez

132
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,005
to a more comfortable spot
so that someone can

133
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,591
clean up his diarrhea.

134
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,553
Oooh, I'm nervous
about my first mission!

135
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,930
Actually, Noob Noob,
you have a new mission.

136
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,473
Got damn.

137
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,851
Vindicators, prepare for arrival.

138
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,520
Morty, the Vindicators
and I had a chat this morning,

139
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,772
and I'm afraid we need
to make a little change.

140
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,775
I-I totally get it.
I-I'm so sorry.

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,944
You should be, running around
in a yellow T-shirt

142
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,279
like you're not one of us.

143
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,657
- Disgraceful.
- I-I-I'm not a superhero.

144
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,950
Cop a squat, chief.

145
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,743
Everyone in the universe is a hero.

146
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,204
All you have to do is know
the difference between good and bad

147
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,289
and root for good.

148
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,791
Rick says good and bad
are artificial constructs.

149
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,877
Yeah, well, I get the feeling...

150
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,254
he kind of needs that to be the case.

151
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,463
Not coming, Noob Noob?

152
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,552
Ohh! No, uh, I got stuff to do here.

153
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,311
Security drones inbound.

154
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,188
Star Mother, grant me your wrath.

155
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,527
All aboard!

156
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,541
- Gun turret.
- Are you all right?

157
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,752
Yes. I only lost 400 ants.

158
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,629
My queen is laying more.

159
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,506
I am back to... one Million Ants.

160
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,133
Someone wake up Sanchez.

161
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,803
Ugh! Oh, Christ.

162
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,555
- Rick. You're up.
- Barely.

163
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,474
We're taking fire
from an automated turret.

164
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,059
- Can you bring it offline?
- Uh-huh.

165
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,737
- Uh, my God, that's better.
- Rick!

166
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,739
Hey, I can't help if I can't see.

167
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,843
I could've just used a ghost train.

168
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,638
Really? You don't say.
You would've used a ghost train?

169
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,848
Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy

170
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,684
would have used a ghost train.

171
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,435
- Man, fuck you.
- Is there coffee?

172
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,728
Hey, Morty, can you be a pal?

173
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,438
Grandpa left his coffee
maker on the ship,

174
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,773
you know, the French press thing...

175
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,899
Get it yourself.

176
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,863
Little extra snippy this morning,
aren't you?

177
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,490
Just focus on the mission, all right?

178
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,492
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, you're right.

179
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,870
Ohh, real serious.
Gotta take it real serious, huh?

180
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,166
Son of a Steam Engine.
They're all dead.

181
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,086
Why would Worldender
do this to his own men...

182
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,463
- and several women?
- Well, he is the Worldender.

183
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,716
The guy ends worlds.
Kind of his thing.

184
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,969
Ohh, real scared.
Real fuckin' on alert,

185
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,220
high alert over here.

186
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,306
Watch out!

187
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,266
What the fuck?!

188
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,768
It's Worldender!
What happened to him?

189
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,313
I sense his life force is fading.

190
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,648
Million Ants, ladies and gentlemen.

191
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,401
The ant colony with the power
of two human eyes.

192
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,280
All right. Short mission.
Good mission.

193
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,532
Remember when Alan wanted
to use a ghost train?

194
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,367
See you guys in Vindicators Four.
Morty?

195
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,660
Rick, whoever did this

196
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,495
is an even bigger threat
than Worldender.

197
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,663
We can't leave now.

198
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,124
He's right.
This is far from over.

199
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,125
Well, have fun with that,

200
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,502
but Morty and I have to meet
a Lady Comet, a Monorail Man,

201
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,671
Two Assholes, and a Full Alligator
in like an hour.

202
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,186
Shit.

203
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,522
I sense the presence of a greater evil.

204
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,525
<i>Check, check. One, two.</i>

205
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,570
<i>Okay. Is it recording?
Good.</i>

206
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,280
<i>Hello, Vindicators.</i>

207
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,450
<i>Welcome to your reckoning, baby!</i>

208
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,118
Welp, it's official.

209
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,537
I had too much to drink last night.

210
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,165
<i>If you guys are watching this,</i>

211
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,751
<i>you're, you know, the Vindicators.</i>

212
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,796
- <i>So, now that we know...</i>
- Rick? What's going on, buddy?

213
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,091
Obviously, I came here
last night during a blackout.

214
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,342
"Obviously"?

215
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,636
You came here and defeated
our archnemesis

216
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,679
while so drunk, you don't
remember doing it?

217
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,973
That's something "obvious" to you?

218
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,892
Look, I'm a lit... little more
complex than you guys,

219
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,061
and, no offense,
but I've always suspected

220
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,312
that a lot of what you do in a year

221
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,897
could be knocked out
in a couple of hours.

222
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,233
<i>So I thought why not
just do your job for you</i>

223
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,568
<i>so we can have a little fun game.</i>

224
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,656
Rick, is... is this a "Saw" thing?

225
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,158
Are you seriously
Sawing the Vindicators?

226
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,119
Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack.

227
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,663
<i>If you break the rules,
lose the game, or try to leave,</i>

228
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,914
<i>you will die.</i>

229
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,208
<i>Like in "Sawwww."</i>

230
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,626
Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough.

231
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,211
I'll just figure out
how to unplug this.

232
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,462
<i>Okay, here we go.
Room number one.</i>

233
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,172
<i>The Vindicators are known
throughout the galaxy,</i>

234
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,384
<i>but do they know yourselves...
do you know yourselves?</i>

235
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,803
<i>Match your... your shit, your...
your gimmicks,</i>

236
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,389
<i>with your faces, and y-you get it.</i>

237
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,473
<i>It's a matching thing.</i>

238
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,060
<i>And do it in three minutes
or you'll all die.</i>

239
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,938
Screw this. I'm not playing his game.

240
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,314
I'm gonna find us a way out of here.

241
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,607
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Vance.

242
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,192
He said you'd die
if you tried to leave.

243
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,443
That means there's booby traps.

244
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,779
Why are you acting like that's not you?

245
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,781
What part of "blackout"
don't you understand?

246
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,782
I thought you drank.

247
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,368
Like cool drinking!
Like sexy drinking,

248
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,662
not this psycho, trailer-park shit!

249
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,289
Vance, stay calm.

250
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,374
Oh, so you're the leader now,
because we gave you a jacket?

251
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,626
You're the learning-disabled kid
we do photo ops with.

252
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,628
- Okay, ouch, but...
- Okay, this...

253
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,214
this is triggering me. I need space.

254
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,384
I-I need space from this!

255
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,659
Give me one reason

256
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,077
why I shouldn't crush your windpipe.

257
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,998
Because my epidermis is laced
with a nanofiber defense mesh.

258
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,167
And because, like I said,
I don't remember last night.

259
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,878
I told you not to invite this
mummified motherfucker back.

260
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,213
Alan, I'm not proud
of what's happening here,

261
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,297
but if you keep coming at me,

262
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,091
there's gonna be another
passenger on that ghost train.

263
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,636
Guys! I figured it out.

264
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,347
<i>- Congrats!
- You did it!</i>

265
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,725
It was a bit. All of the descriptors
apply to all of you.

266
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,726
Drunk Rick's point

267
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,062
is that none of you are
very special or different.

268
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,730
That's always his point.

269
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,857
Let's just get through this
as quickly as possible.

270
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,859
Then we'll deal with the two of you.

271
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,654
The <i>two</i> of us?
I hope you're proud of yourself.

272
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,281
Uh, I kind of am.
I saved the goddamn universe.

273
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,616
That's not the issue, Rick!

274
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,743
Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't!

275
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,203
<i>The Vindicators say their job</i>

276
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,372
<i>is to fight evil wherever it hides,</i>

277
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,208
<i>but they don't...
pick the location you'll...</i>

278
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,044
<i>you'll never hear them even mention,</i>

279
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,172
<i>because to fight darkness
is to fight yourself.</i>

280
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,341
Oh! I know this. Dorian 5!

281
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,342
Crocubot, don't!

282
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,969
There's no other possible answer.

283
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,846
My mechanical and reptilian
logic are certain of it.

284
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,516
Oh!

285
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,726
Huh! I'm seeing more
croc than bot here.

286
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,769
God damn it!

287
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,563
- Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?
- Nothing!

288
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,858
Nothing?
We exterminated a planet.

289
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,026
W-Wait. Huh?

290
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,113
Doomnomitron was hiding there!
He's a shapeshifter.

291
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,032
Destroying Dorian 5
was the only way to kill him.

292
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,617
<i>Come on, guys, we're all thinking it.</i>

293
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,868
<i>Don't...</i>

294
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:06,869
<i>Don't make me say it.</i>

295
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,579
Oh, okay. This again.

296
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,540
You know I could have made you a device

297
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,376
to detect Doomnomitron
from orbit like that.

298
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,254
I'm not the one that didn't
want you back. Alan was.

299
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,799
If you lay those deaths
at my doorstep one more time...

300
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,968
Do not threaten her.

301
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,387
<i>Congrats, you did it.</i>

302
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,431
What the hell is "Israel"?

303
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,308
I-It's just something
Rick starts talking about

304
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,559
when he's blackout drunk.

305
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,352
W-What?
In w... In w-w-what way?

306
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,937
Like, w-w-what's my point?

307
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,147
In a way that has no point.

308
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,441
You just babble about defense
budgets and the United Nations

309
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,442
and then you pass out.

310
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,695
So, to be clear, I sometimes reference

311
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,072
the geopolitical complexities of the topic,

312
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,325
which is not the same as going
to an anti-Semitic place.

313
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,534
I have no stake in this.

314
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,828
I don't, either. I'm...
I'm just saying, if anything,

315
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,331
the drunk version of me is probably
so supportive of Israel

316
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,457
he wants what's best for it and...

317
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,627
Hey, man, I'm not touching this.
You do you.

318
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:01,924
<i>Aloha... means hello
and goodbye in Hawaii.</i>

319
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,094
<i>But, uh, aloha means...</i>

320
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,180
<i>has nothing to do with this room.</i>

321
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,682
<i>I'm so fuckin' drunk.</i>

322
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,434
<i>Ugh, okay. Here's the deal.</i>

323
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,353
<i>I-I want to rest my eyes
for a little bit.</i>

324
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,354
<i>I'm... I'm not going to sleep.</i>

325
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,189
<i>I just... just need to rest my eyes,</i>

326
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,815
<i>so let's make this one simple.</i>

327
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,068
<i>Just... try to hit some three-pointers.</i>

328
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,737
<i>Let's say... you have to hit...
five three-pointers</i>

329
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,281
<i>in... five minutes... or...
I don't know...</i>

330
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,033
<i>the whole place...
the whole planet will get blown up</i>

331
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,951
<i>...with a n-neutrino bomb.</i>

332
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,870
<i>And try to make it
a-a lesson about yourselves,</i>

333
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,622
<i>like... like how selfish you are...</i>

334
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,915
<i>are or something.</i>

335
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,792
<i>And also Hawaii.</i>

336
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,377
You guys hit the baskets.

337
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,962
I'll disarm the drunkenly
improvised neutrino bomb.

338
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,547
There's a 40% chance it's a dud,

339
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,716
but y-you should still stay back.

340
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,469
- Morty, how many of these...
- Too many, Rick! Too many!

341
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,889
Man, I am really getting
high-roaded today.

342
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,185
<i>That's a three-pointer.</i>

343
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,853
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.

344
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,814
You two make quite a team.

345
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,066
We all do.

346
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,109
Yeah, I guess.

347
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,318
<i>That's a three-pointer.</i>

348
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,406
But you guys have always had a...
an unspoken bond.

349
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,534
I mean <i>really</i> unspoken.

350
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,287
Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband
unspoken.

351
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,667
We aren't married anymore, Alan.

352
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,627
Sure, but were we married

353
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,548
when you two were "stranded"
on Delphi Six for three days?

354
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:28,052
Because I <i>sensed</i> something
was weird when you came back,

355
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,763
but what do I know about sensitivity?

356
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,557
I'm just a phantom train conductor.

357
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,060
You're the pile of ordinary
bugs that fucked my wife!

358
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,271
<i>That's a three-pointer.</i>

359
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,480
Where the fuck is the lead wire?

360
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,773
You always put it
in the weirdest place.

361
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,191
Um, uh, over here maybe?

362
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,193
Jesus Christ, what a shitty
neutrino bomb.

363
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,070
It's a miracle I ever
actually destroy anything.

364
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:46,904
Oh, I don't know.

365
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,115
You managed to destroy
just about everything today.

366
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,324
The villains, the heroes,

367
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,201
the lines between them, my childhood.

368
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,203
Thank you.
I appreciate it, Morty.

369
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,580
I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid

370
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,622
out of the Vindicators' dicks,

371
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,249
so the fact that I was right about them

372
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,542
must be pretty hard to admit.

373
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,252
Yeah, it is.
You know why, Rick?

374
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,420
Because when you're an asshole,

375
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,796
it doesn't matter how right you are.

376
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,756
Nobody wants to give you
the satisfaction.

377
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,009
I know. Everyone wants people
they like to be right.

378
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,927
That's why popular
people are fucking dumb.

379
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,721
And why your pretentious,
poorly written,

380
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,847
high-budget friends back there

381
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,807
can eat a double-decker shit sandwich.

382
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,225
Disarmed.

383
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,561
Holy shit. You're jealous.

384
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,521
Yes! Is <i>that</i> what you want to hear?!

385
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,898
Did it feel good?

386
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,609
Did you like his six million wriggling legs

387
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,444
more than my tragedy-stricken,

388
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,905
half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!

389
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,739
Guys, stop!

390
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,449
You're just proving
my asshole grandpa right!

391
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,036
You wish this was about sex!
We loved each other!

392
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,246
- We had a child together!
- What?!

393
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,415
I conceived a child with Million Ants,

394
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,167
and it died inside me

395
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,796
because it was half a million ants
and half collapsing star!

396
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,258
And yes. He was better than you.

397
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,094
- Yeah?
- One million times better.

398
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,264
All aboard, motherfucker!

399
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,058
Stop!

400
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,021
Oof! Didn't see that coming.

401
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,523
Is that sarcasm?

402
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,399
I don't want you slipping away
when this is over.

403
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,443
All of these deaths are on your hands.

404
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,861
Okay, come on, maybe a couple of them,

405
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,321
but definitely not the Train Guy.

406
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,656
- Oof!
- <i>All</i> of them.

407
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,698
Okay.

408
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,326
<i>Congrats. You did it.</i>

409
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,663
<i>All right, by now,
I've been pretty clear</i>

410
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,207
<i>that I think the Vindicators
are full of shit.</i>

411
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,085
<i>But... you do have one thing
that I'll never have.</i>

412
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,212
<i>And that thing is the only part
of the Vindicators</i>

413
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,588
<i>with any value to me.</i>

414
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,132
<i>If you know what it is,
place it on the platform.</i>

415
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,802
<i>Guess wrong,
and the pla-planet will explode.</i>

416
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,262
<i>And probably the solar system,</i>

417
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,347
<i>'cause I kind of fuckin'
eyeballed the neutrino bombs</i>

418
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,640
<i>on this one.</i>

419
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,143
So what's the trick? Morty,
you're the Drunk Rick expert.

420
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:45,189
I think... no matter what
we put on there, we die.

421
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,650
He said it's the part
of the Vindicators he values.

422
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,693
That means nothing.

423
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,986
He wants our last moment alive

424
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,988
to be spent knowing
how few fucks he gave.

425
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,532
Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions.

426
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,117
It could... It could be Morty.

427
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,493
- What?
- Hey, I don't know.

428
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,120
I mean, look, when I get drunk,

429
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,330
I get stupid and emotional,
and there's no logic to it.

430
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,666
It's, like, it's possible I got so drunk

431
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,710
I felt like I was losing Morty
to the Vindicators,

432
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,421
and maybe this is my way
of saying, "Okay,

433
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,715
you can have him, but only if you
know how important he is.

434
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,049
Otherwise, I'll kill you."

435
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,760
That is a... really specific guess.

436
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,221
Look, I-I...
There's nothing in the room but us.

437
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,432
I'm just using logic
to connect some dots.

438
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,600
It's the best guess I've got.

439
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,768
But you're betting our lives on it.

440
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,104
I'll cover that bet.
I get it.

441
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,106
Well, Morty, I think
you're doing that smirky face

442
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,816
because you're
misinterpreting the moment.

443
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,193
I am not being coy about
some hidden love for you.

444
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,487
I want to be really clear that if
anyone has a better guess,

445
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,990
like, if I gave you
an amulet last night or...

446
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,993
Phew.

447
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,912
Oh, shit.

448
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,667
<i>Sorry. I'm... not good at goodbyes,</i>

449
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,462
<i>and I'm drunk, so, you know, I just...</i>

450
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,006
<i>It looks like I'm never
going to see you again.</i>

451
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,924
<i>I can't really roll
with the hero types.</i>

452
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,218
<i>And I don't... They...
They don't want me around.</i>

453
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,805
<i>But I want you to know,
even if I didn't show it at the time,</i>

454
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,391
<i>I really appreciated you
sticking by me.</i>

455
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:06,062
<i>God damn it, why am I crying?
It makes no sense.</i>

456
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,272
<i>Ugh, you're... you're probably confused</i>

457
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,482
<i>because we barely knew each other,</i>

458
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,067
<i>but you really stuck your neck out</i>

459
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,194
<i>when you gave me props
for my awesome jokes</i>

460
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,403
<i>in the briefing room.</i>

461
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,405
<i>Everybody else had their head
so far up their ass.</i>

462
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,199
<i>Even my own grandson is like,</i>

463
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>"Oh, the Vindicators, they're so cool."</i>

464
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,663
<i>I mean, he's a moron.
That's their demographic.</i>

465
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,247
<i>But you're different, Noob Noob.</i>

466
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,083
Motherfucker.

467
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,502
<i>You're fucking cool.
And you're smart.</i>

468
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,837
<i>And I bet we could've
hung out and shit.</i>

469
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,465
<i>And I hope you get to be
a full-fledged Vindicator,</i>

470
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,050
<i>and... and do... do me a favor.</i>

471
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,219
<i>Don't... Don't let them know
I-I got emotional.</i>

472
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,179
<i>But you can tell them one thing.</i>

473
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,972
<i>Tell them I said...</i>

474
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,726
<i>Oh, fuck. Okay. I just shit myself.
Okay, later.</i>

475
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,150
- W... Dude, Morty, what happened?
- Shut up.

476
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,113
I sense this means we are not dying.

477
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,489
Not all of us.

478
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,907
Sweetheart.

479
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,992
Just let Titty Bean do this, Snuzzles.

480
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:02,993
It's for the greater good.

481
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:03,994
- Greater good?
- Titty Bean?

482
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,579
It's like you said, Morty.

483
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,832
- There's no right or wrong.
- Never said that.

484
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,668
It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators

485
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,962
that keeps the galaxy secure.

486
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,088
Yeah, I feel safer already.

487
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,340
No doubt. Who do we make
the check out to?

488
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,634
I will say we are getting
some good licks in

489
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,136
- while choking to death...
- Right?

490
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,887
Titty Bean. Listen to me.

491
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,013
When you came to me,

492
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,474
I was merely a sentient colony of ants.

493
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,436
It was your beliefs,
your pursuit of justice

494
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,688
that taught me to be a man.

495
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,482
When did it get so complicated?

496
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,193
Who knows?
But we can make it simple again.

497
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,987
You were always the romantic.

498
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,156
Which is why you can't leave, either.

499
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm sorry, my love.

500
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,914
Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!

501
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,792
Silence! I'm going to enjoy this.

502
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,128
Let's give a huge thanks
to Rick Sanchez

503
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,922
for killing Worldender,
putting this awesome party together,

504
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,301
and for booking one of the hottest
talents out there...

505
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:04,054
- Logic!
- Aw, yeah.

506
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,347
- Look at that.
- It's going down.

507
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,932
Geez, I must have
planned a whole party.

508
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,392
- It's Logic, y'all.
- Invited a bunch of people.

509
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,519
Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.

510
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,687
Are you ready?

♪ There's a choo-choo train man,
he's rolling down tragedy ♪

512

Morty, you're wearing

Which is why we don't need jackets.

And I'm pretty sure
we don't need Vindicators.
