1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,170
Geez, I can't believe we found
a version of Earth

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,506
with a "Ball Fondlers"
movie franchise.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,634
I can't believe the things
this reality considers PG-13.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,387
- Yeah, I-I'm pretty jealous.
- Don't be, Morty.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,306
There's pros and cons
to every alternate timeline.

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,557
Fun facts about this one...

7
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,059
It's got giant,
telepathic spiders,

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,394
119/11s,

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,479
and the best ice cream
in the multiverse!

10
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,147
- Shut up!
- Whoa!

11
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,692
We're gonna go get
some ice cream, motherfucker!

12
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,028
Oh, great.

13
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,780
Oh, boy. W-What's wrong, Rick?

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,448
Is it the quantum carburetor
or something?

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,534
"Quantum carburetor"?
Jesus, Morty.

16
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,536
You can't just add
a s... sci-fi word

17
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,538
to a car word
and hope it means something.

18
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,040
Looks like something's wrong
with the microverse battery.

19
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,667
We're gonna have to go inside.

20
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,293
Um, go inside what?

21
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,170
The battery, Morty.
Be right back, Summer.

22
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,672
Stay put,
don't touch any buttons,

23
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,675
and ignore all random thoughts
that feel... spidery.

24
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,343
Wait! You can't leave me here!

25
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,636
You'll be fine.

26
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,221
Ship, keep Summer safe.

27
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,390
Keep Summer safe.

28
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,016
Ohh!

29
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,853
Ugh. Wonderful.

30
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,276
Hey, excuse me. Hello.

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,319
Um...

32
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,321
What, you think
you're better than me?!

33
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,407
Nobody's better than me!

34
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,658
Hey! Hey!

35
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,748
Aah! Aaaaah!

36
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,583
- Keep Summer safe.
- Aaaaaaah!

37
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,792
Hey, man, what the hell?!

38
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,586
That was my daughter's
pediatrician! Aah!

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,379
No, stop! Don't kill him!

40
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,714
Confirmed.

41
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,257
Aah!

42
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,135
Oh, god. I can't feel my legs.

43
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,386
Help! Help!!

44
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,721
Summer is safe.

45
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,723
I don't feel safe.

46
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,141
Confirmed.

47
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,185
No.

48
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,728
Oh, god, help me. Help me!

49
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,855
Help me, please!
You can help me!

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,057
Oh, man. Where are we, Rick?

51
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,184
Morty, remember eight
seconds ago when... you said,

52
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,728
"go inside what?"
And I said, "the battery"?

53
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,396
Then we showed up here,
and I wasn't like,

54
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,731
"Whoa, this is unexpected."

55
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,399
This is not what I was
expecting, Morty.

56
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,068
"What a perplexing mystery
this is."

57
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
All right, all right,
we're inside the battery.

58
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,404
I get it. You don't have
to bust my balls.

59
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,448
Huh, this isn't right.
This pipe's supposed to be...

60
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,493
sending 20 terawatts of
juice up to the engine, Morty.

61
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,328
Instead we've got... zero?

62
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,663
Now what are these people doing?

63
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,915
W-W-W-Whoa, people?

64
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,625
It's time for some
hands-on engine repair.

65
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,293
All right, Morty,
hold on to something.

66
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,419
Whoa!

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,215
Holy crap!

68
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,217
I thought we were
inside your car battery, Rick.

69
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,886
T-T-This is like a whole
p-planet or something.

70
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,805
Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty
proud of this bad boy.

71
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,348
Check it out.

72
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,392
I put a spatially
tessellated void

73
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,352
inside a modified temporal field

74
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,604
until a planet developed
intelligent life.

75
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,274
I then introduced that life
to the wonders of electricity,

76
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,609
which they now generate
on a global scale.

77
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,444
And, you know, some of it goes
to power my engine

78
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,113
and charge my phone and stuff.

79
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,282
You have a whole planet
making your power for you?

80
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,450
- That's slavery.
- It's society.

81
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,869
They work for each other, Morty.

82
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,537
They pay each other.
They buy houses.

83
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,038
They get married and make
children that replace them

84
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,832
when they get
too old to make power.

85
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,042
That just sounds like slavery
with extra steps.

86
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,045
Ooh la la, someone's
gonna get laid in college.

87
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,047
It appears we are
being revisited

88
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,884
by the alien known as Rick,
who once gave our world

89
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,261
the gift
of gooble box technology,

90
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,513
which, when stomped on,
generates electricity,

91
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,682
powering our homes
and businesses,

92
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,517
improving our daily lives,
while safely removing

93
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:51,063
the dangerous waste power
to a special disposal volcano.

94
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,690
But why has Rick returned?

95
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,359
And what will he say
when he hears the big news?

96
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,986
Let's find out.

97
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,405
You need to tell these people
they're in a battery, Rick.

98
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,741
It's messed up.
There's caterers down there.

99
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,826
Th-Th-They're setting up
chafing dishes.

100
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,202
Would you relax, Morty?

101
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,996
There's nothing dishonest
about what we're doing.

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,373
Now slap on these antennae.
They need to think we're aliens.

103
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,460
- What? Why?
- Sh... Obviously...

104
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,004
You really know
nothing about car repair.

105
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,927
Wait for the ramp, Morty.

106
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,762
They love the slow ramp.

107
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,431
Really gets their dicks hard
when they see this ramp

108
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,767
just slowly extending down.

109
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,770
Greetings!

110
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,191
Morty, you gotta flip them off.

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,193
I told them it means
"peace among worlds."

112
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,611
How hilarious is that?

113
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,160
Coming through.

114
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,120
Two real aliens walking
through here.

115
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,122
Rick, our alien friend.

116
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,124
Uh, Mr. President,
um, couldn't help but notice

117
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,585
that you were having problems
generating power.

118
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,046
That's correct. We've evolved.

119
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,341
Our most brilliant scientist,
Zeep Xanflorp,

120
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,343
has developed a source of energy

121
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,096
that makes gooble boxes
obsolete.

122
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,014
I would love to see it.

123
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,475
- Fuck You.
- What did you say to me?!

124
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,935
"Fuck You."

125
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,813
Y-You told me
it means "much obliged."

126
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,857
Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.

127
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,693
No, no, no. Blow me.

128
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,951
Zeep, you have an honored guest
from beyond the stars.

129
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,578
I said 12 quantum stabilizers,
not 11.

130
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,414
Fix it or it's your ass.

131
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,124
Chris, I'm in the middle
of something.

132
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,335
Zeep, this is Rick... The Alien.

133
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,170
Rick The Alien.

134
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,172
Rick The Alien...

135
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,841
Really?
You're gonna pull that move?

136
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,634
I guided
your entire civilization.

137
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,678
Your people have
a holiday named Ricksgiving.

138
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,638
They teach kids
about me in school.

139
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,182
I dropped out of school.
It's not for smart people.

140
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,101
Ohhhh, snap!

141
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,020
Listen to me,
you arrogant little...

142
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,231
R-Rick was hoping
to see your new energy source.

143
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,234
I think he could learn
a lot from you, Zeep.

144
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,861
Fine.

145
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,904
It's hard for people to grasp,

146
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,240
but inside that container is
an infinite universe

147
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,242
with a planet capable
of generating

148
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,411
massive amounts of power.

149
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,747
I call it a miniverse.

150
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,832
Dumb Name.

151
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,208
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

152
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,377
I mean, it's hard
for us to comprehend all this.

153
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,379
Would it be possible
for us to get some kind of tour

154
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,256
of your miniverse
from the inside?

155
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,883
This isn't a fucking
chocolate factory.

156
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,426
I don't have time.

157
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,887
Didn't you say time goes
more slowly in the miniverse

158
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,889
relative to the real world?

159
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,266
Yes, Chris.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

160
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,769
Great President.
All right, let's go.

161
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,353
Whoa-Oh!

162
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,522
Hold on to something.

163
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,733
I put an unbounded vacuum
inside a temporal field

164
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,359
until a world developed.

165
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,320
I then introduced
the people of this world

166
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,615
to the wonders of electricity
in the form of a device

167
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,533
I call a flooble crank.

168
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,495
What they don't know is that 80%
of every crank's energy output

169
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,413
gets channeled
out of the miniverse

170
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,499
to be used by us.

171
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,167
No more gooble boxes.

172
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,002
I gotta tell you, Zeep,
with no disrespect,

173
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,463
I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

174
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,923
- It's not cool.
- What?!

175
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,926
Y-Y-You got the people
on this world slaving away

176
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,636
making your power.

177
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,221
I mean, that's
what I call slavery.

178
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,056
No, no, no,
they work for each other

179
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,266
in exchange for money,
which they then...

180
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,561
Well, that just sounds like
slavery with extra steps.

181
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,398
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's
gonna get laid in college.

182
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,691
Rick, a word?

183
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,818
What the hell was that?

184
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,653
I know. "eek barba dirkle"?

185
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,196
That's a pretty
fucked up "ooh la la."

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,906
No, what are you doing
telling this guy

187
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,783
that his miniverse is unethical?

188
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,910
D-Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

189
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,080
Holy crap.
You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy!

190
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,957
Somewhere on this planet,
there's gotta be an arrogant...

191
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,501
scientist prick on the verge
of microverse technology,

192
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,711
which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

193
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,964
forcing Zeep
to say microverses are bad,

194
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,842
at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being.

195
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,344
His people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

196
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,972
and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

197
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,974
Eating that motherfucking
ice cream!

198
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,892
Slurping, slurping,
slurping it up.

199
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,186
Wh-Wh-Why are you making
that face?

200
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,688
Holy shit!

201
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,857
It's me. I've convinced
the people of this planet

202
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,817
that I'm a traveler
from another world.

203
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,861
You don't think that's over-
doing it a little?

204
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,071
I mean, you can achieve the same
effect with a pair of...

205
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,240
Never mind. You know what?
I shouldn't be so critical.

206
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,575
I'm an alien.

207
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,785
Places, please.
We're about to land.

208
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,541
Too fast.

209
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,630
Law enforcement
converging on location.

210
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,882
Keep Summer safe.

211
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,634
No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody!

212
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,262
Confirm
custom defense protocol...

213
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,056
Keep Summer safe...
No physical force.

214
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,225
- Yes.
- Processing.

215
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,020
Come out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!

216
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,771
Scanning assailants.

217
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,152
Psychological option detected.

218
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,196
Gestating.

219
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,488
"Gestating"?

220
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,157
Come out with your hands up,

221
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,327
or we will be forced
to open fire!

222
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,912
- Incoming!
- We got a device!

223
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,705
Bomb! Bomb!

224
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,292
Daddy?

225
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,294
Oh, my god.

226
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,879
- H-Hunter?
- Daddy?

227
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,547
What the hell?

228
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:11,050
Jesus Christ, cease fire!
Stay back!

229
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,176
H-H-Hunter?

230
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,053
- Daddy.
- Hunter!

231
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,055
Oh, my dear, sweet god, Hunter.

232
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,389
Oh, my boy. My boy.

233
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

234
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,061
I'm sorry.
Daddy, leave the car alone.

235
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,187
W-W-W-What?

236
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,314
Leave the car alone.

237
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,899
Hunter? Don't...

238
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,150
Oh, my god.

239
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,402
Stay here, Hunter! No!

240
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,364
God, no! Hunter!

241
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,532
All of you have loved ones.

242
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,201
All can be returned.

243
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,828
All can be taken away.

244
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,872
Please step away
from the vehicle.

245
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,417
Keep Summer safe.

246
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,212
And if you continue
to turn your flooble cranks,

247
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,798
I will bring you
other great alien advancements.

248
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,217
- Hey, lemme ask you something.
- Yes?

249
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,886
Any of your, uh, scientists
working on anything new?

250
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,346
All of them. That's their job.

251
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I mean, like, energy-wise.

252
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,268
Anyone working on, say,
a little universe in a box?

253
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,395
How do you know about that?
It's top secret.

254
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,357
So remember... A crank
a day is not nearly enough.

255
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,109
Crank it.

256
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,903
I told them this means
"peace among worlds."

257
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,321
How hilarious is that?

258
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,990
Re-Really funny, Zeep.

259
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,075
Hey, Zeep, the fake president
of your fake world

260
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,536
has something fake important
to show you.

261
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,831
It's not much now,

262
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,874
but once I learn to accelerate
the temporal field,

263
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,419
I'll be able to interact with
any sentient life that evolves

264
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,171
and introduce them
to the wonders of electricity

265
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,258
via a pulley-based device
I call a blooble yank.

266
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,468
But what they won't know is...

267
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,429
You'll be taking
most of their energy.

268
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,888
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

269
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,433
It's show- ... time.

270
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,148
You do realize this will make
the flooble crank obsolete?

271
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,985
This is wrong, Kyle.
What you're doing is wrong.

272
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,362
You're basically...
This is slavery.

273
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,865
You're talking about creating
a planet of slaves.

274
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,408
Told you, Zeep.

275
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,285
Oh, they won't be slaves.

276
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,412
They'll work for each other
and pay each other money.

277
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,542
That just sounds like slavery
with ex... tra... steps.

278
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,336
- What?
- Wait a minute.

279
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,047
Did you create my universe?
Is my universe a miniverse?

280
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,257
- Microverse!
- Uh, teenyverse.

281
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,217
- Ugh!
- You bastard!

282
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,178
Much obliged.

283
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,014
- What the hell is happening?
- This is healthy. Trust me.

284
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,891
You're my battery, motherfucker!

285
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,184
That's all you are.

286
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,186
I made you.
Your microverse sucks!

287
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,313
And your miniverse is the size
of a fucking lobster tank!

288
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,439
It's wack!

289
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,483
Are they not really aliens?

290
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,860
Nah, they're just
a couple of crazy,

291
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,904
wacky scientists, you know?

292
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,447
So he made a universe,

293
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,199
and that guy is
from that universe.

294
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,493
- You're my battery!
- And that guy made a universe.

295
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,080
And that's the universe
where I was born.

296
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,332
Where my father died.

297
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,584
Where I couldn't make time
for his funeral

298
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:55,047
because I was working
on my universe.

299
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,882
- I made you!
- Yeah.

300
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,592
Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.

301
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,928
You know, one time,
Rick sh... accidentally shot

302
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,596
his laser pistol
right through my hand.

303
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,225
You know, I mean, like,
Old-Lady Science, you know?

304
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,060
She's a real...

305
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,395
You got to hang on tight,
you know?

306
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,231
Because she... she...
She bucks pretty hard.

307
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,317
Ooh, boy, what...
Oh, my god, no!

308
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,323
- Teenyverse.
- Teenyverse.

309
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,452
Come on, come on, come on.

310
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,663
Pterodactyl!

311
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,081
Asshole!

312
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,666
When I get
out of this teenyverse,

313
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,501
I'm gonna smash it to pieces
with you in it.

314
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,211
Yeah, well, when I get
out of this teenyverse,

315
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,879
I'm gonna get out of
the surrounding miniverse

316
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,714
and then the microverse
around that, and guess what?

317
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,716
Don't make things worse, Rick!

318
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,718
Uh, he's not gonna destroy
your universe.

319
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,762
You know, we... we need it
to start our car.

320
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,806
That's what you used
my universe for...

321
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,683
To run your car?

322
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,351
Yeah, but don't
flatter yourself.

323
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,855
There's always AAA,
you fucking cock sucker!

324
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,523
What's he doing?
What's he crafting?

325
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,233
I can craft stuff, too, pal!

326
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,152
Just like I crafted
your reality!

327
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,280
You crafty son of a...

328
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,532
Ow! I crafted the guy
that created

329
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,409
the planet you're standing on!

330
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,827
Yeah, and I made the stars
that became

331
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,203
the carbon
in your mother's ovaries!

332
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,913
I didn't ask to be born!

333
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,540
All right, that's it! I'm out.

334
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,292
I-I'm gonna go
into the wilderness,

335
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,751
and I'm gonna make
a new life for myself

336
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,295
among the tree people.

337
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,921
I-It can't be worse than this.

338
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,548
Sure. Okay, Morty,
Just be back before sundown

339
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,924
or the tree people will eat you.

340
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,134
That's a myth!

341
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,094
W-W-Why are you trying
to start a myth?

342
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,721
It's a prehistoric planet,
Morty.

343
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,431
Someone has to bring
a little culture.

344
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,183
And I-i-it certainly
can't be someone

345
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,102
whose entire culture powers
my brake lights!

346
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,149
Go, go, go!

347
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,568
Oh, my god. Oh, god.

348
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,570
What are we gonna do now?

349
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,989
I am unable
to destroy this army.

350
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,992
To clarify, I am quite able to
destroy this army,

351
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,620
but you will not permit it.
Correct.

352
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,582
You also refuse to authorize
emotional countermeasures.

353
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,043
If you're talking
about the melting ghost babies,

354
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,878
yes, please, no more of that.

355
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,338
Confirmed.

356
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,050
I am currently constructing
a security measure

357
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,968
in compliance
with your parameters.

358
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,138
But I do want to say
you are not making this easy.

359
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,890
You know you're
kind of a dick, right?

360
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,893
My function is
to keep Summer safe,

361
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,063
not keep Summer being,
like, totally stoked

362
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,024
about, like,
the general vibe and stuff.

363
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,735
That's you. That's how you talk.

364
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,991
Hey, that's my deer!

365
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,827
Aaaaaaah!

366
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,162
Raah!

367
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,290
I hope your god is
as big a dick as you.

368
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,546
My god's the biggest dick
that's never existed.

369
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,756
Why do you think I'm even here?

370
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,677
You're here...

371
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,137
because you created
someone smarter than you.

372
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,933
Oh, I thought we were both here

373
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,143
because I created
a universe of idiots.

374
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,152
Kalo kada sha la.

375
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,697
Holy shit. Morty?
I haven't seen you in months!

376
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,532
You're leading the tree people?

377
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,950
Huh. That's a step up.

378
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,243
We have no leaders.

379
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,829
We follow
only the will of the forest.

380
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,038
Ooh. Wow.

381
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,456
Gaaaaay.

382
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,041
That is pretty gay.

383
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,960
You two call yourselves
geniuses,

384
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,671
but you have spent
this time learning nothing.

385
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,506
Come with me into the forest.

386
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,134
There is something
I wish to teach you.

387
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,099
This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree.

388
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,101
For generations,
it has guided the...

389
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,396
You have to get us
the fuck outta here.

390
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
These people are
backwards savages.

391
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,941
They eat every third baby

392
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,068
because they think
it makes fruit grow bigger.

393
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,571
Everyone's gross, and they all
smell like piss all the time.

394
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,240
I m... I m... I miss my family.
I miss my laptop.

395
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,075
I masturbated
to an extra-curvy piece

396
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,577
of driftwood the other day!

397
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,287
Look, I-I don't care
what it takes.

398
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,997
You two are putting aside
your bullshit,

399
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,374
and you're working together
to get us back home.

400
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,293
No can do, Morty. I just can't.

401
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,003
I just don't see how I can...

402
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,296
Ro ro dah no gah!

403
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,090
You're smart.
You'll figure it out.

404
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,343
You have 10 seconds

405
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,261
to get out of the ship!

406
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,056
10, 9...

407
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,390
All right, not bad.

408
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,476
I guess you're
an okay proto recombinator.

409
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,145
I've certainly seen
worse ionic cell dioxination.

410
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,938
If this works, drinks are on me.

411
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,649
If drinks are on you,
you're gonna need

412
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,359
a second mortgage on that tower.

413
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,943
I'm an alcoholic.

414
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,445
Opium addict.

415
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,283
All right, okay, okay,
okay, wrap it up.

416
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,951
You guys are the fucking worst!

417
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,244
Your gods are a lie!

418
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,789
Fuck you, fuck nature,
and fuck trees!

419
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,501
Yes! You did it! Yes!

420
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,294
Hey, uh, how about that drink?

421
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,130
Sure, I just need to go grab
my wallet from inside my ship.

422
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,715
Oh, is your wallet in your ship?

423
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,300
That's where
the transporter is, too,

424
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,802
so why don't we come with?

425
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,138
It's cool.
I'll be back in a sec.

426
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,975
You know how long a second can
take in a microverse?

427
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,144
Run, Morty! That asshole's
willing to risk...

428
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,771
everything he cares
about just to defeat me!

429
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,231
He's psychotic!

430
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,819
- Morty, hop on my back.
- Why?

431
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,321
Go, go Sanchez ski shoes.

432
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,492
- Aaaaaah!
- Eight...

433
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,078
Aaaah! Oof!

434
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,957
Hold still.

435
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,792
Oh, hey, guys.

436
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,378
I just finished
cooking us a feast.

437
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,171
- Aaaah!
- Holy...

438
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,465
- You monster!
- Whoa. Bad tour.

439
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,092
Seven...

440
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,677
Hey, you gotta sign out.

441
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,096
Nothing you do matters!
Your existence is a lie!

442
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,725
If that were
really true, then...

443
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,977
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.
- Third floor.

444
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,687
Would you like
to go to dinner with...

445
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,355
Uh, no.

446
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,901
You may have created
this universe, Rick,

447
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,571
- but I live in it.
- Shit!

448
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,406
What are we gonna do, Rick?
We're so screwed.

449
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,199
He's gonna get to the ship
and smash the microverse,

450
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,743
and then he's gonna kill us!

451
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,411
Quick, Morty, you've got
to turn into a car.

452
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,121
- What?!
- A long time ago...

453
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,831
I implanted you with
a subdermal chip that could

454
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,708
call upon dormant nanobots
in your bloodstream

455
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,043
to restructure your anatomy
and turn you into a car.

456
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,545
- Oh, my god!
- Concentrate, Morty.

457
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,921
Concentrate and turn
into a car, Morty.

458
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,133
Never mind. Here's a taxi.
Get in. It's fine.

459
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,926
Six...

460
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,722
- Hey, Zeep.
- Huh?

461
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,433
Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

462
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,393
Aaah!

463
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,853
We did it, Morty.

464
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,855
Now let's get out of here
and destroy this whole universe.

465
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,273
Excuse me?

466
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,358
- Five...
- Sir?

467
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,696
- Holy hell.
- Sir!

468
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,032
Hold your fire!

469
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,286
What's going on?

470
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,704
I have brokered
a peace agreement

471
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,165
between the giant spiders
and the government.

472
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,585
Thanks to the skilled diplomacy
of this mysterious space car,

473
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,505
from this day forward,
human and spiderkind will live

474
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,465
side by side in peace.

475
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
We will stop bombing them,

476
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,219
and they will no longer use
their telepathic abilities

477
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,721
to make us wander into webs
for later consumption.

478
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,348
Instead, we will work together

479
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,809
to make this world
a better place for all,

480
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,144
no matter how many legs.

481
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,355
What do we do
about the space car?

482
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,689
Leave it alone.

483
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,358
I mean, what did it
really do, anyways?

484
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,692
Kill a guy
and paralyze his buddy?

485
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,570
Not a bad trade
for spider peace.

486
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,531
All right, that's it. Move out!

487
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,330
I love this spider!

488
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,040
Summer is safe.

489
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,625
All right, I get it.

490
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,839
Riiiick!

491
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,175
Don't do it.

492
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,512
You quit school, but you
still got some learning to do.

493
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,276
Aah!

494
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,777
Unh!

495
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,538
Class dismissed.

496
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,915
Geez.

497
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,092
- You all right?
- Uh-Huh!

498
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,385
What are you doing, Rick?

499
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,095
I'm pretty sure
the battery's dead.

500
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,471
Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

501
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,140
Well, let's see.

502
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,559
Hey, wait... Huh?
I don't get it.

503
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,853
Of course you don't.
But Zeep did.

504
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,438
He knew that once I got
back to my car,

505
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,356
one of two things
was gonna happen...

506
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,442
I was gonna have to toss
a broken battery,

507
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,361
or the battery wouldn't
be broken.

508
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,620
Peace among worlds, Rick.

509
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,829
Jesus.

510
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,497
Yeah. Listen to that baby purr.

511
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,166
You were right, Morty...

512
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,751
We really just needed to
be honest with those guys.

513
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,044
All right, here we go.

514
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,381
Thank y-o-o-o...

515
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,216
See, Morty?
This is what it's all about.

516
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,885
This is why we do what we do.

517
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,470
- Uh-Huh.
- Ew! What the hell?

518
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,597
Jesus!
There's flies in my ice cream.

519
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,890
Presidential decree...

520
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,351
All ice cream is now
for all beings,

521
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,936
no matter how many legs.

522
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,604
What the fuck
did you do, Summer?!

523
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,314
It was your ship!
Your stupid ship did it!

524
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,024
- Don't blame my ship!
- It melted a child!

525
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,026
My ship doesn't do anything
unless it's told to!

526
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,778
I don't want to hear it, Summer!

527
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,863
Your boobs are
all hanging about,

528
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,782
and you ruined ice cream
with your boobs out.

529
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,533
And don't even try
to deny it, either.

530
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,667
Oh, my god!

531
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,127
Did you get any of that?

532
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,170
It's a good show!
