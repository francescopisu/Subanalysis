1
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:06,257
Hey, Rick.

2
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:08,261
I have to make a project for
the science fair this weekend.

3
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:09,932
You think you could help me out?

4
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:11,738
- Whatever.
- Well, I mean, traditionally...

5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,190
science fairs are
a father-son thing.

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:17,072
Well, scientifically,
traditions are an idiot thing.

7
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,658
Morty, I think it would
be fun for you

8
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:21,497
to work on a science project
with your Dad.

9
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:25,463
Uh...

10
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:28,219
Yeah, Dad.
Why don't we do it together?

11
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:31,100
Yes! You backed the right horse
on this one, son.

12
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:33,313
We'll get out the crayons,
brew some coffee,

13
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:35,735
and knock this thing out
in two or three days.

14
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:38,657
What is my purpose?

15
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,912
Pass the butter.

16
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,002
Thank you.

17
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:48,385
Dad, I need a ride to work.

18
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,264
Maybe Rick can give you a ride.

19
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,143
I'm helping Morty with science.

20
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:54,148
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

21
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:56,694
Uh, anything else.

22
00:00:56,779 --> 00:00:58,698
What is my purpose?

23
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,828
You pass butter.

24
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:02,539
Oh, my god.

25
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,585
Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.

26
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,492
Since when do you have a job?

27
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:41,578
Since last week.

28
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,331
It's part-time at this
little vintage thrift store.

29
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,753
My boss is this really
smart, eccentric old man

30
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,049
that treats me nice
and values me.

31
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:49,928
Meow.
Can't wait to meet...

32
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:51,807
this fascinating character.

33
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,438
Please don't.

34
00:01:54,522 --> 00:01:57,319
Oh. Well, when did this
stop being Jamba Juice?

35
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,573
I've just recently opened
for business,

36
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:01,745
Mister, um, Goldenfold.

37
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,122
You know my name?

38
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,918
That's disarming.

39
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,757
I also know you long
for female company.

40
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,888
You know, it has been
lonely since the divorce.

41
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:13,810
Some voids can't be filled
with Jamba Juice.

42
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:17,401
This aftershave makes a
man quite irresistible to women.

43
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:18,863
Free of charge.

44
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:21,576
One never pays here...
not with money.

45
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,581
Nothing to read into
there. Thanks!

46
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,627
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. Needful.

47
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,883
This is my grandpa, Rick.
He was just leaving.

48
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,010
Huh.

49
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:31,889
Tell me, Rick,
what do you desire?

50
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:33,893
Eh, I make my own stuff.

51
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:35,772
So, what are you...
like, the devil?

52
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,442
- What? Sorry?
- I don't know.

53
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:40,658
Store comes out of nowhere,
all the shit's old and creepy.

54
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,620
Are you the devil?
A demon? Leprechaun?

55
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,499
- Grandpa Rick!
- Hey, I'm not judging.

56
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,503
Just like shoot straight.
I'm a man of science.

57
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:49,342
Ah, then perhaps you could
make use of this.

58
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:53,350
This microscope reveals things
beyond comprehension.

59
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,663
Grandpa, go home and drink.

60
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,504
Why don't we do a model
of the solar system?

61
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:09,591
That's what my Dad did with me
when I was your age.

62
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,095
Oh, okay.

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,767
You know, Rick's in his lab,
making cyborgs

64
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,105
and wormholes
and all that weird stuff,

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,942
but this is real science.

66
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:20,113
A man and his boy,
making planets.

67
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:22,702
Hey, how about we use
a ping-pong ball for Pluto?

68
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,163
And then Jupiter...

69
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,752
Uh, actually, I don't
think Pluto's a planet.

70
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,134
Of course Pluto's a planet, son.

71
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,013
I learned that
in the third grade.

72
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,766
Well, yeah, but you
know they changed it.

73
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,728
Morty, nobody changed
the planets.

74
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:38,150
I just googled it.
Pluto's not a planet.

75
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:40,154
They changed it in 2006.

76
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,868
Yeah, I heard about that, Morty.

77
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:45,749
And I disagree.
You disagree?

78
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,255
That's right. It's possible
to disagree in science, Morty.

79
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,924
Pluto was a planet.

80
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:51,650
Some committee of
fancy assholes disagree.

81
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,598
I disagree back.
Give me a ping-pong ball.

82
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:56,062
Um, okay.
I-I just have to...

83
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:57,909
Go find Rick and go
over my head about Pluto?

84
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,110
No. Geez!

85
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:01,532
I just gotta go
to the bathroom. Damn.

86
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,413
Oh.
Okay, good.

87
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,082
This is gonna be fun.

88
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,971
- Hey, Morty, let me...
- let me...

89
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:10,842
let me ask you a question
real quick.

90
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:12,679
Does evil exist, and if so,

91
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,433
can one detect and measure it?

92
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,270
- Um...
- Rhetorical question, Morty.

93
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,650
The answer's "yes, you just
have to be a genius."

94
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,571
Cute. Your sister's boss
gave me a microscope

95
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,157
that would have
made me retarded.

96
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,952
Ooh.
Oh, boy, Rick.

97
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:25,956
I'm don't think you're allowed
to say that word, you know?

98
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,337
Morty, I'm not disparaging
the differently abled.

99
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,758
I'm stating the fact that
if I had used this microscope,

100
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:32,404
it would have made me
mentally retarded.

101
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,850
Okay, yeah, but I don't think
it's about logic, Rick.

102
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,771
I think the word has just
become a symbolic issue for

103
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:39,275
powerful groups that are
doing the right thing.

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,987
Well, that's retarded.

105
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,866
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, nothing.

106
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,912
You asked him if
Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

107
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:45,997
- No!
- It's not.

108
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,501
- Shut up, Rick.
- Whoa.

109
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,171
I don't care what anyone says.

110
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,010
If it can be a planet,
it can be a planet again.

111
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,933
Planet.
Planet, planet, planet.

112
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,437
Stay scientific, Jerry.

113
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,070
This aftershave made women
want me,

114
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:03,074
but it also made me impotent!

115
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:05,788
A price for everything,
Mr. Goldenfold.

116
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,127
A price for everything.

117
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:11,843
Oh, my god!

118
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,556
How could I not
see this coming?!

119
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,314
My lust!

120
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,527
My greed!

121
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,115
I deserved this!

122
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,122
This serum should
counteract the negative effects.

123
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,835
Holy cats!
Ladies, let's get out of here.

124
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,839
I haven't learned a thing!

125
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:32,259
Here.

126
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:34,013
You can have this back.

127
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:35,265
You didn't use it?

128
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,144
Sure I did...
to develop this.

129
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:39,231
It detects and catalogs
all your "Twilight Zone,"

130
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:41,737
Ray Bradbury,
"Friday the 13th" The Series

131
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,407
voodoo crap magic.

132
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:44,910
I thought you might
want it so you didn't

133
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:47,415
accidentally
sell anybody, say...

134
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,962
A typewriter that generates
best-selling murder mysteries

135
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:52,885
and then makes the murders
happen in real life?

136
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:53,845
Ooh.
Be quiet.

137
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,264
Don't you want to make sure

138
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:56,851
people know what they're
getting?

139
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,980
You're not intentionally
selling...

140
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,776
Beauty cream that makes
ugly ladies pretty

141
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,030
but also makes them blind?

142
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,034
I find this all quite
preposterous.

143
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,039
Oh, I say, good sir.
Oh, harrumph.

144
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:10,003
Oh, oh!

145
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:11,506
That's beautiful.

146
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,345
You know it's gonna be wearing
you in three hours?

147
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,152
Do I need to call the police?

148
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,519
Here, you can use my phone.

149
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,063
Don't worry, it won't
make you deaf

150
00:06:19,148 --> 00:06:20,400
because I'm not a hack.

151
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:21,819
Hey!

152
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,867
You think you're fucking
so great!

153
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,745
Stop it! No!

154
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,624
Fuck yeah, man.

155
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:30,378
Stop it right now!

156
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,466
Grandpa Rick,
I like working here.

157
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,637
- You work for the devil.
- So what?

158
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,307
- "So what?"
- Yes!

159
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:37,977
So what if he's the devil, Rick?

160
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,647
At least the devil has a job.

161
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,401
At least he's active
in the community.

162
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,070
What do you do?

163
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,159
You eat our food
and make gadgets.

164
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:47,538
Buh-bye.

165
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:49,042
WhOops.

166
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:53,133
I'm sorry, Mr. Needful.
I'll clean that up.

167
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:54,929
I don't know what I can do
about the ghost lady

168
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,599
that came out of it, but...
It's fine.

169
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,561
Summer, you know,
your grandfather's right.

170
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:01,359
This store curses people.
That's my business.

171
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,780
Well, yeah.
Fast-food gives people diabetes,

172
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:05,617
and clothing stores have
sweatshops.

173
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:07,829
Is there a company hiring
teenagers that isn't evil?

174
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:09,542
This is my first job.

175
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:11,254
You've been nice to me,
Mr. Needful.

176
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,049
You respect me.

177
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,555
Please, call me "The Devil."

178
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,392
I'd rather not, actually.

179
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,228
Yes, perhaps not during
business hours.

180
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,233
I told you, I want to
file a declaration

181
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,404
that Pluto is a planet.

182
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:25,741
Well, then my son's going to
fail his science class,

183
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:27,955
and when that happens,
I'm suing you first.

184
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,295
I think I know what the "A"
in N.A.S.A. stands for.

185
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,175
- Dad, what's your endgame?
- Ain't no game, sucka.

186
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,929
Why don't we just make the solar
system with eight planets?

187
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:37,223
It's even easier.

188
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:40,397
Sure, sure, and why don't we
just burn Galileo at the stake

189
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:42,401
for saying the sun is round?

190
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:44,614
Science isn't always easy,
Morty.

191
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,829
Whoa! Whoa!

192
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:49,457
What the hell?!

193
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,906
I'm King Flippy Nips,
ruler of Pluto.

194
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,243
We discovered you quite
by accident

195
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,916
during routine surveillance
of your world.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,963
You really gave it to those
guys at N.A.S.A.

197
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,467
I was... you know,

198
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:16,805
sometimes science is
about conviction.

199
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,310
It'd like to introduce you
to a few people

200
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,314
that very much agree with you.

201
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,151
Oh, I...

202
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,447
Plutonians.

203
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,493
Jerry Smith is a scientist
from Earth,

204
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:31,000
where he's creating a model
of our solar system.

205
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,340
Jerry, tell Pluto
about your decision.

206
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,558
Um... Pluto's a planet.

207
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,816
Pluto's a fucking planet, bitch!

208
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,365
Oh, man. This is definitely
gonna go to his head.

209
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,165
If it's athletic prowess
you desire, Principal Vagina,

210
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,043
I might...
I'll take it.

211
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,129
B-But I haven't even...

212
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:54,213
Thank you very, very much.

213
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:56,386
Great store.
Great place. Bye.

214
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,265
Huh. Okay.

215
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:01,188
I must say, Summer, I thought
your grandfather's outburst

216
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,565
would have disrupted business,

217
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,279
but this is the best weekend
I've had since Salem.

218
00:09:05,363 --> 00:09:07,283
Nice. "Wholesome Delight"
for lunch?

219
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,287
- Is that the vegan place?
- Yeah, I love their soup.

220
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:11,166
I'm kind of soup-ed out.

221
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,086
Mrs. Tate, is it?

222
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,300
What do you desire?

223
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,471
Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey.

224
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:19,225
Oh, is there a limit?
Everything's free, right?

225
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,856
Let's just say you
don't pay... with money.

226
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,861
That was perfect.

227
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:26,865
You pay with the curses, right?

228
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,451
Um... I... well...

229
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,708
But, Mrs. Tate, why do you
want cursed items?

230
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,420
Well, I'm going to get
the curses removed

231
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:34,756
at "Curse Purge Plus."

232
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,760
You know, the guy on TV?

233
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:38,806
What?

234
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,270
Have you acquired
creepy specific old stuff

235
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:42,772
from a mysterious antique
or thrift store

236
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,194
that gives you powers
but fucks with you

237
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,363
in unforeseeable ways?

238
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,075
Bring it
to "Curse Purge Plus."

239
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,164
I use science to
UN-curse the items for cash,

240
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:52,751
and you get to keep the powers.

241
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,117
This guy got mysterious sneakers

242
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,301
to make him run faster,
but guess what?

243
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,179
He would have had to run
until he died,

244
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,390
making them worthless.

245
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,060
I removed the curse,
making them worth,

246
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:03,356
like, I don't know, $8 million.

247
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:04,609
See you at the Olympics.

248
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:06,112
This eerily intelligent doll

249
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:07,824
was threatening to murder
its family.

250
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,243
Now it does their taxes.

251
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:10,872
Everything's deductible.

252
00:10:10,956 --> 00:10:12,584
Don't pay for cool stuff
with your soul.

253
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,128
Pay for it with money.

254
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,467
You know, like how every other
store in the world works?

255
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,721
We're located at First and Main
in Old Town.

256
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,141
Come on... come on down.

257
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,435
"First and..."

258
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,443
That's right across the street
from "Needful Things,"

259
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,865
where you can get evil items
for free!

260
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,330
Diabolic son of a motherf...

261
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,335
We're back on
"Good Morning, Pluto."

262
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,339
And a very good morning it is

263
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:38,095
for our guest,
Earth scientist Jerry Smith,

264
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,307
who's making headlines
with his bold announcement

265
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:42,478
that is what, Jerry?

266
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,148
Pluto is a planet.

267
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,944
Well, how about that.

268
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:47,948
I love it.

269
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,370
Morty Smith.
I'm Scroopy Noopers.

270
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:52,499
I'm a scientist.
Can I show you something?

271
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,378
Uh, I better not.

272
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:56,841
Right now.

273
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:59,555
The center of Pluto,
Mr. Smith,

274
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,810
is made of a substance called
"plutonium."

275
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:05,525
mines like these suck plutonium
up to the cities,

276
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,822
where corporations use it
to power everything,

277
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:11,538
from diamond cars
to golden showers.

278
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,544
And the more we remove,
the more Pluto shrinks.

279
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,548
There it goes again.

280
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:18,177
Just shrank a little.

281
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,429
But a few years ago,

282
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,351
your scientists noticed Pluto
had gotten so small

283
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:24,648
they couldn't even call it
a "planet" anymore.

284
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,527
Should've been
our wake-up call.

285
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,322
But the rich plutonians
won't wake up,

286
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:31,203
and they love your Dad telling
everyone Pluto's a planet

287
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,249
because that means
they can keep mining

288
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:36,589
until Pluto goes
from planet to asteroid

289
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:39,888
to meteor, and finally...

290
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,476
poof.
Um, a party?

291
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,962
Is everyone in your family
an idiot?

292
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:45,691
Well, for sure
me and my Dad are.

293
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,529
Well, all you have to do

294
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:49,156
is get him to admit that,

295
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,745
and you could save
four billion lives.

296
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,797
Yeah, you know, the thing is
my Dad's really insecure.

297
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,054
Hmm. Funny.

298
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,392
Mr. Needful, out of everything
in the store,

299
00:12:02,476 --> 00:12:05,106
you'll never guess
what we couldn't get rid of.

300
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,738
Oh, my god.

301
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:12,413
Oh, my god.

302
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:17,089
I wish this desk was lighter.

303
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:20,179
I wish this knot was looser.

304
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:21,974
Come on.

305
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,646
I don't...

306
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,819
Wait, what am I doing?

307
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,032
I wish I knew CPR.

308
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,327
1, 2, 3.

309
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,038
Oh, Jesus.

310
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:35,293
What a waste of a monkey paw.

311
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:37,297
Mr. Needful, how
could you even think of doing

312
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,926
something so horrible?

313
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,595
I'm the devil.
What should I do

314
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,850
when I fail...
get myself an ice cream?

315
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,186
You haven't failed.

316
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,106
People like Rick
are making me obsolete.

317
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:48,110
I mean, seriously.
I may be "the devil,"

318
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:50,824
but your grandpa is the devil.

319
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,286
I just want to go back to hell,

320
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,013
where everyone thinks
I'm smart and funny.

321
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,709
No!
It's not fair.

322
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:58,006
Everyone in this town
got something they wanted

323
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,175
from you... even Rick.

324
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,348
I was your only friend,
and I get nothing?

325
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:05,312
Okay. I'll give you one thing.
Name it.

326
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,651
I want to help you.

327
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:08,736
Clever twist.

328
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,907
I learned from
the best, you old fart.

329
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,037
Now, let's go get you hydrated.

330
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:14,748
Looks like we've got...

331
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,752
haunted boxing gloves
that will make you

332
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,716
the heavyweight champion
in 1936,

333
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,678
and then you'll be
trapped there,

334
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:22,180
winning the same fight
for eternity.

335
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:24,143
I can take out the "eternity"
and the padding,

336
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:26,857
and then you'll have some
time-traveling mittens.

337
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:28,861
Oh, look, it's Rosemary's Baby.

338
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,573
How's business?

339
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,452
Here's the last
of our inventory.

340
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:35,416
We're going to file chapter 11
and do some restructuring.

341
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,337
Sounds like code for
"You win, Rick."

342
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:39,299
That was important
to you, wasn't it?

343
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:40,969
Nope. Lt was important
to your dumb devil friend.

344
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,681
To me, this was all just a bit,

345
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,309
like when Bugs Bunny fucks
with the opera singer

346
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:45,520
for 20 minutes.

347
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:47,148
He tried to kill himself.

348
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,403
Seriously? Holy crap.

349
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,115
Holy crap.

350
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,910
But you know what, Grandpa Rick?

351
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,873
He's strong, and he's never
going to give up.

352
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,419
- Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.
- Oh, I know.

353
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,298
- Everyone knows you don't care.
- So?

354
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:01,302
So have fun not caring.

355
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,056
- I always do.
- Good.

356
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,935
- Yeah, it is good.
- It's the best.

357
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,022
I'm sure it is.

358
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,609
- Bye.
- Later.

359
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:11,031
I'm here to pick up
my undead cat and child.

360
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,285
Yeah, uh...
give me a sec.

361
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,665
These are the forms
for the employee health plan.

362
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:19,214
All right, yeah, put...
put them on my... eh.

363
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:21,886
I just got bored.

364
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:24,559
Everybody out.

365
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:26,521
All right, just one more rally,

366
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,483
then I promise we'll get back
to your science project.

367
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,154
Dad, Pluto isn't a planet.

368
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:31,823
It's shrinking because
of corporations.

369
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,828
Yeah, that's what that
anti-planet nut job

370
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:35,790
Scroopy Noopers was
screaming about

371
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,919
outside the Ministry of Money's
Fundraiser.

372
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:40,758
Are you telling me four billion
Plutonians are wrong?

373
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,471
You said science wasn't easy.

374
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,182
I said science
isn't a/ways easy.

375
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,770
Obviously, that means
sometimes it is easy.

376
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:48,983
Let's not debase ourselves
with word games, son.

377
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:50,487
Dad, their whole
planet is dying.

378
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,869
Ha! You called it a planet.
Checkmate.

379
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:55,789
What's up, Pluto?

380
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:02,052
Mr. Smith, please tell
my friend here

381
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:04,014
what you just told me.
Go on.

382
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:06,478
My very eager mother
just served us nine pickles,

383
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,440
and the "pickles" is Pluto.

384
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:11,154
My god, the man's a genius.

385
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,075
Um, excuse me.

386
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,162
Morty, what?

387
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,089
Dad, what did you
think about the recent report

388
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,254
published by
The Pluto Science Reader

389
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:23,805
linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes,
and surface shrinkage

390
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,354
to deep-core plutonium
drilling?

391
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:30,610
Well, son, what did you think

392
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:32,614
when you were five
and you pooped your pants,

393
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,869
and you threw your poopy undies
out your bedroom window

394
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,623
because you thought it was like

395
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,376
throwing something
in the garbage?

396
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,120
I mean, I'm trimming the hedges,

397
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,802
and these things are just
hanging there.

398
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:44,808
Was I supposed to think
the poop bunny left them?

399
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,854
Good one, Dad.

400
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:50,693
Hey, Morty, you want to
go on a... oh.

401
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,655
Hey, Beth.
Hello?

402
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,119
Hey, Jerry, you in here
being stupid?

403
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,343
Thanks.

404
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,263
Hey, you know, I was thinking,
you know,

405
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:05,557
I might watch a movie.

406
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,186
I am not programmed for
friendship.

407
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,273
Suit yourself.

408
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:13,448
Hey.
Hey.

409
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:14,826
W-W-What's going on?

410
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:18,166
Um, can you help me do
the stupid science fair project?

411
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,128
Whatever.

412
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,427
Jerry, you must be so excited.

413
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:26,308
The Pluto-bel prize is
the highest honor

414
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:28,521
a scientist can receive.

415
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:30,525
I'm flattered and humbled.

416
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:33,322
Oh, I like that.
Use that in your speech.

417
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,619
Also, talk about Pluto
being a planet.

418
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,330
People like that.

419
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,000
Your highness, we've captured
Scroopy Noopers.

420
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,629
You animals! Animals!

421
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:45,347
Ooh, look who's little
journey's come to an end.

422
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:47,476
Take him to Pluto-namo Bay.

423
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:50,107
You can't kill the truth,
father.

424
00:16:50,191 --> 00:16:52,403
- What?
- I can see you're confused.

425
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,282
Pluto-namo Bay is
a military prison...

426
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:56,161
a sort of play on words.

427
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:57,789
Did he call you "father"?

428
00:16:57,874 --> 00:17:00,336
Scroopy Noopers,
the anti-planet nut job,

429
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,006
is your son?

430
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,344
The young eat the old
if you let them, Jerry.

431
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,559
Pluto is a cold, cold
celestial dwarf.

432
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,814
- It's a what?
- Huh? Oh, planet.

433
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,196
"Pluto is a cold,
cold planet."

434
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
That's what I meant.

435
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,289
Knock them dead out there, you.

436
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,550
Pluto is...

437
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,784
not a planet.

438
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:38,581
Ow! It's not a planet.

439
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,963
Hey!
It's not a planet!

440
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:45,136
I'm an idiot, and I love my son.

441
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,140
It was a long six hours,

442
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:49,228
but we've overhauled
"Needful Things"

443
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:50,898
into the globally-compliant
web 4.0

444
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:54,906
"E-nomenon," n33dful. Com,

445
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,704
spelled with threes
instead of "E's."

446
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,674
Okay, that's it.
We just got bought by Google!

447
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:06,513
Mm.
I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

448
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:09,019
So, how much did we make?

449
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,064
"We."

450
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,402
This is mybusiness.
Security!

451
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,364
You're Zuckerberg-ING me?

452
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,993
I was Zuckerberg-ING people

453
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,705
before Zuckerberg's balls
dropped.

454
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:21,544
I'm the devil, bitch!
What, what?!

455
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,766
Hey!

456
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,316
- Hey, Morty.
- Oh, oh, hey, Dad.

457
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,280
Um, what... what are you doing
back from Pluto so quick?

458
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:38,287
Uh... some people just
can't handle the truth.

459
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,291
Especially dummies like me.

460
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,837
Morty, I'm not as smart
as your grandpa Rick,

461
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,178
but I promise never to make
that your problem again.

462
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:47,765
Hey, Dad.

463
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,938
Nobody's smarter than Rick,
but nobody else is my Dad.

464
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:52,733
You're a genius at that.

465
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,737
Wow.

466
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:58,328
That's... humbling
and flattering, son.

467
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,332
Thank you.

468
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,700
What say we finish ourselves
an eight-planet solar system?

469
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:05,050
Um... I'm just gonna
take this thing in

470
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:07,054
and get an "A."
Butter.

471
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:08,766
- But...
- You're a genius...

472
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:09,935
at being my Dad, Dad.

473
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,271
Quit while you're ahead.

474
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:12,941
And also, knock next time,
you know?

475
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,508
I mean, I'm sitting in here,
I'm 14...

476
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,072
I got a computer in here,
you know?

477
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:17,909
Oh, I... I think
I understand.

478
00:19:17,994 --> 00:19:19,538
You're really playing with fire

479
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:20,957
when you burst in here
like that, man.

480
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,502
I get it. Say no more.

481
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:24,006
I mean, one of these days,

482
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,801
you know, you're gonna end
up seeing something.

483
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:28,139
I got it!
Noted. Good night.

484
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:34,569
How's your pretend
grandpa doing, aka "The Devil"?

485
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,408
- He dumped me.
- Oof. Sorry.

486
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:39,621
Did we learn a lesson here
I'm not seeing?

487
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:40,999
Not sure.

488
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:42,878
Maybe in a much bigger way,

489
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,549
Mr. Needful gave us
both what we really wanted?

490
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:49,015
Because I was always jealous of
you hanging out with Morty,

491
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,146
and you didn't realize how much
you valued my approval?

492
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,777
- No, that's dumb.
- Yeah, not satisfying.

493
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,697
I'll tell you what, though.

494
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,493
If... if... if it's satisfaction
you're after,

495
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,205
I think I might have an idea.

496
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,501
Uh-huh.

497
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,088
Uh-huh.

498
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,507
Uh-huh, totally.

into the forefront
of the up front.

514
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,362
Thank you, Seattle.

515
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:40,914
Rick? Summer?

516
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,086
Stupid motherfucker!

517
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,339
You stupid bitch.

518
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:47,134
Stupid motherfucker!

519
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:49,347
How do you like that?
How do you like that?

520
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:53,606
W-W-Why?

521
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,237
Because sometimes
what you really need is

522
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,908
for someone else to pay
a horrible price.

523
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,086
- We did it.
- Yeah, bro.

524
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,758
We totally worked it.
