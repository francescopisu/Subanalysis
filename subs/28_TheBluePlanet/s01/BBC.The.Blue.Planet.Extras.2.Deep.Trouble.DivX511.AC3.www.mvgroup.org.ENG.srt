2
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:48,517
<i>that we've gone underwater</i>
<i>to see what lives there,</i>

3
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:09,078
<i>We all love dolphins,</i>

4
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:12,799
<i>They're the playful,</i>
<i>popular face of the ocean,</i>

5
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:20,037
<i>But most of what lives underwater</i>
<i>is out of sight,</i>

6
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:22,600
<i>and so, out of mind,</i>

7
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,999
<i>Even in the 20 years</i>
<i>that I've been diving,</i>

8
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,840
<i>there have been big changes</i>
<i>in our seas,</i>

9
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:34,160
<i>It's clear that our oceans</i>
<i>are now in real danger,</i>

10
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:47,875
<i>Flying over miles and miles</i>
<i>of ocean, you get the impression</i>

11
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:49,878
<i>that things aren't too bad,</i>

12
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:54,120
<i>but below the surface there's</i>
<i>a multitude of man-made problems,</i>

13
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:59,362
<i>0f all of them, probably</i>
<i>the most destructive is fishing,</i>

14
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>and it's the WAY we catch fish</i>
<i>that's the problem,</i>

15
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,965
<i>Blue fin tuna, king of the sea,</i>

16
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:19,358
<i>They are exquisitely designed</i>
<i>for the open ocean,</i>

17
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,960
<i>They can grow up</i>
<i>to three-quarters of a tonne,</i>

18
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,118
<i>and can swim at 50 miles an hour,</i>

19
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:28,085
<i>faster than any other creature</i>
<i>in the sea,,,</i>

20
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:30,680
<i>apart from us,</i>

21
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:35,483
<i>They have few natural predators</i>
<i>when fully grown,</i>

22
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:39,879
<i>It is believed that these blue fin</i>
<i>are now endangered,</i>

23
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:43,562
<i>There's no place in the ocean</i>
<i>where we can't pursue them,</i>

24
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,957
<i>They just can't escape us,</i>

25
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,161
Fishing has become
incredibly hi-tech,

26
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:53,558
so much so that we can
pretty much capture anything

27
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,718
anywhere in the world nowadays.

28
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:59,277
These blue fin tuna boats
beneath me have every mod con.

29
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:03,804
They have incredibly big engines,
use depth sounders, GPS,

30
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:07,880
and they even have spotter planes
spotting the fish for them.

31
00:03:08,047 --> 00:03:11,437
I got about eight fish over here.
They just went down.

32
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,598
They're on my left side.

33
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,716
<i>So the blue fin tuna,</i>
<i>travelling at 50 miles an hour,</i>

34
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,559
<i>hasn't got much of a chance,</i>

35
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:26,356
The moment it comes to the surface,
somebody will spot it.

36
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:32,356
Go at 12 o'clock.
Five or six boats.

37
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,159
<i>Here they're being hunted on one</i>
<i>of their major migration routes,</i>

38
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,239
<i>It's thought they swim</i>
<i>from the Gulf of Mexico</i>

39
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:46,195
<i>up the eastern seaboard</i>
<i>of the U,S, to Canada each summer,</i>

40
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,962
<i>Their routes are so predictable,</i>

41
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,687
<i>that they can be caught</i>
<i>year after year,</i>

42
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:01,198
<i>While these fisherman</i>
<i>are still catching them,</i>

43
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,517
<i>scientists are tagging the fish,</i>

44
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:07,236
<i>trying to discover how many</i>
<i>separate populations there are,</i>

45
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,204
<i>what their movements are,</i>

46
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,562
<i>and just how many fish are left,</i>

47
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,882
<i>Marine scientist and</i>
<i>keen sports fisherman Carl Safina</i>

<i>He loves fishing for blue fin,</i>

50
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,925
<i>but these days</i>
<i>he has to target other species,</i>

51
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:28,681
I've been fishing off shore
since I was 12

52
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,838
with my fathers and my uncles,

53
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,441
and we used to see
lots of blue fin tuna -

54
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,565
a lot of small ones
and a lot of big ones.

55
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,359
Now, er...there are so few tuna,

56
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:43,883
that people...sport fish
for sharks now.

57
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,036
<i>Safina is so concerned</i>
<i>by this decline</i>

58
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:55,086
<i>that he's campaigning</i>
<i>with the National Audubon Society</i>

59
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:57,363
<i>to try and save these tuna,</i>

00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:02,039
What we do know about blue fins
in the western part of the Atlantic -

61
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:05,279
the part of the Atlantic
off the U.S. and Canada -

62
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:09,486
is that, er...from the mid 1970s

63
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,524
until the late 1990s,

64
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,723
the population has declined

65
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,559
by roughly 85 per cent.

66
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:19,481
<i>In New England, where most</i>
<i>of the Western Atlantic blue fin</i>

67
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,638
<i>are caught commercially,</i>

68
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:25,482
<i>fishermen just don't believe</i>
<i>these government figures,</i>

69
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:29,359
<i>They claim there are mistakes</i>
<i>in the analysis,</i>

70
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,166
<i>so they're naturally</i>
<i>very sceptical</i>

71

<i>about the quotas</i>
<i>the government imposes,</i>

72
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,080
<i>Scientific research in the ocean</i>
<i>is expensive,</i>

73
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:42,126
<i>and the politics surrounding</i>
<i>this fish are complicated,</i>

74
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,242
<i>but one thing is indisputable -</i>

75
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:48,558
<i>these fish sell</i>
<i>for vast amounts of money,</i>

76
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:53,400
(SAFINA) The blue fin tuna
was worth a few cents a pound

77
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,081
and often sold as cat food

78
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:58,238
until some people realised

79
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,796
that if they airlifted them
to Japan -

80
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,481
if they sent them to Japan
in airplanes -

81
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,161
the price would go from a few cents

82
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,318
to many dollars per pound.

<i>Tsukiji market in Tokyo is the</i>
<i>biggest fish market in the world,</i>

84

<i>Before I came to Japan,</i>
<i>I'd heard a lot about it</i>

85
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:29,238
<i>but I just wasn't prepared</i>
<i>for the scale of it,</i>

86
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,800
<i>This warehouse</i>

87
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:36,880
<i>In another section, there are</i>
<i>rows and rows of fresh tuna,</i>

88
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:41,279
<i>and amongst these are</i>
<i>a frightening quantity of blue fin,</i>

<i>in the world,</i>

91
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,638
This is big business.

92
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:06,241
These blue fin
are fetching £60 a kilo,

93
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,398
so in today's auction,

94
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:11,684
a dealer would expect
to get £12,000

95
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,838
for this one fish alone.

96
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:16,077
<i>But the market fluctuates madly,</i>

97
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:18,761
<i>and some blue fin here</i>

98
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,077
<i>have fetched more than £100,000,</i>

99
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:42,439
<i>Tuna fisherman don't accept the</i>
<i>blue fin numbers are right down,</i>

<i>but most scientists</i>
<i>firmly believe that they are,</i>

101
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:50,320
Many people want blue fin tuna
listed as CITES Appendix I,

102
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:53,877
in other words, a total ban
on all fishing of them.

103
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,526
Unless this is done,

104
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,600
there is no way that those involved
in the market will give up -

105
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,962
there's too much in it for them.

106

<i>This market is not just about tuna,</i>

107

<i>There's every conceivable type</i>
<i>of fish here,</i>

108
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:21,719
Nearly 50 per cent of the food
eaten in Japan

109
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,878
comes from the sea,

110
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:27,596
compared with the world's average
of about 15 per cent.

111
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:32,158
They eat enormous quantities of fish,
of every species imaginable,

112
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,558

those species are in deep trouble.

118
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:04,357
<i>While shark meat is on sale</i>
<i>in many Japanese markets,</i>

119
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,758
<i>by far the biggest trade</i>
<i>is in shark fins,</i>

120
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,236
<i>and that trade is Asia-wide,</i>

121
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:14,045
<i>About 100 million sharks</i>

Admittedly,
this IS the biggest market,

124
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:23,117
but there are hundreds of markets
all over the world

125
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:25,437
selling huge quantities of fish,

126
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,963
and it's not just one day a week,
it's day after day.

127
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,483
You might find
some really strange creatures here,

128
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:35,241
ones which are
totally unfamiliar to us,

129
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:39,002
but it's often the more common
species that are threatened,

130
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,556
and those you can find on sale
at home.

131

<i>This is Billingsgate Market,</i>

132
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,282

<i>Here you can buy all the familiar</i>
<i>fish which we love to eat,</i>

134
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:57,356
<i>but in the UK, we're eating fish</i>
<i>whose stocks are dangerously low,</i>

<i>Most of us have no idea</i>
<i>that these fish are in trouble,</i>

136
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:05,396
<i>even the most common ones</i>
<i>such as cod,</i>

137
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:10,645
At the moment, the worst problem
is with cod in the Irish Sea

138
00:10:10,807 --> 00:10:14,800
which is really in a very,
very depressed state indeed.

139
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:20,075
The north-east Arctic stock
off the coast of Norway

140
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:21,999
is not in very good shape.

141
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:26,126
The Canadian stock and the North
Sea stock are not in good shape.

142
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:30,565
About the only one that's doing
reasonably well is in Iceland.

143
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,480
And if that one goes the same way,

144
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,638
there will be no Atlantic cod.

145
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:38,924
There simply will not be any cod
for sale.

146
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,523
So is this a normal size
for a cod these days?

147
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,564
That's an average size, yeah.

(SHEPHERD ) When you buy fish in the
supermarket or fish and chip shop,

149
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,397
as a consumer
you have no way to tell

150
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:58,640
whether this is from a stock
that is overfished or that isn't.

151
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:02,959
- These are from the North Sea?
- Yeah, they're Scottish.

152
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:05,436
We know that fish stocks
do collapse

153
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:07,598
and sometimes they recover -

154
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,201
the herring collapsed
and recovered.

155
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:13,837
A stock of mackerel in
the North Sea in the 60s and 70s

156
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,319
collapsed under very heavy fishing
pressure by purse-seiners,

157
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,284
and it has not come back.

158
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,358
In 30 years, it has not come back.

159
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,166
Sole and plaice
are fully exploited

160
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:30,482
and could not sustain
any further fishing pressure.

161
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:32,956
The herring also
is fully exploited.

162
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,083
There's no room for expansion.

163
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:39,762
Now, with so much fishing pressure
in surface waters,

164
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:44,159
fishermen are going deeper and
deeper to find fish for the market.

165
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:48,639
We're seeing things here that we'd
never have heard of 20 years ago.

166
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,316
This is a black scabbard

167
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,921
and it lives at about 1,000 metres.

168
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,999
So are these fish in trouble?
It's hard to say,

169
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,557
because like everything else
that lives in the deep,

170
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:02,718
very little is known about it.

171
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,482
Scientists don't really know
what's going on down there,

172
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:09,480
<i>and they're only just beginning</i>
<i>to find out,</i>

173
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,484
<i>Scientists from Tasmania</i>

174
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,002
<i>are now using hi-tech cameras</i>

175
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,759
<i>mounted on submersibles</i>

176
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:22,124
<i>to study the effects of fishing</i>
<i>on the deep sea,</i>

177
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,598
<i>0nly in the last 30 years</i>

178
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,679
<i>have we had the technology</i>
<i>to fish the deep,</i>

179
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:33,599
<i>But in many places, the fishing</i>
<i>pressure has been intense,</i>

180
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:39,680
<i>This particular fish</i>
<i>is now on our menus,</i>

181
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,326
These white fish

182
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:46,957
are the fillets of a deep sea fish
called orange ruffie.

183
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:50,722
You may have noticed them
in your supermarket recently.

184
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:54,397
They can live at depths
of 1,500 metres,

185
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,558
and like a lot of deep sea fish,

186
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:58,718
they live a very long time.

187
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:02,197
These ones could have been born
during World War II.

188
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:06,121
They could even have been around
during the Victorian era.

189
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,278
It's believed that orange ruffie

190
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,915
can live to a staggering
150 years old.

191
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:15,284
<i>As well as living longer,</i>
<i>these fish mature later</i>

192
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:16,960
<i>at about 30 years old,</i>

193
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,436
<i>If you take them out</i>
<i>before this age,</i>

194
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:21,677
<i>they won't be able to reproduce,</i>

195
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:25,681
<i>There won't be a future generation</i>
<i>of orange ruffie,</i>

196
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,037
<i>For many years, the fishing</i>
<i>pressure here was huge,</i>

197
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:37,517
<i>Thousands of tonnes</i>
<i>were scooped up for the market,</i>

198
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:39,484
<i>and sold around the world,</i>

199
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:41,638
<i>At times, so many were caught,</i>

200
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:45,561
<i>there wasn't even the market</i>
<i>for them, They were just dumped,</i>

201
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,682
<i>Fortunately, the New Zealand</i>
<i>and Australian fisheries</i>

202
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,997
<i>recognised the problem in time,</i>

203
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,159
<i>They now monitor the fish stocks</i>
<i>carefully,</i>

204
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:02,081
<i>The fish may be safe,</i>
<i>but the habitat they rely on isn't,</i>

205
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,566
<i>In the deep sea,</i>

206
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,195
<i>there are animals so new to us</i>

207
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:15,882
<i>and so strange,</i>
<i>it's as if we are in another world,</i>

208
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:49,643
<i>Despite its remoteness,</i>

209
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:54,119
<i>the deep sea habitat is now</i>
<i>under threat, and once again,</i>

210
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:58,200
<i>it's the method of fishing</i>
<i>that is causing the real damage,</i>

211
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,321
<i>Deep sea fishing nets are huge,</i>

212
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,081
<i>They dredge up life</i>
<i>indiscriminately,</i>

213
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,518
<i>Corals and sponges</i>
<i>hundreds of years old</i>

214
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:14,724
<i>are being ripped off</i>
<i>the seabed and destroyed,</i>

215
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:18,243
What a trawler does,
particularly in the deep sea,

216
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:22,082
where fishing effort
is concentrated around sea mounts

217
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:24,238
which are very hard rock,

218
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:26,477
to protect the net from the rock,

219
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:30,481
they have steel balls on them
about half a metre in diameter.

220
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:34,117
That net is pulled along
at say three knots,

221
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:38,644
smacking into the rock,
smack, smack, smack, smack.

222
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,959
So this net basically comes along
and mows that thing down,

223
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,516
just rips it off, it's history.

224
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:48,520
It's got no chance of living
after that.

225
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,121
<i>You can't see</i>
<i>the damage done at depth,</i>

226
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:55,757
<i>but if the same was done on land,</i>
<i>you'd be horrified,</i>

227
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,725
If we wanted to catch cows,
for instance,

228
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:01,276
we'd hang a net from a helicopter,

229
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,677
and drag that through the paddock.

230
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,838
We'd not only catch a few cows,

231
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,317
we'd catch the dog, the car,
the farmyard, the barn,

232
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,478
we'd catch the farmer's wife,

233
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:14,480
we'd catch the stuff
that we weren't going for.

234
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:17,559
<i>0'Shea is concerned</i>
<i>about many of the animals</i>

235
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,287
<i>that are being brought up</i>
<i>from the deep,</i>

236
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,438
<i>most of them unintentionally,</i>

237
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,835
<i>He's monitoring</i>
<i>the damage being done</i>

238
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,998
<i>from his lab in New Zealand,</i>

239
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,397
0ne of the most spectacular things

240
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,719
we've received in fisheries'
bi-catch is this large gorgonian.

241
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:37,879
It's like a black coral.
It's closely related,

242
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,277
and this specimen is 700 years old.

243
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,926
So it was 700 years

244
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:46,956
when the net ripped it off the
bottom of the sea. Now it's dead.

245
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,118
When you add up the pieces,

246
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,677
you'd have three metres
in height from the sea floor,

247
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:56,635
and that must be the equivalent
of an underwater forest.

248
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,685
It's tragic that this
should be ripped from the floor.

249
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:09,319
This particular species was very
common between 700 and 1100 metres

250
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,886
off our coast,

251
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:14,357
but like everything,
that is very fragile,

252
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:19,078
and if we put a steel ball over it,
it would be crushed to pieces.

253
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:27,722
<i>0'Shea has a particular</i>
<i>fascination for deep sea squid,</i>

254
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,799
<i>but he's worried</i>
<i>that many are disappearing</i>

255
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,721
<i>before we've even had a chance</i>
<i>to see them alive in the wild,</i>

256
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,878
<i>let alone understand them,</i>

257
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:42,916
This species used to be very common
around New Zealand.

258
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:44,645
It's gone.

259
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,200
The only reason
an animal like this is gone,

260
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,642
is it's so stupid, it's so slow,

261
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,844
it got attacked by a trawler net,

262
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,283
and the trawlers have been going
in the area for so long

263
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,722
that we've made this animal
extinct.

264
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:06,640
<i>With every single dive</i>
<i>to the deep ocean,</i>

265
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,480
<i>scientists are discovering</i>
<i>new species,</i>

266
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:13,242
<i>Some may have properties</i>
<i>that could be invaluable to us,</i>

267
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:19,117
<i>Sponges are animals,</i>
<i>but they're rooted to the bottom</i>

268
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:21,357
<i>and can't get away from something</i>

269
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:24,519
<i>that's trying to eat them</i>
<i>or grow over them,</i>

270
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,643
<i>so they produce chemicals</i>

271
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:30,846
<i>to ward off predators</i>
<i>or other encroaching sponges,</i>

272
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:42,239
<i>It's these chemicals that interest</i>
<i>marine scientists in Florida,</i>

273
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,716
<i>They collect sponges from the deep,</i>

274
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,526
<i>and take them back to the lab</i>
<i>for analysis,</i>

275
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:49,678
The challenge to us

276
00:18:49,847 --> 00:18:52,600
as drug discoverers
and marine biologists

277
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,598
is to figure out

278
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,917
why the organism is producing it,

279
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,840
and then apply that knowledge
to figure out

280
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,601
what might be
an appropriate drug target

281
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,361
for that chemical compound.

282
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,760
<i>Pomponi's team is using chemicals</i>
<i>from the sponges in trials,</i>

283
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:14,966
<i>They believe the chemicals will</i>
<i>prevent the growth of cancer cells</i>

284
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,606
<i>in humans,</i>

285
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,519
Ideally, we want something
that will kill

286
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,678
a certain type of cancer cell,

287
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:27,283
so it will be very specific
for certain types of cancer,

288
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:30,439
and, so far, the results
are very encouraging.

289
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:34,156
So, yes, we think that this will
be useful as a treatment

290
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:36,602
for certain forms of cancer.

291
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:43,041
<i>So far, we've only explored</i>
<i>two per cent of the deep,</i>

292
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:47,041
<i>We could be in danger of losing</i>
<i>a treasure-trove of species,</i>

293
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:50,119
<i>before we've even discovered them,</i>

294

295
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:58,478
that biological diversity
that occurs in the deep ocean,

296
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,160
and it does,

297
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,761
then we lose
that chemical diversity,

298
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:06,158
and we lose the opportunity
to discover new drugs.

299
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:17,917
<i>It's not just the deep that's</i>
<i>in danger, Shallow water habitats</i>

300

<i>like coral reefs</i>

301
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,758
<i>are having a hard time, too,</i>

302
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,402
<i>Part of the problem</i>
<i>is the growing trade in reef fish,</i>

303
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,604
<i>and it's often the market demand</i>
<i>for luxury fish</i>

304
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:37,919
<i>like groupers, coral trout and</i>
<i>wrasse that's behind the problem,</i>

00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:41,397
<i>They're being fished out</i>
<i>at an alarming rate,</i>

306
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:48,679
<i>Fish on coral reefs</i>
<i>that were once a staple food</i>

00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,326
<i>for local people,</i>

308
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:52,876
<i>are now in high demand</i>
<i>as a delicacy</i>

<i>in major cities around the world,</i>

310
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,716
<i>The majority goes to mainland China</i>

<i>It's a huge market</i>

313
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:13,927
<i>and some 30,000 tonnes of reef fish</i>
<i>come into Hong Kong every year,</i>

<i>further and further afield</i>

<i>very fresh,</i>

320
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:37,407
<i>so much so</i>
<i>that the cost of live fish</i>

<i>is ten times</i>
<i>the cost of fresh dead fish,</i>

322

<i>and the fish in the marketplace</i>
<i>are getting smaller and smaller,</i>

<i>Dr Yvonne Sadovy is worried about</i>
<i>the amount of juveniles sold here,</i>

This beautiful animal
is a humphead wrasse,

325
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:59,480
and he's called humphead wrasse
because of his hump on his head.

326
00:21:59,647 --> 00:22:03,560
The other one is the giant grouper.
This is a giant grouper.

327
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:05,638
There's several of them,

328
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:08,038
and these are juveniles.

329
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:10,596
This one is probably
a late teenager,

330
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,600
but still not an old
or well-developed fish,

331
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,725
and the majority
that we see of these species

332
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,718
are young, juvenile fish.

333
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:23,680
<i>Humphead wrasse should be able</i>
<i>to live for more than 20 years,</i>

334
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:25,997
<i>but they rarely reach that age,</i>

335
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,362
<i>They're taken out far too young,</i>

336
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:32,805
If you have fisheries which take
large numbers of juveniles,

337
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:36,118
these animals have not had
a chance to reproduce,

338
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,597
so where's the next generation
going to come from?

339
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,597
If you take too many juveniles,

340
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,758
slowly what happens is

341
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:49,237
you don't get enough adults
in the next generation,

342
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:52,763
and slowly the populations
decline in numbers.

343
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:57,878
So that's what my concern is,

344
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:01,357
that if this is part of a trend -

345
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:05,076
that we're seeing more
and more juveniles being taken -

346
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:08,444
then that does not augur well
for these species.

347
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:12,646
<i>But much more serious than</i>
<i>the possible loss of a few species</i>

348
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>is the loss of an entire habitat,</i>

349
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,206
<i>especially one</i>

350
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:21,406
<i>which supports thousands</i>
<i>upon thousands of species,</i>

351
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:30,439
<i>Coral reefs are the most diverse</i>
<i>communities in our oceans,</i>

352
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,758
<i>Many of them have grown up</i>
<i>over hundreds,</i>

353
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,918
<i>sometimes thousands of years,</i>

354
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:40,046
<i>and over that time, a fantastic</i>
<i>number of animals and plants</i>

355
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:42,118
<i>have evolved with them,</i>

356
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:46,882
<i>The intricate structure</i>
<i>built by the corals themselves</i>

357
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,800
<i>provides protection</i>
<i>from predators,</i>

358
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:54,245
<i>important breeding sites,</i>
<i>and endless feeding opportunities,</i>

359
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,440
<i>But now the coral itself</i>
<i>is under threat</i>

360
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,086
<i>from man,</i>

361
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,556
<i>Today, dynamiting is commonplace,</i>

362
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:42,719
<i>It's an efficient way</i>
<i>to kill the nearby fish,,,</i>

363
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:47,915
<i>but just one blast will completely</i>
<i>flatten a patch of reef,</i>

364
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:53,966
<i>There are lots of other threats</i>
<i>to reef right across the world,</i>

365
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:57,961
<i>Sometimes it's pollution,</i>
<i>they get covered by sediment,</i>

366
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:01,881
<i>and global warming</i>
<i>is certainly playing its part, too,</i>

367
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,158
Here in south-east Asia,

368
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:08,763
80 per cent of reefs
are either in danger of dying,

369
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:10,406
or are dead.

370
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,558
A lot of it's been dynamited,

371
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:16,276
but now a more sinister method
of fishing is being used.

372
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,438
It's fast, it's effective,

373
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:20,598
but it's highly illegal.

374
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:23,486
Fishermen are using
the poison cyanide.

375
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:28,244
<i>Fishermen squirt sodium cyanide</i>
<i>into crevices</i>

376
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,637
<i>where fish take refuge,</i>

377
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:35,997
<i>Cyanide starves the fish of oxygen,</i>
<i>so they come out into the open</i>

378
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,317
<i>dazed and much easier to catch,</i>

379
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,885
<i>Not all these fish are for food,</i>
<i>Many of them</i>

380
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:47,038
<i>are for the aquarium trade,</i>

381
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,198
<i>They're purely a luxury item,</i>

382
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,924
<i>The corals themselves</i>
<i>die in just a few weeks,,,</i>

383
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:02,483
<i>and the whole reef</i>
<i>becomes smothered in algae,</i>

384
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,438
<i>That was a reconstruction,</i>

385
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,484
<i>but this is real life,</i>

386
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:13,765
<i>Members of the International Marine</i>
<i>Alliance in the Philippines</i>

387
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:16,521
<i>are trying to save</i>
<i>their few remaining reefs,</i>

388
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:20,202
<i>They suspect these men</i>
<i>have been fishing illegally,</i>

389
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:23,404
<i>and want to find out</i>
<i>where they've been fishing,</i>

390
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,319
<i>but the fishermen are wary,</i>

391
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,284
They are afraid to tell us
where the places are

392
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:35,564
because there might be
some retaliation

393
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,639
from the other villagers
in this village.

394
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,838
They hide the bottles

395
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,963
underneath the boat,

396
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:48,756
and when...another boat approaches,

397
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,724
they just ditch this

398
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:52,923
so that nobody could see it.

399
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:57,597
<i>These men know</i>
<i>they could end up in jail,</i>

400
00:26:58,087 --> 00:27:01,762
It's so hard to police
the coastal area of the Philippines

401
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:05,124
because it's a very long
coastal area.

402
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:07,278
Also, if you jail them,

403
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,915
you don't have enough room in jail.

404
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,965
<i>We were taken to a jail</i>
<i>on the island of Koron,</i>

405
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,963
<i>These men have been arrested</i>
<i>for illegal fishing,</i>

406
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,118
<i>and they're awaiting trial,</i>

407
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:26,517
<i>They've been locked up for months,</i>

408
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,599
<i>but the trader, the middle man,</i>
<i>is still free,</i>

409
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,682
I don't think we can lump
all the blame on the fishermen,

410
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,838
because first is that, er...

411
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,316
they do not know anything better.

412
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,557
They are afraid of being caught,

413
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:47,561
but they say there's
no other method to catch fish.

414
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,006
<i>When they've been squirted</i>
<i>with cyanide,</i>

415
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,842
<i>fish don't die immediately,</i>
<i>but the damage HAS been done</i>

416
00:27:57,007 --> 00:28:00,044
<i>and their internal organs</i>
<i>gradually pack up,</i>

417
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:02,596
<i>The trader has to move them fast</i>

418
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,520
<i>as they will die</i>
<i>in just a few weeks,</i>

419
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:12,958
<i>Cruise is sure that the importers</i>
<i>know when cyanide has been used</i>

420
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:15,721
<i>because the mortality rate</i>
<i>is so high,</i>

421
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:18,447
<i>but they simply choose</i>
<i>to ignore it,</i>

422
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:21,236
An importer would know immediately

423
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:24,399
that there's something wrong
with his fishes,

424
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:26,558
but they keep on importing

425
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:28,524
from the same exporter

426
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:31,485
in the Philippines
or in other countries.

427
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:35,278
<i>The majority of tropical fish</i>

<i>are exported to America</i>
<i>and to the UK,</i>

430
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:45,599
Fortunately, responsible importers
like the owner of this shop

431
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:49,077
refuse to buy fish
that have been caught by cyanide.

432
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,886
A customer can't tell
how a fish was caught.

433
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:55,835
The responsibility lies with us
to check with the shopkeeper.

434
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>And if you don't,</i>

435
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:00,757

<i>simply chucked overboard,</i>

459
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,606
<i>usually dead,</i>

460
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,482
Modern fisheries
are very destructive.

461
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:54,366
They catch what they're after -
and everything else.

462
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,358
The United Nations tells us

463
00:30:56,527 --> 00:30:59,997
that up to 30 million metric tonnes
a year are caught

464
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,761
and then thrown overboard
dead or dying.

465
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:07,318
That's one quarter to one third of
the annual catch around the world.

466
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:12,683
I'm talking about not just
non-target fish species

467
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:16,442
but turtles, marine mammals,
birds such as albatrosses,

468
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:18,598
even whales on occasion.

00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,718
<i>No matter how magnificent,</i>

<i>in our hunt for food,</i>

472
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,877
<i>But what's even more ridiculous,</i>

473
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:49,642
<i>is that often the fish that</i>
<i>we would eat are thrown away</i>

474
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,879
<i>if the boat is targeting</i>
<i>a different species,</i>

475
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:59,198
<i>And there's one particular fishery</i>
<i>where the waste is phenomenal,</i>

476
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,085
Prawn or shrimp trawling

477
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:04,398
is the most destructive fishery
in the world.

478
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:08,276
Prawn or shrimp trawling
occurs throughout the tropics.

479
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:12,156
The nets are dragged along
the bottom where the shrimp live.

480
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:15,205
Those nets hoover up
everything in their path.

481
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,757
Up to 15 pounds of other species

482
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,406
are discarded

483
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,559
for every one pound of shrimp
that's caught.

484
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:30,842
<i>Worse still are the quantities of</i>
<i>juvenile fish that get thrown away,</i>

485
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:41,676
<i>Hundreds of thousands of tonnes</i>
<i>of young fish</i>

486
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:43,599
<i>are discarded every year,</i>

487
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:45,758
<i>fish that would otherwise grow</i>

488
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:49,203
<i>to become an important</i>
<i>and valuable source of protein,</i>

489
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,880
<i>And all this</i>

490
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:53,515
<i>for just a handful of prawns,</i>

491
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:58,441
<i>The fishermen recognise</i>
<i>the problem and asked for help,</i>

492
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:02,600
<i>so Dr Steve Keneally is looking</i>
<i>at the prawn fishing industry</i>

493
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,201
<i>in New South Wales, Australia,</i>

494
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,323
<i>Here, the industry is huge,</i>

495
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:13,797
<i>They catch over a thousand tonnes</i>
<i>of prawns a year,</i>

496
00:33:20,087 --> 00:33:23,762
<i>Keneally has invented</i>
<i>a bi-catch reduction device -</i>

497
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,486
<i>a B</i>R<i>D -</i>

498
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:29,037
<i>which lets smaller, immature fish</i>
<i>escape from the net,</i>

499
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,722
This cording gets towed along
at the back of the net,

500
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,560
at the back
of the whole operation.

501
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:39,925
The catch that enters a trawl net
ends up at the back of this bag.

502
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:43,045
We did some trials and experiments

503
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:47,678
and found that, at a certain
point where this material changes,

504
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:50,281
you get a back pressure of water,

505
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,325
and by putting
in open square meshes

506
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:57,799
just at that point where that back
pressure of water is occurring,

507
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:02,199
the water will flow up and out
through that square mesh panel.

508
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,244
Little fish inside this net

509
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:06,682
feel that back pressure of water

510
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:08,838
and immediately head upwards

511
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,760
and out through
the open square mesh panel.

512
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:16,677
<i>Keneally is experimenting</i>
<i>with two different nets,</i>

513
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,396
<i>This first one is</i>
<i>a conventional prawn fishing net,</i>

514
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:25,120
0K, this is the catch
from the control cording -

515
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:28,836
that is the conventional cording
without any BRD in it.

516
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:33,159
As you can see, there's quite a lot
of small fish in the catch,

517
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:38,037
and, hopefully, in the other
cording with the BRD installed

518
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,198
there'll be a lot less fish

519
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,881
and still the same quantity
of prawns.

520
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,642
<i>This is the net with his bi-catch</i>
<i>reduction device in it,</i>

521
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:51,597
<i>It's immediately obvious that fewer</i>
<i>fish have been accidentally caught,</i>

522
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:57,681
So that's the difference
in bi-catch.

523
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:00,281
<i>Most of the smaller fish</i>
<i>have escaped,</i>

524
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:03,200
<i>so at least they should have</i>
<i>a chance to breed,</i>

525
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,040
You just have to look
with your own eyes

526
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:07,640
and there's no doubt

527
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:11,959
that there's a 60 per cent
reduction or more in bi-catch.

528
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:16,086
<i>Keneally's device has gone</i>
<i>a long way to reducing the waste,,,</i>

529
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:20,565
<i>but he knows that</i>
<i>it's not the whole answer,</i>

530
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:23,321
I don't think we can ever have
a situation

531
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:26,877
where we only catch the things
we're trying to catch.

532
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,720
With just about
every fishing method,

533
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:34,244
you're going to catch undersized
organisms of the target species.

534
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:39,196
To get to the position
where we don't catch any bi-catch

535
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:40,846
for prawn and shrimp,

536
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,680
I don't think we'll ever get
to that point,

537
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:46,566
at least not
in the foreseeable future.

538
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,406
<i>But there is possibly</i>

539
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,046
<i>another way -</i>

540
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:54,846
<i>one where there may be</i>
<i>no bi-catch at all,</i>

541
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:58,204
<i>It's fish farming or aqua culture,</i>

542
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:01,518
<i>Already it's producing</i>
<i>huge quantities of fish,</i>

543
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:09,041
Could fish farming be the solution?

544
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:13,120
At the moment, one in every
four fish that we eat is farmed,

545
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:17,360
but over the next 25 years,
it's thought that figure will double

546
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,200
so that half the fish
we eat will be farmed.

547
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:24,201
So is this the answer? Can we
really protect our fish stocks,

548
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:27,279
the juveniles,
the fragile marine habitats?

549
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:30,996
Is fish farming the solution
to all our fishing problems?

550
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:37,925
<i>If aqua culture is one of</i>
<i>the answers, then surely the people</i>

551
00:36:38,087 --> 00:36:41,716
<i>with the highest incentive</i>
<i>to get it right are the Japanese,</i>

552
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:45,084
<i>They're already very advanced</i>
<i>in farming fish,</i>

553
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:49,763
<i>They're even trying to raise</i>
<i>large predatory fish like tuna,</i>

554
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,077
<i>and in particular, blue fin tuna,</i>

555
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,042
Here in Koshimoto in western Japan,

556
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:56,879
they're going for broke.

557
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:01,479
<i>Swimming around beneath me</i>
<i>in this enclosure,</i>

558
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:04,161
<i>there are 50 fully mature</i>
<i>blue fin tuna,</i>

559
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,477
<i>These tuna were caught in the wild</i>

560
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:12,845
<i>and are now being fattened up</i>
<i>for market, They're fed generously</i>

561
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:16,556
<i>so they'll be in prime adult</i>
<i>condition when they're sold,</i>

562
00:37:18,727 --> 00:37:21,958
<i>Here they've taken tuna farming</i>
<i>to the next stage,</i>

563
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:24,083
<i>They're not just holding them,</i>

564
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:26,442
<i>they're breeding these blue fins,</i>

565
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:30,725
<i>They hope that these fish</i>
<i>will breed in three years' time,</i>

566
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:34,846
<i>and so complete</i>
<i>the whole life cycle in captivity,</i>

567
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:37,237
<i>Then, they won't have to take</i>

568
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:40,444
<i>any more blue fin tuna</i>
<i>from our oceans,</i>

569
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:50,037
(INTERPRETER) Japan is the largest
tuna consuming nation in the world.

570
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:56,002
And we're also very concerned
about diminishing stocks

571
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,158
of blue fin tuna in the wild.

572
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:04,757
<i>Aqua culture has its own set</i>
<i>of well-known problems,</i>

573
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,724
<i>Most worrying are pollution</i>

574
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:10,084
<i>and the mixing of captive-bred fish</i>
<i>with wild stocks,</i>

575
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,884
<i>But there's another issue,</i>

576
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:20,159
<i>These tuna are fed a staggering</i>
<i>amount of fish every day,</i>

577
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,600
<i>They're being fed valuable protein</i>

578
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:28,555
<i>which should be food</i>
<i>for the poorer people of Asia,,,</i>

579
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:33,086
<i>so now the Japanese are trying</i>
<i>to develop a substitute feed</i>

580
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:36,762
<i>either from vegetable matter</i>
<i>or from animal products,</i>

581
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:38,406
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

582
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,798
(INTERPRETER) And we hope
further development

583
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:46,245
will enable us to use
more artificial feed in the future.

584
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,476
<i>But they haven't succeeded yet,</i>

585
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:58,879
<i>and they still take huge quantities</i>
<i>of low value fish</i>

586
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:02,084
<i>to feed one big luxury fish,</i>

587
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:08,884
<i>In other parts of Asia</i>
<i>which are poorer than Japan</i>

588
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,800
<i>and where fish stocks</i>
<i>are heavily depleted,</i>

589
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,527
<i>they are also turning</i>
<i>to aqua culture,</i>

590
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,079
<i>And tiger prawns</i>
<i>are the biggest money earner,</i>

591
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:26,956
<i>More than half a million tonnes</i>
<i>of prawns are produced a year,</i>

592
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:29,561
<i>nearly all of which are exported,</i>

593
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:32,799
<i>It's big business</i>
<i>and it employs a lot of people,</i>

594
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:38,157
<i>But just like tuna,</i>
<i>the prawns are carnivorous</i>

595
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:42,206
<i>and need to eat fish - fish</i>
<i>that have been ground into pellets,</i>

596
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:45,757
<i>When they're farmed</i>
<i>as intensively as they are here,</i>

597
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,283
<i>they need a lot of feed,</i>

598
00:39:48,447 --> 00:39:49,926
If you have, er...

599
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:55,081
three square metres of pond for
one tiger prawn, that's extensive -

600
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:57,238
nature will feed the prawn -

601
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,716
but if you have 30 of them

602
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,923
in one square metre,

603
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:04,760
then you have to provide
some kind of food.

604
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:08,556
I think the latest figures
are about two -

605
00:40:08,727 --> 00:40:10,718
two kilos of fish -

606
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,479
to produce

607
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:14,603
one kilo of prawn.

608
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,882
<i>Substitute feeds may help,</i>
<i>but they could come too late,</i>

609
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:23,483
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>low value fish are fed to prawns</i>

610
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:26,161
<i>which are then exported</i>
<i>to the West,</i>

611
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:29,080
<i>These fish should be feeding</i>
<i>local people,</i>

612
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,680
It's the...

613
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,997
little fish that's there

614
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:39,719
that's being bought by...people,
by Filipino families for their food,

615
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:43,197
by low income families
and middle income families,

616
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:45,517
that will not be available
to these families.

617
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,598
<i>But there's another issue,</i>

618
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:54,601
<i>Thousands of intensive farms</i>
<i>have been built in coastal areas,</i>

619
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:58,476
<i>destroying a valuable marine</i>
<i>habitat - mangrove forests,</i>

620
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:03,403
<i>Mile upon mile of mangroves</i>

621
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,603
<i>have been cut down,</i>

622
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:12,320
<i>The coastline has been stripped</i>
<i>of its natural protection,</i>

623
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:17,924
<i>And there are many important</i>
<i>ecological reasons why mangroves</i>

624
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,078
<i>should be protected,</i>

625
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:23,922
To many people, mangroves
are just a mass of gnarled roots

626
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:28,000
where the bottom is sludgy,
and the air is full of mosquitoes,

627
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,680
but get underwater,

628
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:31,917
and it's a very different world.

629
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:44,041
<i>The intricate root system provides</i>
<i>a natural nursery for young fish,</i>

630
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:47,961
<i>They spend their later life</i>
<i>on coral reefs or in the open sea,</i>

631
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:51,039
<i>The roots provide protection</i>
<i>from predators</i>

632
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:54,324
<i>which is vital</i>
<i>for small, vulnerable fish,</i>

633
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:00,004
<i>In the shelter of mangroves,</i>

634
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,159
<i>fish can feed and grow</i>
<i>in relative safety,</i>

635
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:10,478
<i>Again, it's the habitat</i>
<i>that's under threat,</i>

636
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:12,126
<i>We're destroying it</i>

637
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:15,962
<i>without a thought for the animals</i>
<i>that depend on it,</i>

638
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:23,486
<i>Perhaps the answer might be</i>
<i>to set aside some areas of the sea</i>

639
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:27,435
<i>so that the animals that live there</i>
<i>have a chance,</i>

640
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:31,196
<i>When land animals need protecting,</i>

641
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,676
<i>we usually do something about it -</i>

642
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:37,396
the huge game reserves in Africa
are a classic example -

643
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:41,162
but for some reason,
we treat our seas very differently.

644
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:45,081
This is the island of Skomer,
a very beautiful reserve

645
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:47,602
that offers excellent protection

646
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:50,201
for the birds and plants
that live here.

647
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,279
It also calls itself
a marine nature reserve,

648
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,881
one of only two
in the whole of Britain.

649
00:42:56,327 --> 00:43:00,081
You'd think a marine reserve
would offer total protection

650
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,044
for all life under the sea,

651
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,357
but amazingly, you can fish here.

652
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:07,405
Even commercial fishermen
can operate here.

653
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,157
<i>In the time of our grandfathers,</i>

654
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:15,878
<i>there were natural marine reserves,</i>
<i>inaccessible to fishing fleets,</i>

655
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:19,437
<i>There, the fish could grow</i>
<i>to maturity undisturbed,</i>

656
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:21,996
<i>But with modern fishing technology,</i>

657
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:25,239
<i>there's practically nowhere</i>
<i>we now can't fish,</i>

658
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:28,205
<i>0nly a tiny percentage of the ocean</i>

659
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,164
<i>is a safe sanctuary,</i>

660
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:34,996
Something like one third
of one per cent of the oceans

661
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:37,596
are within marine-protected areas.

662
00:43:37,767 --> 00:43:39,758
That's a very tiny fraction

663
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:44,000
and it's equivalent to something
like the size of South Africa.

664
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:49,002
However, we're not protecting those
areas well enough at the moment,

665
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,158
and only something like

666
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:54,319
one ten thousandth of the surface
of the oceans

667
00:43:54,487 --> 00:43:57,001
is protected
from all forms of fishing.

668
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:01,604
That's equivalent to the size of
Holland and it isn't nearly enough.

669
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:06,601
R<i>oberts wants areas set aside</i>
<i>which are T0TALLYprotected,</i>

670
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:10,478
<i>There are some small areas</i>
<i>where they've done this</i>

671
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:14,606
<i>like this reserve off</i>
<i>the north island of New Zealand,</i>

672
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,441
<i>Since fishing stopped 25 years ago,</i>
<i>the stocks have recovered</i>

673
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:23,644
<i>and the water is now teeming</i>
<i>with fish,</i>

674
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:33,638
<i>And it's not just fish -</i>
<i>everything's doing well,</i>

675
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,684
<i>Lobsters are abundant again,</i>

676
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,997
<i>and they're getting a lot bigger,</i>

677
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,601
<i>Scientists monitor stocks carefully</i>

678
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:45,999
<i>and keep a close eye on how all the</i>
<i>animals in the reserve are doing,</i>

679
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,476
<i>This five-kilometre-wide reserve</i>

680
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:50,877
<i>produces the same number</i>
<i>of lobsters</i>

681
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:54,437
<i>as a 100-kilometre stretch</i>
<i>of unprotected coastline,</i>

682
00:44:56,487 --> 00:45:00,196
<i>Fishermen are allowed to fish</i>
<i>right up to the boundaries,</i>

683
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,677
<i>The lobsters are now so abundant</i>
<i>within the reserve</i>

684
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:05,758
<i>that they spread out</i>

685
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:07,918
<i>into the surrounding waters,</i>

686
00:45:08,087 --> 00:45:12,205
(R0BERTS) So what these
no-take zones provide to fisheries

687
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:16,402
is an increase in the replenishment
to their fisheries.

688
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:20,560
The spawning stocks are
like deposits in a bank account.

689
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,480
<i>Even the behaviour of the fish</i>
<i>has changed,</i>

690
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:31,163
<i>0nce scared of man, the fish</i>
<i>are perhaps a little over-friendlyI</i>

691
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:39,120
R<i>oberts believes that between</i>
<i>ten and 20 per cent of our oceans</i>

692
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,357
<i>should become no-take zones,</i>

693
00:45:41,527 --> 00:45:43,961
<i>and that we should protect</i>
<i>large areas</i>

694
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:46,118
<i>of different marine habitats -</i>

695
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:48,721
<i>the deep sea, coral reefs,</i>
<i>mangroves,</i>

696
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:51,082
<i>as well as key spawning grounds,</i>

697
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:54,603
<i>That way, fish can grow bigger</i>
<i>and older</i>

698
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,758
<i>and stocks will recover,</i>

699
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,926
<i>He also believes</i>

700
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:06,239
<i>that migration routes and feeding</i>
<i>grounds should be protected,</i>

701
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:10,480
<i>particularly the routes taken</i>
<i>by the largest marine animals -</i>

702
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:15,003
<i>the whales -</i>
<i>as they circumnavigate the globe,</i>

703
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:25,206
<i>It's a simple idea,</i>

704
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,916
<i>and one that</i> R<i>oberts believes,</i>
<i>with the public's help,</i>

705
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,725
<i>is possible,</i>

706
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,447
0nce people realise
what's going on,

707
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:36,121
and they begin
to bring to bear pressure

708
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,960
on the politicians
and decision-makers,

709
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:42,563
we'll see moves taking place
to establish the areas

710
00:46:42,727 --> 00:46:45,287
that we need to set aside
from fishing.

711
00:46:47,687 --> 00:46:50,599
<i>We CAN make that choice,</i>
<i>We've done it before -</i>

712
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:54,237
<i>we brought back the great whales</i>
<i>from near extinction,</i>

713
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:58,161
Most of them can live free
from the threat of a whaling boat -

714
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:01,000
but it took
international co-operation,

715
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:04,318
and that only came about
once the public realised

716
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:07,604
how close the whales were
to being wiped out.

717
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:17,557
<i>Whaling was a huge industry</i>

718
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:19,763
<i>right up until the 1970s,</i>

719
00:47:20,927 --> 00:47:24,158
<i>Some species nearly disappeared</i>
<i>from our oceans,,,</i>

720
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,806
<i>altogether,</i>

721
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:28,758
<i>We recognised this just in time,</i>

722
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:30,918
<i>so we did something about it,</i>

723
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:41,799
<i>We do now know what's happening</i>
<i>in our oceans,</i>

724
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:45,198
We know they're in trouble
and that we're to blame.

725
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:46,846
We can't hide

726
00:47:47,007 --> 00:47:50,397
behind an out of sight,
out of mind attitude any more.

727
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,558
We know what's down there -

728
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,161
the extraordinary diversity
of life.

729
00:47:55,327 --> 00:47:57,318
0ur oceans are S0 precious,

730
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,478
so vital to the planet.

731
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,683
If we care about that,

732
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:04,520
then, surely,
we can look after them.
