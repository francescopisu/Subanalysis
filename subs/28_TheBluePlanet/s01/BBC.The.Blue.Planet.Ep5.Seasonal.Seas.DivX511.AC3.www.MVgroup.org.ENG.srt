1
00:00:34,287 --> 00:00:38,883
There are some seas
where fish swarm in millions...

2
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:45,357
..and plankton blossoms
in vast clouds.

3
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:52,480
The sheer quantity of life here is
unmatched anywhere in the oceans.

4
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:03,322
These are the most productive seas
on Earth.

5
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:11,360
They are the Seasonal Seas.

6
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:17,803
The Seasonal Seas border
the temperate zones,

7
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:21,164
where conditions change
through the year.

8
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:32,926
The seasons also affect
the underwater world.

9
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,762
The power of the sun
is constantly changing.

10
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,481
in the far north,
during the summer,

11
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,081
there are long hours of sunlight,

12
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:52,526
but in winter, that dwindles,
and there can be weeks of darkness.

13
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,520
The summers are warm and gentle,

14
00:01:56,687 --> 00:02:00,726
the winters
racked by savage storms.

15
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,563
in conditions like this,
life of any sort

16
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:00,719
has to struggle to survive.

17
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:09,758
january on Sable island
off the coast of Nova Scotia.

18
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:12,600
Grey seals
have managed to get ashore

19
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,201
through the crashing breakers.

20
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:27,638
Gales here can blow
for days on end.

21
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:50,597
Sable island has the world's
largest colony of grey seals.

22
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,839
100,000 come here
to breed each year,

23
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:57,158
just when the weather
is at its worst.

24
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:05,166
To add insult to injury,

25
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:10,447
the pups, having suckled for
only 18 days, are then abandoned.

26
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:15,158
Their mothers must return to
the sea to find food for themselves.

27
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:22,243
As yet unable to dive,
the pups are marooned,

28
00:04:22,407 --> 00:04:25,319
sustained only
by their fatty blubber.

29
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:31,838
it will be five weeks before
they are strong enough to swim,

30
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:38,196
but then it will be spring and
the ocean will be teeming with food.

31
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:56,802
By May, spring has reached
the coasts of Scotland.

32
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:02,437
Underwater, it arrived
rather earlier.

33
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:05,280
in March,
the seas had warmed enough

34
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:08,564
to trigger
a magical transformation.

35
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,678
These are phytoplankton -

36
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:27,125
tiny floating algae,
each much smaller than a pinhead.

37
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,755
They multiply with amazing speed

38
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:35,081
to produce more annual growth
than all the plants on land together -

39
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,522
six billion tonnes of it.

40
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:44,156
This immense bloom spreads
across the face of the ocean

41
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,602
and, within a couple of months,

42
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:50,601
turns vast areas of it
a dense green.

43
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,963
Animal life
reacts to the blooming sea.

44
00:05:57,127 --> 00:06:02,076
These look like small anemones,
but they're about to change.

45
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:07,958
They separate, revealing themselves
to be tiny common jellyfish.

46
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:15,045
They are less
than three millimetres across.

47
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:24,004
Within a few months, they will
have assembled into vast swarms.

48
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:32,598
Minute copepods
are part of their staple diet.

49
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,565
These appear every spring
in vast numbers

50
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:39,606
and graze
on the phytoplankton bloom.

51
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:46,118
Their beating legs create currents
that sweep the little algae

52
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,006
into the filters
round their mouths.

53
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:57,360
0n this microscopic scale,
water is so viscous

54
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:01,725
that the phytoplankton
can't swim against the current.

55
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:06,800
Whilst feeding,
sensors on the copepod's antennae

56
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,356
give warning of dangers ahead.

57
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,404
Lighting by lasers

58
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,560
reveals that feeding copepods
leave wakes behind them,

59
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,718
like jet trails in the sky.

60
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,562
Slightly larger floating predators

61
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:47,357
are able to use these trails
to find their prey.

62
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:05,958
A close call, but some predators
are simply too large to avoid.

63
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,286
jellyfish.

64
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:23,163
They may appear to be delicate
as well as beautiful,

65
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,682
but they are deadly hunters.

66
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,046
With every pulse
of the delicate bells,

67
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:09,166
plankton-rich water is drawn
into their lacy throats

68
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:15,118
and pushed out again, leaving
copepods stuck to the membranes.

69
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:28,047
A single sea-nettle jellyfish,
only a few centimetres across,

70
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,995
can collect thousands
of copepods in a day.

71
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:48,167
So, the killing power of giants
like these is hard to estimate.

72
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,516
Each of these jellyfish
weighs up to 30 kilos

73
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:02,398
and has tentacles
stretching over eight metres.

74
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:08,242
But there are even greater dangers
awaiting the copepods.

75
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:13,923
By late spring, the baby
common jellyfish are fully grown.

76
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:18,277
They gather in millions,

77
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:22,076
forming swarms
hundreds of metres long,

78
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:26,405
which filter out all the small
planktonic animals in their path.

79
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:18,277
Nevertheless, there are such
astronomic numbers of copepods

80
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:22,998
that enough will survive
to form swarms of their own.

81
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,600
A basking shark.

82
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:46,126
This huge eight-tonne fish
feeds on plankton and nothing else.

83
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:51,680
Every hour it filters 1,000 tonnes
of seawater through its gills.

84
00:11:56,127 --> 00:12:00,882
Numbers of these shark appear
when the bloom is at its peak

85
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:05,484
and travel along currents
where the plankton is thickest.

86
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:11,646
Even so, the supply of plankton
is so abundant

87
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:14,924
that another group of animals
can feast -

88
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,885
animals that live on the sea floor.

89
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:26,995
Every centimetre of rock is covered
with invertebrates of some kind -

90
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,239
anemones, sea squirts, gorgonians -

91
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:34,366
all trapping plankton
from the passing water.

92
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:19,684
Not all life in the Seasonal Seas
depends upon plankton.

93
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:23,522
it is early spring
in British Columbia.

94
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:29,282
Seaweed has started to grow slowly
in the cold water.

95
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:34,480
As the hours of sunlight increase
and the water warms,

96
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,686
these small plants turn into
great beds of bull kelp.

97
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,278
The immense 30-metre long strands

98
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:54,406
have small gas-filled floats
which keep them high in the water,

99
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,639
within reach
of the energy-giving sunlight.

100
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:10,645
Further south,
the sunshine is more powerful,

101
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,719
so here,
on the coast of California,

102
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,560
the biggest kelp of all can grow.

103
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,402
This is giant kelp,
and by midsummer,

104
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:27,880
each plant is growing in length
by nearly a metre a day.

105
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:39,118
The main stem is fixed
to the bottom 35 metres below

106
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:43,883
by a small
but immensely strong holdfast.

107
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:47,245
Fully grown,

108
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:52,037
these gigantic plants
are 100 metres long

109
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:54,846
and they form vast marine forests.

110
00:14:56,287 --> 00:15:00,166
Great schools of fish
find sanctuary here.

111
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:09,637
These are blacksmith fish.

112
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:14,323
They are plankton feeders
and, whenever it seems safe,

113
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:19,356
they head into open water to feed
where the plankton is thickest.

114
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,758
But at the first hint of danger...

115
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,996
..they rush back to the safety
of the forest.

116
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:38,563
Fish are not the only creatures
that shelter here.

117
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:47,324
Californian sea otters
gather in the kelp forest

118
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,524
to rest and snooze in safety.

119
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,325
To prevent themselves
being carried away

120
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,400
into dangerous open water
where the big predators cruise,

121
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:04,402
they anchor themselves by winding
straps of kelp around their body.

122
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:13,722
Sooner or later,
they have to find food,

123
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:17,675
and that lies on the seabed
a long way below them.

124
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:21,965
Sea otters, however, can stay
underwater for up to ten minutes,

125
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:26,120
ample time to find
the shellfish they need.

126
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,716
Many of the smaller creatures
that live in these forests,

127
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,037
such as urchins, graze on the kelp

128
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:05,166
and can seriously damage it
if their numbers are unchecked.

129
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:08,239
The sea otters
feed on some of these grazers

130
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,205
and prevent them
getting too numerous.

131
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:16,805
So, in effect, the sea otters
are the guardians of the forest.

132
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:24,563
Garibaldi fish do not,
in fact, damage the kelp.

133
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:26,797
if anything, they help it

134
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:31,438
by picking off tiny animals
that encrust the leaves.

135
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,283
They graze on bryozoans,
tiny colonial animals

136
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:41,915
which build their colonies

137
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:46,205
like a patchwork of white skins
on the leaves.

138
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,877
When night falls, there are
fewer predatory fish around,

139
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,245
and the bryozoans emerge
from their white shelters.

140
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:14,078
Now, just like coral polyps,

141
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:18,479
they start filtering out the
plankton under cover of darkness.

142
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:28,042
They're not the only animals
to venture out at this time.

143
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:36,556
This is an amphipod,
just two centimetres long,

144
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,605
and it does eat kelp.

145
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,805
in turn,

146
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:49,482
it is excellent food
for many predators.

147
00:18:55,807 --> 00:19:00,323
To protect itself, it produces
silk, just like a spider,

148
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:04,765
and uses it to sew together
two sides of a kelp frond

149
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,804
and so form a shelter.

150
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,761
This one is in particular need
of a secure home.

151
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:19,918
She's a mother.

152
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,922
There are over 50 youngsters
clustered on her abdomen,

153
00:19:28,087 --> 00:19:31,443
so her home is becoming
somewhat cramped.

154
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,120
They will soon
be old enough to leave,

155
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:38,006
and, whenever she can,
she kicks them out

156
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,522
to get a taste of the outside world.

157
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,485
Dawn.

158
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,599
Beds of eel grass
grow in the shallows

159
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,077
between the kelp forest
and the shore.

160
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:03,317
A harbour seal
has found sanctuary here,

161
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:07,605
and is sleeping
after a hard night's foraging.

162
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,041
But not for long.

163
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,806
A male seal gives a wake-up call.

164
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:26,442
More seals are attracted
from all directions.

165
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:38,083
it's june, the time
when young male harbour seals

166
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:40,761
start their strange
mating displays.

167
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:48,806
0ne listens attentively to the
grunting noises made by the other.

168
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:56,202
These calls are almost certainly
a way of establishing

169
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,562
which of the two will be dominant.

170
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,882
But if the animals are closely
matched in size and experience,

171
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:11,117
grunts won't settle the issue.

172
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:14,324
The rivals
will have to come to blows.

173
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:22,237
And seals can be
surprisingly violent.

174
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,198
in a month's time,

175
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:40,202
the breeding season will start
and then fights will be in earnest,

176
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,155
but now, in midsummer,
these exchanges are harmless.

177
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:46,079
They're just playing.

178
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,044
Many of the creatures
that shelter in the kelp

179
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,596
have to venture out
in order to feed.

180
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,484
The bat ray for one.

181
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,437
Unlikely though it seems,

182
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,598
the sandy floor of the open sea

183
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,520
is, for the bat ray,
a rich feeding ground.

184
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:26,124
There is food
hidden within the sand,

185
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:29,916
and the bat ray has
a special technique for finding it.

186
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:37,160
it uses jets of water

187
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:42,720
to blow the sand aside
and expose small invertebrates.

188
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:50,161
A kelp bass hangs about alongside
waiting for scraps.

189
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,599
0ther hunters
are also on the prowl.

190
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,002
The fan-tailed sole.

191
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:33,444
There are mantid shrimps here,
living in tunnels.

192
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:41,558
But, once again, hunger compels
them to venture into the open.

193
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:44,480
That, of course, is a gamble.

194
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:49,363
They will either eat...

195
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,078
..or be eaten.

196
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:03,361
A sea slug called janolus.

197
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:07,361
its colours suggest
that it is poisonous,

198
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:12,647
and so it is, to everything
except another kind of sea slug...

199
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:20,764
..the predatory Navanax.

200
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:28,201
Navanax pulls itself
along the trail of slime

201
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,961
that janolus leaves behind it.

202
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:49,520
0nce caught,
janolus rolls into a ball.

203
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:58,241
All Navanax gets
is a few yellow tentacles.

204
00:25:03,647 --> 00:25:07,845
And janolus is swept to safety
by the current.

205
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:20,040
it's now midsummer, and the sun is
shining at full strength.

206
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:25,642
The increasing warmth is the cue

207
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:29,720
for an Atlantic lobster
to start on a long journey.

208
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:34,563
She's spent the winter 250 metres down,
far beyond the reach of the storms.

209
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:41,765
But it was cold down there and now
she needs to find warmer water,

210
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:45,317
so she's marching
towards the shallows.

211
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:48,957
They, however,
are 150 kilometres away.

212
00:25:55,007 --> 00:26:00,684
After a month of walking, she arrives
at her favoured sand bank.

213
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:04,162
But she is not the first here.

214
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:09,117
Dozens of other lobsters
have already dug homes in the sand

215
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:13,326
and they don't intend
to surrender them to newcomers.

216
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,882
Size counts for everything
in these battles.

217
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:51,277
The new arrival
is in need of a pit,

218
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:57,795
and since she weighs a hefty seven
kilos, she'll probably get one.

219
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,758
She has won.

220
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:21,638
These battles continue
for the next two months,

221
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,445
and they are crucial,

222
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:27,839
for the females must have shelter
and warm water to raise young.

223
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:29,599
For the last seven months,

224
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:33,680
each female has been carrying
about 20,000 fertilised eggs,

225
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:37,920
but their task
is approaching its end.

226
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:42,444
The warmth of the shallows
is speeding the eggs' development.

227
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:49,406
Two more months
and the eggs are ready to hatch.

228
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:10,515
At first, they're not very good
at swimming.

229
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,757
But within a few minutes,

230
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:17,079
the babies are able to set off
in a purposeful way.

231
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:24,005
At this time of the year,
the sea is full of larval animals.

232
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,965
This one is a day old lobster.

233
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:31,165
And this - a three-week-old crab -

234
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:35,366
just ready to start its life
on the sea floor.

235
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:40,281
its feet touch the bottom
for the first time.

236
00:28:43,527 --> 00:28:48,920
At this stage, it's a vegetarian
with a taste for sea lettuce.

237
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,885
As it grows,
it will repeatedly moult

238
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:55,119
and expand into a bigger,
thicker skin.

239
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:57,755
The chances are it will be eaten,

240
00:28:57,927 --> 00:29:03,081
but if it survives for five years,
it will become an armoured giant.

241
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:12,755
Now it eats meat,

242
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:17,443
and special adaptations
enable it to hunt in the dark.

243
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:24,038
its jointed feet
are covered in sensors

244
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:29,486
which detect the slightest chemical
change in its surroundings.

245
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:32,605
As it walks through the darkness,

246
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:36,555
its feet can, literally,
taste the sand.

247
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:41,235
As soon as it finds suitable food,

248
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:45,036
it passes it forward
to its powerful crushing claws,

249
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:48,040
which make light work
of the soft flesh.

250
00:29:48,207 --> 00:29:51,882
And those claws are also
very useful for defence.

251
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:02,606
A one and a half metre long
common octopus glides by.

252
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:11,001
The jet-propelled giant
is both powerful and very clever.

253
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:22,881
With octopus about, it's risky
for even a crab to be in the open.

254
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:26,198
Even in the dark,
the octopus's eyes are sensitive

255
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,164
to the slightest movement.

256
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:43,520
Against a hunter like this,
the crab's claws are useless.

257
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:55,085
Late summer in South East Alaska.

258
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,442
The water is still warming,

259
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:06,679
and mysid shrimp
swarm near the surface.

260
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:15,438
it's a final feast
for Pacific salmon

261
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,805
returning to the coast
from the open Pacific.

262
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:31,444
They are heading inshore to breed
and they arrive in huge numbers.

263
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:36,283
They have to swim
far up the rivers to spawn,

264
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:39,917
but this river's level
is still too low.

265
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:43,915
They'll have to wait
till rain causes it to rise.

266
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,599
For now, they are trapped
in the sea, close to the shore,

267
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,485
the worst place to be.

268
00:31:52,847 --> 00:31:55,281
A three metre long salmon shark,

269
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:59,520
a close relation
of the great white.

270
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:05,319
This one has sensed

271
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,763
minute electrical signals
from the salmon nearby.

272
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,237
Shark can maintain
their blood temperature

273
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:15,877
at a higher level
than the surrounding water.

274
00:32:16,047 --> 00:32:20,723
And that means they have the energy
to be quick.

275
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:28,084
Quicker than salmon.

276
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:53,755
Early autumn in Vancouver island
in Canada, 600 miles to the south.

277
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:57,681
The ocean temperature
is slowly dropping.

278
00:32:57,847 --> 00:33:00,042
40 metres below the surface,

279
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:05,600
this year's baby herring feed
on the last of the summer plankton.

280
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:10,761
Their movements attract attention
from the skies above.

281
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:20,245
Gulls can't dive,

282
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:24,241
so for now,
the fish are still safe.

283
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:29,685
But there are birds which CAN dive.

284
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:37,760
Auklets and murres swim with ease
down beneath the school.

285
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:42,318
The panicked herring are forced
towards the surface.

286
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:56,316
They gather into a giant
defensive ball of swirling fish.

287
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:01,445
The commotion attracts
yellowtail rockfish.

288
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:06,360
They, too, are hunters.

289
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:17,962
The marauding fish
scatter the herring.

290
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:31,877
Repeated attacks split the ball
into numerous smaller groups.

291
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,958
Now, it's easier for the divers

292
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:43,676
to keep the confused fish
penned at the surface.

293
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:46,077
Even the gulls can get at them.

294
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:08,962
Attacked from all sides, the little
fish have virtually no chance.

295
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:13,803
More and more divers
are attracted to the scene.

296
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:20,798
They harry the shrinking numbers
of herring

297
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,879
right down
to the very last individual.

298
00:35:40,127 --> 00:35:43,722
Far bigger predators
cruise here, too.

299
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,963
Pacific white-sided dolphin.

300
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:54,482
But the dolphin
are mainly nocturnal hunters.

301
00:35:54,647 --> 00:35:57,798
During the day,
they concentrate on socialising.

302
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:02,802
They display by releasing streams
of bubbles

303
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:05,162
and they play games.

304
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:11,556
Games like pass the seaweed,
for example.

305
00:36:44,687 --> 00:36:49,238
Exactly eight months ago,
in the winter off Western Scotland,

306
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:54,561
an egg was laid and securely fixed
to a strand of kelp.

307
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:58,800
inside, a tiny embryo
started to develop.

308
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:09,486
Protected by the tough egg case,

309
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:13,162
it endured
the worst of the winter storms.

310
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:24,040
By summer, it was half-grown.

311
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:41,166
Now, at last, in late autumn,
it's nearly ready to hatch.

312
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:52,364
A fully-formed miniature shark
swims free.

313
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:55,325
This year's plankton will soon die,

314
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,955
but the dogfish is so well developed

315
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:01,563
that it can hunt immediately
for larger prey.

316
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,200
The days are getting shorter now.

317
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:12,319
in British Columbia,
the water begins to chill.

318
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:16,844
This bizarre-looking creature
is searching the kelp for food.

319
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:22,685
This is Melibe -
the hooded sea slug.

320
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:30,364
it catches plankton
with its net-like head.

321
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:43,036
As winter approaches,
plankton is becoming scarce,

322
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:47,200
but Melibe
is an assiduous searcher.

323
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,077
it can swim.

324
00:38:57,047 --> 00:39:00,198
it flaps away to look
for a better feeding spot,

325
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:04,042
but its search is becoming
increasingly difficult.

326
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:09,122
Within the next two weeks, most of
the plankton will have disappeared.

327
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:20,245
As the sunlight
becomes ever more feeble,

328
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:25,718
the kelp starts to die,
gradually rotting away to nothing.

329
00:39:58,447 --> 00:40:00,597
Soon, it will be winter.

330
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:10,520
But 9,000 miles to the south,
the sun is rising on a new spring day.

331
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:15,807
The southern hemisphere, too,
has temperate regions.

332
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:20,040
And now the plankton is beginning
to bloom around Tasmania.

333
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,279
just as in the north,

334
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:28,282
the Southern Seasonal Seas
have areas of rich green water...

335
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:32,762
..with their own kelp forests...

336
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:37,926
..and their own swarms of plankton.

337
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:47,761
Some of the inhabitants
of these seas

338
00:40:47,927 --> 00:40:50,600
live only
in the southern hemisphere.

339
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:54,077
This is one of them -
the handfish -

340
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:58,479
that strolls around
on modified fins.

341
00:41:01,287 --> 00:41:06,156
But, when needs must,
it can resort to tail power.

342
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:14,845
Every summer, visitors come
to the shallows around Tasmania.

343
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:19,717
These are Australian squid,
about half a metre long.

344
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:25,002
They are here to breed.

345
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:34,604
The larger males compete
for the attentions of a female,

346
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:37,600
displaying towards her
and to one another,

347
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:42,283
by putting on a ballet,
continually changing costume colour.

348
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,759
Eventually,

349
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:15,282
they form pairs.

350
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:24,879
A male passes a packet of sperm
across to the female.

351
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:31,605
After the eggs
have been fertilised,

352
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:35,806
they are deposited
in tough, rubbery egg cases

353
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:39,357
that other creatures find poisonous.

354
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:45,238
Within three weeks,
the babies are ready to hatch out.

355
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:54,039
They are already
able to change colour,

356
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:56,721
but aren't so good at swimming.

357
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:19,006
There is another animal here
that is a rather more devoted parent.

358
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,683
This is a male leafy sea dragon,

359
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:27,601
an exquisitely-decorated relative
of the sea horse.

360
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:33,444
He is carrying his partner's eggs
around with him.

361
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:37,839
They would be a nutritious snack
for any predator that found them.

362
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:41,761
But that's not easy
because the eggs are attached

363
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:45,681
to their father's
perfectly-camouflaged body.

364
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:49,317
They could scarcely be
in a safer place.

365
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:18,205
By November,
10,000 miles to the north,

366
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,597
winter has arrived.

367
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:24,726
Norway now gets less than
five hours of daylight in every 24.

368
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:27,765
The temperature is falling rapidly.

369
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:34,519
But, despite the cold,
the sea is far from deserted.

370
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,646
Every winter, 500 million tonnes
of adult herring

371
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:41,765
seek shelter in these deep waters.

372
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:47,159
They will stay here
for four months,

373
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:50,364
living entirely
on the fat they accumulated

374
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:53,246
during the summer feasts
of plankton.

375
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:55,682
But they are not alone.

376
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:58,725
0rca.

377
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:04,086
This pod is part of a population
of some 500 killer whales

378
00:45:04,247 --> 00:45:08,479
that specialise in hunting
North Atlantic herring.

379
00:45:10,247 --> 00:45:12,317
(WHALE S0NG)

380
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:25,479
Using their echo location,
they have detected a shoal of herring

381
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:27,717
50 metres below them.

382
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:31,163
With enough air
for a ten-minute dive,

383
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,160
they swim deep below the herring

384
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:36,522
and drive the fish upwards.

385
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:44,639
Bubbles stream from the rising fish

386
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:49,323
as gas in their swim bladders
expands and escapes.

387
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:59,324
Even an orca finds it difficult
to catch a healthy herring.

388
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:03,639
But they have a devastating weapon
all their own.

389
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:15,278
They use their tails to club the fish
with waves of water pressure.

390
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:28,484
Then it's simply a matter
of collecting the stunned casualties.

391
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:44,278
The herrings have no chance.

392
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:47,883
Both orca and gulls
will eat as much as they can

393
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:50,720
every day for the next four months.

394
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:59,400
But there are so many fish
wintering here,

395
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,956
over five billion individuals,

396
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:05,278
that the losses
are almost unnoticeable.

397
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,800
Violent as this winter weather
may be,

398
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,916
it's essential for the renewal
of the riches of the Seasonal Seas.

399
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,759
0ut in the open oceans,

400
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:27,045
the surging waters stir up
nutrients from the depths.

401
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:32,885
By the end of winter,

402
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:36,517
the Seasonal Seas will be
full of minerals once more,

403
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:42,876
ready for the return of the sun
and the next great plankton bloom.
