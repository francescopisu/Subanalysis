1
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:35,356
0ur planet is a blue planet.

2
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:37,438
Nearly three-quarters of its surface

3
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:39,718
is covered by the oceans.

4
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,401
Their enormous size, and the fact

5
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:46,475
that we know so little about many
of the creatures that live there,

6
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:50,726
presented the makers of this series
with some very difficult challenges.

7
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:57,799
The series took the best part
of five years to make

8
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:01,437
and we filmed
in nearly 200 locations worldwide.

9
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,959
Much of the behaviour
of the animals in this series

10
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,163
had never been filmed before

11
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,438
and some was new to science.

12
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:25,757
To get it,
the Blue Planet team were helped

13
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:30,803
by researchers at the cutting edge
of marine science all over the world.

14
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:33,726
This film is about how we worked
with those scientists

15
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:37,124
and were able to see
so much that is new.

16
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:54,719
0ne of the least known and hardest
animals to film is the blue whale.

17
00:01:55,007 --> 00:02:00,081
It roams thousands of miles of open ocean
and can move at 30 miles an hour.

18
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,566
You have to be very lucky

19
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:03,599
even to catch up with one.

20
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:05,006
This...

21
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:08,875
This immense body is just the tip

22
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,522
of the flank of the biggest creature

23
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:13,798
that exists on the planet -

24
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,639
the blue whale.

25
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:20,318
0ver 30 metres long and weighing
as much as 200 tonnes,

26
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,956
it's larger than the biggest dinosaurs.

27
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:27,683
And yet its migration routes
are still largely unknown

28
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:31,601
and we have no idea
where blue whales breed.

29
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,647
The biggest research project
trying to solve these mysteries

30
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:36,246
is based off California,

31
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:40,206
working with one of the largest
remaining populations of blue whales.

32
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:45,076
Marine biologist Bruce Mate
is pioneering a new technique

33
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:49,797
which uses electronic radio tags
to send signals to satellites.

34
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,444
<i>Amazingly, we don't know where most</i>
<i>whale species are at least half the year,</i>

35
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:58,959
<i>and it's really important</i>
<i>that we know their critical habitats -</i>

36
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:01,607
<i>where they feed, breed,</i>
<i>calve and migrate,</i>

37
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:05,118
<i>because those are the areas</i>
<i>that they can't do without,</i>

38
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:11,726
<i>We have to be very careful not to</i>
<i>frighten them off but, as we approach,</i>

39
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:13,759
<i>you can see the flukes,</i>

40
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:16,277
<i>you can see the head start to rise,</i>

41
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>When it blows,</i>
<i>you know you're in the presence</i>

42
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,806
<i>of a HUGE animal,</i>

43
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,605
<i>There's a sense of intimidation there,</i>

44
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:26,277
<i>just by the sheer si</i>z<i>e of the animal,</i>

45
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,039
<i>Squeeze in,</i>

46
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,278
<i>- All rightI</i>
<i>- 0h, yeahI</i>

47
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:36,646
The dart is little more than a pinprick
to the whale and, in under six months,

48
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,246
it will fall off.

49
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:40,887
The little tag sends up signals
to the satellite

50
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:45,404
that records the whale's exact position
each time it surfaces to breathe.

51
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,400
The latest results confirm
that this population commutes each year

52
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,877
from 0regon in the north to Mexico
and Costa Rica in the south,

53
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:58,437
with many whales overwintering
in the Gulf of California.

54
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,366
For three years,

55
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,320
we had cameramen on standby
all along this migration route

56
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:07,565
using a microlight and helicopters

57
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,839
to try to film blues from the air
without disturbing them.

58
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,676
The microlight was specially adapted
for landing on the water

59
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:20,516
so the cameraman could jump in
ahead of the whale for an underwater shot.

60
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,240
But soon the whales headed
out of microlight and helicopter range,

61
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:30,399
and we had to follow them south
into the Gulf of California.

62
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,680
There, we worked with another
marine biologist, Diane Gendron.

63
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,119
<i>If we want to do an estimation</i>
<i>of the population,</i>

64
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,767
<i>an estimation of the numbers</i>
<i>of blue whale</i>

65
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,644
<i>who use the Gulf of California,</i>

66
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,600
<i>we need to know if we're looking</i>
<i>at the whole population</i>

67
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,206
<i>or just part of it,</i>

68
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,640
<i>And that's what we're doing</i>

69
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,246
<i>with the aerial transect -</i>

70
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,285
<i>trying to estimate</i>
<i>the number of blue whale</i>

71
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,359
<i>that use the Gulf of California</i>
<i>during winter,</i>

72
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:02,919
Pilot Sandy Lanham has an expert eye
for spotting blue whales from the air.

73
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,000
For the last ten years,

74
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,557
she's worked with biologists
studying these animals in the Gulf.

75
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:11,639
What's really exciting
is that there are early indications

76
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,958
that this may be the place
that blue whales come with their calves.

77
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,796
For our cameraman Rick Rosenthal
it was a unique opportunity

78
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:22,284
to get rare footage of a blue whale mother
with its young.

79
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,758
<i>Marilee, we've just got,,,</i>

80
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:29,840
The spotter plane also provided
crucial information to a boat-based team

81
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:33,124
trying to catch up with the whales
down at water level.

82
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,598
The whales are only
on the water's surface

83
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,206
for two minutes.

84
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:42,437
Then they dive for 20.

85
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,324
But, as their tails go down,

86
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:46,477
they leave a patch of smooth water

87
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,086
called a footprint -

88
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,876
a clue to where they're heading
and where they might resurface.

89
00:05:55,847 --> 00:06:00,716
<i>You know, with experience,</i>
<i>you have an idea of the distance</i>

90
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:02,725
<i>a whale moves underwater,</i>

91
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,367
<i>looking from where you started moving,</i>

92
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,566
With Diane's knowledge
and special permits,

93
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:14,004
our team managed to get really close
without disturbing the whales.

94
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:28,644
The open ocean is a vast wilderness
between the continents -

95
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,800
a big, blue arena where finding anything
is extremely difficult.

96
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,716
Somewhere out in this marine desert,

97
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,719
there are amazing dramas
played out every day

98
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:42,482
and the Blue Planet team
invested over 400 days

99
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:46,480
of often unsuccessful filming trips
far out to sea.

100
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:54,204
<i>The day is still young,</i>

101
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:58,883
<i>It's a little after four in the afternoon,</i>

102
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:02,881
<i>Historically, this is about the time</i>
<i>that the predator hour starts up,</i>

103
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,443
<i>Probably the open ocean,</i>
<i>which I like to call liquid space,</i>

104
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,878
<i>is the most difficult area to work</i>
<i>in the ocean,</i>

105
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,442
<i>People wonder</i>
<i>how we even film out there -</i>

106
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,837
<i>do we just throw the camera in</i>
<i>or wander about for days on end?</i>

107
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:20,042
<i>There's hours of boredom,</i>
<i>Nothing goes on, Nothing,</i>

108
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,155
<i>Patience, patience,</i>
<i>Looking, looking,</i>

109
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:27,156
After six weeks searching
off the Pacific Coast of Panama,

110
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,440
our crew finally caught up
with some fast-moving

111
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,126
and unusual dolphins -

112
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,045
spinners.

113
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,925
<i>I look for dolphins, marine mammals</i>

114
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,880
<i>aggregating, coming together -</i>
<i>a successful predator</i>

115
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,566
<i>goes where the food is,</i>

116
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,485
<i>If we can find those patches,</i>

117
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:47,440
<i>then that's going to be</i>
<i>paydirt for us as well,</i>

118
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,639
A pod of dolphins like this
is often accompanied

119
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,804
by other predators such as tuna.

120
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:59,802
0ur team thought that following dolphins
might lead them to some exciting action.

121
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:05,601
R<i>ight behind the dolphin school,</i>
<i>a massive bunch of tuna came by,</i>

122
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,918
<i>I dove down and one school</i>
<i>was crossing in front of me,</i>

123
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:12,961
<i>then all of a sudden - vroomI -</i>
<i>another big, massive school,</i>

124
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,920
Eventually, the team struck gold -

125
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,563
a ball of baitfish corralled
at the surface by predators.

126
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:22,879
<i>,,on that outside edge there,</i>

127
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:26,957
You have to be quick
to film a bonanza like this,

128
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:31,206
because soon the baitfish
will be eaten and it'll be all over.

129
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:37,516
You have to be careful, too. This frenzy
is no place for the inexperienced.

130
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,684
<i>0ne of the things -</i>

131
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,958
<i>when you are in the water,</i>

132
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:46,957
<i>sardines will often swarm you to try</i>
<i>to hide around you from the predators,</i>

133
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:49,283
<i>I could see a piece of the bait ball</i>

134
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,444
<i>break off and come directly at me,</i>

135
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:56,517
<i>The fish were on me and the tuna knew it,</i>
<i>The tuna were rocketing out of the deep,</i>

136
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:01,437
<i>just for a second, I felt I had become</i>
<i>part of this feeding frenzy,</i>

137
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:05,884
<i>I felt like a big sardine</i>
<i>in the middle of the bait ball,</i>

138
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,124
<i>Finally, when it was all over,</i>

139
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:13,003
<i>all that remained was a shower</i>
<i>of fish scales from the sardines,</i>

140
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,039

another Blue Planet team was looking
for more gentle creatures -

144
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:27,086
one of the world's smallest whales,
pilot whales.

145
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,280
So little research

146
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,877
has been done in the open ocean that
normally we worked without scientists.

147

from the local experts.

00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,998
<i>They were very tolerant, but it's sensible</i>
<i>to respect their potential power,</i>

168
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:03,723
<i>A calf came very close to check us out,</i>

169
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,360
<i>The male was escorting</i>
<i>the mother and calf,</i>

170
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:20,996
<i>making sure nothing came too close,</i>
<i>which in this case was me,</i>

171
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:24,762
<i>As I saw the calf coming towards me,</i>
<i>it was obvious</i>

172
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:27,038
<i>that the male didn't want me there,</i>

173
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,436
<i>It was very important</i>
<i>to leave the calf alone,</i>

174
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,844
<i>The male came up</i>
<i>and swished his tail right in front of me</i>

175
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,039
<i>and nearly knocked me out,</i>
<i>so I just stayed there</i>

176
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:38,682
<i>and let them swim off on their own,</i>

177
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:43,279
<i>(</i>R<i>ICA</i>R<i>D0 ) The presence</i>
<i>of film crews on a ship like this</i>

178
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,523
<i>is definitely very important,</i>

179
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:49,919
<i>We are not just doing the research</i>
<i>for academic purposes</i>

180
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,838
<i>but for conservation,</i>

181
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,925
<i>so public awareness is an important part</i>
<i>of our programme,</i>

182
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,919
<i>It's no use for us just</i>
<i>to come up with scientific results,</i>

183
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:01,756
<i>We have to get through to the public</i>
<i>and politicians that take the measures,</i>

184
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:11,125
The open ocean's ultimate filming
challenge is the world's fastest fish -

185
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,723
Billfish.

186
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:21,117
Spectacular predators
like marlin and sailfish

187
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,001
are extraordinarily difficult
to locate and film.

188
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:27,359
We finally caught up with them
off Mexico,

189
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,200
where Rick Rosenthal used the birds
to guide him to the action.

190
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:35,918
<i>(</i>R<i>ICK) There's a Mexican legend about</i>
<i>the frigate bird, which they call tijereta,</i>

191
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,526
<i>or scissor tail,</i>

192
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:41,646
<i>The height that the frigate bird flies</i>
<i>above the surface of the sea</i>

193
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,522
<i>is directly proportional to the depth</i>
<i>where the predators are swimming,</i>

194
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:51,879
This opportunity only came after a total
of 400 days scouring the open ocean

195
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,798
and many failed trips.

196
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:56,555
<i>You're pumped up, you're hunting,</i>

197
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,000
<i>you're hunting with a camera,</i>

198
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:03,478
<i>You have to filter out an awful lot</i>
<i>of what's going on around you,</i>

199
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,201
<i>get specific,</i>
<i>get into where the action is,</i>

200
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:09,842
It was an exciting
but dangerous moment.

201
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:14,518
These underwater javelins can travel
at over 70 miles an hour.

202
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,363
Suddenly, tuna arrive
to attack the very same bait ball.

203
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:26,562
And finally, almost unbelievably,

204
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,877
a sei whale.

205
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,725
<i>We got itI</i>

206
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,239
<i>Will it come up again?</i>

207
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,883
<i>Where the hell are you? Get goingI</i>
<i>Help Doug, Help Doug,</i>

208
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,921
<i>You have a wish list of things</i>
<i>you'd want to film,</i>

209
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:51,080
<i>And, if you're in these gatherings,</i>
<i>you'd certainly hope that some day</i>

210
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,757
<i>a whale would come in and feed</i>
<i>and you're in there,</i>

211
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:57,077
<i>In this programme,</i>
<i>we were at the right time,</i>

212
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,961
<i>We followed groups</i>
<i>of whales feeding,</i>

213
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,686
<i>We had put a cameraman</i>
<i>or two in the water,</i>

214
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,520
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>we were filming from the surface</i>

215
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:07,677
<i>so we could get proper coverage,</i>

216
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,961
0f all the ocean habitats,

217
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:32,045
the coasts are the most dynamic
and demanding.

218
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:43,600
Life here is harsh and there are
few permanent residents.

219
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:49,726
But when the conditions are right,
the coast can be extremely rich -

220
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,162
and that is exactly
what happens each June

221
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:55,205
off this coast in Natal, South Africa.

222
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,445
For two seasons,
our crew of six cameramen

223
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:05,718
and their extensive back-up team

224
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:09,402
came to try and film
one of the ocean's greatest spectacles.

225
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,042
<i>Change speed underwater,</i>

226
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,645
Six to 115.

227
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:22,044
They were here for an annual event
called the sardine run.

228
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,197
Millions and millions
of tonnes of sardines

229
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:29,280
migrating northwards along the coast
with the changing currents.

230
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:33,526
So much food inevitably attracts
masses of predators.

231
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,401
It was this predation
the team were hoping to film.

232
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,558
The sardine run stretches for miles,

233
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:45,204
and the microlight was constantly
searching for pods of common dolphins

234
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,081
that would lead them to the action.

235
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,165
0nce the microlight
had discovered hunting dolphins,

236
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,837
it passed on the location
to the boat-based teams.

237
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,482
And it wasn't just dolphins,

238
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:07,276
but hundreds of sharks
that were also attracted by the fish.

239
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:15,400
Before diving in, the team put special
explosive tips on their shark sticks.

240
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:19,919
If things looked really dangerous, these
could be used to frighten the sharks away.

241
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,846
<i>En gardeI 0ne - two - three, GoI</i>

242
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:26,644
<i>Very few people</i>

243
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,918
<i>dive with the brown shark,</i>

244
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:32,682
<i>because we see the sharks</i>
<i>in shallow water</i>

245
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,758
<i>during the sardine run only,</i>

246
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,357
<i>When we are surrounded by sharks,</i>

247
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,320
<i>we feel fear,</i>

248
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,601
<i>And suddenly the dolphins come,</i>

249
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:54,516
<i>We hear them before we see them,</i>
<i>And then we start to relax,</i>

250
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:59,483
Scientific research on the sardine run
is still in its early stages.

251
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,080
But underwater filming

252
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:04,716
reveals some very exciting
new behaviour among the dolphins.

253
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,758
Working together in teams,

254
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,039
they release walls of bubbles
to corral the sardines

255
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:12,919
into ever-tighter balls.

256
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:18,439
This bubble-netting behaviour

257
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:22,356
allowed the dolphins to feed
on every last sardine left behind

258
00:17:22,647 --> 00:17:25,764
while the rest of the migration
continued north.

259
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,200
Monterey Bay,

260
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,478
on the coast of California.

261
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,879
Every year, a pod of killer whales
arrives to hunt grey whales

262
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,640
as they migrate north
through these waters.

263
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:50,520
0ur cameramen Doug Allan
and Tom Fitz spent eight weeks

264
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,275
over two seasons
trying to film the action.

265
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,766
<i>We had these killer whales,</i>

266
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:58,562
<i>We started following them but,</i>
<i>as you can see, the sea's got up,</i>

267
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:01,081
<i>It's 30 - 35 knots,</i>
<i>We couldn't keep up with them,</i>

268
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,761
0ur team was advised
by marine biologist

269
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,366
Nancy Black,

270
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:10,326
who had spent 14 years watching
killer whales in Monterey Bay

271
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:13,524
but had never seen
a single complete kill.

272
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:18,398
The boat-based team was supported

273
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:22,362
by keen-eyed spotters who every day
scoured the bay from the air

274
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:25,878
looking for grey whale mothers
and their calves taking a shortcut.

275
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,286
<i>(NANCY) During the spring,</i>

276
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,161
<i>when the mothers and calves</i>
<i>come through,</i>

277
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,562
<i>the grey whales migrate north,</i>

278
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:35,919
<i>When they cross Monterey Bay,</i>
<i>they have no shore protection,</i>

279
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:39,244
<i>There's no place for them to hide,</i>
<i>and the killer whales</i>

280
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:42,837
<i>are out looking for these mother/calf</i>
<i>pairs of grey whales,</i>

281
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:46,636
Killer whales can travel at over 20mph.

282
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:48,763
The challenge was

283
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,237
trying to keep up with the action,
whatever the weather at sea.

284
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:55,087
<i>(NANCY) We were out there</i>
<i>at the perfect time,</i>

285
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,358
<i>right before the attack happened,</i>

286
00:18:57,447 --> 00:19:00,120
<i>with the killer whales</i>
<i>in pursuit of the grey whales,</i>

287
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:04,958
<i>It's the first time that we've seen it</i>
<i>all the way from the start to the end,</i>

288
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:09,676
The killers kept up the hunt
for five hours until, eventually,

289
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:13,403
the calf was so exhausted
that the mother was forced to stop.

290
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,645
And we had to watch
as the pod came in

291
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:20,522
to finish off the calf right in front of us,
just a few metres away.

292
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,685
<i>Killer whales seem to work</i>

293
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:28,685
<i>in certain roles,</i>

294
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,282
<i>0ne female actually positioned herself</i>

295
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,762
<i>between the mother and calf grey whale,</i>

296
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,999
<i>She was in there, pushing him away,</i>
<i>The others had roles around the outside,</i>

297
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:41,278
<i>They seemed to be really co-ordinated,</i>

298
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,484
<i>It was the first time we'd had a chance</i>
<i>to document that,</i>

299
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,644
<i>We spent a long time with them that day,</i>

300
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:51,397
<i>(D0UG) If they'd taken a mind to,</i>
<i>they could have flipped us over,</i>

301
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:56,363
<i>But, on the other hand, I think</i>
<i>they were concentrating on the whale,</i>

302
00:19:56,647 --> 00:20:01,357
<i>and we were able to get closer</i>
<i>but not interfere, which was important,</i>

303
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:05,726
<i>By the end,</i>

304
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,521
<i>I was just completely</i>
<i>emotionally drained,</i>

305
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:16,963
After a six-hour hunt,

306
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,607
the fifteen-strong pod of killer whales

307
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,962
ate nothing more
than the calf's lower jaw

308
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:24,044
and its tongue.

309
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,359
The coral seas
are the richest in the ocean.

310
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:35,076
Their diversity and richness of life
is unmatched.

311
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:51,041
Blue Planet filmed worldwide in pretty
well every major coral reef system.

312
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,956
But some of the most exciting places
we worked were remote islands

313
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,561
far off the Pacific coast
of Central America,

314
00:20:57,647 --> 00:21:00,036
like the Galapagos, Malpelo and Cocos.

315
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,636
<i>This is a big event,</i>

316
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:07,842
<i>This is a place in this vast ocean,</i>

317
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,963
<i>and the deep water currents come in</i>

318
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,477
<i>and hit this island,</i>

319
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:15,799
<i>And it upwells -</i>
<i>brings all the nutrients up,</i>

320
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:18,237
<i>So the little fish feed on the nutrients,</i>

321
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:22,320
<i>the bigger fish feed on the little fish,</i>
<i>then the sharks feed on THEM,</i>

322
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,920
<i>We came out here</i>

323
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:27,882
<i>without any experts, by ourselves,</i>
<i>just out looking around</i>

324
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,556
<i>trying to find sharks,</i>
<i>trying to find good things to film,</i>

325
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,524
<i>And we found a bunch of them,</i>

326
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:34,526
Finding oneself

327
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,160
among so many silky sharks

328
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:40,963
was an extraordinarily exciting
but perhaps worrying experience.

329
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:44,284
<i>I don't think you have</i>

330
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,762
<i>anything to be worried about</i>
<i>or frightened of,</i>

331
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:50,676
<i>They're a very curious shark,</i>
<i>They come right up to you,</i>

332
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,003
<i>which makes it good for photography,</i>

333
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,486
<i>They bump you,</i>

334
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,362
<i>they push off</i>
<i>your camera with their nose,</i>

335
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:02,440
<i>I think they want to find out what you are</i>
<i>and what you're doing here in their world,</i>

336
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,597
<i>When they bump me, I bump them back</i>

337
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:10,358
<i>to let them know, ''Hey, I'm here</i>
<i>and I'm something to be reckoned with, ''</i>

338
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:15,516
No sooner had they arrived than
the silky sharks started to disappear

339
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:17,286
into the open ocean,

340
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:20,200
never to be seen again
on that particular trip.

341
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:28,676
At night, a completely new collection
of animals emerges onto the reef

342
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:32,437
and we were determined to film
some of the things that happen

343
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,046
under cover of darkness.

344
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:38,006
But lighting the reef to look
as if it were lit by moonlight

345
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:41,882
requires a well co-ordinated team
and a complex lighting set-up.

346
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:47,557
<i>For filming at night,</i>
<i>especially sharks in a big area,</i>

347
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:50,156
<i>we needed quite a bit of light,</i>

348
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:54,235
<i>Little battery lights wouldn't do,</i>
<i>We brought in a generator</i>

349
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:58,759
<i>and cables coming down</i>
<i>to 650W lights,</i>

350
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:23,238
<i>I don't think the sharks were</i>
<i>disturbed at all by the light,</i>

351
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:26,283
<i>These sharks are clued in</i>

352
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:29,798
<i>to little electronic impulses</i>
<i>from each other</i>

353
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:31,884
<i>and also from the prey,</i>

354
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:07,804
Filming in the tidal seas
is all about timing.

355
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,639
The lives of the animals that live here

356
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:13,237
are dominated by the daily advance
and retreat of the tides.

357
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:22,080
But it's not just the daily cycle
that's important.

358
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,840
The monthly cycle of the moon
also has a massive effect

359
00:24:25,127 --> 00:24:26,606
on the oceans.

360
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:28,837
And on the Great Barrier Reef
in Australia,

361
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,919
it seems to be the key factor
co-ordinating the mass spawning

362
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,526
of the entire reef.

363
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,201
We were there
to try and film that spectacle

364
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:40,678
but, as yet, it's still not
properly understood by science.

365
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,046
<i>It was only 20 years ago</i>

366
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:48,037
<i>that they discovered that the whole</i>
<i>of the Barrier</i> R<i>eef went off,</i>

367
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:50,960
<i>Basically it goes off</i>
<i>on three or four nights,</i>

368
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:55,120
<i>They've been working on it ever since</i>
<i>but they still don't know an awful lot,</i>

369
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,437
<i>So, for the scientists,</i>
<i>this is really exciting,</i>

370
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:08,520
<i>and we tracked that down to one</i>
<i>small, encrusted brown multipore,</i>

371
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,766
It was Craig's advice that allowed us
to get there at just the right time.

372
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:17,279
With three cameramen and a complex
lighting rig, we were determined to film.

373
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:19,846
But, for Martha,

374
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:22,880
there was a lot of tension
as she waited on deck.

375
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,723
<i>It's frustrating not being able</i>
<i>to speak to them or see them,</i>

376
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:28,123
<i>If you're filming topside, you can interact</i>

377
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,523
<i>and you know</i>
<i>what the cameraman's getting,</i>

378
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:34,880
<i>But, on the back of a boat, at night,</i>
<i>you have no idea what's going on,</i>

379
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:36,446
That first night,

380
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,882
there was no sign of the spawning.

381
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:43,240
The worry was that the lights might be
interfering with the coral's behaviour.

382
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:48,366
<i>Craig thinks it's important</i>
<i>not to have light on the coral at all,</i>

383
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:53,680
<i>He actually got us to turn the lights off</i>
<i>on here and that light over there off</i>

384
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,804
<i>because it was producing a cast</i>
<i>on the reef,</i>

385
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,526
<i>He thinks it might be affecting the corals,</i>

386
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:03,805
<i>Well, we have to light it</i>
<i>in order to film it,</i>

387
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:09,676
<i>Well, I white-balanced,</i>
<i>I switched,,, I had the light on,,,</i>

388
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:11,758
<i>He obeyed instructionsI</i>

389
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:14,919
<i>Craig thought the light</i>
<i>might affect the spawning</i>

390
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,475
<i>so I thought I'd just leave things</i>
<i>as they are,</i>

391
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:19,558
<i>I wasn't told that,</i>

392
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:25,520
<i>(PETE</i>R<i>) This is a practice lighting,</i>
<i>(MA</i>R<i>THA) It was, you're quite right,</i>

393
00:26:26,207 --> 00:26:30,678
Tantalisingly, for two more nights,
there was little sign of the spawning.

394
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,803
But, eventually, on the fourth night,

395
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:35,078
something started to happen.

396
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:41,725
Some of the corals began to release
sperm in clouds into the water.

397
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:45,044
But this was not
the mass-spawning spectacle

398
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,318
the team had come to film.

399
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:55,716
For the cameramen,
it was rather frustrating work

400
00:26:56,007 --> 00:27:00,205
as they picked away, trying to get
the pictures needed to build up the story.

401
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:04,799
<i>It just takes such a long time,</i>
<i>I mean, it doesn't go in one big bang,</i>

402
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:06,286
<i>It just goes 1,,, 2,,,</i>

403
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:10,560
<i>Quite a lot of eggs go off,</i>
<i>but they don't go off in vast numbers,</i>

404
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:13,161
<i>They just sort of waft out gently,</i>

405
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:15,438
<i>4,,, 5,,, 1,,,</i>

406
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:18,195
<i>We would follow one egg,</i>
<i>you know, one egg,,,</i>

407
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:21,277
<i>You wait five minutes</i>
<i>and you might get two,</i>

408
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:25,037
<i>Watching a lump of stone</i>
<i>getting ready to spawn is,,,</i>

409
00:27:27,527 --> 00:27:31,884
<i>(PETE</i>R<i>) Now, this,,, We've gone up</i>
<i>and we've got the main light,</i>

410
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:36,160
<i>We're not balanced for that</i>
<i>so I just had to adjust it,</i>

411
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:38,203
<i>- That's mine,</i>
<i>- I know, I know,</i>

412
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:42,366
Finally, on the fifth night,
it seemed it was all going to happen

413
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:45,325
and Martha could hardly suppress
her excitement.

414
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,279
<i>Ye-e-e-esI</i>

415
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:52,680
But there was a problem. At the last
minute, Peter's camera had failed.

416
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,764
He worked desperately to fix it

417
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:58,522
in the few hours remaining
before the spawning was due to happen.

418
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:02,877
<i>(MA</i>R<i>THA) We're in go mode</i>
<i>for tonight,</i>

419
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:05,044
<i>We're in go mode tonight,</i>

420
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:08,039
<i>- With colour,</i>
<i>- 0h, there'll be some colour there,</i>

421
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:10,083
<i>No guarantee what it's likeI</i>

422
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,876
<i>There'll be some colour there but,,,</i>

423
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:16,725
<i>(MIKE) ,,but no spawning yet,</i>

424
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:21,806
Luckily,

425
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:23,406
on the fifth night,
the team WERE all set

426
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:27,805
to film a spectacular mass spawning
of the coral reef.

427
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:48,802
The seasonal seas that occur
in the temperate regions of the world

428
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:52,277
are probably the most productive
parts of the ocean.

429
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:58,277
But they're hard places to work in.

430
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:00,244
Their very productivity

431
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:01,846
reduces water visibility,

432
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:04,043
and the weather is often rough
and unpredictable.

433
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:11,965
The Blue Planet

434
00:29:12,247 --> 00:29:14,238
came to temperate waters off California

435
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,602
to film some exciting new behaviour
in harbour seals,

436
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:20,641
first observed by biologist
Teri Nicholson.

437
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,445
<i>Harbour seals are incredible,</i>

438
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:28,723
<i>I guess what I love about working</i>
<i>with them is dispelling the myth</i>

439
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,719
<i>that they are these funny,</i>
<i>rock-looking objects on shore,</i>

440
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:34,116
<i>When you get underwater with them,</i>

441
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:39,201
<i>they have an incredibly complex</i>
<i>and dynamic social life,</i>

442
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:42,318
<i>They're very curious</i>

443
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:44,837
<i>and very cool to be with,</i>

444
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:48,164
Teri discovered that young male seals
seem to learn

445
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:53,601
an extraordinary courtship song
by closely mimicking older males.

446
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:56,879
(DEEP GUTTURAL GURGLES)

447
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,761
(SHE IMITATES THE SEALS' S0NG)

448
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:11,518
<i>I know it sounds much more intense</i>
<i>than that, but I'm a femaleI</i>

449
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:15,879
<i>These vocalisations kind of allow males</i>

450
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,481
<i>to feel each other out</i>
<i>and figure out</i>

451
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:22,840
<i>who are the males to stay away from,</i>
<i>who they can potentially be harmed by,</i>

452
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:27,405
<i>They're bigger and more dominating</i>
<i>than other males that they can overcome,</i>

453
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,797
<i>The biggest lesson I've learned</i>
<i>is that, to look at harbour seals</i>

454
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:34,840
<i>and understand their behaviour,</i>
<i>you have to look underwater,</i>

455
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:40,558
<i>Amost everything interesting</i>
<i>these animals do occurs underwater,</i>

456
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:48,726
Hundreds of miles to the north,
off Prince William Sound, Alaska,

457
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:53,717
another Blue Planet team came in search
of one of the least-known sharks -

458
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:57,037
salmon sharks.

459
00:30:57,247 --> 00:31:00,000
These unusual relatives
of the great white shark

460
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:04,200
have never been observed
behaving naturally underwater,

461
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,684
and we were keen to try and get
unique images using a remote camera

462
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,958
attached to a pole.

463
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:14,766
Director Hugh Pearson could watch
the action via a monitor on the surface.

464
00:31:14,847 --> 00:31:16,917
<i>It was great to try and film</i>
<i>something very new,</i>

465
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:20,199
<i>Also, it just fitted in</i>
<i>so well with our story,</i>

466
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:23,279
<i>because the whole theme</i>
<i>of the temperate programme</i>

467
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,085
<i>is the seasonality of the seas,</i>

468
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,964
<i>And this story is totally seasonal,</i>

469
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:31,718
<i>The salmon sharks wait for the salmon</i>
<i>to spawn, and then they move in,</i>

470
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,843
<i>(PETE</i>R<i>) 0bviously, we're hoping</i>

471
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:37,119
<i>that we're going to get them</i>
<i>actually behaving naturally</i>

472
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:40,165
<i>and fishing amongst the salmon</i>

473
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:42,841
<i>in the thick numbers that we're told,</i>

474
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,756
<i>(HUGH) The timing for us</i>
<i>to come here is absolutely vital,</i>

475
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:48,924
<i>because, for most of the year,</i>

476
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:53,000
<i>the scientists think they're out feeding</i>
<i>in the North Pacific on whatever's there,</i>

477
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,960
<i>But they follow the salmon in</i>

478
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,923
<i>and the salmon only run in for maybe</i>
<i>a month or so during the summer,</i>

479
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:03,963
It's not just the sharks

480
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:08,001
that are after the salmon -
there's a big fishing industry here.

481
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:12,080
Marine biologist Ken Goldman
works with the fishermen,

482
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:14,517
who help him catch sharks
for science.

483
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:16,757
<i>The salmon sharks are becoming</i>

484
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:20,039
<i>an important resource</i>
<i>for the state of Alaska,</i>

485
00:32:20,127 --> 00:32:22,641
<i>There's a large interest in sport fishing,</i>

486
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:25,395
<i>It's becoming big news</i>
<i>for game fishing,</i>

487
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:29,241
<i>The state and the federal government</i>
<i>are interested in managing this species</i>

488
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,646
<i>before the population</i>

489
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:33,316
<i>begins to decline</i>
<i>because of the fishing,</i>

490
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,717
Catching and tagging
a 4-metre shark is hard work.

491
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:40,800
But Ken hopes it might provide
vital information about population size

492
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,923
and where the sharks go to breed.

493
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:46,005
They've only ever been seen here
off Alaska

494
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,476
and then for just one month
each year.

495
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,559
The rest of their lives
remains a mystery.

496
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:54,315
<i>(KEN) That'll be fine, That's good,</i>

497
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:58,839
This is often the only close-up look
that Ken ever gets of his shark.

498
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:02,519
And he was as fascinated
as we were to see

499
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:05,799
what pictures would emerge
from our camera on a pole.

500
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,964
<i>This is a 3-minute selection</i>
<i>of some of the good stuff we got,</i>

501
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:15,239
<i>(KEN) This kind of activity</i>
<i>is what I don't get to see,</i>

502
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,204
<i>Even when I look over the side</i>
<i>of the boat,</i>

503
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:20,047
<i>I get a top view, I don't see the side of it</i>

504
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:22,887
<i>or get to look up underneath it,</i>

505
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,965
<i>What's the distance from the camera,,,</i>
<i>That's nice,</i>

506
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,886
<i>It's probably 10 foot</i>
<i>when you start to see him,</i>

507
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,522
<i>(KEN) They probably see</i>
<i>that camera at 30 feet,</i>

508
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:35,243
<i>Who knows? But theirs are adapted</i>
<i>to that environment where ours are not,</i>

509
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:37,961
<i>(HUGH) Do you think from that</i>

510
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:40,807
<i>- that they're very visual predators?</i>
<i>- Yeah,</i>

511
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:44,602
By exploiting the shark's visual sense,

512
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:49,597
we hope to lure them closer to get
some more powerful images still.

513
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:52,526
<i>You get that silver-sided salmon</i>
<i>doing what you're doing,</i>

514
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,767
<i>You're moving it along,</i>
<i>it's something visual</i>

515
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,166
<i>going through the water,</i>

516
00:33:56,247 --> 00:34:00,001
<i>You can't really see it</i>
<i>without a video shot like this,</i>

517
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:05,236
<i>where it comes in, turns its head to it,</i>
<i>then turns away - curious and cautious,</i>

518
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,916
<i>And then comfortable enough</i>
<i>to go for it,</i>

519
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,277
<i>It's a new look, This is a shark</i>
<i>that so little is known about,</i>

520
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:23,598
<i>and few people have had the opportunity</i>
<i>to see them underwater,</i>

521
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:28,278
<i>So, every time, the behaviours are</i>
<i>either confirming something we suspect</i>

522
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:32,076
<i>or showing us something new, or</i>
<i>something we didn't think they could do,</i>

523
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,482
<i>It's absolutely wonderful to see,</i>

524
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:38,760
<i>You learn stuff every time</i>
<i>you watch something like this,</i>

525
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:49,235
The frozen seas in the Antarctic
and the Arctic, for some,

526
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,684
are the most beautiful
of all ocean habitats.

527
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,765
But it's dangerous to be lulled
by their beauty.

528
00:34:58,047 --> 00:35:01,801
For the animals
that have to survive at the poles,

529
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,636
and our teams who had to work there,
conditions could hardly be harsher.

530
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,718
<i>This is not a day to be looking</i>
<i>for bears,</i>

531
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:11,283
<i>It's about minus 15</i>
<i>with 20 knots of wind,</i>

532
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:14,837
<i>The wind chill</i>
<i>is something ferocious,</i>

533
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:19,239
Doug Allan made several trips
to the Arctic island of Svalbard

534
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:21,995
to try and film polar bears hunting.

535
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,759
<i>I've got this little guy here,</i>

536
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:26,322
<i>He comes with me on all my trips,</i>

537
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:30,317
<i>And, if I put him down here</i>
<i>by the window, facing out,</i>

538
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:32,996
<i>hopefully he'll bring in the real thing,</i>

539
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:35,362
<i>So, do your stuff,</i>

540
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:38,844
Polar bears hunt far out
on the frozen sea ice,

541
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,680
which is a dangerous place to work.

542
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,959
And finding a white bear
in this white wilderness

543
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:46,719
requires much patience and experience.

544
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,998
<i>God, that was so frustrating,</i>

545
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:59,762
<i>We had this female and cub, We'd been</i>
<i>watching her for the last 3 or 4 hours</i>

546
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:03,517
<i>doing a bit of hunting,</i>
<i>never very close,</i>

547
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:05,598
<i>Anyway, she came in</i>
<i>to a nice position,</i>

548
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:08,884
<i>And then I took a few steps</i>
<i>towards her,</i>

549
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,558
<i>She was a long way away but she just</i>
<i>completely reacted the wrong way,</i>

550
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:16,680
<i>I lost all her confidence</i>
<i>and now she's,,,</i>

551
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,046
<i>pissed off,</i>

552
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:21,038
<i>And it's such a nice day for filming,</i>

553
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:23,318
<i>And I thought we had it and,,,</i>

554
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:24,726
<i>0h,,,</i>

555
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:37,598
If anything, working in Antarctica is
even more demanding than the Arctic.

556
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:41,721
Here you can be thousands of miles
from civilisation

557
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:45,397
and everything you need
has to come in by sea or air.

558
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:49,559
We were fortunate
to have the support of scientists

559
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:51,838
on the Italian Antarctic programme

560
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:54,157
who kindly let us share
a temporary research base

561
00:36:54,447 --> 00:36:58,520
they'd set up miles out
on the edge of the frozen sea ice.

562
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:04,518
(SPEAKS IN ITALIAN)

563
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:11,681
The Italian programme is involved
in a wide range of Antarctic research,

564
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:15,039
but here they were concentrating on
the communities of animals and plants

565
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,118
that live under the ice.

566
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,518
By measuring the amount of light

567
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,798
that reaches algae under the ice,

568
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:29,244
they hope to monitor the frozen sea's
productivity - one vital way

569
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:32,360
to gauge the health
of the Antarctic 0cean.

570
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:33,880
Their hole also provided

571
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,364
a unique opportunity for Doug.

572
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:41,039
<i>It's quite nice,</i>

573
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,397
R<i>eally big platelets of ice,</i>

574
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:47,639
<i>Very impressive when Mark's crawling</i>
<i>in amongst it trying to find a space</i>

575
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:49,918
<i>for the light centre,</i>

576
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:53,397
<i>Very nice, Browns, greens,</i>
<i>all kinds of colours,</i>

577
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:59,198
<i>A Weddell seal came by and gave us</i>
<i>a quick once-over,</i>

578
00:37:59,287 --> 00:38:00,845
But most of our work

579
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:03,243
was concentrated at the ice edge.

580
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:13,563
We were there to film Emperor penguins
as they returned to their breeding colonies

581
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:15,838
from feeding far out to sea.

582
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:22,116
A remote camera under the ice helped us
predict when the penguins would emerge.

583
00:38:39,447 --> 00:38:41,563
<i>0K, I think that's it, That's it,</i>

584
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:50,757
Back in the Arctic, on Svalbard,
after weeks of patience,

585
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:55,404
Doug was finally getting close
to a polar bear and its cub.

586
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:02,281
You have to work very carefully
to gain her confidence.

587
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:08,004
<i>It's five o'clock in the morning</i>

588
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:10,437
<i>and I think we've just cracked it,</i>

589
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:12,006
<i>We had a female there</i>

590
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:13,606
<i>with the cub,</i>

591
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:16,326
<i>and she did quite a lot</i>
<i>of pouncing about,</i>

592
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:20,520
<i>50 to 80 metres away,</i>
<i>just a nice sort of distance,</i>

593
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:25,278
<i>And do you know what she did</i>

594
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:26,966
<i>when she was finished?</i>

595
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,766
<i>She was so relaxed,</i>

596
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:32,960
<i>she sat down</i>
<i>and gathered the cub in to her,</i>

597
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:35,686
<i>and suckled it head-on to the camera,</i>

598
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,166
<i>I tell you,</i>

599
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:44,997
<i>the weight off your mind when you get</i>
<i>something like that is incredible,</i>

600
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:00,478
Sixty per cent of our planet

601
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,525
is covered by ocean
more than a mile deep.

602
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:07,600
The deep is by far the largest
of all the ocean habitats.

603
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,678
And yet it's the least known.

604
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:14,363
You need the very latest technology
to explore this last frontier.

605
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:21,838
As you descend, the light diminishes and
pressures increase to dangerous levels.

606
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:26,564
Within 1,000 metres,
it's 100 times that on the surface

607
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:30,526
and only a handful of submersibles
worldwide can dive any deeper.

608
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:37,481
<i>You're flying around in this very small</i>
<i>ball of air - a glass bubble,</i>

609
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,966
<i>zooming around,</i>

610
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:42,084
<i>And it's just a wonderful feeling</i>

611
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:47,395
<i>to think that the chances are excellent</i>
<i>that no one else has ever seen</i>

612
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:50,281
<i>anything you're looking at</i>
<i>on that entire dive,</i>

613
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:57,722
We joined
the Johnson Sealink submersible

614
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:01,522
from the Harbor Branch
0ceanographic Institute

615
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:06,483
to film a completely new community
of animals only discovered in the '90s.

616
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,000
This brine lake

617
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:12,041
is surrounded
by thousands of mussels,

618
00:41:12,127 --> 00:41:15,324
and there are extensive fields
of tubeworms nearby,

619
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:17,398
all existing without the sun's energy.

620
00:41:17,647 --> 00:41:20,923
Filming was a real challenge.

621
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:25,040
<i>Every single thing you do</i>
<i>is done remotely,</i>

622
00:41:25,327 --> 00:41:27,682
<i>You barely twist this knob</i>
<i>and the iris jerks,</i>

623
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:31,039
<i>And, you know, you see</i>
<i>that kind of stuff - it's frustrating,</i>

624
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:33,516
Beautiful, close-up images of tubeworms,

625
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:36,799
revealed for the very first time.

626
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:41,998
These worms live 1,000 metres down,

627
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:45,875
but we wanted to dive
a lot deeper than that

628
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:48,556
and had to use
a far stronger submersible.

629
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:50,279
This is ALVIN,

630
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:54,155
operated by the Woods Hole
0ceanographic Institute.

631
00:41:54,247 --> 00:41:57,364
It's a reinforced titanium tank
with tiny windows,

632
00:41:57,647 --> 00:42:00,605
which allows it to dive
as deep as three miles.

633
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:07,721
We joined ALVIN on a number
of different expeditions.

634
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:12,005
This time we were diving over a mile
down into the San Diego trench

635
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:15,484
about 40 miles
off the Californian coast.

636
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,523
<i>I'll be tracking you on 12,5,</i>

637
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:22,403
Crammed into the tiny sphere
just 2 metres wide was the pilot,

638
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:24,678
chief scientist Craig Smith...

639
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:29,123
and, once again, our cameraman
Mike deGruy.

640
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:37,005
<i>500 metres, Five - zero - zero,</i>

641
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:42,043
Craig was keen to return
to a particular location

642
00:42:42,287 --> 00:42:44,278
that he had visited
on a previous expedition

643
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:46,558
18 months before.

644
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:49,080
<i>I hear sonar target,</i>

645
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:54,925
<i>North-east at 60 metres,</i>

646
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,646
The sonar found its target -

647
00:42:57,727 --> 00:43:00,241
the skeleton of a 40-tonne grey whale.

648
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:07,519
After a year and a half on the seabed,

649
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:09,598
this was all that was left.

650
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,599
But we first filmed it
as a fresh carcass

651
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:15,485
after just six weeks on the bottom.

652
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:19,560
0riginally, the dead whale had
washed up on the coast of California.

653
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:22,878
With Craig's advice,
we'd paid a local fisherman

654
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:27,080
to drag it out to the San Diego trench,
where it was to be sunk.

655
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,522
Easier said than done.

656
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:33,236
<i>We put 5,000 pounds of weight on it</i>

657
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:36,399
<i>and it was still sticking halfway</i>
<i>out of the water,</i>

658
00:43:36,567 --> 00:43:39,525
<i>We stabbed it full of holes</i>
<i>with cleansing knives</i>

659
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:43,566
<i>and a big spear that the first engineer</i>
<i>made from the ship,</i>

660
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:47,117
<i>He also shot it full of holes</i>
<i>with his ,45 automatic pistol,</i>

661
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:51,002
<i>The gas coming out of it</i>
<i>when you cut holes in it was horrible,</i>

662
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:55,160
But the hard work proved worthwhile.

663
00:43:55,247 --> 00:43:57,807
The carcass attracted
an extraordinary variety

664
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:00,078
of deep-sea scavengers.

665
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,237
<i>SharkI SharkI</i>

666
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,761
<i>0h, geeI He's right out here,</i>

667
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:12,719
0ut of nowhere, a sleeper shark,

668
00:44:12,807 --> 00:44:15,958
a real deep-sea specialist,
and never filmed at this depth before.

669
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:22,517
These sharks and thousands
of hagfish stripped the carcass bare

670
00:44:22,607 --> 00:44:26,998
and this was all that was left
18 months later when we returned.

671
00:44:32,567 --> 00:44:36,037
Craig's main interest in returning
was to collect pieces of bone

672
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:38,318
to take them to the surface.

673
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:40,477
For Mike, it was another opportunity

674
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:43,525
to film this eerie
but fascinating spectacle.

675
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:47,475
<i>It's amazing, It's just evolved,</i>

676
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:49,842
<i>When we first got down there,</i>

677
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:52,316
<i>it looked like no meat, all skeleton,</i>

678
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:54,602
<i>I thought, ''Ah, well, that's great, ''</i>

679
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:58,766
<i>Big rib cages and hagfish</i>
<i>moving through - totally picked clean,</i>

680
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:00,958
<i>Unbelievable, Then, as we settled in,</i>

681
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:04,006
<i>and started looking in detail,</i>

682
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:09,315
<i>we saw mats of all these worms, and</i>
<i>suddenly meat, hagfish grinding away,</i>

683
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:12,286
<i>There's still meat on it</i>
<i>a year and a half later,</i>

684
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:15,001
<i>It was great, And it looks terrific,</i>

685
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,521
<i>Everything worked, Hah, I'm happy,</i>

686
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:22,798
Craig was delighted to get so many
specimens lifted to the surface,

687
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,726
even if they were less than fragrant.

688
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:28,278
<i>They do smell pretty bad,</i>

689
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:33,163
0n the surface, Craig could get
a really close look

690
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,403
at the life living on the bones.

691
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:39,157
0n a previous expedition,
he found 178 species on one vertebra.

692
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:42,007
There's a fascinating community
of animals

693
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:45,404
that seem to be able to survive
in the darkness

694
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:50,158
by breaking down the energy
trapped in the whale's bones.

695
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:54,440
What really fascinates Craig about the
new species discovered on dead whales

696
00:45:54,527 --> 00:45:59,999
is that some are also found in
one other special deep-sea habitat.

697
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:10,564
Two miles down
along the mid-oceanic ridges,

698
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:15,323
extraordinary volcanic activity
emerges out of the seabed

699
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,598
in hydrothermal vents.

700
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:23,600
Scientists were amazed

701
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:25,878
to discover among these vents

702
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,765
one of the richest oases of life
in the deep ocean.

703
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:34,078
Since they were first discovered,

704
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:38,160
a new species has been revealed
every ten days.

705
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:41,325
And what fascinates Craig
is that some of these species

706
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,523
are exactly the same as those

707
00:46:43,807 --> 00:46:45,798
found on his dead whales.

708
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:58,443
Remarkably, Craig believes that
his whale skeletons may be providing

709
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:00,718
vital stepping stones of energy

710
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:04,004
for larvae journeying
to colonise a new vent.

711
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,318
Like so much in the marine world,

712
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:14,399
this science is breaking
the frontiers of knowledge

713
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:17,206
and new discoveries
are made every day.

714
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:29,885
The satellite tags on the blue whales
are still operating today,

715
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:34,358
providing Bruce Mate
with new information round the clock.

716
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:36,517
<i>We've seen animals</i>
<i>tagged on the same day</i>

717
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:38,798
<i>go in dramatically different directions,</i>

718
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:41,799
<i>In the first seven weeks,</i>
<i>one went up to southern 0regon,</i>

719
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:45,118
<i>one was down on the Baja coast,</i>
<i>one was 1,200 miles offshore,</i>

720
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:49,764
<i>Some of those animals have gone all</i>
<i>the way down to the Costa</i> R<i>ican dome,</i>

721
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:54,284
<i>which is about eight degrees north</i>
<i>of the equator and 400 miles offshore,</i>

722
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:58,999
Despite all the efforts
of researchers worldwide,

723
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:03,565
we still do not know
where these giants go to breed.

724
00:48:06,647 --> 00:48:10,959
Like so much about our blue planet,
it remains a mystery.

725
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:45,719
<i>(HUGH) I don't know if we got that shot,</i>

726
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:50,125
<i>(PETE</i>R<i>) We'll get it again,</i>
<i>Go on, get your act together,</i>

727
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:53,205
<i>Bloody producers,</i>
<i>Can't get the staff,</i>
