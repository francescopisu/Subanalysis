1
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,510
The end of the Arctic summer,

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,310
and the sun hasn't set for three months.

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,550
It's hard to imagine the bitter cold
will soon return.

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,310
Some will welcome the chills of autumn,

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,630
but for most, time is running out before
they will have to retreat to the south.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,470
Early autumn in the Canadian Arctic

7
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,310
and polar bears are gathering
on the coastal strip,

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,590
waiting for the sea to freeze.

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,670
But a life spent alone on the sea-ice
is no preparation for a crowded beach.

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,350
Such close contact with other bears
must be stressful.

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,150
Surely tempers will flare.

12
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,870
Over half a tonne of bear
slams into the other.

13
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,870
Polar bears will fight to the death
over mates, but not in autumn.

14
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,830
Now these fearsome predators display

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,910
a surprisingly tolerant side
to their natures.

16
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,950
Being marooned on land
means the bears no longer have access

17
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,310
to the seals they usually hunt

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,750
and they have to scrape by
on whatever they can find.

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,230
Like bears the world over,
they're not choosy feeders.

20
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,070
They even turn vegetarian,

21
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,630
delicately picking out berries
from between the thorns.

22
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,950
There are plenty to go around,

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,790
so there's no need
to squabble over them.

24
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,630
Any fighting is just for fun.

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,590
The bears select sparring partners
who are well-matched

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,550
and they always pull their punches.

27
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,510
No one wants to get hurt
in a play-fight.

28
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,870
Perhaps these bouts
are a way of testing rivals

29
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,070
in case they ever meet again
out on the sea-ice.

30
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,350
One thing's for sure,

31
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,950
the famous loners are revealing
a social, playful side we rarely see.

32
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,230
It's all just boisterous fun,

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,430
but with so many big males around,

34
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,790
the females keep their cubs
at a safe distance.

35
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,030
The wary mother will lead her young
to a quieter beach along the coast

36
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,870
while she waits for the ocean to freeze.

37
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,670
The sea-ice is now
at its minimum extent.

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,750
In the Canadian Arctic,
vast stretches of coastline

39
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,470
are now unlocked
and ready to receive visitors.

40
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,510
Belugas, the white whales of the north.

41
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,510
They're relying on open water
to reach an ancient rendezvous.

42
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,270
It's a journey they make every year
along traditional routes.

43
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,070
Baby belugas ride piggy-back,

44
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,150
pulled along
by their mother's slipstream.

45
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,190
This one is only a month old,

46
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,150
and won't turn white
for another five years.

47
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,790
Thousands of belugas are being drawn

48
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,310
to one special estuary
in the Canadian Arctic.

49
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,590
It isn't food that brings them here.

50
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,550
Curiously, it's personal hygiene.

51
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,590
When the tide is low,
they swim into the shallows

52
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,670
and flail around with great enthusiasm.

53
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,990
They're after a body scrub.

54
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,070
The gravel acts as a loofah

55
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,590
and thrashing their bodies across it
helps to get rid of their old skin.

56
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,670
Presumably the treatment keeps them
clean and streamlined.

57
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,390
But it also appears to feel good.

58
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,670
Bliss!

59
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,030
The water in the estuary is warmer
and less salty

60
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,350
and that seems to soften the skin,
making the scrub more effective.

61
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,510
This secluded estuary
is only a temporary whale spa.

62
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,430
The ocean will soon freeze again,
forcing the whales to travel south.

63
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,750
Vast seabird colonies
are the jewels of the Arctic.

64
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,110
BrÃ¼nnich guillemots have
spent the summer months

65
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,510
packed together on vertical cliffs
beyond the reach of predators.

66
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,630
They are among the most numerous
seabirds in the Northern Hemisphere.

67
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,910
This colony alone contains 100, 000 birds

68
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,910
and there are many more like it
all along the Arctic coastline.

69
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,030
In just a few weeks,
these cliffs will empty,

70
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,950
but before the guillemots can leave,
their chicks must fledge.

71
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,870
Their feathers are now fully formed,

72
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,110
but their stubby wings are still
too short for them to fly properly.

73
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,790
This will be a challenge.

74
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,590
It's a 150-metre drop

75
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,790
and they need to make it
all the way to the sea.

76
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,110
Here goes.

77
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,830
He falls short
and survives the crash landing.

78
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,070
The chicks are manna from heaven
for an Arctic fox.

79
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,070
The next chick is accompanied
by a parent.

80
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,550
Failed again.

81
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,630
This looks better.

82
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,270
Success!

83
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,110
Aquatic landings are certainly gentler

84
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,670
and foxes can't reach you out here.

85
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,190
The chicks will stay in
their parents' care for another month.

86
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,350
The guillemots are not
the only ones preparing to leave.

87
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,510
All across the Arctic,
millions of summer visitors

88
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,030
are beginning to return south.

89
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,510
The guillemot chicks can't fly yet,

90
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,830
so they and their families must swim
to their winter feeding grounds.

91
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,310
It's a journey that will take them
a thousand miles south to the open ocean

92
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,830
and away from the approaching ice.

93
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,070
The breeding season is over
and silence returns to the Arctic.

94
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,310
But as the first storms of autumn

95
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,790
sweep through
the deserted nesting grounds,

96
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,990
they bring an unexpected bonanza
for the few that remain.

97
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,790
The discovery doesn't
remain secret for long.

98
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,830
It's a huge fin whale carcass.

99
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,910
The polar bears have been drawn
from several miles away,

100
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,990
guided by their extraordinary sense
of smell.

101
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,830
Bears are arriving all the time,

102
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,830
but there's plenty of room
at this 18-metre long dining table.

103
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,990
They're surprisingly relaxed,

104
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,590
but with enough for everyone,
there's no need to argue.

105
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,670
The tastiest morsels
are often underwater.

106
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,390
Others prefer some greens
with their dinner.

107
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,350
After a well-balanced meal,

108
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,470
there's nothing better
than some good company.

109
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,230
Despite their reputation as loners,

110
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,990
it's surprising
just how sociable polar bears can be.

111
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,950
All across the Arctic,
the temperature is now dropping

112
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,750
and the sea is beginning to freeze.

113
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,350
Every day over 20,000 square miles
of ocean turn to ice

114
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,030
as the cold spreads south.

115
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,230
At first, a thin, greasy film
appears on the surface.

116
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,030
Next, pancakes of ice start to appear.

117
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,030
The pancakes lock together
and form a continuous sheet.

118
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,590
The Arctic Ocean is freezing again.

119
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,990
At last, the bear family can return
to the sea-ice, where they belong.

120
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,270
It's been six months since
the cubs first emerged from the den.

121
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,310
They've survived the hazards
of melting sea-ice in spring

122
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,430
and lack of food in summer,

123
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,310
and now, at last,
they are in their element again.

124
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,910
As the north of our planet
turns away from the sun,

125
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,670
the big chill travels south.

126
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,030
Temperatures on the tundra
start to fall.

127
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,150
The shorter days and colder nights
trigger a dramatic change

128
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,750
in the willows and blueberry bushes.

129
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,150
They stop producing the green pigment
that harnesses the sun's energy.

130
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,470
And red and yellow pigments
build up in their leaves.

131
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,630
The tundra blazes with colour
and the whole landscape is transformed.

132
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,470
A bull musk ox marks his territory
with scent from the glands on his face.

133
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,510
He's preparing for the breeding season.

134
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,190
He shadows his harem of females

135
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,590
as they graze the last
of the summer grasses.

136
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,350
He must be on his guard.

137
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,150
An outsider is arriving,

138
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,390
a large male
whose intentions soon become clear.

139
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,550
The newcomer circles
the resident bull warily.

140
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,550
The resident must take up
the intruder's challenge.

141
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,830
This clash of polar Titans could
easily become a fight to the death.

142
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,950
The impact is like a car crash
at 30 miles an hour.

143
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,270
A heavy skull
and a helmet of horn four inches thick

144
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,990
provide some protection
for the musk ox's brain.

145
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,590
Over the next half hour,
the advantage ebbs and flows,

146
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,590
as each tries to finish the duel.

147
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,710
If one can turn the other
and gore its flank,

148
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,710
the fight will be over.

149
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,910
The stakes rise as the risk of injury
or even death increases.

150
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,270
The rival is out-manoeuvred.

151
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,310
And the champion returns to his females.

152
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,950
By now, most animals
have migrated south,

153
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,470
but the musk oxen
with their thick coats will stay

154
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,870
and face the approaching winter.

155
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,990
As autumn progresses,

156
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,350
the moisture in the air freezes
and hoarfrost decorates the leaves.

157
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,270
Ice crystals grow like diamonds
on every twig.

158
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,270
All across the tundra, both the rivers
and the ground freeze solid.

159
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,870
Glassy cathedrals form, as the remaining
water becomes locked up as ice.

160
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,510
Soon, even the largest waterfalls
will be motionless.

161
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,390
The tundra has been transformed
once again.

162
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,270
It appears deserted.

163
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,510
Caribou on their migration.

164
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,070
Unlike the musk ox,
caribou do head south for the winter,

165
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,110
but it's a long and difficult journey.

166
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,790
They use the frozen lakes as ice roads.

167
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,230
These are flat and firm,

168
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,750
but it seems hooves and ice
were never really meant to go together.

169
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,430
The frisky males would be well-advised

170
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,950
to keep at least one eye on the road
as the mating season begins.

171
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,830
A cow is being closely guarded
by a mature bull,

172
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,110
with his much larger antlers.

173
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,070
The females are busy feeding up
for the winter,

174
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,390
but the bull has other things
on his mind.

175
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,270
The cow is playing hard to get.

176
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,790
She heads off with her admirer
in pursuit.

177
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,030
Several other bulls join in the chase.

178
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,350
She's out in front,

179
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,190
but the amorous males
are gaining on her.

180
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,030
The big bull breaks off his chase
to deal with a rival.

181
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,070
But now he's fallen behind
the other challengers.

182
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,470
The younger bulls,
with their lighter antlers,

183
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,510
keep up with the cow more easily,

184
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,750
but as the pace slows,
the older bull catches up.

185
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,310
Again he has to stop and fight.

186
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,630
A decisive victory for the big male.

187
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,270
He's earned the respect
of the vanquished bulls

188
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,510
and they now trail in his wake.

189
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,550
It's now become a game
of Grandma's Footsteps.

190
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,270
One look from the boss

191
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,950
and the young-bloods freeze
in their tracks.

192
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,550
The exhausted bull guards his prize,

193
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,270
but he'll need to recover before he is
able to make the most of his victory.

194
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,910
And the herd continues its journey south

195
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,790
to avoid the worst
of the advancing cold.

196
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,430
From the ocean to the tundra,

197
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,670
the north of our planet
is now completely frozen.

198
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,350
The Antarctic.

199
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,950
In the far south,

200
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,830
autumn can be a particularly savage
and unpredictable time.

201
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,790
South Georgia is a splinter of rock

202
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,670
in the middle
of the vast Southern Ocean.

203
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,990
It's only 100 miles long
and is battered by the elements.

204
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,830
This ocean generates some of
the largest waves on the planet.

205
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,630
They gain size and power
as they travel around the globe,

206
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,030
uninterrupted by land for 12,000 miles.

207
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,990
As they buffet South Georgia,
they also bring food.

208
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,950
A seal carcass.

209
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,630
A prize worth braving the surf for.

210
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,830
Giant petrels are the vultures
of Antarctica

211
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,950
and are always the first to the spoils.

212
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,110
The word is out and the hordes move in.

213
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,190
Like feathered dinosaurs,
they lock beaks in battle.

214
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,990
These butchers provide a service
for some unlikely meat-eaters.

215
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,310
With the carcasses now opened,
pintail ducks arrive for a meal.

216
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,030
There's plenty of good food here

217
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,590
and none of South Georgia's inhabitants

218
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,150
can afford to be fussy
with winter looming.

219
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,070
After the feast,
it's time for a rinse and spin.

220
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,590
The breeding season is finally over

221
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,750
and the petrels will
soon be heading out to sea

222
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,390
to avoid the worst of the winter.

223
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,150
A snowstorm is an omen
of things to come.

224
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,470
There is now little left to eat

225
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,990
and South Georgia's beaches will soon be
abandoned to the cold and ice.

226
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,310
Further south still,

227
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,830
and the first storms are
striking the continent of Antarctica.

228
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,910
The AdÃ©lie penguins must rear
their half-grown chicks to adulthood

229
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,190
before winter hits
in just a few weeks' time.

230
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,630
The chicks are only three weeks old.

231
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,630
Their downy coats
aren't fully waterproof yet

232
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,310
and they cluster together for warmth.

233
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,830
These crÃ¨ches are essential
during bad weather,

234
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,670
as most of the adults are away at sea
fishing for their fast-growing families.

235
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,630
When the parents return,

236
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,550
their offspring quickly leave
the comfort of their peers.

237
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,790
Both chicks are ravenously hungry.

238
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,870
But there may be only
enough food for one.

239
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,830
This race could determine
which chick has the better prospects.

240
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,710
Most AdÃ©lie pairs will only manage
to raise a single chick each season.

241
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,190
And this may not be it.

242
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,030
At least number one
is getting stronger by the day.

243
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,750
With one meal delivered,
the parents must quickly find another.

244
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,470
To rear their chicks
before the onset of winter,

245
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,510
the penguins must work round the clock.

246
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,790
The parents can travel over 100 miles
to reach the best fishing grounds

247
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,430
and may be gone
for several days at a time.

248
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,030
They return with a kilogram
of fish and squid in their bellies,

249
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,310
feed their chicks

250
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,590
and then go off again
to repeat the process.

251
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,150
The job must be finished
before the sea freezes over again.

252
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,510
At seven weeks old,

253
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,870
the chicks are losing the last
of their baby down,

254
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,830
and are now fully equipped
to take the plunge.

255
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,510
Confidence is all that's lacking.

256
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,070
Perhaps it'll help
if the parents lead by example.

257
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,790
There. Effortless
and as graceful as any fish.

258
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,590
It seems penguins are not born
with a love of water.

259
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,470
Staying submerged is the next problem.

260
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,070
Buoyancy control is clearly a skill
that needs practice.

261
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,990
Well, it's a start.

262
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,070
And at least
they can now reach the ice floes.

263
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,230
Swimming is the first of many lessons.

264
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,510
They must next learn
to recognise danger in all its forms.

265
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,950
A leopard seal.

266
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,430
Even high up on an ice floe,
the penguins aren't safe.

267
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,070
Each year, leopard seals will take
5, 000 of them from this colony alone.

268
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,430
The AdÃ©lies that survive drift out
into the Southern Ocean.

269
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,270
They will spend the next five months
feeding at sea,

270
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,950
avoiding the great freeze
that is about to envelop Antarctica.

271
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,150
The edge of the sea-ice advances
by up to two and a half miles a day.

272
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,230
Eventually, over five million
square miles of ice

273
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,710
will surround the continent
of Antarctica,

274
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,070
effectively doubling its size.

275
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,350
The great white wilderness is empty.

276
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,990
But not for long.

277
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,590
Bizarrely, it's now that
the emperor penguins arrive,

278
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,430
just as all the other penguins
have left.

279
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,310
These giants are now at their heaviest.

280
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,630
They've been feeding at sea all summer
and can weigh 40 kilos.

281
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,790
From the edge of the sea-ice,
they head towards their colony.

282
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,630
But an obstacle course of
jumbled ice blocks stands in their way.

283
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,150
The males are particularly fat
at this time of year.

284
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,470
This will be crucial for
their survival in the months ahead,

285
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,430
but it doesn't make squeezing
through narrow gaps any easier.

286
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,790
With the worst behind them,

287
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,510
they start a 20-mile march
into the freezer to breed,

288
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,550
the only animals to do so.

289
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,110
By tobogganing, they can travel
at twice their walking speed

290
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,870
and it takes the weight off tired feet.

291
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,350
Their destination is the thicker ice
closer to shore,

292
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,150
which will stay solid long enough
for them to safely rear their chicks

293
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,470
throughout the months to come.

294
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,670
Their colony is in the lee of icebergs
trapped in the frozen ocean,

295
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,070
which will shelter them
from the bitter Antarctic winds.

296
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,670
Newly formed pairs promenade together.

297
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:51,590
Courtship demands that both partners
strike and hold a variety of poses.

298
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,630
It's an important process,

299
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,270
as the bond between the couple will have
to be an exceptionally strong one.

300
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,910
The final act lacks the elegance
of the prelude,

301
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,710
but at least it's quick.

302
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,430
The egg is laid a few days later.

303
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,070
It contains the female's last reserves.

304
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,870
She now has nothing more to give

305
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,030
and must pass the egg to the male
to incubate.

306
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,430
The couple must be quick.

307
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,990
If the egg rests on the ice
for too long, it'll freeze.

308
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,390
With their eggs safe in the care
of the males,

309
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,430
the females start the long journey
back to the sea.

310
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,230
The sun is also leaving
and will be gone for many months.

311
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,990
The precious eggs,
balanced on the males' feet,

312
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,790
will make the terrible ordeal ahead
worthwhile.

313
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,750
With no food
and only each other for warmth,

314
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,270
they will attempt
to keep the next generation alive

315
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,150
while surviving
in the most brutal conditions on Earth.

316
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,670
Not all of them will succeed.

317
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,190
At both ends of our planet,

318
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,430
the sun sets for the last time
in autumn.

319
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,630
A season of change comes to an end

320
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,830
and one of endless darkness
and bitter cold begins.

321
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,030
The spectacular return
of the emperor penguins

322
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,950
was a key event
for the Frozen Planet team.

323
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,550
The crew will have to operate

324
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,510
in the most dangerous
of all polar environments,

325
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,590
the edge of the sea-ice.

326
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,470
They have to fly in
everything they'll need

327
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,350
for a month of living
on the frozen ocean.

328
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,350
On board are slow-motion cameraman
John Aitchison,

329
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,390
underwater cameraman Didier Noirot
and director Chadden Hunter.

330
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,150
With the plane gone,
the team are on their own.

331
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,550
This is home for the next month.

332
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,310
But it doesn't look like much right now.

333
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,670
Their tents should be secure
on the permanent sea-ice,

334
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,550
but they're still miles from the ocean,
where they hope to film.

335
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,550
The locals are keen to get acquainted

336
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,630
with anything
of a familiar shape and size.

337
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,950
The emperors are welcome neighbours
around the camp,

338
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,790
but the team need to film them returning
from the water

339
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,990
and to do that,
they face a daunting task.

340
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,350
They must find a path to the open sea

341
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,510
through a shifting landscape
of jagged sea-ice.

342
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,030
Their first scouting trip
doesn't look promising.

343
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,990
Neither maps nor sat-nav are any help
in this everchanging environment.

344
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,510
The only clue that the ocean
lies somewhere to the east

345
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,910
is a steady procession of penguins.

346
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,270
Any suggestions, Didier?

347
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,870
- We must find a way.
- Yes.

348
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,870
And we will find a way.

349
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,190
I like the attitude.

350
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,110
The penguins have found a way.

351
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,990
It seems the emperors
will be the key

352
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,430
to reaching the ice edge.

353
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,750
Okay, let's go.

354
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,470
With their penguin guides
leading the way,

355
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,630
snowmobiles are brought in
to haul 500 kilograms of equipment

356
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,550
through the icy maze.

357
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,710
It's tough going for film crew
and penguins.

358
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,710
When the ice ridges halt progress,
it's time for some back-breaking work.

359
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,830
The next three days are spent chiselling

360
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,590
through mile after mile
of broken sea-ice.

361
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,470
Once finally clear of the ice boulders,
they spot their goal,

362
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,790
a patch of open ocean with penguins.

363
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,790
John is first in position.

364
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,470
He hopes to capture
the most striking images

365
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,990
by using a computerised
slow-motion camera.

366
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,630
But attempts
to film the penguins underwater

367
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,310
are halted by an unwelcome visitor.

368
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,950
We just saw the head
of a massive leopard seal.

369
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,150
So we'll get closer
to see what's going on.

370
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,310
We must be careful, because those guys

371
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,190
can come out very quickly
out of the hole and give a bite,

372
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,430
but being red like that,
we should be quite protected, you know?

373
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,430
Being dressed in red
may be Didier's idea of safety,

374
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,590
but the rest of the crew have
a healthy respect for leopard seals.

375
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,270
They can be fiercely territorial
and are not afraid to attack humans.

376
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,630
I think I can run faster
than him on land.

377
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,670
That's very exciting,

378
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,950
that's the first time I've ever seen
a leopard seal in my life.

379
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,750
And he's come straight out of the hole
and starts walloping towards us.

380
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,990
So there's a lot of adrenaline.

381
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,030
With the seal
frightening the penguins away

382
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,470
and hassling the crew,
it's time to try a new hole.

383
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,430
Oh, hello.

384
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,630
Can you see him?

385
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,150
While the seal is around,

386
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,430
there's little hope
of filming the penguins.

387
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,670
But now a far greater threat is posed
by the changing weather.

388
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,790
That dark headland in the distance
is Cape Washington.

389
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,870
That's our last sign of mainland.

390
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,190
We can't see anything else.

391
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,910
Once we lose sight of that mainland,

392
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,870
that means we're out here
on our own on the sea-ice

393
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,070
and this visibility is getting
lower and lower.

394
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,830
It's started snowing
and this wind is just blowing off-shore,

395
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,430
so if all this ice heads out,
we don't want to be on it.

396
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,150
So I think we're going to
can filming for the day.

397
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,550
All the signs suggest that
a big Antarctic storm is on its way.

398
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,910
Winds pick up to 70 miles an hour
and everyone retreats to their tents.

399
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,270
High winds then turn to heavy snow.

400
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,990
On the driest continent on Earth,
a big snowfall is rare.

401
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,790
White-out conditions take the penguins
and the film crew by surprise.

402
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,550
Each day they must dig out
their buried equipment,

403
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,710
filming has ground to a halt.

404
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,750
One week and a metre of snow later,
the headland is visible again

405
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,390
and the team are raring
to get back to the ice edge.

406
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,510
They follow their old route
back through the frozen maze

407
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,310
and with no leopard seal in sight,

408
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,670
it's time for another attempt
with the pole cam.

409
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,630
It's cumbersome, but it allows the team
to capture underwater images

410
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,830
without having to risk
the icy water themselves.

411
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,590
- That is okay?
- That's perfect.

412
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,710
They are coming, I can see some.

413
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,030
Oh, wow.
Oh, penguin's coming in the hole.

414
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,390
This is awesome, this is great.

415
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,950
The aim now is
to film the penguins' dramatic exit

416
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,310
from the hole.

417
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,990
The only problem, which hole?

418
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,510
These penguins keep outsmarting us.

419
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,790
We tried to switch holes
to film them coming up

420
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,790
and of course, they all just
completely came up behind us.

421
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,950
Whatever the crew try,

422
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,230
there's always someone
who hasn't read the script.

423
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,710
John has been filming,

424
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,510
but he can't view his slow-motion shots
until they are downloaded to a computer.

425
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,510
While he waits,
Didier seizes his chance.

426
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,390
Come, my friend, come.

427
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,110
If you can't beat them, join them.

428
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,230
It's time to go scuba diving
in the coldest waters on the planet.

429
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,870
I will see you on the other side.

430
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,510
The team are 300 miles from help

431
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,350
and have only a small hole
as their lifeline to the surface.

432
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,550
A magical world opens up.

433
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,430
For the first time, Didier now shares
the penguins' perspective

434
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,710
from beneath the ice.

435
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,910
This is Antarctica
at its most enchanting.

436
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,910
For Chadden, after weeks of struggle,

437
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,470
the sequence quite literally
falls into his lap.

438
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,150
Whoa!

439
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,630
Sorry!

440
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,470
I think I'm in the way.

441
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,630
Up they go.

442
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,070
Oh! Just a little...
Come this way. Here we go.

443
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,030
I'm getting run over by penguins. Ooh!

444
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,910
I think it worked.
It's very difficult to tell.

445
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,190
John's camera
is finally capturing

446
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,830
the super-slow-motion images
of the emperors' dramatic return.

447
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,470
With the penguins performing perfectly,
it was all falling into place.

448
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,870
The team were finally able
to capture Antarctica's

449
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,470
most spectacular belly flop.
