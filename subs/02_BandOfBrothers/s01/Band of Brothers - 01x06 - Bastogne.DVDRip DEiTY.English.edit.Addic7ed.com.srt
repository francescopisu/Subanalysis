00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,984
WHEN WE LEFT

4
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,420
WE WERE SHORT
OF EQUlPMENT,

5
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,123
WE DlDN'T HAVE

00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,319
BUT WE HAD CONFlDENCE

MlLlTARY AUTHORlTlES

9
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,468

WE WERE DUG lN

00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,541
THE GERMANS KNEW
RlGHT WHERE WE WERE

13
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,743

THERE WAS THlS,
THE FOG WAS lN,

17
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,119
THEY COULDN'T DROP US,
COULDN'T RE-SUPPLY US.

00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,022
EVERY TlME THEY TRlED

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,559
THEY MlSSED US
