A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

3
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,583
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D GET THROUGH D-DAY.

4
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,155
LET ALONE THE NEXT PHASE
OR THE NEXT PHASE.

5
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,857
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
GET KILLED INSTANTLY.

6
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,893
I THOUGHT ONE
OF TWO THINGS:

7
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,191
A QUICK DEATH,
ER, OR...

8
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,998
I'D COME THROUGH PROBABLY
WITHOUT A SCRATCH.

9
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,833
I THINK EVERYBODY
HAD FEAR.

10
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,735
I THINK THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT CAN HANDLE FEAR.

11
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,300
I THINK...

12
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:56,042
I THINK I WAS
PROBABLY ONE OF THEM.

13
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,577
I THINK I WAS
JUST AS...

14
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,613
SCARED AS ANYBODY ELSE
EXCEPT I COULD THINK.

15
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,743
IT'S A FEELING YOU WOULD
NOT LET YOURSELF DOWN,

16
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,984
AND YOU WOULD NOT LET YOUR
CAMRADES OR YOUR UNIT DOWN.

17
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,125
WE ALL HAD FEAR...

18
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,617
BUT WE ALL HAD
TRAINING TO KNOW THAT...

19
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,498
YOU TRY TO HANDLE
YOUR FEAR

20
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,667
AND WORK TO ACCOMPLISH

21
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,693
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING.

22
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,618
HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.

23
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,095
YOU KNOW,
FROM 1st PLATOON?

24
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,926
OUR 1st PLATOON?

25
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,754
IT SURE DOES.

26
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,229
BLITHE.

27
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,807

( gunfire )

30
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,287
THOUGHT THAT
WAS YOU.

31
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,263
YOU ALONE?

32
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,839
YOU'RE THE FIRST
FAMILIAR FACES I'VE SEEN.

33
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,907
I AIN'T SURPRISED.

34
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,009
THEY DROPPED US
ALL OVER THE PENINSULA.

35
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,003
WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING
WITH THE 502nd
SINCE WE HIT THE GROUND.

36
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:15,945
YOU?

37
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,448
OH, I'VE BEEN...

38
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,447
TRYING TO FIND EASY.

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,182
JOIN THE CLUB.

40
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,598

41
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,184
HEY, FELLAS.

00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,592
HEY, TAB,

THAT'S A BEAUTY,
SARGE.

52
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,163
MY LUGER'S GONNA PUT YOU
ALL TO SHAME WHEN I GET IT.

53
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,379
HOW WAS YOUR JUMP?

54
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,548

00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,193

PREVIOUS OWNERS.

62
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,653

63
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,326
HEY.

64
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,372

THAT'S GOOD.

69
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,116
YOU RUN INTO LIEUTENANT MEEHAN
IN YOUR TRAVELS?

70
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,217
NO, WHY?

71
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,919
COMPANY HQ'S
STILL MISSING.

72
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,021
THEY THINK THE PLANE
WENT DOWN.

73
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,289
THEY SAY
HE'S GONNA TURN UP.

74
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,491
YEAH, I AIN'T
HOLDING MY BREATH.

75
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,789
WHO'S IN COMMAND,

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,895
WINTERS FOR NOW.

77
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,764

I WANT LIGHT AND NOISE
DISCIPLINE FROM HERE ON.

00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,153

89
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,527
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

90
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,230
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE ARMOR FROM OMAHA
AND UTAH BEACH

91
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,364
CAN LINK UP
AND HEAD INLAND.

92
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,000
UNTIL WE TAKE CARENTAN,
THEY'RE STUCK IN THE SAND.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,170
GENERAL TAYLOR'S SENDING
THE WHOLE DIVISION.

00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,490
FLIES SPREAD DISEASE.

108
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,834

109
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,545
DON'T WAKE JERRY.

WHY HAVE

126
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,980
THIS IS ABOUT OFFICERS
CRAPPING OUT IN
THEIR TRAINING, NIX.

127
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,643
COME ON, LET'S GET

133
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,681
I CAN HEAR Y'ALL ALL THE WAY
ACROSS THE FIELD.

134
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,512
YOU "F" COMPANY?

135
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,573

WHERE Y'ALL BEEN?

137
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,191

DID YOU FIND
FOX COMPANY?

143
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,909
YES, SIR.

144
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,586
I THOUGHT HE...

145
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,554
I THOUGHT
HE HAD ME.

146
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,627
FALLSCHIRMJAGER.

147
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,361
PARATROOPER?

148
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,496
DIVISION THINKS
THERE'S A REGIMENT OF 'EM

149
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,130
HOLDING CARENTAN.

150
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,531
WELL, THERE'S ONE LESS

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,468
YEAH.

152
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,869
THAT'S EDELWEISS.

153
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,339
THAT ONLY GROWS IN THE ALPS
ABOVE THE TREE LINE,

154
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,642
WHICH MEANS HE CLIMBED
UP THERE TO GET IT.

155
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,806
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE MARK
OF A TRUE SOLDIER.

156
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,902
I WANT YOU TAKE THE 1st

00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,853
OUT OF TOWN,
LIEUTENANT?

363
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,013
ALREADY?

364
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,878
THAT'S RIGHT.

365
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:41,927
DON'T THEY KNOW
WE'RE JUST GETTING
SETTLED HERE?

366
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,096
NlCE, GROUCHO.

367
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,173
WHAT?

368
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,075
REAL SMART.

369
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,911
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR LIFE IN YOUR OWN HANDS.

370
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,179
AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

371
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,048
I TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY SEE IT.

372
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,450
WHAT, SPEIRS SHOOTING
THE PRISONERS

373
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,452
OR THE SERGEANT
IN HIS OWN PLATOON?

374
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,186
SERGEANT?

375
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,187
I DIDN'T
HEAR THAT ONE.

376
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,321
HE SHOT ONE OF
HIS OWN GUYS?

377
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,457
WELL, SUPPOSEDLY
THE GUY WAS DRUNK

378
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,891
AND REFUSED TO
GO ON A PATROL.

379
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,189
WHO KNOWS IF
IT'S TRUE?

380
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,198
WELL, I KNOW A GUY
WHO SAID AN EYEWITNESS

381
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,998
TOLD HIM THAT SPEIRS
HOSED THESE PRISONERS.

382
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:17,999
WHY?

383
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,471
WHAT FOR?

384
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,665
ON D-DAY.

385
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,742
SPEIRS COMES ACROSS THIS
GROUP OF KRAUT PRISONERS

386
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,370
DIGGING A HOLE
O SOME SUCH.

387
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,246
UNDER GUARD
AND ALL.

388
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,016
HE BREAKS OUT
A PACK OF SMOKES,

389
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,017
PASSES THEM OUT.

390
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,485
HE EVEN GIVES
'EM A LIGHT.

391
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,391
THEN, ALL OF
A SUDDEN,

392
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,985
HE SWINGS UP
HlS THOMPSON...

393
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,091
AND HE HOSES 'EM.

394
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,503
I MEAN, GODDAMN,
GIVES 'EM SMOKES FIRST?

395
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:56,241
MMM, YOU SEE THAT'S
WHY I DON'T BELIEVE
HE REALLY DID IT.

396
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,142
OH, YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IT?

397
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,440
I HEARD HE
DIDN'T DO IT.

398
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,254
OH, NO, NO,
IT WAS HIM ALRIGHT.

399
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,389
BUT IT WAS MORE
THAN EIGHT GUYS.

400
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,357
IT WAS MORE
LIKE 20.

401
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,797
HELL OF A SHOT.

402
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,924
ALL EXCEPT ONE GUY...

403
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,834
WHO HE LEFT ALONE.

404
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,571
WELL, ALL I KNOW,
FROM WHAT I HEARD,

405
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,574
HE TOOK THAT LAST 105 IN D-DAY
PRACTICALLY BY HIMSELF.

406
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,710
RUNNING THROUGH
MG FIRE LIKE A MANIAC.

407
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,545
YEAH, THAT
I DID SEE.

408
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,379
ON HIS OWN?
YEAH.

409
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,048
I DON'T CARE IF ANY OF
THE OTHER STUFF'S TRUE.

410
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,049
HEY, ALBERT.

411
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,040
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

412
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,187
I DON'T KNOW.

413
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,557
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
EVERYBODY'S WORD FOR IT.

414
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,758
I DIDN'T SEE
ANY OF IT.

415
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,594
LET'S GO, 1st PLATOON,
WEAPONS ON ME.

416
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,895
WE'RE MOVING OUT.

417
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,796
HEY, TAKE ALL
YOUR SMOKES.

418
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,732
ON YOUR FEET,
TACTICAL COLUMN.

419
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,222
FLANKERS, UP.

420
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,803
THAT MEANS YOU,
PRIVATE BLITHE.

421
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,135
COME ON, BLITHE,
GET UP.

422
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:25,663
HEY, LADS?

423
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:26,164
WHAT?

424
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,298
HOW FAR WE GOING?

425
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,135
OH, JESUS CHRIST,
FRANK, I DON'T KNOW.

426
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,695
UNTIL THEY
TELL US TO STOP.

427
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,671
HIGH GROUND.

428
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,840
THERE'S HIGH
GROUND UP AHEAD.

429
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,409
OKAY, GENIUS,
ANSWER ME THIS THEN:

430
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,614
WHY IS EASY COMPANY THE ONLY
COMPANY WHO'S EITHER AT

431
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,983
THE FRONT OF AN ADVANCE
OR, LIKE NOW,

432
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,719
EXPOSED AT THE FAR
EDGE OF THE LINE?

433
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,487
TO KEEP YOU
ON YOUR TOES.

434
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,522
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

435
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,091
I'M SAYING THAT WE'RE
NEVER IN THE MIDDLE.

436
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,828
AND WE'RE THE FIFTH OF NINE
COMPANIES OF THIS REGIMENT.

437
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,930
"ABLE" THROUGH "ITEM".

438
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,597
THINK OF IT.

439
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,299
SEE THERE,

440
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,630

HEY, LIEUTENANT,

00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,723
OH, SAME AS IT WAS

00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,159
THEY'RE IN THEIR HEDGEROW,

459
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,561
SPELL ME

WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE AID STATION TODAY?

468
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,091
DOC ROE,

469
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,185
HE CALLED IT
HYSTERICAL BLINDNESS.

470
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,400
NO, THANK YOU, SIR.

471
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,168
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAID ON BASIC:

472
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,604
DEHYDRATION'S
A SOLDIER'S WORST ENEMY.

473
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:25,773
YEAH.

474
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,503
IT'S A GAME,
BLITHE.

475
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,279
THAT'S ALL.

476
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,521
HELL, WE'RE JUST
MOVING THE BALL FORWARD

477
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,156
ONE YARD AT A TIME.

478
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,124
NOTHING BUT A GAME.

479
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,185
WHAT IS, SIR?

480
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:47,732

481
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,461
THE WHOLE THING.

482
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:51,763
NO.

483
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,764
THANK YOU, SIR.

486
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:14,559

488
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,428
THE REST PULLED OUT

00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,630
I KNEW THAT TOWN

490
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,494
YEAH.

491
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,302
THEY REGROUPED
SOUTH OF TOWN.

492
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,305
MAY HAVE BEEN ON THEIR WAY
TO A COUNTERATTACK

493
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,207
WHEN WE RAN
INTO 'EM HERE.

494
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,038
STRENGTH UNKNOWN.

495
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:33,908
( gunfire )

496
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,248
THEY WANT
THE TOWN BACK.

497
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,478

IN THEIR WAY.

498
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,652

00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,729

I'LL SURVIVE.

503
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,700

507
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,124

MEDIC!

518
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,645
I'M SIRRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

519
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,280
HE LOOKED
LIKE A KRAUT.

520
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,415
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS HIM.

521
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,149
YEAH, I CAN
BREATHE.

522
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,451
LOOK AT ME,

523
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,452
CAN YOU BREATHE?

00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,553
YEAH, I CAN
BREATHE!

525
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:53,081
I'M JUST GONNA PUT SOME
SULPHUR ON THE WIUND, FLOYD.

526
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,327
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

527
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,032
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S COMING
FROM 3rd PLATOON.

528
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,543
YOU WANNA GET
SOME SLEEP?

529
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,740
I DON'T THINK,
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

530
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,540
THEN GO
TAKE A LOOK.

531
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:24,953
SARGE.

532
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,806
( groaning )

533
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,253
FLASH.

534
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,057
THUNDER, THUNDER!

535
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,355
LIEUTENANT SPEIRS, SIR.

536
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,996
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
PRIVATE?

537
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,362
CHECK OUT
THE NOISE, SIR.

538
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,067
I JUST CAME
FROM THERE.

539
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,627
EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL.

I THINK IT WAS THESE

554
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:21,267
WHEN I WOKE UP, I DIDN'T
