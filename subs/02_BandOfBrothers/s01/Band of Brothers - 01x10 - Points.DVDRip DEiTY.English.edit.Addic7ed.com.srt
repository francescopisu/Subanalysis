SlDEARM, CILINEL.

204
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,147
( Narrator )
Heroic dead of a combined
army and marine force

205
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,086
mark the grim
battlefield of Ikinawa,

206
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,056
where one of the bloodiest
engagements of the war

207
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:51,590
is being fought.

208
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,092
Thousands of Yanks
have been wounded...

209
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,491
HEY, SHARPE.

210
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,434
Along the jap's
southern defense line,

211
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,202
the Yanks
progress slowly,

212
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,904
facing one of the fiercest
artillery barrages of the war.

213
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,840
Each small advance is
gained by sheer grit

214
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,177
in the face of withering
fire from a suicidal enemy

215
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,680
being slowly hammered
back into the hills.

216
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,649
The going is brutal
and our casualties are high,

217
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,987
but Ikinawa is
the next big step
towards victory over japan.

218
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,723
A victory that can
only be won by work,

219
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,658
war bonds, and
heroic sacrifice.

220
