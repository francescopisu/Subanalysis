1
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,874
The oceans, seemingly limitless,

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,314
invoke in us a sense of awe and wonder
and also sometimes fear.

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,311
They cover 70% of the surface
of our planet,

4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,117
and yet they are still
the least explored.

5
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,630
Hidden beneath the waves
right beneath my feet,

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,152
there are creatures
beyond our imagination.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,310
<i>With revolutionary technology,</i>
<i>we can enter new worlds...</i>

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,193
<i>...and shine a light on behaviours</i>

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,432
<i>in ways that were impossible</i>
<i>just a generation ago.</i>

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,080
We've also recognised
an uncomfortable fact.

11
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,990
The health of our ocean is under threat.

12
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,070
They're changing at a faster rate
than ever before in human history.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,480
<i>Never has there been a more crucial time</i>

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,998
<i>to reveal what is going on</i>
<i>beneath the surface of the seas.</i>

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,991
<i>In this first episode,</i>

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,960
<i>we will journey across the globe</i>
<i>from the warm waters of the tropics</i>

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,799
<i>to the coldest around the poles.</i>

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,756
<i>To bring us a new understanding</i>
<i>of live beneath the waves.</i>

19
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,710
This is <i>Blue Planet II.</i>

20
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,800
<i>The surface of the ocean conceals</i>
<i>the many creatures that live beneath</i>

21
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,559
<i>but not all.</i>

22
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,033
<i>Bottlenose dolphins.</i>

23
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,835
<i>They're extremely intelligent.</i>

24
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,756
<i>And with this intelligence</i>
<i>comes playfulness.</i>

25
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,040
<i>They surf.</i>

26
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,669
<i>And as far as we can tell,</i>
<i>they do so for the sheer joy of it.</i>

27
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,479
<i>But to properly appreciate</i>
<i>their true character,</i>

28
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,032
<i>you have to travel with them</i>
<i>into their world.</i>

29
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,360
<i>A pod of bottlenose dolphins is visiting</i>
<i>a coral reef in the Red Sea.</i>

30
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,237
<i>For the youngsters,</i>
<i>there are things to be learned here.</i>

31
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,196
The adults lead a calf
to a particular bush-like coral

32
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,956
<i>called a Gorgonian.</i>

33
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,034
<i>And here, the adults behave</i>
<i>rather strangely.</i>

34
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,709
<i>They deliberately rub themselves</i>
<i>through the fronds.</i>

35
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,632
<i>Their calf seems reluctant to do so.</i>

36
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,680
<i>By watching his elders,</i>

37
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,754
<i>he may be realising</i>
<i>that this is something he ought to do.</i>

38
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,230
<i>Gorgonia fronds, in fact,</i>
<i>are covered with a mucous</i>

39
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,957
<i>that can have anti-inflammatory</i>
<i>and antimicrobial properties.</i>

40
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,514
<i>So maybe the adult dolphins</i>
<i>are doing this</i>

41
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,717
<i>to protect themselves from infection.</i>

42
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,639
<i>The dolphins' intimate knowledge</i>
<i>of the reef</i>

43
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,112
<i>is spurring us to search</i>
<i>for new medicines here, too.</i>

44
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,993
<i>Tropical coral reefs</i>

45
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,199
<i>occupy only a tenth of one percent</i>
<i>of the ocean floor.</i>

46
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,233
<i>But their shallow warm waters</i>
<i>and stable year round conditions,</i>

47
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,910
<i>support some of the most crowded</i>
<i>and varied communities</i>

48
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,600
<i>to be found anywhere in the oceans.</i>

49
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,634
<i>And there are new discoveries to be made</i>
<i>on every one of them.</i>

50
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,797
<i>One creature</i>
<i>on Australia's Great Barrier Reef</i>

51
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,278
<i>is challenging our understanding</i>
<i>of fish intelligence.</i>

52
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,309
<i>A tusk fish.</i>

53
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,317
<i>And you can see why it gets its name.</i>

54
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,600
<i>He does something</i>
<i>few would have believed a fish could do.</i>

55
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,156
<i>Every morning,</i>
<i>he travels to the edge of the reef.</i>

56
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,189
<i>He's searching</i>
<i>for something special to eat</i>

57
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,749
<i>amongst the coral and sand.</i>

58
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,235
<i>Here's one.</i>

59
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,834
<i>A small clam.</i>

60
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,599
<i>But how to crack it open</i>
<i>and get to the meat?</i>

61
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,919
<i>He takes it all the way back</i>

62
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,599
<i>to his special kitchen.</i>

63
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,119
<i>A bowl-shaped coral</i>

64
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,237
<i>that has a particular bump on the inside</i>
<i>that he always uses.</i>

65
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,030
<i>It's not easy if you have no hands.</i>

66
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,315
<i>Whoops.</i>

67
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,834
<i>There he goes again.</i>

68
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,589
<i>But he's got great determination</i>

69
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,951
<i>and surprising accuracy.</i>

70
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,800
<i>At last.</i>

71
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,878
<i>So here is a fish that uses tools.</i>

72
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,238
<i>Some fish are much cleverer</i>
<i>than you might suppose.</i>

73
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,192
<i>The density of the animals</i>
<i>on tropical reefs</i>

74
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,836
<i>makes competition</i>
<i>inevitable and extreme.</i>

75
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,038
<i>Not only for those that lived</i>
<i>within the reef,</i>

76
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,789
<i>but for the birds that fly above them.</i>

77
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,879
<i>During the dry season,</i>

78
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,351
<i>over half a million terns</i>

79
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,951
<i>crowd onto this remote atoll</i>
<i>in the Indian Ocean.</i>

80
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,350
<i>Their chicks are still</i>
<i>in their dark, juvenile plumage.</i>

81
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,759
<i>They vary in age.</i>

82
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,432
<i>Whilst the more advanced chicks</i>
<i>take to the air,</i>

83
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,071
<i>others aren't quite ready yet.</i>

84
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,195
<i>Those just starting to learn to fly</i>

85
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,069
<i>use the shallow lagoon</i>
<i>that occupies the centre of the atoll</i>

86
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,879
<i>as their training ground.</i>

87
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,115
<i>It's difficult for some of them</i>
<i>to stay aloft for long.</i>

88
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,677
<i>Giant trevallies.</i>

89
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,711
<i>Usually, they're solitary hunters,</i>

90
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,914
<i>but about 50 of them have come here</i>
<i>from neighbouring reefs</i>

91
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,511
<i>attracted by this abundance</i>
<i>of potential prey.</i>

92
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,592
<i>The fledglings stay out of the water</i>
<i>if they can,</i>

93
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,552
<i>they even drink on the wing.</i>

94
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,756
<i>If the trevally are to catch one now,</i>

95
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,672
<i>they have to up their game.</i>

96
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>So there is a fish here that amazingly</i>

97
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,754
<i>has a brain capable of calculating</i>
<i>the airspeed,</i>

98
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,038
<i>altitude and trajectory of a bird.</i>

99
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,314
<i>The time comes when every fledgling</i>
<i>has to take to the air</i>

100
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,477
<i>and collect food for itself.</i>

101
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,750
<i>Their parents lead them</i>
<i>to the training grounds.</i>

102
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,237
<i>If they're to survive,</i>

103
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,473
<i>they must learn quickly.</i>

104
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,118
<i>After a month of practising</i>
<i>over the lagoon,</i>

105
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,072
<i>the youngsters start to leave</i>

106
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,198
<i>and take their chances</i>
<i>out over the open sea.</i>

107
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,039
<i>The oceans hold 97% of all the water</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

108
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,310
<i>As the sun warms their surface,</i>
<i>water evaporates.</i>

109
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,357
<i>The vapour rises into the sky</i>

110
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,275
<i>until it cools and condenses</i>
<i>into towering clouds.</i>

111
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,351
<i>And they generate huge storms.</i>

112
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,511
<i>The spin of the earth</i>
<i>deflects these storms</i>

113
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,798
<i>north and south into cooler latitudes.</i>

114
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,357
<i>As they travel across the sea,</i>

115
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,600
<i>storm-driven winds create huge swells.</i>

116
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,156
<i>When the swells reach shallower waters,</i>

117
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,917
<i>they rise into gigantic waves.</i>

118
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,633
<i>In its lifetime,</i>
<i>a large storm can release energy</i>

119
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,794
<i>that is the equivalent</i>
<i>of 10,000 nuclear bombs.</i>

120
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,393
<i>These are the seasonal seas.</i>

121
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,193
<i>And when they warm in spring,</i>

122
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,274
<i>they can suddenly explode with life.</i>

123
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,240
<i>Mobula rays have gathered</i>
<i>in Mexico's Sea of Cortez</i>

124
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,033
<i>in vast numbers.</i>

125
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,800
<i>Why do they leap?</i>

126
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,871
<i>Is it to tell others that they're here?</i>

127
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,840
<i>No one knows.</i>

128
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,715
<i>They feed mostly at night</i>

129
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,835
<i>for that is when vast swarms</i>
<i>of plankton rise from the depths.</i>

130
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,437
<i>The disturbance in the water stimulates</i>
<i>many of the planktonic creatures</i>

131
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,113
<i>to luminesce.</i>

132
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,596
<i>Only now do we have the technology</i>
<i>to record their faint glow.</i>

133
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,075
<i>The feasting rays swim through them</i>

134
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,598
<i>creating an extraordinary ballet</i>
<i>of life and death.</i>

135
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,238
<i>The richness of these waters</i>
<i>is based on microscopic plants,</i>

136
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
<i>phytoplankton,</i>

137
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,599
<i>which bloom on such a massive scale</i>
<i>they benefit us all.</i>

138
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,357
<i>They, together with seaweeds</i>
<i>and seagrasses,</i>

139
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,273
<i>produce as much oxygen</i>

140
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,240
<i>as all the forests</i>
<i>and grassy plains on land.</i>

141
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,836
<i>Every spring off New Zealand,</i>

142
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,630
<i>the seasonal bounty</i>
<i>draws in rare visitors.</i>

143
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,072
<i>False killer whales.</i>

144
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,592
<i>They're relatives of the orca,</i>

145
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,872
<i>six metres long</i>
<i>and weighing over a tonne.</i>

146
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,998
<i>They appear to be searching</i>
<i>for dolphins.</i>

147
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,232
<i>And there are many</i>
<i>in these coastal waters.</i>

148
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,480
<i>Here, bottlenose dolphins stick together</i>

149
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,712
<i>constantly chattering</i>
<i>with whistles and clicks.</i>

150
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,557
<i>Such a din carries for miles underwater.</i>

151
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,200
<i>The false killers have detected them.</i>

152
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,070
<i>Travelling at ten knots,</i>
<i>the killers quickly close in on them.</i>

153
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,835
<i>But then,</i>
<i>something truly extraordinary happens.</i>

154
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,438
<i>The dolphins turn</i>

155
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,434
<i>as if to greet their pursuers.</i>

156
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,790
<i>They seem to change their course.</i>

157
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,077
<i>Could it be that they're attempting</i>
<i>to communicate?</i>

158
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,559
<i>Scientists studying</i>
<i>this annual encounter,</i>

159
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,515
<i>now think that individuals</i>
<i>may recognise one another.</i>

160
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,914
<i>Almost unbelievably,</i>
<i>it seems that these different species</i>

161
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,037
<i>appear to be old friends.</i>

162
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,991
<i>Together they're gathering</i>
<i>as one unified army</i>

163
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,037
<i>up to a thousand strong.</i>

164
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,033
<i>This formidable hunting party</i>
<i>now harvests the riches</i>

165
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,397
<i>that come with New Zealand's summer.</i>

166
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,555
<i>All across the higher latitudes,</i>

167
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,510
<i>seasonal seas flourish</i>
<i>under the summer sun.</i>

168
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,111
<i>Here in Alaska,</i>
<i>sea otters lounge in the canopy</i>

169
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,590
<i>of great submarine forests.</i>

170
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:01,632
<i>Giant kelp, the biggest seaweed of all</i>
<i>is home to all kinds of life.</i>

171
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,478
<i>On the forest floor, spiny</i>
<i>sea urchins munch through the kelp.</i>

172
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,515
<i>Elsewhere there are continuously hungry</i>
<i>sea cucumbers</i>

173
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,117
<i>And in the tangled undergrowth,</i>

174
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,631
<i>wonderfully camouflaged sea dragons.</i>

175
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,636
<i>In the underwater forests</i>
<i>of northern Japan,</i>

176
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,752
<i>the residents of this sunken wreck</i>

177
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,869
<i>are waiting for the summer temperatures</i>
<i>to reach 16 degrees Celsius.</i>

178
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,600
<i>That for some is the time for mating.</i>

179
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,352
<i>A kind of giant wrasse called a Kobudai.</i>

180
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,074
<i>This is a male.</i>

181
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,715
<i>And in female terms,</i>
<i>he's particularly handsome.</i>

182
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,878
<i>He's a metre long and weighs 15 kilos.</i>

183
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,872
<i>Much larger than the diminutive female,</i>

184
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,156
<i>and he is ready to breed.</i>

185
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,913
<i>He attempts to mate with her</i>

186
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,638
<i>and with any of the dozen or so females</i>
<i>that live in his territory,</i>

187
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,112
<i>whenever he gets the chance.</i>

188
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,713
<i>But females from around ten years old</i>

189
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,839
<i>take little notice of his advances.</i>

190
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,997
<i>This is because when any large female</i>
<i>reaches a critical body size,</i>

191
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,911
<i>she can begin a dramatic transformation.</i>

192
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,193
<i>Over just a few months,</i>

193
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,553
<i>particular enzymes inside her body</i>
<i>cease to work,</i>

194
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,190
<i>and male hormones start to circulate.</i>

195
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,793
<i>As time passes,</i>

196
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,719
<i>her head expands</i>

197
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,312
<i>and her chin gets longer.</i>

198
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,274
<i>A she has changed into a he.</i>

199
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,633
<i>And with this comes a change</i>
<i>in temperament.</i>

200
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>The old male who rules</i>
<i>all the females here</i>

201
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,955
<i>is challenged to a face off.</i>

202
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,237
<i>The more bulbous the head,</i>

203
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,832
<i>the more it intimidates an opponent.</i>

204
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,154
<i>The territory has a new ruler.</i>

205
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,759
<i>Only the largest females transform</i>
<i>themselves in this way.</i>

206
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,757
<i>But the change enables them</i>
<i>to have more mates,</i>

207
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,040
<i>so they will have many more offspring</i>
<i>carrying their genes.</i>

208
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,635
<i>But a new male can't afford</i>
<i>to be complacent.</i>

209
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,671
<i>Inside the body of every Kobudai female,</i>

210
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,314
<i>there is a new male in waiting.</i>

211
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,710
<i>The closer we travel towards the poles,</i>
<i>the colder the seas become.</i>

212
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,834
<i>Icebergs appear.</i>

213
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,634
<i>Huge slabs that have broken away</i>

214
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,757
<i>from glaciers that are sliding</i>
<i>into the sea.</i>

215
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,110
<i>And then the surface starts to freeze.</i>

216
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,478
<i>While the lights of the aurora</i>
<i>play above,</i>

217
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,552
<i>even in the depths of midwinter,</i>

218
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,676
<i>there are a few places</i>
<i>well north of the Arctic circle</i>

219
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,234
<i>that are still open.</i>

220
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,036
<i>The fjords of northern Norway</i>
<i>remain ice free</i>

221
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,999
<i>because a giant current,</i>
<i>the Gulf Stream,</i>

222
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,958
<i>flows up here from the south</i>

223
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,158
<i>bringing warmth all the way</i>
<i>from the Caribbean.</i>

224
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,520
<i>And every winter,</i>

225
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,957
<i>billions of herring</i>
<i>come here for shelter.</i>

226
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,599
<i>And following them...</i>

227
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,355
<i>... Orca.</i>

228
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,670
<i>There are up to a thousand of them.</i>

229
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,679
<i>It's possibly the greatest gathering</i>
<i>of orca on the planet.</i>

230
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,673
<i>The herring maybe plentiful</i>
<i>but in these winding fjords</i>

231
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,514
<i>they're not always easy to track down.</i>

232
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,196
<i>These particular orca, however,</i>

233
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,990
<i>are fish hunting specialists.</i>

234
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,309
<i>They work as a team,</i>

235
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,912
<i>coordinating their approach</i>
<i>by calling loudly to one another.</i>

236
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,636
<i>They herd the herring</i>
<i>into tighter and tighter shoals.</i>

237
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,159
<i>They swim below them,</i>

238
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,709
<i>trapping them against</i>
<i>the surface of the sea.</i>

239
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,315
<i>And now the orca deploy</i>
<i>their special weapon.</i>

240
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,559
<i>They beat their tails with such force,</i>

241
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,479
<i>that the shock waves stun the herring.</i>

242
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,234
<i>And then the senseless victims</i>
<i>are easily collected.</i>

243
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,080
<i>But all this underwater noise</i>
<i>attracts others.</i>

244
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,639
<i>Humpback whales.</i>

245
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,675
<i>They move in on the action.</i>

246
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,954
<i>They approach the shoal from beneath</i>
<i>and then lunge upwards,</i>

247
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,678
<i>gathering up to a hundred kilos</i>
<i>of herring in a single mouthful.</i>

248
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,353
<i>The humpbacks are comparative newcomers.</i>

249
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,637
<i>They only started coming here</i>
<i>within the last decade.</i>

250
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,599
<i>But these polars seas are so rich</i>

251
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,519
<i>that there appears to be enough food</i>
<i>for everyone.</i>

252
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,992
<i>Nonetheless, few if any of these riches</i>

253
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,557
<i>would be here were it not</i>
<i>for the Gulf Stream.</i>

254
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,271
<i>Ocean currents, in fact, are crucial</i>
<i>to the well being of our planet.</i>

255
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,398
<i>They distribute the sun's heat</i>
<i>towards the poles</i>

256
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,073
<i>all the way from the equator,</i>

257
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,998
<i>maintaining a climate favourable</i>
<i>for life almost everywhere.</i>

258
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,718
<i>From creating the weather</i>
<i>to producing oxygen,</i>

259
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,599
<i>the seas keep our world healthy.</i>

260
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,195
<i>But there are now worrying signs</i>

261
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,879
<i>that conditions in the oceans</i>

262
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,759
<i>that have remained relatively stable</i>
<i>for millennia</i>

263
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,958
<i>are changing radically.</i>

264
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,356
<i>Nowhere is this more evident</i>
<i>than in the Arctic.</i>

265
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,557
<i>Here in the past 30 years,</i>

266
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,277
<i>the extent of the ice in summer</i>
<i>has been reduced by 40%.</i>

267
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,119
<i>This sudden warming,</i>

268
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,079
<i>most likely a consequence</i>
<i>of human activity,</i>

269
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,150
<i>is having a profound impact</i>
<i>on its wildlife.</i>

270
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,994
<i>Walruses are among those</i>
<i>that are seriously affected.</i>

271
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,280
<i>Every adult female</i>
<i>needs to find a safe place</i>

272
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,354
<i>where her 80-kilo pup can rest.</i>

273
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,840
<i>The sea ice is retreating</i>

274
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,560
<i>from much</i>
<i>of the walrus' traditional range,</i>

275
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,912
<i>so they now have</i>
<i>to haul out on dry land.</i>

276
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,677
<i>But a herd of hundreds</i>
<i>of quarrelsome mothers,</i>

277
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,800
<i>some weighing almost a tonne,</i>
<i>is not an ideal nursery.</i>

278
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,755
<i>Walruses on land stick together</i>
<i>for good reason.</i>

279
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,280
<i>Polar bears.</i>

280
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,992
<i>A full grown male walrus is gigantic,</i>

281
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,834
<i>too big for even a polar bear to tackle.</i>

282
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,191
<i>So the bear is looking</i>
<i>for a walrus baby.</i>

283
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,557
<i>The scent of the bear</i>
<i>spreads alarm through the colony.</i>

284
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,316
<i>The walruses retreat into the sea.</i>

285
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,837
<i>The bear knows it won't be able</i>
<i>to catch them there.</i>

286
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,479
<i>But she too has young ones to feed.</i>

287
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,679
<i>What is a mother to do?</i>

288
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,554
<i>A mother walrus still needs</i>
<i>to find a place</i>

289
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,273
<i>where her young can rest.</i>

290
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,191
<i>A melting iceberg might do,</i>

291
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,638
<i>but she is not the first</i>
<i>to find this one.</i>

292
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,039
<i>Suitable places are already taken.</i>

293
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,960
<i>Other mothers don't want to share.</i>

294
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,231
<i>They, too, need a patch of ice</i>
<i>where they can protect their young.</i>

295
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,157
<i>A desperate mother has no choice</i>
<i>but to barge her way in.</i>

296
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,199
<i>So this time everyone loses.</i>

297
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,473
<i>Finding the right place</i>
<i>on these melting shores</i>

298
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,474
<i>gets harder and harder.</i>

299
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,838
<i>Solving these problems together</i>
<i>helps create a bond so strong</i>

300
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,597
<i>that the mother will stay in contact</i>
<i>with her young for the rest of her life.</i>

301
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,796
<i>But who knows now</i>
<i>what their future will be.</i>

302
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,911
<i>As we understand more</i>
<i>about the complexity</i>

303
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,390
<i>of the lives of sea creatures,</i>

304
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,839
<i>so we begin to appreciate</i>
<i>the fragility of their home.</i>

305
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,359
<i>Our blue planet.</i>

306
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,750
Blue Planet II <i>has been</i>
<i>four years in the making.</i>

307
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,120
<i>The teams have explored every ocean,</i>

308
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,119
<i>seeking extraordinary untold stories,</i>

309
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,873
<i>many new to science.</i>

310
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,760
<i>Bringing a new understanding</i>
<i>of life beneath the waves.</i>

311
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,679
<i>The latest diving technology</i>
<i>producing no bubbles or noise</i>

312
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,555
<i>has allowed our teams</i>
<i>longer and closer encounters.</i>

313
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,757
<i>To explore our final frontier,</i>
<i>the deep,</i>

314
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,231
<i>we have spent a thousand hours</i>
<i>in submersibles</i>

315
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,034
<i>over half a mile below the surface.</i>

316
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,390
<i>Innovative new camera technology</i>

317
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,156
<i>makes it possible to film moments</i>
<i>never seen before.</i>

318
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,919
<i>Low-light cameras capture magical events</i>
<i>almost invisible to the naked eye.</i>

319
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,198
<i>Probe cameras</i>
<i>give a completely fresh perspective</i>

320
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,749
<i>into the lives of tiny creatures.</i>

321
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,032
Here he comes, here he comes.

322
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,280
<i>While suction cameras take us</i>
<i>on a giant's eye view of the ocean.</i>

323
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,513
<i>But the sea is an unpredictable</i>
<i>and dangerous place to work.</i>

324
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,632
<i>Nowhere more so than the so called</i>
<i>wild coast of South Africa.</i>

325
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,310
<i>Home to surfing dolphins.</i>

326
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,278
<i>The team's mission here</i>
<i>is to ride alongside the dolphins</i>

327
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,877
<i>and record their surfing behaviour</i>
<i>in closer detail than ever before.</i>

328
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,431
<i>These are treacherous seas,</i>

329
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,952
<i>so the film crew enlists local</i>
<i>professional surfers to guide them.</i>

330
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,152
<i>But this year, the waves are bigger</i>
<i>than anyone had anticipated.</i>

331
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,079
<i>A daunting prospect for surf cameraman,</i>
<i>Chris Bryan.</i>

332
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,434
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty nervous,
the, uh...

333
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,154
It's a big swell out there.

334
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,951
Really big swell.
Like there's 20-foot waves out there,

335
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,592
<i>and, um, yeah this will probably be</i>
<i>the biggest seas I've ever been out in.</i>

336
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,556
No risks, no reward, I guess.

337
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,112
<i>Chris has a high-speed camera</i>

338
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,671
<i>to shoot super slow motion action</i>
<i>in the waves.</i>

339
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,952
<i>The challenge is to get as close</i>
<i>to the wave-riding dolphins as possible.</i>

340
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,920
<i>The good news is that the dolphins</i>
<i>have been spotted on the horizon.</i>

341
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,870
Um, they said this was gonna be
the biggest swell of the year and...

342
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,397
Hey, I've never seen anything like this.

343
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,279
This is much bigger
that I'd possibly imagined.

344
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,520
<i>In these waves,</i>

345
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,480
<i>the only way to get out to the dolphins</i>
<i>is with a jet ski.</i>

346
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,798
It's gonna be enough
of a challenge for them

347
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,360
to just kind of weave their way out.

348
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,072
<i>At last,</i>
<i>the driver's detailed knowledge</i>

349
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,595
<i>gets them safely</i>
<i>through the massive breakers,</i>

350
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,875
<i>but the dolphins are nowhere to be seen.</i>

351
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,438
<i>Leaving the crew to face</i>
<i>the hair-raising task</i>

352
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,034
<i>of getting back to shore.</i>

353
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,318
Keep going, keep going!

354
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,516
Whoa!

355
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,634
How was that?

356
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,518
That was pretty wild, yeah.

357
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,360
The wave actually hit
the back of the sled,

358
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,070
<i>and I was like, "Go, go.</i>
<i>Get out of here, guys. Get out of here."</i>

359
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,714
<i>Heard a big bump and almost bounced off</i>

360
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,872
<i>trying to hold the camera</i>
<i>and, um, just rode out of there,</i>

361
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,394
but, yeah, it was hectic.

362
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,635
Just another day at the office.

363
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,674
<i>The next day brings</i>
<i>a sudden change in conditions.</i>

364
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,713
<i>Plenty of dolphins...</i>

365
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,079
<i>but a calmer sea.</i>

366
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,799
We've got a complete lack
of any wave at all.

367
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,192
Look out, look out, look out.

368
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,958
<i>As so often in the ocean,</i>

369
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,952
<i>if you know you're in the right place,</i>

370
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,397
<i>you just need the patience</i>
<i>to wait for the perfect moment.</i>

371
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,952
<i>A week later and a storm</i>
<i>is once again brewing</i>

372
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,273
<i>off the wild coast and surf is building.</i>

373
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,074
<i>Feel like a nervous excitement.</i>

374
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,279
The conditions are absolutely perfect.
It's what we've been waiting for.

375
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,637
<i>And the dolphins seem to know it.</i>

376
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,552
<i>But Chris is struggling</i>
<i>to get a steady shot.</i>

377
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,755
Look at that.

378
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,917
Hello, gentleman. Uh, this is tricky.

379
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,871
Little tricky no the jet ski,
uh, just trying to get the right angle.

380
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,320
So, I'm gonna have a go on the zodiac

381
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,392
and hopefully have better luck
on that one.

382
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,353
<i>The inflatable boat</i>
<i>gives Chris a larger,</i>

383
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,671
<i>more stable filming platform.</i>

384
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,511
<i>At last, he's in exactly the right place</i>
<i>at exactly the right time.</i>

385
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,917
<i>And the results are spectacular.</i>

386
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,077
That's amazing!

387
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,800
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

388
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,719
<i>And this intimate footage</i>
<i>is now available</i>

389
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,634
<i>as part of wider scientific studies.</i>

390
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,120
<i>Supporting evidence that dolphins surf</i>

391
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,597
<i>to strengthen friendships,</i>
<i>develop social skills</i>

392
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,356
<i>and for the sheer exhilaration of it.</i>

393
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,230
<i>Next time.</i>

394
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,794
<i>The deep.</i>

395
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,793
<i>A world richer</i>
<i>than we ever though possible,</i>

396
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,634
<i>where creatures thrive,</i>

397
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,837
<i>in the most extreme conditions on earth.</i>
