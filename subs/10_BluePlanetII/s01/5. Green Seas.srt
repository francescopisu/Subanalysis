1
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,399
<i>In the far north,</i>

2
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,319
<i>after three dark months of winter,</i>

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,515
<i>a world is waiting</i>

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,639
<i>for a trigger.</i>

5
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,640
<i>The sunshine of spring.</i>

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,917
<i>Starfish are the first to respond.</i>

7
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,431
<i>They race for the highest point,</i>

8
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,191
<i>and, sensing changes in the water,</i>

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,831
<i>with the tips of their tube feet,</i>

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>they spawn.</i>

11
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,599
<i>Sea cucumbers,</i>

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,917
<i>with only their mouths exposed,</i>

13
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,319
<i>now emerge.</i>

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,076
<i>They collect as many</i>
<i>starfish eggs as they can.</i>

15
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,830
<i>Which is quite a lot</i>
<i>when you've got ten arms.</i>

16
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,719
<i>Now sea pens</i>

17
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,797
<i>rise up to claim a share.</i>

18
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,429
<i>The creatures here</i>

19
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,911
<i>must grab what they can</i>
<i>of this annual banquet.</i>

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,990
<i>For the light has also set in motion,</i>

21
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,357
<i>the greatest transformation of all.</i>

22
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,120
<i>Fronds of kelp,</i>

23
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,154
<i>a marine alga, rise towards the surface,</i>

24
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,796
<i>lifted by their gas-filled bladders.</i>

25
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,196
<i>Soon, a marine forest has materialised.</i>

26
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,313
<i>Teeming with life of all kinds,</i>

27
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,356
<i>these green seas</i>

28
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,559
<i>are some of the most productive</i>
<i>but fiercely competitive waters</i>

29
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,279
<i>in all the oceans.</i>

30
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,676
<i>The southern tip of Africa.</i>

31
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,831
<i>Here two great oceans collide.</i>

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
<i>In the shallows,</i>

33
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,359
<i>fed by rich currents,</i>

34
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,274
<i>are bountiful forests of kelp.</i>

35
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,791
<i>Barely visible, except for</i>
<i>the pulsating siphons</i>

36
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,109
<i>through which it breathes,</i>

37
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,109
<i>a common octopus waiting for prey</i>
<i>to pass by.</i>

38
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,680
<i>A crab will do.</i>

39
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,476
<i>The octopus sets of in pursuit.</i>

40
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,993
<i>And then lurks</i>

41
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,756
<i>with the patience of an ambush hunter.</i>

42
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,399
<i>But the octopus shares the Cape waters</i>

43
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,593
<i>with a great concentration</i>
<i>of other predators.</i>

44
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,555
<i>Fur seals,</i>

45
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,670
<i>and sharks.</i>

46
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,474
<i>They all eat octopus,</i>

47
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,355
<i>if they can find one.</i>

48
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,036
<i>And Pyjama Sharks are experts</i>

49
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,512
<i>at hunting in the undergrowth.</i>

50
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,789
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

51
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,116
<i>But these tough-skinned little sharks</i>

52
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,671
<i>are small enough to reach deep</i>
<i>into crevices.</i>

53
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,669
<i>But the octopus is far from finished.</i>

54
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,551
<i>She slips her tentacles</i>
<i>into the shark's gills.</i>

55
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,395
<i>That prevents the shark from breathing.</i>

56
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,910
<i>So the shark has to let go.</i>

57
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,758
<i>When caught out</i>
<i>in the open and vulnerable,</i>

58
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,794
<i>this octopus does something</i>
<i>truly extraordinary,</i>

59
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,356
<i>and never recorded before.</i>

60
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,958
<i>She disguises herself</i>

61
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,309
<i>with a protective armour of shells.</i>

62
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,669
<i>She's hiding</i>

63
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,273
<i>in plain sight.</i>

64
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,276
<i>The shark can sense its prey.</i>

65
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,033
<i>But the shells confuse it.</i>

66
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,034
<i>In a forest full of hungry mouths,</i>

67
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,630
<i>superior wits allow this octopus</i>
<i>to stay alive.</i>

68
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,073
<i>Forests of kelp</i>

69
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,836
<i>flourish in seasonal waters</i>
<i>around the globe,</i>

70
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,190
<i>particularly along the Pacific Coast</i>
<i>of North America.</i>

71
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,956
<i>Here, the biggest kelps of all</i>

72
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,117
<i>grow in vast forests,</i>

73
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,110
<i>stretching for hundreds of miles.</i>

74
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,680
<i>In some places,</i>

75
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,914
<i>the giant fronds rise up</i>
<i>to 60 metres tall.</i>

76
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,113
<i>The thickets they create</i>

77
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,919
<i>are crowded with life.</i>

78
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,751
<i>Competition here for space and food</i>

79
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,280
<i>is intense.</i>

80
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,199
<i>A challenging problem</i>

81
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,677
<i>for the Garibaldi fish.</i>

82
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,954
<i>He tends to his patch of seaweed</i>

83
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,715
<i>filled with tiny creatures that he eats.</i>

84
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,919
<i>As with most farmers,</i>

85
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,078
<i>his work never ends.</i>

86
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,392
<i>He removes snails and any other grazers</i>

87
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,438
<i>that come to eat his algae.</i>

88
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,117
<i>No matter how big they are.</i>

89
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,070
<i>He has to deal with pests of all kinds.</i>

90
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,277
<i>This can be the worst of them.</i>

91
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,515
<i>Sea urchins that can scrape off</i>
<i>every vestige of algae from a rock.</i>

92
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,911
<i>Its spines are needle sharp.</i>

93
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,073
<i>Somehow the Garibaldi must remove it.</i>

94
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,035
<i>But the problem with sea urchins</i>

95
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,676
<i>is that they just keep coming.</i>

96
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,073
<i>When evening arrives</i>
<i>and the light fades,</i>

97
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,796
<i>he has to stop.</i>
<i>He not only needs a rest,</i>

98
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,718
<i>he needs to hide.</i>

99
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,913
<i>Because at night,</i>

100
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,994
<i>predators prowl through these forests.</i>

101
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,000
<i>A Torpedo Ray,</i>

102
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,871
<i>capable of stunning its victim</i>
<i>with 45 volts of electricity.</i>

103
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,951
<i>While the Garibaldi hides,</i>

104
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,433
<i>the urchins can feed</i>
<i>without interruption.</i>

105
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,672
<i>The light returns,</i>

106
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,754
<i>and he finds his farm is once again</i>

107
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,115
<i>under attack.</i>

108
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,116
<i>Urchins like locusts,</i>

109
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,751
<i>have the ability to swarm</i>

110
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,315
<i>and this can be disastrous</i>

111
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,999
<i>not just for the Garibaldi,</i>

112
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,231
<i>but for the kelp forest itself.</i>

113
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,518
<i>All the vegetation is now under attack.</i>

114
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,349
<i>The urchins move through the forest</i>

115
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,631
<i>cutting through the kelp fronds</i>

116
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,111
<i>and leaving behind vast barrens.</i>

117
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,160
<i>These urchin armies</i>

118
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,351
<i>have felled many kelp forests</i>

119
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,200
<i>along the Pacific Coast</i>
<i>of North America.</i>

120
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,830
<i>But help is at hand.</i>

121
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,479
<i>Sea otters.</i>

122
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,154
<i>All other kinds of otters spend much</i>
<i>of their lives on land.</i>

123
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,640
<i>But sea otters rarely leave the water.</i>

124
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,431
<i>At first, a newly born pup</i>

125
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,512
<i>is not a very good swimmer.</i>

126
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,757
<i>So its mother spends hours</i>

127
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,480
<i>grooming its fur to make it buoyant.</i>

128
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,709
<i>But to provide her youngster with milk,</i>

129
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,359
<i>and keep herself warm</i>

130
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,912
<i>she must eat up to 30%</i>
<i>of her bodyweight every day.</i>

131
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,318
<i>She does that by eating shellfish.</i>

132
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,956
<i>And urchins are among a sea otter's</i>
<i>favourite delicacies.</i>

133
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,877
<i>In the past, sea otters were hunted</i>
<i>so intensively for their fur,</i>

134
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,231
<i>that they came close to extinction.</i>

135
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,560
<i>With them gone,</i>

136
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,912
<i>many kelp forests were replaced with</i>

137
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,958
<i>urchin barrens.</i>

138
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,479
<i>Today, sea otters are protected.</i>

139
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,710
<i>And as their numbers slowly return,</i>

140
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,471
<i>many of the kelp forests</i>
<i>are recovering too.</i>

141
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,671
<i>Now, in some remote places,</i>

142
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,433
<i>sea otters are so numerous,</i>

143
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,439
<i>they assemble in huge wafts.</i>

144
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,278
<i>Something that hasn't been seen</i>

145
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,238
<i>for over a century.</i>

146
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,639
<i>In the sun drenched</i>
<i>shallows off Australia,</i>

147
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,680
<i>kelp is replaced by the sea's</i>
<i>only flowering plants,</i>

148
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,240
<i>sea grass.</i>

149
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,318
<i>The most extensive of these marine</i>
<i>grasslands</i>

150
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,430
<i>can stretch for over 3,000 square miles.</i>

151
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,199
<i>All across the Tropics,</i>

152
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,194
<i>they're patrolled by tiger sharks.</i>

153
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,999
<i>They can grow</i>
<i>up to five metres in length.</i>

154
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,949
<i>And have powerful crushing jaws.</i>

155
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,440
<i>Green turtles are their prey.</i>

156
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,230
<i>The turtles feed almost entirely</i>
<i>on sea grass.</i>

157
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,115
<i>A single one can consume</i>
<i>up to two kilos of it in a day.</i>

158
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,393
<i>But they can never rest easy.</i>

159
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,792
<i>Healthy turtles will keep well away</i>
<i>from an approaching shark.</i>

160
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,234
<i>And just by keeping the turtles</i>
<i>on the move,</i>

161
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,679
<i>the sharks prevent</i>
<i>any one patch of sea grass</i>

162
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,559
<i>from being overgrazed.</i>

163
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,079
<i>And that has benefits for us all.</i>

164
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,313
<i>A patch of sea grass</i>

165
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,236
<i>can absorb and store</i>
<i>35 times as much carbon dioxide</i>

166
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,799
<i>as the same area of a rainforest.</i>

167
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,796
<i>So the prairies and their sharks</i>

168
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,429
<i>are surprising allies in the fight</i>

169
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,512
<i>against a warming climate.</i>

170
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,034
<i>The struggle to survive</i>
<i>in our green seas</i>

171
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,596
<i>can have far reaching consequences.</i>

172
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,916
<i>Once a year,</i>

173
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,949
<i>one particular meadow in Australia,</i>

174
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,074
<i>is transformed.</i>

175
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,597
<i>Around the first full moon of winter,</i>

176
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,197
<i>an army materialises.</i>

177
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,079
<i>Spider crabs.</i>

178
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,877
<i>For the past year</i>
<i>they've been feeding in deeper waters.</i>

179
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,110
<i>Now, they march across</i>
<i>the sea grass plains.</i>

180
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,120
<i>Hundreds of thousands of them.</i>

181
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,837
<i>They clamber over one another</i>

182
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,351
<i>creating great mounds</i>

183
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,515
<i>nearly a hundred metres long.</i>

184
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,839
<i>They're not seeking mates</i>

185
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,077
<i>neither are they laying eggs.</i>

186
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,072
<i>They have come here in order</i>

187
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,955
<i>to grow.</i>

188
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,835
<i>Like all crabs, their bodies</i>
<i>are enclosed in a hard</i>

189
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,633
<i>unexpandable shell.</i>

190
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,358
<i>So to grow,</i>
<i>they have to break out of it.</i>

191
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,833
<i>And that allows the soft one</i>
<i>that has developed beneath</i>

192
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,229
<i>to expand.</i>

193
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,557
<i>It will take days</i>
<i>for the new shell to harden.</i>

194
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,439
<i>Its legs are so limp,</i>

195
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,472
<i>that they won't work properly.</i>

196
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,072
<i>The crab is unprotected</i>

197
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,159
<i>and in great danger.</i>

198
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,636
<i>A smooth stingray.</i>

199
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,320
<i>It's huge, about four metres long.</i>

200
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,074
<i>It wants a soft, freshly moulted crab</i>

201
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,199
<i>that will be easier to eat.</i>

202
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,673
<i>The crabs try to stick together.</i>

203
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,751
<i>But now, disturbed by the ray,</i>

204
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,116
<i>they're scattering.</i>

205
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,839
<i>A newly moulted crab</i>

206
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,469
<i>is too weak to keep up with the crowd.</i>

207
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,756
<i>The safest place is right</i>
<i>in the middle of the pile.</i>

208
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,198
<i>That is why they have</i>
<i>all assembled here.</i>

209
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,835
<i>There is safety in numbers.</i>

210
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,119
<i>But the vast majority</i>
<i>of the crabs escape.</i>

211
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,158
<i>And within the next few days,</i>

212
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,835
<i>they will be ready to return</i>
<i>to the depths,</i>

213
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,395
<i>and resume their lonely wanderings</i>

214
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,954
<i>in search of food.</i>

215
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,551
<i>This is no graveyard.</i>

216
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,352
<i>But the triumph</i>
<i>of a hundred thousand crabs,</i>

217
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,640
<i>successfully moulted.</i>

218
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,473
<i>The green seas of Southern Australia,</i>

219
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,520
<i>are particularly rich in such</i>
<i>spectacular assemblies.</i>

220
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,917
<i>But most of the creatures come together</i>
<i>for a very different reason,</i>

221
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,229
<i>to breed.</i>

222
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,073
<i>The giant cuttlefish.</i>

223
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,472
<i>The largest of all cuttlefish.</i>

224
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,754
<i>They live forjust one or two years.</i>

225
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,032
<i>Now, as the Australian summer</i>
<i>draws to an end,</i>

226
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,394
<i>they have one last act to complete.</i>

227
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,040
<i>To find a mate.</i>

228
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,919
<i>But there are</i>
<i>over one hundred thousand males</i>

229
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,149
<i>competing for the arriving females</i>

230
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,640
<i>in this one bay.</i>

231
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,998
<i>Among them, a giant, a true goliath.</i>

232
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,195
<i>He probably weighs about ten kilos.</i>

233
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,554
<i>Bands of colour sweep across his skin.</i>

234
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,192
<i>That's how cuttlefish communicate.</i>

235
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,630
<i>This smaller male couldn't</i>
<i>possibly take him on.</i>

236
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,034
<i>Beside Goliath and under his protection,</i>

237
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,120
<i>a female who has just mated with him.</i>

238
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,638
<i>But other rivals are still interested.</i>

239
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,717
<i>It seems a small male</i>
<i>wouldn't stand a chance.</i>

240
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,680
<i>The female is now displaying</i>
<i>a white stripe</i>

241
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,275
<i>along her side nearest Goliath.</i>

242
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,036
<i>It's a clear signal that she no longer</i>
<i>wants to mate with him.</i>

243
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,831
<i>It's all the encouragement</i>
<i>that the little male needs.</i>

244
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,156
<i>He's going to have to use trickery.</i>

245
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,311
<i>He tones down his colours,</i>

246
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,549
<i>and tucks in his arms.</i>

247
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,791
<i>He's just the right size to mimic</i>
<i>a female.</i>

248
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,191
<i>Goliath is deceived.</i>

249
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,351
<i>The small male now</i>
<i>displays a white stripe,</i>

250
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,994
<i>just like the real female</i>

251
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,118
<i>to deter his advances.</i>

252
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,397
<i>He slips beside her.</i>

253
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,636
<i>And they mate.</i>

254
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,560
<i>By mating with multiple partners,</i>

255
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,470
<i>the female ensures</i>
<i>the greatest genetic diversity</i>

256
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,995
<i>for her young.</i>

257
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,792
<i>The sneaky male leaves,</i>

258
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,231
<i>his final act complete.</i>

259
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,797
<i>So even among giant cuttlefish,</i>
<i>it seems,</i>

260
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,835
<i>it's not all about size.</i>

261
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,590
<i>Other males</i>
<i>in these Australian green pastures,</i>

262
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,591
<i>take greater responsibility</i>
<i>for their young.</i>

263
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,110
<i>A Weedy Sea Dragon.</i>

264
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,280
<i>This is a male</i>

265
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,200
<i>and he's carrying a precious cargo.</i>

266
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,193
<i>While mating with the female,</i>

267
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,999
<i>he collected the eggs</i>

268
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,191
<i>and attached them to his underside.</i>

269
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,678
<i>Now, he's leaving the seaweed thickets</i>

270
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,955
<i>and travelling into more open waters</i>

271
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,914
<i>where elaborate camouflage</i>
<i>is less effective.</i>

272
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,029
<i>And there are many predator out here.</i>

273
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,796
<i>And this is what the fathers</i>
<i>risk their lives for.</i>

274
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,274
<i>Dense clouds of minute shrimp.</i>

275
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,754
<i>Mysids.</i>

276
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,954
<i>One of a sea dragon's favourite foods.</i>

277
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,200
<i>They're drawing other sea dragons</i>
<i>out here too.</i>

278
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,275
<i>Finally, it's time for the young</i>
<i>to break free.</i>

279
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,110
<i>But algae has grown over</i>
<i>these developing eggs.</i>

280
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,832
<i>And it risks smothering them.</i>

281
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,599
<i>Nonetheless, the babies are emerging.</i>

282
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,437
<i>They've hatched successfully.</i>

283
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,639
<i>The fathers return to the tangle of kelp</i>

284
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,917
<i>where they're virtually invisible.</i>

285
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,630
<i>While the young remain out here.</i>

286
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,598
<i>But they will grow quickly,</i>

287
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,674
<i>surrounded as they are</i>
<i>by their ideal food.</i>

288
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,039
<i>Vast numbers of the ocean's young fish,</i>

289
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,319
<i>start their lives in the green seas.</i>

290
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,480
<i>One of the richest nurseries of all,</i>
<i>are the mangrove forests.</i>

291
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,915
<i>Fringing the coastline of the Tropics,</i>

292
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,600
<i>they form a natural protective barrier</i>
<i>between land and sea,</i>

293
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,877
<i>and are some of the world's most</i>
<i>productive forests.</i>

294
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,312
<i>Below the water,</i>
<i>their arching aerial roots</i>

295
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,959
<i>give them a firm footing.</i>

296
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,432
<i>Here there's abundant food</i>
<i>for baby fish.</i>

297
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,197
<i>While the tangled roots protect them</i>
<i>from bigger fish,</i>

298
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,472
<i>and other predators that haunt</i>
<i>the channels.</i>

299
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,518
<i>But in Northern Australia</i>

300
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,717
<i>with the receding tide,</i>

301
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,440
<i>the little fish are forced</i>
<i>to leave their shelter.</i>

302
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,956
<i>And now, they're vulnerable.</i>

303
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,080
<i>It's the most deadly assassin</i>
<i>in the green seas.</i>

304
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,276
<i>The Zebra Mantis Shrimp.</i>

305
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,193
<i>A male, almost 40 centimetres long.</i>

306
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,354
<i>But he's not hunting just for himself.</i>

307
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,919
<i>He's collecting food for his mate.</i>

308
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,356
<i>She may have been his partner</i>
<i>for 20 years.</i>

309
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,154
<i>She relies on him to bring her food.</i>

310
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,237
<i>And puts her energy</i>
<i>into her eggs instead.</i>

311
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,032
<i>In a world so full of food,</i>

312
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,510
<i>this would seem a sensible strategy.</i>

313
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,517
<i>But it's also a risky one.</i>

314
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,830
<i>Were her male to disappear,</i>
<i>she could starve.</i>

315
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,119
<i>Something has caught</i>
<i>this male's attention.</i>

316
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,390
<i>Perhaps an irresistible odour</i>

317
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,673
<i>or a distant call.</i>

318
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,794
<i>Whatever the reason,</i>
<i>a male will leave his burrow</i>

319
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,832
<i>and his lifelong mate.</i>

320
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,518
<i>An even larger hole.</i>

321
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,076
<i>Females who have lost their mates</i>

322
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,630
<i>appear to send out distress signals</i>

323
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,031
<i>to call in a new male.</i>

324
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,440
<i>A larger female will produce more eggs.</i>

325
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,518
<i>So by mating with her,</i>

326
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,191
<i>he will father more offspring.</i>

327
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,872
<i>But infidelity comes at a price.</i>

328
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,156
<i>A larger partner demands more food.</i>

329
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,231
<i>The richer a sea,</i>
<i>the greater the competition.</i>

330
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,751
<i>And there is one green sea</i>

331
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,840
<i>that supports more life</i>
<i>than all the rest combined.</i>

332
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,072
<i>Unlike the mangrove forests</i>
<i>and the sea grass prairies,</i>

333
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,114
<i>its location is in the open seas,</i>

334
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,273
<i>and only temporary and unpredictable.</i>

335
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,910
<i>This greenness comes</i>
<i>not from rooted plants,</i>

336
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,235
<i>but from clouds of floating ones.</i>

337
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,233
<i>Billions of microscopic phytoplankton</i>

338
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,120
<i>are proliferating.</i>

339
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,393
<i>And in such numbers,</i>

340
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,753
<i>that they fuel one</i>
<i>of the greatest feasts of all.</i>

341
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,717
<i>Off America's Pacific Coast,</i>

342
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,072
<i>hundreds of common dolphins</i>
<i>are rushing to a banquet.</i>

343
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,791
<i>They're not the only ones homing in.</i>

344
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,838
<i>So are sea lions.</i>

345
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,672
<i>They're heading</i>
<i>for Monterey Bay, California,</i>

346
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,590
<i>where algal blooms have caused</i>
<i>an explosion,</i>

347
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,398
<i>in plankton feeders.</i>

348
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,355
<i>Anchovies,</i>

349
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,400
<i>millions of them.</i>

350
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,273
<i>The dolphins herd the anchovies</i>
<i>towards the surface.</i>

351
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,193
<i>Sea birds and sea lions</i>
<i>take advantage of the shoals appearance.</i>

352
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,313
<i>It's a race to grab a share</i>
<i>before others arrive.</i>

353
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,555
<i>Hump Back Whales,</i>

354
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,200
<i>hundreds of them.</i>

355
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,993
<i>With every upward lunge, they sieve</i>
<i>out up to a 100 kilos of fish.</i>

356
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:32,075
<i>They're claiming the biggest share</i>
<i>of one of the biggest feasts on earth.</i>

357
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,270
<i>So crucial are these tiny plankton,</i>

358
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,600
<i>that almost all marine life ultimately</i>
<i>depends upon them.</i>

359
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,876
<i>It's the green seas, not the blue</i>

360
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,154
<i>that are the basis of almost all life</i>

361
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,597
<i>in the world's oceans.</i>

362
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,473
<i>To capture the magnificence</i>
<i>of the undersea forests</i>

363
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,756
<i>and the surprising creatures</i>
<i>living here,</i>

364
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,392
<i>the</i> Blue Planet II <i>team have developed</i>

365
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,075
<i>a series of specialist camera rigs.</i>

366
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,193
<i>From the mega dome</i>

367
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,711
<i>recording half-in, half-out shots,</i>

368
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,877
<i>at the top of the towering canopy,</i>

369
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,194
<i>to state-of-the-art</i>
<i>time lapse equipment</i>

370
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,633
<i>that speeds up time to reveal</i>
<i>the secret life of the forest floor.</i>

371
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,994
<i>But of all the creatures</i>
<i>living in these forests,</i>

372
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,159
<i>filming one in the waters</i>
<i>of the Cape of South Africa,</i>

373
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,835
<i>was to prove</i>
<i>the greatest challenge of all.</i>

374
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,272
<i>Naturalist, Craig Foster,</i>

375
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,280
<i>has developed a fascination</i>
<i>for its most secretive resident,</i>

376
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,354
<i>a common octopus.</i>

377
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,956
<i>There are almost one hundred</i>
<i>species of shark in these waters.</i>

378
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,157
<i>But that doesn't deter Craig,</i>

379
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,278
<i>who's swum here every morning</i>
<i>for the past six years.</i>

380
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,277
When you find that really
small, tiny, little, oval hole,

381
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,636
then you know it's been killed
by an octopus.

382
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,199
And if you look very, very carefully,
they're often in the vicinity of that.

383
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,077
<i>Craig has witnessed the antics</i>
<i>of these octopuses,</i>

384
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,914
<i>and wants to share</i>
<i>his remarkable discoveries</i>

385
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,674
<i>with</i> Blue Planet <i>cameraman,</i>
<i>Roger Horrocks.</i>

386
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,040
<i>Roger is immediately charmed</i>
<i>by the strength of their personalities.</i>

387
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,440
It's really been astounding
to see how individual

388
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,874
these, these characters are.

389
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,196
The common octopus
all display different behaviours.

390
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,673
Some were extremely timid.
Some were very, very bold.

391
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,000
They have variety,
and it's really endeared me to them.

392
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,999
<i>After weeks of filming</i>
<i>different individuals,</i>

393
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,958
<i>they finally meet one octopus,</i>

394
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,839
<i>that's not only seemingly unafraid</i>
<i>of the camera,</i>

395
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,157
<i>but willing to perform for it.</i>

396
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,839
She just came right out, whoop.

397
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,874
And it came right through underneath
the tripod into my legs.

398
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,079
- Yeah.
- That's cool. Amazing.

399
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,719
She very quicklyjust

400
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,833
completely accepted both of us.

401
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,476
So, we've actually been getting these
intimate behaviours, it's amazing.

402
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,437
I've watched this octopus
for many months,

403
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,758
and it's just trusting us in the water,
carrying on with normal activity

404
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,519
which is just so fantastic.

405
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,914
<i>Months later, the team finally</i>
<i>film their star octopus on the hunt.</i>

406
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,555
<i>But then discover the grave consequences</i>

407
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,077
<i>of sharing the forest with so many</i>
<i>other predators.</i>

408
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,314
<i>Pyjama Sharks.</i>

409
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,510
Pound for pound, these sharks
are far more brazen and aggressive

410
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,750
than a Great White.

411
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,519
They're like guided missiles.

412
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,590
The slightest smell that octopus
gives off, that shark will find it.

413
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,916
The Pyjama Shark actually
got hold of that octopus,

414
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,999
and I mean, I just assumed that was it.

415
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,397
After spending so much time
with this animal,

416
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,949
it was just so difficult
watching her get attacked.

417
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,278
<i>Then, to their amazement,</i>
<i>she fights back.</i>

418
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,755
She put her tentacles down,
you can see them coming through

419
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,553
the gill, basically closed the mouth.

420
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,953
The shark couldn't breathe.
And that's what enabled her to escape.

421
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,796
And just witnessing
that whole thing was,

422
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,914
you know,
it was an incredibly intense moment.

423
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,273
<i>The team are relieved by her escape.</i>

424
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,153
<i>But when caught out in the open,</i>

425
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,512
<i>her next trick,</i>
<i>astonishes them even more.</i>

426
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,439
It lifted its arms and legs,

427
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,677
over its head and at the same time,

428
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,070
pulled the shell material with it
and created this extraordinary

429
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,716
armoury.

430
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,074
The octopus had armoured up and then

431
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,913
and that guy came through from the back.

432
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,554
He could kind of smell something.

433
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,793
He's not seeing an octopus head,

434
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,395
he's seeing that strange armoury.

435
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,190
And he was bumping the octopus.

436
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,993
It was just incredible to see
how that octopus outwitted that shark,

437
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,800
using the armour,
using all its knowledge.

438
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,912
It was just absolutely phenomenal.

439
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,871
She's a rock star, man.
A proper little rock star.

440
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,355
<i>Thanks to Craig's</i>
<i>and Roger's dedication,</i>

441
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,995
<i>the octopus' astonishing behaviours</i>

442
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,793
<i>are now known to science.</i>

443
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:54,190
<i>What else might we find as we continue</i>
<i>to explore these fascinating</i>

444
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,272
<i>undersea forests?</i>

445
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,550
<i>Next time, on</i> Blue Planet II,

446
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,358
<i>we meet the creatures that live</i>
<i>where two worlds collide.</i>

447
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,795
<i>And discover how they cope</i>
<i>with the demands of</i>

448
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,156
<i>the ever changing coasts.</i>
