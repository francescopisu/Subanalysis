00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,595
In the course of making <i>Blue Planet II,</i>

2
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,390
we've explored every corner
of the underwater world.

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,599
<i>We've encountered extraordinary animals,</i>

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,155
<i>and discovered new insights into</i>
<i>how life is lived beneath the waves.</i>

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,399
For years we thought
that the oceans were so vast

6
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,791
and the inhabitants
so infinitely numerous

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,396
that nothing we could do
could have an effect upon them.

8
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,551
But now we know that was wrong.

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,794
The oceans are under threat now
as never before in human history.

10
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,317
<i>In this final episode,</i>

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,520
<i>we will meet the pioneers</i>
<i>who are striving to turn things around.</i>

12
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,150
<i>People who are helping to save</i>
<i>the ocean's most vulnerable inhabitants</i>

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,753
<i>and dedicating their lives</i>
<i>to protecting the seas.</i>

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,836
<i>But is time running out?</i>

15
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,392
Many people believe that our oceans
have reached a crisis point.

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,709
So just how fragile is our blue planet?

17
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,319
<i>Winter in the Arctic Circle.</i>

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,991
<i>Every year, the waters of Norway</i>
<i>are the setting</i>

19
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,551
<i>for one of the greatest</i>
<i>wildlife spectacles in the ocean.</i>

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,318
<i>Over a billion herring</i>
<i>pour into these fields.</i>

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,313
<i>The</i> Blue Planet II <i>team</i>
<i>spent three years</i>

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,915
<i>documenting this astonishing event.</i>

23
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,751
<i>Such a wealth of prey attracts predators</i>

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,877
<i>in extraordinary numbers.</i>

25
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,594
<i>Orcas</i>

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,512
<i>and humpback whales.</i>

27
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,512
<i>But this migration</i>
<i>hasn't always been so bountiful.</i>

28
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,400
<i>Leif Notastad is a Norwegian</i>
<i>fisheries scientist.</i>

29
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,994
It's been one of
the most important fisheries

30
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,796
that we had for centuries
along the whole coast of Norway.

31
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,872
But in the late 1960s

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,749
the herrings that we see around us here
was on the brink of collapse.

33
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,553
<i>50 years ago,</i>
<i>fishing was so intensive</i>

34
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,314
<i>that the herring had all</i>
<i>but disappeared.</i>

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,911
<i>Orcas were seen as rivals</i>

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,117
<i>and hundreds of them were killed.</i>

37
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,398
<i>It was only after the Norwegian</i>
<i>government imposed severe restrictions</i>

38
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,676
<i>that the herring began to recover.</i>

39
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,956
<i>Today, this is once again</i>
<i>an immensely productive fishery,</i>

40
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,231
<i>closely monitored</i>
<i>by teams of scientists.</i>

41
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,270
<i>Marine biologist Eve Jourdain</i>

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,353
<i>is one of the resident orca experts.</i>

43
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,913
From 1982, orcas got protected in Norway

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,631
and we have clearly one of the largest
orca population in the world out here.

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,874
<i>There are now over</i>
<i>a thousand orcas here.</i>

46
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,551
<i>But with so many mouths to feed,</i>
<i>including ours,</i>

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,235
<i>can the mistakes of the past be avoided?</i>

48
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,716
<i>To answer this vital question,</i>

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
<i>Eve and her team are using</i>
<i>multi sensor camera tags.</i>

50
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,712
With the tags we try to see
how the orcas interact with their prey.

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,316
How they hunt and all about
the underwater behaviour

52
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,676
that we are not able to see
from the boat.

53
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,156
<i>A tag has to be attached</i>

54
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,471
<i>to the orca in</i>
<i>exactly the right position.</i>

55
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,716
Here it goes. Here it comes.

56
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,833
Oh, that's a good shot.

57
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,119
It is the least invasive method.
It is suction cups.

58
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,715
So it is not a scratch
on the whale afterwards

59
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,519
which is something we really like.

60
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,712
<i>While studying the orcas,</i>

61
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,316
<i>Eve noticed a worrying change</i>
<i>in their behaviour.</i>

62
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,438
<i>They had worked out</i>
<i>the easiest way to get a meal.</i>

63
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,071
We have seen that
the orcas are waiting

64
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,629
for those fishing boats to drop the net.

65
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,958
It acts like a dinner bell

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,874
and then all the orcas
of the area gather.

67
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,593
Quite a lot of herring slip from the net

68
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,320
and this is exactly what
the orcas are looking for.

69
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,993
<i>But this new tactic</i>
<i>is dangerous, as Eve has witnessed.</i>

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,273
We were there to monitor
the behaviour of the orcas

71
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,511
scavenging around the nets.

72
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,593
And we realised that
one large adult male

73
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,717
was actually trapped inside the net.

74
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,076
When the fishermen
started to retrieve the net

75
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,755
the orca was obviously starting to panic

76
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,992
and trying to pull as much as he could.

77
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,515
This orca was really fighting
for his life.

78
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,990
<i>Stringent rules require fishermen</i>

79
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,834
<i>to get permission</i>
<i>before they open their nets.</i>

80
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,194
<i>But that took time.</i>

81
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,992
It was such a long process.

82
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,839
We thought that the whale
was going to die of exhaustion.

83
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,394
<i>Thankfully, the fishermen</i>
<i>finally got the clearance</i>

84
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,951
<i>to release their net</i>
<i>freeing the exhausted orca.</i>

85
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,957
It was a huge relief to see that
this orca made it until the end

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,600
and finally got back to his family.

87
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,589
<i>With marine mammals</i>
<i>and humans competing so directly</i>

88
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,911
<i>accidents are inevitable.</i>

89
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,789
<i>Two days after tagging an orca,</i>

90
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,714
<i>it's released and Eve collects it.</i>

91
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,271
This tag is full of secrets, you know,

92
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,556
because it has been on
the whale for several days

93
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,792
and willjust reveal exactly
what the whales have been doing.

94
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,753
<i>Pictures from the tag</i>
<i>reveal the hunting technique in detail.</i>

95
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,153
<i>They dive below the ball of fish</i>

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,798
<i>and then back flip.</i>

97
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,034
<i>The tail slap stuns the herring.</i>

98
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,594
<i>Eve can even work out</i>
<i>how many fish the orcas are taking.</i>

99
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,360
They can kill up to 30 herring
with just one tail slap.

100
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,318
And then what is pretty amazing is

101
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,438
all the individuals of the group
share the dead herring.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,754
<i>And it's not just</i>
<i>the orcas feeding here...</i>

103
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,436
<i>Humpback whales</i>
<i>are also drawn to the feast.</i>

104
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,315
<i>They too are being tagged and monitored</i>

105
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,357
<i>giving fishery scientist Leif</i>

106
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,877
<i>a complete picture of</i>
<i>how much herring is being eaten.</i>

107
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,675
The whales, they take
probably less than 1%.

108
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,912
The fishermen take less than 10%.

109
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,429
So the balance there is that
there is enough for everybody.

110
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,399
Given that we manage to stock
in sustainable

111
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,312
and a long term sustainable way.

112
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,952
<i>But it's estimated that</i>
<i>almost a third of ocean fisheries</i>

113
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,157
<i>are being over exploited.</i>

114
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,234
<i>The remarkable recovery</i>
<i>of the herring here</i>

115
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,155
<i>demonstrates what can happen</i>
<i>if a fishery is carefully managed.</i>

116
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,198
<i>Our maltreatment of the seas</i>
<i>has many effects.</i>

117
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,639
<i>Some are predictable,</i>

118
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,356
<i>but there are others</i>
<i>that are rather more surprising.</i>

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,713
<i>Southeast Asia.</i>

120
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,954
<i>The coral reefs here are among</i>
<i>the richest on the planet.</i>

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,674
<i>Marine biologist Steve Simpson,</i>

122
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,673
<i>is discovering how important sound is</i>

123
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,197
<i>to the animals that live in these</i>
<i>bustling coral cities.</i>

124
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,389
We're only now just realising
by listening underwater

125
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,437
that the fish are making
all these sounds.

126
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,360
They use sound to attract a mate.

127
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,591
To try and scare away a predator.

128
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,555
You hear pops and grunts
and gurgles and snaps.

129
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,958
There's a whole language underwater

130
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,430
that we're onlyjust starting
to get a handle on.

131
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,874
<i>Using an advanced</i>
<i>multi directional hydrophone,</i>

132
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,795
<i>Steve is trying to make sense</i>
<i>of this extraordinary chorus</i>

133
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,590
<i>by working out who is making</i>
<i>which noise.</i>

134
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,479
<i>One fish is especially talkative.</i>

135
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,432
<i>It's perhaps the reef's</i>
<i>most famous resident.</i>

136
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,040
<i>The clownfish.</i>

137
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,518
<i>While filming for the series,</i>

138
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,833
<i>we followed this particular family</i>
<i>of saddleback clownfish</i>

139
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,152
<i>as they search for a suitable place</i>
<i>to lay their eggs.</i>

140
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,996
<i>It's a noisy affair.</i>

141
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,031
For clownfish sound
really is everything.

142
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,589
They spend all day
talking to each other.

143
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,158
You've got dominance and submission.

144
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,391
You've got all the others
calling to each other.

145
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
<i>It seems that they also use sound</i>

146
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,996
<i>in protecting themselves from the many</i>
<i>predators that hunt around the reef.</i>

147
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,515
<i>Including coral trout.</i>

148
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,070
<i>Will this model trout</i>
<i>fool the clownfish?</i>

149
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
<i>They react almost immediately.</i>

150
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,080
<i>By mimicking a predator,</i>

151
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,189
<i>Steve manages to record their alarm</i>
<i>calls without putting them at risk.</i>

152
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,471
You can really hear the deeper
pulsing sound of the female

153
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,995
as she tries to scare
the coral trout away.

154
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,116
And all the little ones are
just popping... Pop, pop, pop.

155
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,476
As if to say, "I'm still okay.
I'm still alive."

156
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,518
So they've got this real language
of sounds that they're using

157
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,752
just to try and defend the colony
against this coral trout.

158
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,750
<i>But that discovery</i>
<i>has led to a serious worry.</i>

159
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,032
The fish were really
popping away at the predator.

160
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,716
But as soon as the boat came over
they looked completely distracted.

161
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,793
With all that noise it completely
changed how the fish were behaving.

162
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,678
<i>Unable to make themselves</i>
<i>heard above the noise of boats,</i>

163
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,400
<i>the family can't warn each other</i>
<i>of danger.</i>

164
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,314
<i>And so they are now</i>
<i>vulnerable to attack.</i>

165
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,592
You think about how many boats
are driving around.

166
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,559
All of the ships,
all of the offshore drilling.

167
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,393
All the noise that we're making
in the ocean

168
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,392
you realise just how much
we're drowning out

169
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,392
this natural biological noise,

170
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
robbing animals of their ability to be
able to talk to each other.

171
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,837
<i>All this noise may have</i>
<i>serious consequences for many reef fish</i>

172
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,073
<i>because their babies, as soon as they</i>
<i>hatch are swept out to sea.</i>

173
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,755
<i>There they feed and grow</i>
<i>until strong enough to swim back.</i>

174
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,634
<i>And to find the reef, they use sound.</i>

175
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,679
They listen in. They eavesdrop
to the noises that they can hear

176
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,958
and they use that to choose which reef
they want to make their home.

177
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
But obviously because we're adding
all this noise to the ocean

178
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,190
it's a wonder whether they can even
hear the reef at all.

179
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,996
<i>Man-made noise is now</i>
<i>everywhere in the ocean.</i>

180
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,750
<i>And it has an effect on</i>
<i>marine creatures of all kinds.</i>

181
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,837
<i>From tiny fish</i>

182
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,836
<i>to gigantic whales.</i>

183
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,158
<i>But Steve believes there are solutions.</i>

184
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,360
Noise in the ocean
is a real problem.

185
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,557
But, it's something that we can control.

186
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,154
We can choose where we make the noise.

187
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,152
We can choose when we make the noise.

188
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,597
We can directly reduce
the amount of noise that we make

189
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,478
and we can start doing that today.

190
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,711
<i>We're only now beginning to realise</i>

191
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,874
<i>what an impact our noise is having</i>
<i>on the inhabitants of the ocean.</i>

192
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,032
<i>Other forms of pollution</i>
<i>are only too familiar.</i>

193
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,714
Since its invention some
hundred years ago,

194
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,680
plastic has become an integral part
of our daily lives.

195
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,390
But every year,
some eight million tons of it

196
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,358
ends up in the ocean.

197
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,671
And there, it could be lethal.

198
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,236
<i>While filming</i> Blue Planet II,

199
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,711
<i>the crews found plastic in every ocean.</i>

200
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,398
<i>Even in the most remote locations.</i>

201
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,354
<i>South Georgia.</i>

202
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,875
<i>900 miles north of Antarctica,</i>

203
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,158
<i>this isolated wilderness</i>
<i>is the breeding place</i>

204
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,836
<i>for vast numbers of penguins</i>
<i>and elephant seals.</i>

205
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,520
<i>It's also a favourite nesting site</i>

206
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,671
<i>for the largest bird in the sky.</i>

207
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,632
<i>A wandering albatross.</i>

208
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
<i>Here we learn of</i>
<i>the extraordinary lengths</i>

209
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,317
<i>ancient parents go to give their chicks</i>
<i>the best chance of survival.</i>

210
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,791
<i>Each devoted parent travels thousands</i>
<i>of miles searching for fish and squid</i>

211
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,792
<i>to feed their hungry chick.</i>

212
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,192
<i>But despite all their efforts,</i>

213
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,273
<i>the albatross colony here is in trouble.</i>

214
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,399
<i>Lucy Quinn is part of</i>
<i>the British Antarctic Survey team</i>

215
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,951
<i>studying the birds here</i>
<i>for the last 40 years.</i>

216
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,237
Its only through looking at
long terms studies

217
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,755
that you get a sense of these creatures.

218
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,960
And the albatrosses here have,
over the past 10 years, been in decline.

219
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,478
<i>There are a number of</i>
<i>possible reasons.</i>

220
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,313
<i>While foraging at sea,</i>

221
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,360
<i>albatross can get entangled</i>
<i>and drowned by fishing gear.</i>

222
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,840
<i>But Lucy is particularly alarmed</i>

223
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,958
<i>by what the parents are bringing back</i>
<i>for their chick.</i>

224
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,835
Albatrosses have
the ability to cough up

225
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,230
bits of food that they can't digest.

226
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,154
And from that we can tell
what they've been eating.

227
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,233
A healthy albatross chick in its diet
should really have things like squid.

228
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,075
So we can find the squid beaks
that come out of the pellet.

229
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,710
And also things like fish
so we can find fish bones as well.

230
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,512
<i>But these chicks are being</i>
<i>fed something very different.</i>

231
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,349
We have some plastic that
this poor chick has had to bring up.

232
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,954
Plastic bag.

233
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,158
Here we have some food packaging.
Looks like rice.

234
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,159
Luckily for this chick, he has managed
to get this out of his stomach.

235
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,358
So, fingers crossed he doesn't have
any more plastic left in there

236
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,635
before he fledges.

237
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,716
<i>For other chicks, plastic can be fatal.</i>

238
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,360
Unfortunately,
there is a plastic toothpick

239
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,557
that have actually gone through
the stomach.

240
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,998
Something just as small as that has
actually has managed to kill the bird.

241
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,673
It's really sad to see.

242
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,195
<i>Lucy collects and records</i>
<i>what plastic she finds around the nests.</i>

243
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,275
These are items that were
regurgitated just from last season.

244
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,319
And that's gonna be
a vast underestimation

245
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,234
because that's just ones
that we happen to find.

246
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,996
There'll be many more that
we never see being brought back.

247
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,073
<i>To find out where</i>
<i>all this rubbish is coming from,</i>

248
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,633
<i>Lucy and her team have attached</i>
<i>GPS trackers to adult birds.</i>

249
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,794
It's showing where they're
going to find food for themselves

250
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
and to find food to bring back
for their chicks.

251
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,234
It really shows us that
they could be picking up plastic

252
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,710
from thousands of miles away.

253
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,279
Plastics coming from either being
dumped at sea

254
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,955
or also from people's homes.

255
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,750
Plastic gets into the rivers and then
the rivers flow into the sea.

256
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,910
So this isn't just a problem
around these remote parts.

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,992
This is happening worldwide.

258
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,754
And it's our rubbish
that's going into the oceans.

259
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,309
It's our problem that we need to solve.

260
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,918
<i>In some parts of the ocean,</i>

261
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,075
<i>it's estimated that there are now over</i>
<i>one million pieces of plastic</i>

262
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,833
<i>for every square mile.</i>

263
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,913
<i>And we're only beginning to discover</i>

264
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,437
<i>just how seriously</i>
<i>that affects marine life.</i>

265
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,794
<i>On the east coast of the United States,</i>

266
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,955
<i>researchers are investigating</i>
<i>the mysterious deaths of young dolphins.</i>

267
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,471
<i>The team is led by Dr Leslie Hart.</i>

268
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,831
It looks to be a young animal.

269
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,673
Maybe a little bit over a year.

270
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,071
So we're gonna try to find out more
information on why this dolphin died.

271
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,830
Looking at young dolphins...

272
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,640
The very young dolphins,
it's always heart-breaking.

273
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,080
<i>Leslie takes tissue samples.</i>

274
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,356
<i>Their chemical analysis</i>
<i>could provide crucial evidence.</i>

275
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,519
We are often shocked
by the high levels of toxins

276
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,398
that we detect in these animals.

277
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,197
These young calves are dying
for a number of reasons.

278
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,274
But we suspect man-made toxins
are playing a large role.

279
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,594
<i>And plastic could be</i>
<i>part of the problem.</i>

280
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,279
<i>Once in the ocean,</i>

281
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,432
<i>plastic breaks down into tiny fragments.</i>

282
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,152
<i>Micro plastics.</i>

283
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>Along with all the industrial chemicals</i>
<i>that have drained into the ocean</i>

284
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,592
<i>these form a potentially toxic soup.</i>

285
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,752
The really small organisms

286
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,231
can mistake these tiny,
tiny plastics as food.

287
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,994
Then the larger organisms
eat the plankton.

288
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
Then the larger fish
eat the smaller fish,

289
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,154
and so on and so forth.

290
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,398
<i>Dolphins are</i>
<i>at the top of this food chain</i>

291
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,030
<i>and it's now thought that pollutants</i>
<i>may be building up in their tissues</i>

292
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,752
<i>to such a degree that a mother's</i>
<i>contaminated milk could kill her calf.</i>

293
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,198
<i>Industrial pollution</i>
<i>and the discarding of plastic waste</i>

294
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,593
<i>must be tackled for the sake of</i>
<i>all life in the ocean.</i>

295
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,116
<i>Around the world,</i>
<i>people are now devoting their lives</i>

296
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,398
<i>to saving some of the most</i>
<i>threatened sea creatures.</i>

297
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,075
<i>As here in the Caribbean.</i>

298
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,639
<i>Every year on just a few islands,</i>

299
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,360
<i>a remarkable event takes place.</i>

300
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,680
<i>As the sun sets,</i>

301
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,753
<i>giant reptiles begin to emerge.</i>

302
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,636
This magnificent creature preparing...

303
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,677
Whoops.

304
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,195
Preparing to lay her eggs

305
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,159
is the largest of all turtles.

306
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,594
A leatherback.

307
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,309
They can grow up to
half a ton in weight.

308
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,235
And they have an ancestry that
goes back a hundred million years

309
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,312
to the age of the dinosaur.

310
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,680
But in recent times their numbers
have fallen catastrophically.

311
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,833
Here, however, in the Caribbean
there is hope.

312
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,870
<i>Leatherback turtles leave the sea</i>

313
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,112
<i>in order to lay their eggs</i>
<i>in the dry sand.</i>

314
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,470
<i>But out of water, these huge creatures</i>
<i>are easy targets for hunters.</i>

315
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,999
<i>In a small fishing village in Trinidad,</i>

316
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,915
<i>Len Peters has experienced this</i>
<i>first hand.</i>

317
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,592
I grew up in a household where
the presence of turtle meat was normal.

318
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,478
The fridge was always full of it.

319
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,598
Everybody... Everybody harvested
turtles, including my parents.

320
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,029
It's only when I became
exposed to things

321
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,918
that were being published
about leatherbacks

322
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,434
who were on the verge of extinction.

323
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,079
And nobody cares.

324
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,640
That piqued my interest.

325
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,720
<i>Len took the leatherback's</i>
<i>future into his own hands.</i>

326
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,435
<i>He began patrolling the beach at night</i>
<i>to protect the turtles.</i>

327
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,639
<i>A brave thing to do.</i>

328
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,159
We were met with
tremendous resistance.

329
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,993
People would pelt us at night.

330
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,231
I have had persons insult me.

331
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,879
I've had persons curse me.

332
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,671
I've had persons physically
try to wrestle me with a machete.

333
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,400
So it was really
a hostile time back then.

334
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
<i>If Len was going to</i>
<i>save these turtles</i>

335
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,034
<i>he needed to win over</i>
<i>the whole community.</i>

336
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,473
We had to find a way to
get the villagers to benefit

337
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,597
from the presence of these animals.

338
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,430
<i>He began to encourage</i>
<i>tourists to visit the beach</i>

339
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,433
<i>and trained some villagers</i>
<i>to be their guides.</i>

340
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,120
<i>To help secure the turtle's future,</i>

341
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,272
<i>he took the message</i>
<i>to the next generation.</i>

342
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,834
Now what's... What's the largest size
a leatherback can grow to?

343
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,271
Uh, Shanie.

344
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,438
- 2,000 pounds.
- That's correct.

345
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,275
Leatherbacks can grow to 2,000 pounds.

346
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,919
Well, that's a big turtle.

347
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,597
<i>Len's hard work paid off.</i>

348
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,990
<i>And now, attitudes have changed.</i>

349
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,276
It took us a while to
reach out to the villagers.

350
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,795
But gradually we got them
involved as well.

351
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,839
We got some of the poachers who
would be hunting the animals to

352
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,793
be part of the conservation programme.

353
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,909
<i>As well as protecting</i>
<i>the adult turtles,</i>

354
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,279
<i>the team also collect any eggs</i>
<i>that might be flooded at high tide.</i>

355
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,154
If the eggs are laid
too close to the sea,

356
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,835
we relocate the eggs and rebury them.

357
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,795
<i>Thanks to the efforts of this community,</i>

358
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,396
<i>these turtles have had an extraordinary</i>
<i>change in fortune.</i>

359
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,115
<i>This is now thought to be</i>
<i>one of the densest</i>

360
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,999
<i>leatherback nesting beaches</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

361
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,396
When we started at the height
of the nesting season,

362
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,156
the numbers will be 30-40 turtles
a night.

363
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,959
Now, it's over 500.

364
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,357
So, we have seen an increase
from 40 turtles

365
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,399
to 500 turtles a night
in just around 20 years.

366
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,795
<i>Precious new hatchlings</i>
<i>are also given a helping hand.</i>

367
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,432
<i>Any that emerge during the day</i>
<i>are collected</i>

368
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,231
<i>to be released safely back to the sea,</i>
<i>away from hungry birds.</i>

369
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,031
This little leatherback will have to
face a thousand hazards

370
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,478
before it returns as an adult
to this beach where it hatched.

371
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,558
And those dangers will be
greatly increased

372
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,838
because of damage that we have done
to the ocean.

373
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,194
Good luck, little leatherback.

374
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,036
<i>Protecting breeding sites on beaches</i>

375
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,558
<i>may improve the fortune</i>
<i>of some marine animals,</i>

376
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,793
<i>but safeguarding them while they roam</i>
<i>the high seas is much more difficult.</i>

377
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,713
<i>Out here, there is little protection.</i>

378
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,591
<i>Every night, thousands of miles of</i>
<i>fishing lines laden with hooks are set.</i>

379
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,271
<i>There's enough, it's said,</i>
<i>to wrap twice around the world.</i>

380
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,517
<i>Nets large enough to engulf cathedrals</i>

381
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,832
<i>trap hundreds of tons of fish at a time.</i>

382
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,992
<i>Long distance travellers such as sharks</i>
<i>are particularly at risk.</i>

383
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,559
<i>It's estimated that tens of millions</i>
<i>are killed every year,</i>

384
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,431
<i>including the biggest fish in the sea,</i>
<i>the whale shark.</i>

385
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,156
<i>Shark biologist Jonathan Green</i>
<i>is concerned</i>

386
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,631
<i>that time is running out</i>
<i>for these extraordinary creatures.</i>

387
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,560
We know that they're being fished
possibly at a massive rate.

388
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,477
They may be taken by the thousands,
possibly tens of thousands a year.

389
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,879
If that is indeed true,

390
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,431
we don't know how long they can
withstand that kind of fishing pressure.

391
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,153
<i>To save them,</i>
<i>Jonathan is trying to solve</i>

392
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,880
<i>the mystery of where they give birth.</i>

393
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,318
<i>And, for the first time, he has a clue</i>
<i>as to where this might be.</i>

394
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,674
<i>Pregnant whale sharks are thought to be</i>
<i>travelling from across the Pacific Ocean</i>

395
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,480
<i>to Darwin Island in the Galapagos.</i>

396
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,356
<i>Jonathan is going to try and attach</i>

397
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,911
<i>a multi-sensor camera tag</i>
<i>to a pregnant female.</i>

398
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,280
Okay. We're good to go.

399
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,992
<i>These sharks only stay in the area</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

400
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,872
<i>This may be his only chance.</i>

401
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,519
<i>Jonathan has to attach the tag before</i>
<i>the shark dives to dangerous depths.</i>

402
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,991
<i>The tag will remain on the giant's fin</i>
<i>for two days</i>

403
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,151
<i>before it's automatically released.</i>

404
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,754
<i>Once retrieved, it reveals</i>
<i>some unusual behaviour.</i>

405
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,920
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

406
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,838
There's a silky rubbing at the in front.
Next to her right.

407
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,950
<i>The silky sharks are</i>
<i>brushing up against her rough skin,</i>

408
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,316
<i>perhaps to scrape off parasites.</i>

409
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,916
<i>These predatory sharks make the surface</i>
<i>waters very unsafe places</i>

410
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,196
<i>for young fish of any kind.</i>

411
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,276
<i>There is a surprise in store.</i>

412
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,993
<i>The tag's depth sensor reveals</i>
<i>that she dived</i>

413
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,720
<i>to a depth of 600 metres.</i>

414
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,317
<i>But down there,</i>
<i>it's too dark for the camera.</i>

415
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,792
<i>The only way Jonathan can prove</i>
<i>if they're giving birth</i>

416
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,478
<i>is to go down and look.</i>

417
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,789
<i>Out of the gloom, a shape materialises.</i>

418
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,431
<i>Another massive whale shark.</i>

419
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,472
Oh, look at her. She's having a look
at us. She's looking right at us.

420
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,637
She is huge.

421
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,150
And look at the belly.
Absolutely massive.

422
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,193
That's a large pregnant female.

423
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,117
She's turning around.
She's turning around.

424
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,954
Goes to show we can follow them.
We can follow them in the submarine.

425
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,878
<i>She leads them down</i>
<i>into the darkness.</i>

426
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,714
<i>Rover control.</i>
<i>Passing 100 metres, descending.</i>

427
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,796
Heading down.
I think she's accelerated slightly.

428
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,318
<i>She's too fast.</i>

429
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,320
<i>And with the strong current running</i>
<i>against them, the sub can't keep up.</i>

430
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,670
<i>But, for the first time,</i>
<i>Jonathan can see for himself</i>

431
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,592
<i>exactly where she's headed.</i>

432
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,311
What specifically Darwin
could provide

433
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,156
is a safe refuge for those new-born pups
where predators can't access.

434
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,560
Perfect conditions
for the formative years

435
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,472
of these ocean-travelling giants.

436
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,953
That was unbelievable.

437
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,353
Dream of a lifetime.

438
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,231
<i>His discovery</i>
<i>that pregnant whale sharks</i>

439
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,279
<i>are visiting this very deep patch</i>
<i>of the sea floor</i>

440
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,513
<i>is strong evidence that this is indeed</i>
<i>where the giants produce their young.</i>

441
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,671
If I can actually prove
that they are giving birth in this area,

442
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,831
then we'll have
the information necessary

443
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,912
to go to governments and actually say,

444
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,198
"You must preserve those routes
that they're migrating through."

445
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,637
And then, and only then,
can we really truly afford protection

446
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,791
for this beautiful ocean traveller.

447
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,831
<i>Today, less than one percent</i>

448
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,594
<i>of our international waters</i>
<i>are protected.</i>

449
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,871
<i>And the creation of marine reserves</i>
<i>is vital</i>

450
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,920
<i>if we're to safeguard the future</i>
<i>of many ocean creatures.</i>

451
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,440
<i>It will require</i>
<i>international cooperation.</i>

452
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,792
<i>But here, too, there is hope.</i>

453
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,271
We can turn things around.

454
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,957
We've done so once before.

455
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,635
For centuries,
the sea-going nations of the world

456
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,679
hunted the great whales
until they were close to extinction.

457
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,839
And then, in 1986,
those nations got together

458
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,800
and agreed to put a stop
to commercial whaling.

459
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,315
<i>Today, although a few nations</i>
<i>continue to hunt whales,</i>

460
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,154
<i>some of the great whales</i>
<i>are making a recovery.</i>

461
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,274
<i>In the tropical seas</i>
<i>surrounding Sri Lanka,</i>

462
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,831
<i>there are stories of vast gatherings</i>
<i>of whales.</i>

463
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,471
<i>When the civil war ended in 2009,</i>

464
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,440
<i>locals here were able once again</i>
<i>to fish these waters.</i>

465
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,716
<i>There were soon reports of assemblies</i>
<i>of sperm whales,</i>

466
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,952
<i>the likes of which had not been seen</i>
<i>for centuries.</i>

467
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,120
<i>Marine guide Daya was determined</i>
<i>to get to the truth</i>

468
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,510
<i>behind these fishermen's tales.</i>

469
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,711
The fishermen told me that
there are lots of whales

470
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,995
a little bit north from here.

471
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,310
They didn't actually tell me a number,

472
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,757
but in big numbers, not one or twos.

473
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,797
Er, many.

474
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,590
<i>It took him three years,</i>

475
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,232
<i>but eventually, he found evidence</i>
<i>to support these rumours.</i>

476
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,997
We saw about 1 5 sperm whales
go past us.

477
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,797
Then, another four came past us.

478
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,597
After about 40 then passed me,
I started counting.

479
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,075
Still, they kept coming,
so I lost count.

480
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,478
I estimated that we saw about
300 sperm whales.

481
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,960
<i>Sperm whales were once</i>
<i>killed in vast numbers</i>

482
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,879
<i>and it's thought that if the slaughter</i>
<i>had continued,</i>

483
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,351
<i>the species would be in danger</i>
<i>of extermination.</i>

484
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,351
<i>But now, here at least,</i>
<i>they are being seen in huge numbers.</i>

485
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,675
I believe they come here to feed,
mate, and raise their young.

486
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,315
So, this must be a holiday spot
for them, you know.

487
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,951
At the moment, I don't know
of any other place in the world

488
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,760
that, er, sperm whales gather like this.

489
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,790
<i>Although some whale</i>
<i>populations are still in decline,</i>

490
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,591
<i>scenes like this prove that when</i>
<i>sea-going nations come together,</i>

491
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,718
<i>they can achieve astonishing results.</i>

492
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,073
<i>But today, the oceans face threats</i>
<i>on a truly global scale.</i>

493
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,797
<i>The Great Barrier Reef.</i>

494
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,677
<i>The largest coral reef system</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

495
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,640
<i>Here, we filmed stories which reveal</i>
<i>just how smart fish can be.</i>

496
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,074
<i>This ingenious tuskfish, for example,</i>

497
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,552
<i>used a favourite coral anvil</i>
<i>to smash open shellfish.</i>

498
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,311
<i>This astonishing behaviour</i>
<i>has been closely studied</i>

499
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,835
<i>by local scientist Alex Vail.</i>

500
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,069
We're calling Percy
"Percy the Persistent"

501
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,598
because he took, like, an hour
to open the first shell.

502
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,430
He must have hit it well over 50 times,

503
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,399
but he just kept on going
and finally got it open.

504
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,878
<i>Alex grew up</i>
<i>on the Great Barrier Reef</i>

505
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,759
<i>on one of its more remote islands,</i>
<i>Lizard.</i>

506
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,396
<i>He knows the reef intimately.</i>

507
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,475
<i>But, in 2016, while he was filming</i>
<i>for</i> Blue Planet II,

508
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,075
<i>Alex witnessed a catastrophe.</i>

509
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,919
When we started filming,
everything was pretty much fine.

510
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,071
All of the corals
were basically healthy.

511
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,477
But in the last few weeks,
everything changed.

512
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,240
I have never seen anything
like this before.

513
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,591
<i>A combination of a warming ocean</i>

514
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,276
<i>and an unpredictable weather event</i>
<i>called El Niño</i>

515
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,000
<i>raised sea temperatures</i>
<i>to record levels.</i>

516
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,277
<i>And this had a disastrous effect</i>
<i>on the corals.</i>

517
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,033
<i>The heat causes reef-building corals</i>
<i>to lose their nourishing algae,</i>

518
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,555
<i>exposing their white skeletons.</i>

519
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,559
<i>When temperatures remain high,</i>
<i>bleached corals die off.</i>

520
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,399
The bleaching this year has been
the worst in history

521
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,914
for the Great Barrier Reef.

522
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,435
About 90 percent of the branching corals

523
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,876
on the reef out here at Lizard Island
are dead.

524
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,514
<i>It also has disastrous consequences</i>

525
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,751
<i>for the other creatures that live here.</i>

526
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,994
Percy swimming around out there.

527
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,079
The really sad thing is that his
castle's starting to bleach.

528
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,592
If we lose our coral, there's a chance
we're going to lose our tuskfish.

529
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,156
It's incredibly sad to see areas
that you've dived on

530
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,438
since you were a little kid
just turn to rubble.

531
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,717
I cried in my mask, when I saw,

532
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,917
you know, some of the devastation
from this bleaching.

533
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,718
<i>In the last three years,</i>

534
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,713
<i>over two-thirds</i>
<i>of the world's coral reefs</i>

535
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,516
<i>are thought to have suffered from rises</i>
<i>in ocean temperatures.</i>

536
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,676
<i>This is not the only challenge</i>
<i>they face.</i>

537
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,795
<i>Research is revealing</i>
<i>how the fundamental</i>

538
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,156
<i>chemistry of the ocean is changing.</i>

539
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,878
<i>Professor Chris Langdon shows me</i>
<i>what this might mean</i>

540
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,830
<i>for the future of our seas</i>
<i>by pouring dilute acid over shells.</i>

541
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,470
And how much more acidic is this
than the present ocean?

542
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,591
This is more concentrated than
the pH of the ocean

543
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,477
but it accelerates the process
so we can see something visually.

544
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,277
So, what's happening is, these shells,
they're made out of calcium carbonate,

545
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,559
and the acid is dissolving them.

546
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,915
And coral reefs are made out of
the same material as these shells here.

547
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,834
But surely this is not happening
in the ocean now. Right now?

548
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,391
What we're seeing here is more dramatic
than what's happening in the ocean.

549
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,157
But the shells and the reefs
are really truly dissolving.

550
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,358
Coral reefs could be gone by the end
of this century.

551
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,031
<i>And the cause of this?</i>
<i>Carbon dioxide.</i>

552
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,271
<i>Dissolved in the sea water,</i>
<i>it forms carbonic acid.</i>

553
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,715
<i>The more carbon dioxide</i>
<i>in the atmosphere,</i>

554
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,110
<i>the more acidic the ocean becomes.</i>

555
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,119
<i>Evidence points to the burning</i>
<i>of fossil fuels</i>

556
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,792
<i>as the primary cause for these</i>
<i>increasing levels of carbon dioxide.</i>

557
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,200
And this is man-made beyond question.

558
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,475
Beyond question.

559
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,672
<i>But Chris believes all is not lost.</i>

560
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,160
All we have to do, and I say all,
is reduce our CO2 emissions.

561
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,359
We can switch to renewable fuels,
wind and solar,

562
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,397
instead of natural fossil fuels.

563
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,153
And so, none of this has to

564
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,470
- develop to the worst case.
- And that could fix it?

565
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,157
Yeah, absolutely. So, this future does
not have to play out. It's up to us.

566
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,676
<i>As the climate changes,</i>
<i>the seas warm.</i>

567
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,679
<i>Our oceans are being seriously affected.</i>

568
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,553
<i>And this is nowhere more apparent</i>
<i>than at the poles.</i>

569
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,113
<i>Antarctica.</i>

570
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,557
<i>For the</i> Blue Planet II <i>team, this was</i>
<i>their most ambitious expedition.</i>

571
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,120
<i>For the first time in history,</i>
<i>a manned submersible</i>

572
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,671
<i>will try to dive to a depth</i>
<i>of 1,000 metres</i>

573
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,150
<i>and reach the Antarctic seabed.</i>

574
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,359
<i>A true journey into the unknown.</i>

575
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,031
(RADIO CHATTER

576
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,237
<i>Control rover. Passing 40 metres.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

577
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,239
<i>Leading the team</i>
<i>on this historic dive</i>

578
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,551
<i>is deep sea scientist John Copley.</i>

579
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,910
We get our first glimpse
of this landscape.

580
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,270
And the carpet of life around us
is astounding.

581
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,315
It's beautiful.

582
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,991
<i>Diving in a submersible</i>
<i>gives John an entirely new understanding</i>

583
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,754
<i>of how this rich ecosystem works.</i>

584
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,552
<i>But it also offers him</i>
<i>a unique opportunity</i>

585
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,553
<i>to investigate how the ocean here</i>
<i>is changing.</i>

586
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,797
While we're observing the marine life
down there,

587
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,190
the subs are also recording
what the environment is like,

588
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,636
so we're getting measurements
of temperature, of salinity.

589
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,996
It's hopefully gonna enable us
to understand the changes

590
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,231
that are happening in this vital part
of our planet.

591
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,875
<i>To get a fuller picture,</i>
<i>John also lowers</i>

592
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,191
<i>a deep sea temperature probe.</i>

593
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,196
<i>His data is contributing</i>
<i>to an international attempt</i>

594
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,910
<i>to chart the rise in both sea</i>
<i>and air temperatures.</i>

595
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,231
What shocks me about
what all the data show

596
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,875
is how fast things are changing here.

597
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,319
We're headed into uncharted territory.

598
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,557
<i>To truly comprehend</i>

599
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,836
<i>the effect of the temperature</i>
<i>increases here,</i>

600
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,037
<i>John takes to the skies.</i>

601
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,511
<i>From here, he can record</i>
<i>the number and size</i>

602
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,072
<i>of the icebergs being produced</i>
<i>as the ice shelfs melt and break apart.</i>

603
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,077
The bergs we're seeing all around us
give you some idea

604
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,518
of how huge this process is
that's taking place on the Antarctic.

605
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,550
<i>As the floating shelves</i>
<i>break up, they allow water,</i>

606
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,111
<i>which has been locked up on land as ice</i>
<i>for thousands of years,</i>

607
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,998
<i>to empty into the sea.</i>

608
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,072
<i>And this is predicted to push up</i>
<i>sea levels.</i>

609
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,758
If the ice shelves break up,
then that opens the flood gates.

610
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,717
Ice on land flows faster into the sea

611
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,439
and that's what pushes up
the sea levels.

612
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:43,115
So, what's happening here right now
affects all of us.

613
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,514
Already, cities like Miami here
are under threat.

614
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,552
Scientists predict that by the end
of the century,

615
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,429
the sea levels could have risen
by a metre or even two.

616
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,632
Were that to happen, parts of this city
would certainly be submerged.

617
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,912
<i>Around the world, hundreds of millions</i>
<i>of people live near the coast,</i>

618
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,517
<i>and as sea levels rise,</i>
<i>their lives will be seriously affected.</i>

619
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:45,800
<i>It's now clear that our actions</i>
<i>are having a significant impact</i>

620
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,633
<i>on the world's oceans.</i>

621
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,757
<i>During the four years it took</i>
<i>to make this series,</i>

622
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,912
<i>we've witnessed many of these changes</i>
<i>first-hand.</i>

623
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,872
<i>But we've also worked alongside</i>
<i>men and women</i>

624
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,715
<i>dedicating their lives to safeguarding</i>
<i>the ocean's future.</i>

625
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,432
The oceans provide us with oxygen,

626
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,477
they regulate temperature,

627
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,598
they provide us with food
and energy supplies.

628
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:36,076
And it's unthinkable to have a world
without a healthy ocean.

629
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,714
I still think we have
the capability

630
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,872
to change the manner in which
we're wasting resources,

631
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,917
in which we're poisoning our oceans,

632
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,590
and we can look to a future
with healthy oceans.

633
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,592
When I look forward, I believe
that if what we are doing

634
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,115
can be duplicated just a little bit.

635
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,074
These animals will have a chance
of surviving.

636
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,032
It comes down, I think, to us each
taking responsibility

637
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,755
for the personal choices that we make
in our everyday lives.

638
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,674
That's all any of us can be expected
to do.

639
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,320
And it is those everyday choices
that add up.

640
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,673
We are at a unique stage in our history.

641
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,514
Never before have we had
such an awareness

642
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,557
of what we are doing to the planet.

643
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,629
And never before have we had the power
to do something about that.

644
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,555
Surely, we have a responsibility
to care for our blue planet.

645
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,479
The future of humanity,

646
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,792
and indeed all life on Earth,

647
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,156
now depends on us.
