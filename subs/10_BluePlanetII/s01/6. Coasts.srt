1
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,794
<i>An olive ridley turtle.</i>

2
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,398
<i>She's resting in the shallows</i>
<i>off Costa Rica,</i>

3
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,153
<i>having swum a thousand miles to be here.</i>

4
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,152
<i>All because the eggs she carries</i>
<i>must be laid on dry land.</i>

5
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,398
<i>Now she's returned</i>
<i>to the very same beach</i>

6
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
<i>where she hatched 10 years ago.</i>

7
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,836
<i>She must leave the safety</i>
<i>of her marine world</i>

8
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,837
<i>and brave the alien world beyond.</i>

9
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,752
<i>She's heavily laden</i>

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,597
<i>but the future of the next generation</i>
<i>of her kind is at stake.</i>

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,756
<i>All along the beach in a spectacle</i>
<i>that has remained unchanged</i>

12
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,473
<i>for millions or years,</i>

13
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,398
<i>mother sea turtles emerge from the ocean</i>

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,954
<i>in their hundreds of thousands.</i>

15
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,596
<i>Only those animals</i>
<i>that overcome the great challenges</i>

16
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,672
<i>of both land and sea</i>

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,755
<i>can make the most of life</i>
<i>here on the coast.</i>

18
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,919
<i>Our shores are places of sudden changes</i>
<i>and rich rewards.</i>

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,040
<i>The Galapagos Islands</i>
<i>in the tropical Pacific Ocean.</i>

20
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,471
<i>Their barren coastline</i>
<i>looks inhospitable,</i>

21
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,311
<i>but one group of animals has learnt</i>
<i>to use it to their advantage.</i>

22
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,555
<i>Sea lions.</i>

23
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,040
<i>Bachelors.</i>

24
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,115
<i>They need to pile on the pounds</i>

25
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,393
<i>as only the biggest males will attract</i>
<i>a female and manage to breed.</i>

26
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,951
<i>If these young bulls</i>
<i>fail to grow big enough,</i>

27
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,759
<i>they will remain exiled</i>
<i>on this isolated shoreline.</i>

28
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,280
<i>So one hungry young bull</i>
<i>heads out alone.</i>

29
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,434
<i>He's on the hunt for big game.</i>

30
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,120
<i>Yellowfin tuna.</i>

31
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,036
<i>Each weighing 60 kilos</i>

32
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,438
<i>with a top speed of 40 miles an hour.</i>

33
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,197
<i>He can't possibly catch one</i>
<i>in the open sea,</i>

34
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,912
<i>but he has a plan.</i>

35
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,599
<i>Ahead lies the entrance to the cove.</i>

36
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,838
<i>He herds them towards it</i>

37
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,120
<i>into his trap.</i>

38
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,035
<i>Driving them into a dead end.</i>

39
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,393
<i>But they give him the slip.</i>

40
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,074
<i>He's failed.</i>

41
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,917
<i>But there might be another way.</i>

42
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,880
<i>Now they head off as a team</i>

43
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,594
<i>to round up more tuna,</i>

44
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,955
<i>driving them back into the cove.</i>

45
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,509
<i>The sea lions fan out channelling</i>
<i>the tuna towards the bottleneck.</i>

46
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
<i>Once again the tuna hit the dead end.</i>

47
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,079
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>the young bull doubles back</i>

48
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,631
<i>to act as a blocker</i>
<i>sealing off the exit.</i>

49
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,639
<i>This time when the shoal</i>
<i>tries to escape,</i>

50
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,714
<i>he blocks them and drives them back</i>
<i>into the next blind alley.</i>

51
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,110
<i>The gang can now pick them off</i>
<i>one by one.</i>

52
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,236
<i>This clever fishing technique,</i>

53
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,870
<i>demanding foresight,</i>
<i>planning and cooperation,</i>

54
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,791
<i>has only every been seen here</i>
<i>in the Galapagos.</i>

55
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,113
<i>Each massive fish provides them</i>
<i>with five times more protein</i>

56
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,953
<i>than a normal day's hunting.</i>

57
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,071
<i>Finally, the young bull leaves his post</i>

58
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,072
<i>to claim his reward.</i>

59
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,760
<i>On a diet of protein-rich tuna,</i>

60
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>he's well on the way to becoming</i>
<i>a full-sized breeding bull.</i>

61
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,274
<i>By using this cove,</i>

62
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,752
<i>these Galapagos sea lions</i>
<i>have made the most of the opportunities</i>

63
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,516
<i>that occur</i>
<i>where the coast's two worlds meet.</i>

64
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,357
<i>Coasts are the most swiftly changing</i>
<i>of all ocean habitats</i>

65
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,036
<i>because of the tides.</i>

66
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,160
<i>Tides are created as the moon's gravity</i>
<i>pulls at the sea.</i>

67
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,360
<i>As the moon circles our planet,</i>
<i>the seas rise and fall.</i>

68
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,792
<i>Typically twice a day,</i>

69
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,953
<i>creating the most constantly dynamic</i>
<i>landscapes on Earth.</i>

70
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,553
<i>Nowhere else do sea-living creatures</i>
<i>face such changeable conditions.</i>

71
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,277
<i>With the daily risk of drying out</i>
<i>and being scorched by the sun.</i>

72
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,754
<i>Where the tide retreats</i>
<i>across a rocky shore,</i>

73
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,476
<i>it can leave behind a temporary oasis.</i>

74
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,593
<i>A rock pool.</i>

75
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,799
<i>Seemingly, it's a haven of calm.</i>

76
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,720
<i>But not for long.</i>

77
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,470
<i>Turning minutes into seconds</i>
<i>reveals unexpected dramas.</i>

78
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,157
<i>In rock pools, grazers, scavengers</i>
<i>and filter feeders</i>

79
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,960
<i>must all make the most</i>
<i>of the few short hours</i>

80
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,793
<i>before the tide returns.</i>

81
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,833
<i>Anemones gulp down</i>
<i>anything they can reach.</i>

82
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,551
<i>Though some meals</i>
<i>are harder to digest than others.</i>

83
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,357
<i>These magical worlds</i>
<i>soon become battlegrounds.</i>

84
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,678
<i>A deadly predator with five arms</i>
<i>and on the underside a mouth.</i>

85
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,998
<i>The ochre starfish.</i>

86
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,439
<i>And it's in search of limpets.</i>

87
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,120
<i>For some, there is no escape.</i>

88
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,437
<i>But other limpets have a secret defence.</i>

89
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,799
<i>They deploy a slippery shield</i>

90
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,232
<i>which allows them to slide to safety.</i>

91
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,869
<i>And this limpet</i>
<i>has its own personal bodyguard.</i>

92
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,158
<i>A scale worm with a nasty nip.</i>

93
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,160
<i>The starfish prefers food</i>
<i>that doesn't bite back.</i>

94
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,074
<i>The limpet carries on,</i>

95
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,836
<i>its bodyguard</i>
<i>tucked safe under its shell.</i>

96
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,554
<i>But there is one creature</i>

97
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,432
<i>that limpets have no defence against.</i>

98
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,080
<i>A clingfish.</i>

99
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,076
<i>It has teeth</i>
<i>that can lever under the shell</i>

100
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,400
<i>and twist the limpet off</i>
<i>like a bottle top.</i>

101
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,436
<i>The clingfish then swallows it</i>

102
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,997
<i>shell and all.</i>

103
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,232
<i>Rock pool dramas like these</i>
<i>last just a few short hours</i>

104
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,630
<i>before the tide returns.</i>

105
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,749
<i>Every day the sea becomes land</i>
<i>and the land becomes sea.</i>

106
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,356
<i>Bringing new opportunities.</i>

107
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,712
<i>A Sally Lightfoot crab,</i>

108
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,073
<i>one of thousands of shore crabs</i>
<i>just waiting for their moment.</i>

109
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,240
<i>Every day they gather</i>
<i>on the tropical shores of Brazil,</i>

110
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,794
<i>waiting for the tide to go out.</i>

111
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,119
<i>Which exposes their feeding ground,</i>

112
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,870
<i>seaweed covered rocks,</i>
<i>a hundred metres from the shore.</i>

113
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,436
<i>Getting there is a race</i>
<i>against the tide.</i>

114
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,077
<i>They leap from rock to rock.</i>

115
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,358
<i>These crabs seem</i>
<i>to be afraid of the water.</i>

116
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,317
<i>And for good reason.</i>

117
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,952
<i>The Moray eel.</i>

118
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,080
<i>The chain Moray</i>
<i>is a specialist crab hunter.</i>

119
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,191
<i>It's blunt teeth can easily grip</i>
<i>and crush a crab's shell.</i>

120
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,071
<i>It's the crab's deadliest enemy.</i>

121
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,830
<i>But the crab's feeding grounds</i>
<i>are still a long way off.</i>

122
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,873
<i>They must press on.</i>

123
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,074
<i>Halfway.</i>

124
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,074
<i>But their enemy has other ideas.</i>

125
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,000
<i>Crossing the land</i>

126
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,160
<i>to reset the ambush.</i>

127
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,792
<i>To feed, the crabs must keep going.</i>

128
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,072
<i>But nowhere is safe.</i>

129
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,358
<i>An octopus. Also a crab killer.</i>

130
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,592
<i>The crabs make a dash for it.</i>

131
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,916
<i>Made it.</i>

132
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,718
<i>Risking life and limb</i>

133
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,192
<i>to graze on these seaweed pastures.</i>

134
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,440
<i>But in two hours' time</i>
<i>when the tide starts to turn,</i>

135
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,916
<i>they will have to run the gauntlet</i>
<i>all over again.</i>

136
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,673
<i>Tides are not the only force</i>
<i>to have an impact on the coast.</i>

137
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,156
<i>The greatest waves</i>
<i>originate far out to sea</i>

138
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,075
<i>and roll in towards the coast,</i>
<i>growing as they come.</i>

139
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,793
<i>As the shallowing sea floor</i>
<i>drags at their underside,</i>

140
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,552
<i>their crests rise</i>
<i>up to a hundred feet high,</i>

141
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,395
<i>topple over and break.</i>

142
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,958
<i>Many of the biggest surfed waves</i>
<i>in the world</i>

143
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,834
<i>are formed off Nazare in Portugal.</i>

144
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,877
<i>Every day along this coast,</i>
<i>the impact of the waves is equivalent</i>

145
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,920
<i>to one and a half million tonnes of TNT.</i>

146
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,516
<i>Wave power gradually moulds</i>
<i>and reshapes our coasts.</i>

147
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,800
<i>In some parts of Europe,</i>

148
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,790
<i>waves wear away as much as three metres</i>
<i>of coastline each year.</i>

149
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,278
<i>The rate at which the waves</i>
<i>reshape the rock</i>

150
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,272
<i>depends on its hardness.</i>

151
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,595
<i>Where soft rock lies below hard,</i>

152
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,837
<i>dramatic arches are craved.</i>

153
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,152
<i>It's an endless assault</i>

154
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,154
<i>that gradually sculpts</i>
<i>vaulted cathedrals of stone</i>

155
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,471
<i>as here in northern Spain.</i>

156
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,636
<i>And wave power</i>
<i>creates towering fortresses</i>

157
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,797
<i>like these cliffs in these Arctic,</i>

158
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,556
<i>home to tens of thousands</i>
<i>of breeding seabirds.</i>

159
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,239
<i>The faces of the cliffs</i>
<i>are accessible only from the air</i>

160
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,149
<i>and have plenty of nooks and crannies</i>
<i>for those that can get there.</i>

161
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,996
<i>But to feed, seabirds must still master</i>
<i>the ocean world beyond.</i>

162
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,230
<i>The puffin.</i>

163
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,594
<i>He's a fisherman...</i>

164
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,394
<i>...and a father.</i>

165
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,990
<i>He has a mate for life.</i>

166
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,000
<i>Both share the burden of raising</i>
<i>their week-old chick,</i>

167
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,120
<i>their puffling who needs</i>
<i>five square meals a day.</i>

168
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,719
<i>The parents alternate fishing trips.</i>

169
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,679
<i>It's dad's turn.</i>

170
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,431
<i>When fish stocks are low,</i>

171
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,560
<i>puffins must fly as much as 30 miles</i>

172
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,395
<i>to reach the good fishing grounds.</i>

173
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,360
<i>Once there,</i>
<i>they plunge into another world.</i>

174
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,680
<i>Good fishing spots are hard to come by,</i>
<i>and they have company.</i>

175
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,960
<i>Guillemots.</i>

176
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,069
<i>Like the puffin, their wings are short</i>
<i>and good for diving.</i>

177
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,919
<i>Puffins can hold their breath</i>
<i>for over a minute</i>

178
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,079
<i>and dive as deep as 40 metres.</i>

179
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,720
<i>A catch.</i>

180
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,554
<i>But it's a long way home.</i>

181
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,352
<i>After an exhausting round trip</i>
<i>of almost 60 miles,</i>

182
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,671
<i>this puffin's nearly made it.</i>

183
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,316
<i>But there are pirates on this coast.</i>

184
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,513
<i>Arctic Skuas.</i>

185
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,036
<i>All around returning parents</i>
<i>are being robbed.</i>

186
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,073
<i>The skuas' long rake back wings</i>

187
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,391
<i>make them faster and more manoeuvrable.</i>

188
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,639
<i>Puffins must choose their moment wisely.</i>

189
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,480
<i>A near miss.</i>

190
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,113
<i>A last desperate burst of speed,</i>

191
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,034
<i>and it's made it.</i>

192
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,360
<i>Safely home</i>
<i>after a three-hour round trip...</i>

193
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,315
<i>... where his patient partner is waiting.</i>

194
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,599
<i>Today their puffling will eat.</i>

195
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,074
<i>But where fish numbers are in decline,</i>

196
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,479
<i>many puffins now find it hard</i>
<i>to get enough food for their chicks.</i>

197
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,077
<i>In the changing seas of today,</i>

198
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,080
<i>it can be even harder</i>
<i>to be a successful puffin parent.</i>

199
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,999
<i>Overcoming the challenges</i>
<i>of two worlds is seldom easy.</i>

200
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,592
<i>One marine creature has virtually</i>
<i>abandoned the sea altogether.</i>

201
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,234
<i>On a few remote pacific islands,</i>

202
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,791
<i>lives the most terrestrial fish</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

203
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,157
<i>At the top of this metre-high</i>
<i>limestone cliff,</i>

204
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,358
<i>an eight-centimetre long blenny</i>
<i>has chosen a nest hole.</i>

205
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,157
<i>Up here, he can graze</i>
<i>on the abundant algae</i>

206
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,318
<i>without any competition</i>
<i>from sea-going fish.</i>

207
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,351
<i>The females are feeding beneath him.</i>

208
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,030
<i>He's keen to attract their attention,</i>

209
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,793
<i>but they are busy moisturising.</i>

210
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,120
<i>Staying damp is essential</i>
<i>as they breathe through their skin.</i>

211
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,433
<i>To make himself conspicuous,</i>
<i>he turns black</i>

212
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,240
<i>and flashes his orange fin.</i>

213
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,639
<i>He catches her eye.</i>

214
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,239
<i>But these Pacific leaping blennies,</i>

215
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,000
<i>seem afraid of the waves.</i>

216
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,272
<i>They're poor swimmers</i>

217
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,396
<i>and will be easy prey in the sea.</i>

218
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,271
<i>Time to try again.</i>

219
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,075
<i>She's tempted.</i>

220
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,670
<i>But once again distracted by a wave.</i>

221
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,669
<i>The male just won't give up.</i>

222
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,793
<i>Finally, she's hooked.</i>

223
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,794
<i>He makes way...</i>

224
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,154
<i>so she can enter his cave.</i>

225
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,034
<i>And he encourages her to lay her eggs</i>

226
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,760
<i>with his seductive dance.</i>

227
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,319
<i>He then fertilizes them</i>
<i>in the safety of his nest.</i>

228
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,840
<i>The blenny has given up the sea</i>
<i>for a life on land.</i>

229
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,040
<i>Others have made</i>
<i>an even more successful move</i>

230
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,476
<i>but in a different direction.</i>

231
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,280
<i>Penguins have abandoned flying</i>

232
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,797
<i>and instead spend</i>
<i>most of their lives swimming.</i>

233
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,877
<i>Their sleek survival suits</i>
<i>of tightly packed feathers</i>

234
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,555
<i>are perfect for these freezing waters.</i>

235
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,439
<i>Yet, they must still come ashore</i>
<i>once a year.</i>

236
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,316
<i>South Georgia, an island wilderness</i>
<i>close to Antarctica.</i>

237
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,675
<i>Each spring, its beaches become</i>
<i>the busiest on Earth</i>

238
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,595
<i>as hundreds of thousands</i>
<i>of king penguins return here.</i>

239
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,198
<i>They're heading for the colony.</i>

240
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,757
<i>But in their way lies the biggest wall</i>
<i>of blubber on the planet.</i>

241
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,918
<i>Elephant seals.</i>

242
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,632
<i>It's the breeding season</i>

243
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,556
<i>and the four-tonne bulls are fighting</i>
<i>for control of their harems.</i>

244
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,240
<i>Best to wait for them to calm down.</i>

245
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,430
<i>He can't fly over this barrier,</i>

246
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,434
<i>so he will have to walk</i>
<i>as unobtrusively as possible.</i>

247
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,279
<i>And hope that sleeping giants</i>
<i>will continue to lie.</i>

248
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,876
<i>Careful.</i>

249
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,159
<i>This could be tricky.</i>

250
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
<i>A rival bull mounts a challenge.</i>

251
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,593
<i>The penguins could be caught</i>
<i>in the crossfire.</i>

252
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,315
<i>Eight tonnes of blubber collide.</i>

253
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,990
<i>The towering beach master is victorious.</i>

254
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,397
<i>In the confusion,</i>
<i>this penguin slips through.</i>

255
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,751
<i>Ahead are 40,000 chicks.</i>

256
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,716
<i>Hungry and over-excited.</i>

257
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,392
<i>But not every penguin</i>
<i>has a chick to feed.</i>

258
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,712
<i>That's not why they're here.</i>

259
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,638
<i>There is another reason.</i>

260
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,958
<i>There is a trial of endurance</i>
<i>that every penguin must face,</i>

261
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,077
<i>and it starts with a persistent itch.</i>

262
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,835
<i>His survival suit has been worn thin</i>

263
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,833
<i>by months of swimming</i>
<i>in the rough southern ocean.</i>

264
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,272
<i>His solution is drastic.</i>

265
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,955
<i>Shed all four layers of feathers</i>
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

266
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,630
<i>The process is known</i>
<i>as a catastrophic moult.</i>

267
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,991
<i>Until their feathers regrow,</i>

268
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,557
<i>penguins will remain rooted to the spot.</i>

269
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,431
<i>Having starved for a month,</i>

270
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,913
<i>they're now fully waterproofed</i>
<i>and insulated once more.</i>

271
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,633
<i>Lean, hungry and eager to return</i>
<i>to a life at sea.</i>

272
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,670
<i>Thanks to their waterproof plumage,</i>

273
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,838
<i>penguins are able to make</i>
<i>the most of both worlds</i>

274
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,158
<i>even in some of the harshest conditions</i>
<i>on Earth.</i>

275
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,199
<i>The coasts of South Georgia</i>

276
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,079
<i>are currently protected</i>
<i>by their remoteness.</i>

277
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,792
<i>Other coastlines</i>
<i>are much more vulnerable,</i>

278
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,190
<i>and they are now changing</i>
<i>faster than ever before.</i>

279
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,039
<i>Two thirds of our major cities</i>
<i>are on our coasts.</i>

280
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,360
<i>It's estimated that in the next decade,</i>

281
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,957
<i>we can expect 10%</i>
<i>of the world's remaining wild shores</i>

282
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,999
<i>to be taken over by human development.</i>

283
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,312
<i>Yet every year,</i>
<i>just off Florida 's Palm Beach</i>

284
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,040
<i>and extraordinary spectacle appears</i>
<i>almost unnoticed.</i>

285
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,639
<i>The biggest gathering of coastal sharks</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

286
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,394
<i>Spinners and blacktips.</i>

287
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,073
<i>Ten thousand of them.</i>

288
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,110
<i>EveryJanuary,</i>
<i>they seek out these warm shallows</i>

289
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,837
<i>as a stopover</i>
<i>on their migration northwards.</i>

290
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,991
<i>Sharks have been gathering here</i>
<i>since long before people arrived.</i>

291
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,038
<i>But today, they face levels of pollution</i>

292
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,520
<i>and habitat degradation</i>
<i>as well as fishing pressures.</i>

293
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,316
<i>that their ancestors</i>
<i>would never have experienced.</i>

294
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,198
<i>It's not longer enough</i>
<i>for coastal creatures</i>

295
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,590
<i>to master their own worlds.</i>

296
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,512
<i>Now they must face the many challenges</i>
<i>that come from our world, too.</i>

297
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,839
<i>To film the most surprising</i>
<i>coastal wildlife,</i>

298
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,314
<i>the</i> Blue Planet II <i>team</i>

299
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,313
<i>travelled to some of the remotest shores</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

300
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,518
<i>One destination</i>
<i>was the Galapagos islands.</i>

301
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,471
<i>Here they were in search</i>
<i>of an almost unbelievable story</i>

302
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,553
<i>brought to them by a local cameraman</i>
<i>Richard Wollocombe.</i>

303
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,673
Well, I was talking
to a friend of mine

304
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,830
who's a fisherman over here,

305
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,755
and he said that one day
he turned up here in this bay,

306
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:07,154
and suddenly he saw a group of sea lions
chasing these massive tuna

307
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,033
up onto the beach.

308
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,279
And I was like, "Yeah, funny one.
I don't believe a word of that."

309
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,153
That just sounds too unreal.

310
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,836
<i>Still the lure of the fisherman's tale</i>

311
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,752
<i>was too great to ignore.</i>

312
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,795
I'm a little nervous
that if it doesn't happen,

313
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,349
there goes my credibility.

314
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,840
<i>The</i> Blue Planet II <i>team</i>
<i>launch a full-scale expedition,</i>

315
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,709
<i>but one of them is still skeptical.</i>

316
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,874
It's gonna be pretty spectacular if...

317
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,113
if a sea lion could actually chase down
and kill a tuna.

318
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,913
I'm still yet to be convinced.

319
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,674
<i>They set up camp</i>
<i>in this barren cove,</i>

320
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,034
<i>home for the next month.</i>

321
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,513
<i>The local wildlife,</i>
<i>famed for its tameness,</i>

322
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,910
<i>is curious to meet its new neighbours.</i>

323
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,516
<i>With no sign of the sea lions,</i>

324
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,958
<i>the crew stake out the cove</i>
<i>with remote underwater cameras.</i>

325
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,037
<i>Field assistant Roby Pepolas</i>
<i>takes first watch.</i>

326
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,600
This is the point of view

327
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,877
where we try to see
the sea lions come in

328
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,673
jumping over the water.

329
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,070
If they're definitely coming very close,

330
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,790
they say, "Action, action,"
or "Rock and roll."

331
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,153
<i>Three hours later...</i>

332
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,837
<i>The aerial team are first up.</i>

333
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,994
<i>It's a sea lion chasing tuna</i>
<i>into the bay.</i>

334
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,799
Oh, he's got it. He's got it.

335
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,160
Unbelievable!

336
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,238
Look at that, he's still struggling.

337
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,954
Holy moly!

338
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,356
He's lost him.

339
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,515
<i>The tuna gives the sea lion the slip.</i>

340
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,597
<i>Over the coming days,</i>
<i>more sea lions arrive in the cove</i>

341
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,672
<i>chasing in yellowfin tuna.</i>

342
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,471
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh!

343
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,356
I bet you there's more tuna
and another sea lion.

344
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,315
There's like six tuna in that bay.

345
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,475
<i>One sea lion</i>
<i>has caught Richard's attention,</i>

346
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,792
<i>and he's affectionately</i>
<i>called him Tagboy.</i>

347
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,679
He's really different.
He's, like, a prolific hunter,

348
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,598
and he's really agile.

349
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,116
It's just fascinating to watch and see
the picture emerge about who he is.

350
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,075
<i>From above,</i>
<i>the drone is revealing</i>

351
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,675
<i>how the group of sea lions</i>
<i>are hunting together.</i>

352
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,072
From the air, we really see
the strategy of the sea lion

353
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,880
and see them
with their individual roles as well.

354
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,719
Tagboy stays off
in the middle of the channel

355
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,359
to make sure none of them escape.

356
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,430
Everyone's got a role

357
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,637
and they're really a team
in bringing them together.

358
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,678
<i>Although the sea lions</i>
<i>have been hunting in the shallows,</i>

359
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,436
<i>the crew are yet to see them</i>
<i>drive a tuna onto the beach.</i>

360
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,393
<i>And to make matters worse,</i>
<i>the sea lions aren't alone in this cove.</i>

361
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,353
<i>Galapagos sharks, each two metres long.</i>

362
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,316
The shark almost beached itself

363
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,313
and stole the tuna
from the big sea lion,

364
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,033
who is now really angry.

365
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,120
<i>Despite the sharks,</i>

366
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,200
<i>to reveal the full story,</i>
<i>Richard needs to get in the water.</i>

367
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,318
Classic shark attack scenario.
Blood in the water, shallow,

368
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,518
and easy mistaken identity.

369
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,719
Watch your hands, Roby.

370
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,831
<i>The crew gain some protection</i>
<i>from chain mail suits.</i>

371
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,829
This is not a shark pool.

372
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,719
One, two, three, four, five,
six sharks now.

373
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,637
<i>With so much blood in the water,</i>
<i>the sharks go into a feeding frenzy.</i>

374
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,917
Make mince meat
of these tuna in seconds.

375
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,478
To be so close to something
so unbelievably ferocious

376
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,076
and dangerous, quite frankly,

377
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,198
is amazing. It's... It's...

378
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,870
It's nice to be able to hide
behind all this though.

379
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,192
<i>But then, after a week</i>
<i>of increasing activity,</i>

380
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,239
<i>the sea lions suddenly stop fishing.</i>

381
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,915
It's the first day though

382
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,117
that we haven't seen any action
during the whole day.

383
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,358
Since we start.

384
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,799
We are kind of worried.

385
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,397
<i>The tuna have disappeared.</i>

386
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,674
<i>Richard is worried.</i>

387
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,995
The signs are starting to show
across the globe

388
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,914
that the seas are warming,
they're becoming less productive.

389
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,559
<i>Galapagos marine life</i>
<i>relies on cold, deep currents</i>

390
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,196
<i>welling up intermittently</i>
<i>to fertilize the surface waters.</i>

391
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,549
If those upwellings
become less consistent,

392
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,076
er, their lives could well be
in jeopardy.

393
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,716
<i>In the past,</i>

394
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,032
<i>when these cold water upwellings</i>
<i>have temporarily stopped,</i>

395
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,796
<i>many sea lions have starved to death.</i>

396
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,510
<i>And a warming ocean</i>
<i>could further weaken these upwellings.</i>

397
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,073
<i>Then after two weeks of nervous waiting,</i>

398
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,475
<i>a hopeful sign.</i>

399
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,553
<i>A thick fog descends over the cove.</i>

400
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,074
We've got very cold water
that's come up, upwelled,

401
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,840
and spread across the ocean,

402
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,437
and mixed with the warm air,
creating the fog

403
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,952
and hoping that this cold water

404
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,030
willjust kick things off a bit,
you know, and get the action going.

405
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,674
<i>As the fog clears,</i>
<i>a welcome sight...</i>

406
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,430
<i>The tuna are back</i>
<i>with sea lions hot on their heels.</i>

407
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,473
<i>The crew leap into action.</i>

408
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,556
<i>Being in the water,</i>

409
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,997
<i>Richard can at last follow</i>
<i>the sea lions' teamwork</i>

410
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,350
<i>and finally film Tagboy beaching a tuna.</i>

411
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,834
The know the bottlenecks
in this labyrinth.

412
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,351
They know how to push them
into those bottlenecks

413
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,800
and threre was just Tagboy,

414
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,520
almost his entire body
was blocking the entrance,

415
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,952
and he was just gently back and forth
tiring the fish out.

416
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,359
Absolutely extraordinary.
Really, really impressive.

417
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,230
<i>Director Rachel</i>

418
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,154
<i>has a newfound respect</i>
<i>for the sea lions.</i>

419
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,791
I had no idea they were capable

420
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,114
of this level of planning and strategy
and teamwork.

421
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,709
I had no idea
they were this intelligent.

422
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,512
<i>Richard has succeeded in filming</i>
<i>this unique hunting strategy</i>

423
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,640
<i>and in doing so has proved</i>
<i>the fisherman's tale to be true.</i>

424
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,080
The sea lions' intelligence
is unbelievably sophisticated.

425
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,109
So to say that my expectations
have been exceeded

426
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,600
is a sight understatement.

427
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,759
This is been
one of the most remarkable times

428
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,433
I've ever had here in the Galapagos.

429
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,554
