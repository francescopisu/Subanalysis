1
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,913
<i>Antarctica.</i>

2
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,114
<i>The coldest, the harshest,</i>
<i>and the most remote continent on Earth.</i>

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,517
<i>No human being has ever descended</i>
<i>into the depths that surround it...</i>

4
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,149
<i>...until now.</i>

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,271
<i>The deep ocean is as</i>
<i>challenging to explore as space.</i>

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,835
<i>We know more about the surface of Mars</i>

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,833
<i>than we do about</i>
<i>the deepest parts of our seas.</i>

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,110
<i>Now we can dive</i>
<i>these uncharted depths,</i>

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,630
<i>to discover what secrets lie beneath.</i>

10
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,793
<i>Sinking down beside</i>
<i>the submerged wall of an iceberg,</i>

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,475
<i>we enter an unforgiving world.</i>

12
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,992
<i>These waters</i>
<i>are the coldest on Earth.</i>

13
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,597
<i>As we descend into the deep,</i>

14
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,434
<i>the pressure increases relentlessly.</i>

15
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,918
<i>And the light from above</i>
<i>all but disappears.</i>

16
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,794
<i>Yet, incredibly...</i>

17
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,673
<i>there is life here.</i>

18
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,600
<i>We might have expected</i>

19
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,718
<i>that deep beneath</i>
<i>the surface of the Polar seas,</i>

20
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,594
<i>the waters would be truly barren.</i>

21
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,836
<i>But, in fact, we find life here</i>
<i>in unimaginable abundance.</i>

22
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,238
<i>Nor is such great abundance</i>
<i>confined to Antarctic waters.</i>

23
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,557
<i>Currents carry this richness</i>

24
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,600
<i>into the depths of almost</i>
<i>every ocean around the world.</i>

25
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,030
<i>Astonishingly, in the deep sea,</i>

26
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,875
<i>there is more life</i>
<i>than anywhere else on Earth.</i>

27
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,237
<i>The sunlight fades,</i>

28
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,273
<i>and the seas darken.</i>

29
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,278
<i>Here, in the Pacific, 200 metres down,</i>

30
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,080
<i>we enter an alien world.</i>

31
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,750
<i>The Twilight Zone,</i>

32
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
<i>a sea of eternal gloom.</i>

33
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,476
<i>There are strange creatures here.</i>

34
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,315
<i>A pyrosome.</i>

35
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,436
<i>A tube of jelly two metres long</i>
<i>that dwarfs a visitor from above,</i>

36
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,637
<i>an oceanic whitetip shark.</i>

37
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,314
<i>Only a tiny amount of light</i>
<i>filters down this far.</i>

38
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,910
<i>Survival here means making the most</i>
<i>of every last glimmer.</i>

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,229
<i>A swordfish.</i>

40
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,480
<i>Its eyes are as big as tennis balls</i>
<i>to help it see in the perpetual dusk.</i>

41
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,635
<i>A squid, but this is one</i>
<i>that lives only here.</i>

42
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,112
<i>Its right eye</i>
<i>looks permanently downwards.</i>

43
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,598
<i>But its left eye is much bigger</i>
<i>and trained upwards</i>

44
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,680
<i>to detect the silhouettes of prey</i>
<i>swimming nearer the surface.</i>

45
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,032
<i>No wonder it's nicknamed</i>
<i>the "cock-eyed squid".</i>

46
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,312
<i>And even stranger,</i>

47
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,711
<i>this is barreleye,</i>

48
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,280
<i>a fish with a transparent head,</i>

49
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,832
<i>filled with jelly,</i>

50
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,913
<i>so that it can look up</i>
<i>through its skull.</i>

51
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,152
<i>We now know that</i>
<i>the Twilight Zone is a refuge</i>

52
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,036
<i>for an incredible 90%</i>
<i>of all fish in the ocean.</i>

53
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,919
<i>Only at night,</i>
<i>do vast shoals of lanternfish</i>

54
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,994
<i>migrate to the surface</i>
<i>to feed on tiny plankton.</i>

55
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,070
<i>By day, they retreat back down here.</i>

56
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,397
<i>Humboldt squid.</i>

57
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,598
<i>Two metres long</i>
<i>and 50 kilos in weight.</i>

58
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,037
<i>Like most squid,</i>
<i>they're voracious hunters.</i>

59
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
<i>There are hundreds of them.</i>

60
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,676
<i>They found a shoal of lanternfish</i>

61
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,549
<i>hiding 800 metres down,</i>
<i>off the coast of South America.</i>

62
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,794
<i>Their tentacles are armed</i>
<i>with powerful suckers</i>

63
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,917
<i>with which they grab their prey.</i>

64
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,152
<i>And when there are</i>
<i>no more lanternfish to be found,</i>

65
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,351
<i>they turn on each other.</i>

66
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,916
<i>This squid has caught</i>
<i>a smaller one in its tentacles.</i>

67
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,677
<i>To hide its capture from the rest,</i>

68
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,400
<i>it releases a smokescreen of black ink.</i>

69
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,113
<i>But then, an even</i>
<i>bigger one challenges it</i>

70
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,996
<i>and steals its catch.</i>

71
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,154
<i>The Twilight Zone</i>

72
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,233
<i>is the Humboldt squid's</i>
<i>favourite hunting ground.</i>

73
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,514
<i>They seldom go deeper</i>

74
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,277
<i>into the world</i>
<i>of perpetual blackness below.</i>

75
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,432
<i>The Midnight Zone.</i>

76
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,754
<i>Two-thirds of</i>
<i>a mile from the surface,</i>

77
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,036
<i>beyond the reach of the sun.</i>

78
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,715
<i>A giant black void</i>

79
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,589
<i>larger than all the rest</i>
<i>of the world's habitat's combined.</i>

80
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,399
<i>There's life here,</i>

81
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,599
<i>but not as we know it.</i>

82
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,353
<i>Alien-like creatures</i>

83
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,194
<i>produce dazzling displays of light.</i>

84
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,598
<i>Nearly all animals</i>
<i>need to attract mates</i>

85
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,160
<i>and repel predators.</i>

86
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,391
<i>This language of light</i>
<i>is so widespread here,</i>

87
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,872
<i>that these signals are probably</i>
<i>the commonest form of communication</i>

88
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,559
<i>on the entire planet.</i>

89
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,600
<i>And yet,</i>
<i>we still know little about them.</i>

90
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,672
<i>Hunters illuminate themselves,</i>

91
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,114
<i>and by doing so</i>

92
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,510
<i>attract inquisitive prey.</i>

93
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,956
<i>This is fangtooth.</i>

94
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,550
<i>It has the largest teeth</i>
<i>for its size of any fish.</i>

95
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,477
<i>There are pressure sensors</i>
<i>all over its head and body</i>

96
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,951
<i>which can detect anything</i>
<i>moving in the surrounding water.</i>

97
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,150
<i>It's the Midnight Zone's</i>
<i>most voracious fish.</i>

98
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,318
<i>But prey use light as a distraction.</i>

99
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,799
<i>A decoy of luminous ink.</i>

100
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,196
<i>Down here, in this blackness,</i>

101
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,796
<i>creatures live beyond</i>
<i>the normal rules of time.</i>

102
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,751
<i>Siphonophores are virtually eternal.</i>

103
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,595
<i>They repeatedly clone themselves,</i>

104
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,436
<i>some eventually growing</i>
<i>longer than a blue whale.</i>

105
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,438
<i>Down here, it snows.</i>

106
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,473
<i>Continuous clouds of organic debris</i>

107
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,200
<i>drift slowly down from above.</i>

108
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,476
<i>This is food,</i>

109
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,600
<i>and a whole variety</i>
<i>of filter feeders depend on it.</i>

110
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,955
<i>Jellyfish.</i>

111
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,120
<i>And delicate sea cucumbers.</i>

112
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,680
<i>The 1% of marine snow they miss</i>

113
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,869
<i>eventually settles on the sea floor.</i>

114
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,279
<i>Over millions of years,</i>

115
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,877
<i>it forms a layer of mud</i>
<i>up to a mile thick.</i>

116
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,912
<i>It's an empty plain</i>

117
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,879
<i>that covers half</i>
<i>the surface of our planet.</i>

118
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,833
<i>The deep seabed may,</i>
<i>at first, appear lifeless,</i>

119
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,438
<i>but it's home to a unique</i>
<i>cast of mud dwellers.</i>

120
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,594
<i>The sea toad.</i>

121
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,240
<i>It is an ambush predator</i>
<i>with an enormous mouth</i>

122
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,157
<i>and infinite patience.</i>

123
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,077
<i>This fish has been</i>
<i>living for so long here</i>

124
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,517
<i>that its fins have changed</i>
<i>into something more useful.</i>

125
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,949
<i>Feet.</i>

126
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,958
<i>They help it shuffle about</i>
<i>on the sea floor.</i>

127
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,470
<i>The flapjack octopus.</i>

128
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
<i>It hovers just above</i>
<i>the surface of the mud</i>

129
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,834
<i>as it delicately sifts through it</i>
<i>searching for worms.</i>

130
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,194
<i>But it can jet away</i>
<i>at the first sign of danger.</i>

131
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,798
<i>A sixgill shark,</i>
<i>as big as a great white.</i>

132
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,831
<i>It may not have eaten</i>
<i>for an entire year.</i>

133
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,277
<i>It patrols the mud plains</i>

134
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,034
<i>using a minimum amount of energy.</i>

135
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,750
<i>High above,</i>

136
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,309
<i>the carcass of a huge sperm whale</i>

137
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,517
<i>is slowly decaying.</i>

138
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,117
<i>This will be a bonanza</i>
<i>for the creatures of the deep.</i>

139
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,349
<i>Food.</i>

140
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,513
<i>Thirty tonnes of it.</i>

141
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,480
<i>Finally it settles on the ocean floor</i>

142
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,039
<i>and its presence is soon detected.</i>

143
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,158
<i>Sixgills sharks</i>

144
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,994
<i>have an exceptionally</i>
<i>acute sense of smell.</i>

145
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,754
<i>Just 25 minutes</i>
<i>after the whale's carcass arrives,</i>

146
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,758
<i>a sixgill finds it.</i>

147
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,151
<i>Each bite releases</i>
<i>blood into the current.</i>

148
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,877
<i>The news that food</i>
<i>is here spreads quickly.</i>

149
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,516
<i>Two more ravenous sixgills arrive.</i>

150
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,670
<i>Within 12 hours,</i>
<i>there are seven enormous sharks</i>

151
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,240
<i>jostling with one another</i>

152
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,994
<i>as they compete to tear off mouthfuls.</i>

153
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
<i>No one is prepared to back off.</i>

154
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,273
<i>Twenty-four hours later,</i>

155
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,273
<i>and a third of the carcass has gone.</i>

156
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,471
<i>The first arrival has gorged</i>

157
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,517
<i>until it's completely full.</i>

158
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,033
<i>This single meal</i>

159
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,636
<i>may be enough to sustain it</i>
<i>for a whole year.</i>

160
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,037
<i>Now, the clean up team arrives.</i>

161
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,431
<i>Spider crabs carrying coral</i>
<i>in their hind legs,</i>

162
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,999
<i>presumably as makeshift body armour.</i>

163
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,151
<i>There are rock crabs here too.</i>

164
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,873
<i>They probably detected the carcass</i>
<i>almost as soon as the sharks,</i>

165
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,311
<i>but they can't move as fast.</i>

166
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,197
<i>A month on,</i>
<i>and over 30 species of scavenger</i>

167
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,512
<i>are clearing away</i>
<i>the last edible fragments.</i>

168
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,874
<i>But now, the scavengers</i>
<i>are attracting their own predators.</i>

169
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,278
<i>Scabbardfish, habitually</i>
<i>swimming upright,</i>

170
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,716
<i>are picking them off one by one.</i>

171
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,035
<i>Some of the whale's teeth</i>
<i>have been dislodged</i>

172
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,715
<i>as the skeleton starts to fall apart.</i>

173
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,876
<i>Four months later,</i>
<i>there is nothing left but a few bones.</i>

174
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,357
<i>But even they are food</i>

175
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,829
<i>for something.</i>

176
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,313
<i>Zombie worms.</i>

177
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,756
<i>They tunnel into the bones</i>
<i>by injecting acid</i>

178
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,554
<i>and so reach the tiny amounts of fat</i>
<i>that still remain there.</i>

179
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,439
<i>It may take decades,</i>

180
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,514
<i>but eventually,</i>
<i>the last of the bones will crumble,</i>

181
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,072
<i>and the whole 30-tonne carcass</i>
<i>will have been recycled.</i>

182
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,397
<i>A whale fall is a temporary oasis</i>

183
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,472
<i>in the desert of the sea floor.</i>

184
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,560
<i>But there are permanent oases here too.</i>

185
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,070
<i>Rocks projecting above the mud</i>

186
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,471
<i>provide anchorage for deep sea corals.</i>

187
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,070
<i>As far down</i>
<i>as three and a half miles,</i>

188
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,959
<i>there are more species of coral</i>
<i>in the deep</i>

189
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,509
<i>than on shallow tropical reefs.</i>

190
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,909
<i>Without sunlight,</i>
<i>they rely solely on food</i>

191
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,559
<i>drifting in the current.</i>

192
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,354
<i>And they grow</i>

193
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,752
<i>just a hair's breadth a year.</i>

194
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,029
<i>But some of them</i>
<i>can live for 4,000 years.</i>

195
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,638
<i>They, like their</i>
<i>shallow water relatives,</i>

196
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,151
<i>provide homes for all kinds</i>
<i>of other creatures.</i>

197
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,312
<i>Growing among the corals,</i>

198
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,120
<i>is one of the most beautiful of sponges.</i>

199
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,230
<i>This is Venus' flower basket.</i>

200
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,791
<i>These sponges have lodgers.</i>

201
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,875
<i>Shrimps.</i>

202
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,551
<i>There are plenty</i>
<i>of predators on the reef</i>

203
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,917
<i>so the shrimps are fortunate.</i>

204
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,357
<i>Both this male and female,</i>

205
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,512
<i>were swept into this sponge</i>
<i>when they were tiny larvae,</i>

206
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,440
<i>along with the minute particles of food</i>

207
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,432
<i>on which the sponge feeds.</i>

208
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,195
<i>They found each other</i>
<i>and have been here ever since.</i>

209
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,997
<i>Now, they're full-grown</i>

210
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,595
<i>and the female is carrying eggs.</i>

211
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,599
<i>Once hatched, the larvae will swim</i>
<i>out through the sponge's walls.</i>

212
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,480
<i>But the shrimps will never leave.</i>

213
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,910
<i>They can't.</i>

214
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,240
<i>They're now far too big</i>
<i>to go out the way they came in.</i>

215
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,957
<i>And, no doubt,</i>
<i>they will live longer here</i>

216
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,557
<i>than they would if they were</i>
<i>wandering about on the reef unprotected.</i>

217
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,432
<i>But how one</i>
<i>of the simplest of all animals,</i>

218
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,077
<i>a sponge, is able to build</i>
<i>such a complex structure</i>

219
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,432
<i>to the great benefit of the shrimps</i>

220
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,355
<i>is a mystery.</i>

221
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,511
<i>And, surely, a marvel.</i>

222
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,190
<i>But today,</i>

223
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,069
<i>their timeless world</i>
<i>is being reduced to rubble.</i>

224
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,592
<i>As over-fishing empties</i>
<i>the surface waters of the seas,</i>

225
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,111
<i>trawlers have started</i>
<i>to ransack the deep.</i>

226
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,159
<i>Now, countless numbers of the reefs</i>

227
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,675
<i>that have flourished here for millennia</i>

228
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,672
<i>lie in ruins.</i>

229
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,190
<i>Over time,</i>

230
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,830
<i>organic matter on the sea floor</i>
<i>slowly decays</i>

231
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,000
<i>producing methane.</i>

232
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,837
<i>In the Gulf of Mexico,</i>

233
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,755
<i>these eruptions also release</i>
<i>a super salty liquid.</i>

234
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,990
<i>Brine.</i>

235
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,720
<i>Five times heavier than sea water,</i>

236
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,637
<i>it accumulates in great pools</i>
<i>on the sea floor.</i>

237
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,040
<i>It's difficult to make sense</i>
<i>of the sight.</i>

238
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,192
<i>A lake of concentrated salt water,</i>

239
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,078
<i>fifteen metres deep,</i>

240
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,673
<i>at the bottom of the sea.</i>

241
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,070
<i>Around its margin,</i>
<i>perhaps even more strangely,</i>

242
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,720
<i>there is a profusion of life.</i>

243
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,799
<i>Giant mussels that can live</i>
<i>or grow for a century or more,</i>

244
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,439
<i>pack tightly together,</i>

245
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,514
<i>dwarfing the shrimps and squat lobsters</i>
<i>that feed around them.</i>

246
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,272
<i>Cutthroat eels, scavengers,</i>

247
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,591
<i>come to the shores of the brine lake</i>

248
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,512
<i>in search of something edible.</i>

249
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,919
<i>Some even venture into the brine.</i>

250
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,798
<i>Spending too long in it</i>
<i>can send an eel into toxic shock.</i>

251
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,553
<i>Its only hope</i>
<i>is to rise above it.</i>

252
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,713
<i>It manages to escape.</i>

253
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,718
<i>Others are not so lucky.</i>

254
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,396
<i>The brine embalms their bodies,</i>

255
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,229
<i>and the casualties of decades</i>
<i>accumulate around the margins.</i>

256
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,676
<i>But parts of the deep</i>
<i>are even more hostile.</i>

257
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,350
<i>In places,</i>

258
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,310
<i>gigantic cracks stretch for many miles</i>
<i>across the ocean floor.</i>

259
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,000
<i>Canyons that plunge</i>
<i>towards the centre of the earth.</i>

260
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,477
<i>Scans from survey vessels</i>

261
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,031
<i>make it possible to graphically</i>
<i>reconstruct an image</i>

262
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,635
<i>of this vast submarine landscape.</i>

263
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,438
<i>The deepest of all,</i>
<i>at almost seven miles,</i>

264
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,399
<i>is the Mariana Trench</i>
<i>in the Pacific Ocean.</i>

265
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,710
<i>Even Mount Everest</i>
<i>could disappear inside it.</i>

266
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,111
<i>Down here, in these deep ravines,</i>

267
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,513
<i>it was once thought that</i>
<i>nothing whatever could possibly survive.</i>

268
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,999
<i>But there is life even here.</i>

269
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,312
<i>A kind of sea slug.</i>

270
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,116
<i>A so-called sea pig.</i>

271
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,356
<i>They, and other simple creatures,</i>

272
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,674
<i>manage to survive on the miniscule</i>
<i>amount of food that drifts down here.</i>

273
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,679
<i>Like this starfish,</i>

274
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,754
<i>they can withstand pressure</i>
<i>equivalent of 50 jumbo jets</i>

275
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,036
<i>stacked on top of one another.</i>

276
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,918
<i>A remote camera probe</i>

277
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,391
<i>reveals the most</i>
<i>extraordinary discovery of all.</i>

278
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,832
<i>The ethereal snailfish.</i>

279
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,472
<i>At five miles down,</i>

280
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,474
<i>this is the deepest living fish</i>
<i>so far discovered.</i>

281
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,199
<i>No one imagined</i>

282
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,159
<i>than an animal as complex as a fish</i>

283
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,278
<i>could exist in such extreme pressures.</i>

284
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,993
<i>From the greatest depths</i>

285
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,959
<i>to the uppermost limit</i>
<i>of the Twilight Zone,</i>

286
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,317
<i>it seems that there is</i>
<i>nowhere in the deep sea</i>

287
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,234
<i>where life of some kind can't survive.</i>

288
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,996
<i>And we now think</i>

289
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,630
<i>that the deep sea may well be</i>
<i>where life on Earth began.</i>

290
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,590
<i>Here,</i>

291
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,391
<i>in a world hidden within the greatest</i>
<i>geological feature on Earth,</i>

292
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,150
<i>running right down the middle</i>
<i>of the world's oceans,</i>

293
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,516
<i>an underwater mountain range</i>

294
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,757
<i>spanning the entire globe.</i>

295
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,598
<i>The mid-ocean ridge.</i>

296
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,153
<i>In the South Pacific,</i>

297
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,039
<i>the ocean floor is being torn apart.</i>

298
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,558
<i>Over three quarters</i>
<i>of the planet's volcanic activity</i>

299
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,791
<i>occurs in the deep.</i>

300
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,270
<i>Almost all of it along</i>
<i>the mid-ocean ridge.</i>

301
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,994
<i>But from this titanic violence</i>

302
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,037
<i>come great riches.</i>

303
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,516
<i>Gases and scalding water</i>
<i>gush up through the crevices.</i>

304
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,275
<i>Minerals condensing from these jets</i>

305
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,192
<i>build up great chimneys.</i>

306
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,472
<i>Hydrothermal vents.</i>

307
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,590
<i>This one, 30 metres tall,</i>

308
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,672
<i>has been named "Godzilla".</i>

309
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,316
<i>Astonishingly, we now know</i>

310
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,394
<i>that they hold as much life</i>
<i>as tropical rainforests.</i>

311
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,875
<i>In places, half a million</i>
<i>individual animals</i>

312
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,839
<i>are crammed into a single square metre.</i>

313
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,836
<i>They depend entirely</i>
<i>for their food on bacteria.</i>

314
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,596
<i>And they feed on chemicals</i>

315
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,354
<i>dissolved in the searingly hot fluid.</i>

316
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,630
<i>Crabs consume the bacterial mats</i>

317
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,632
<i>that coat their shells.</i>

318
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,799
<i>Others maintain</i>
<i>bacterial cultures,</i>

319
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,349
<i>actually within their bodies.</i>

320
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,236
<i>Shrimps carry such cultures</i>
<i>in their mouth parts.</i>

321
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,714
<i>But that is a strategy</i>
<i>fraught with danger.</i>

322
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,160
<i>To provide sustenance</i>
<i>for these microbes,</i>

323
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,392
<i>the shrimps must dash</i>
<i>into the hot vents,</i>

324
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,478
<i>and that risks being boiled alive.</i>

325
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,480
<i>In the last decade,</i>

326
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,474
<i>the number of hydrothermal vents</i>
<i>discovered has doubled.</i>

327
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,513
<i>Every one has its own unique</i>
<i>character and community.</i>

328
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,154
<i>But, perhaps, the most important</i>
<i>one of all is in the Atlantic.</i>

329
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,110
<i>It has been named "The Lost City".</i>

330
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,200
<i>Within its 60-metre towers,</i>

331
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,796
<i>something truly extraordinary</i>
<i>is taking place.</i>

332
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,319
<i>Under extremes</i>
<i>of pressure and temperature,</i>

333
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,438
<i>hydrocarbons,</i>

334
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,799
<i>the molecules that are the basic</i>
<i>component of all living things,</i>

335
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,712
<i>are being created spontaneously.</i>

336
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,197
<i>Indeed, many scientists now believe</i>

337
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,878
<i>that life on Earth</i>
<i>may have begun around a vent like this</i>

338
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,476
<i>four billion years ago.</i>

339
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,194
<i>We now know</i>
<i>that there are deep seas</i>

340
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,318
<i>on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.</i>

341
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,717
<i>If life can exist under</i>
<i>such extreme conditions down here,</i>

342
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,438
<i>then surely it could exist</i>
<i>somewhere out there.</i>

343
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,875
<i>The team spent more</i>
<i>than a thousand hours</i>

344
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,360
<i>filming in the deep ocean,</i>

345
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,399
<i>mostly from the research vessel Alucia,</i>

346
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,713
<i>and her twin submersibles,</i>
<i>Deep Rover and Nadir.</i>

347
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,152
<i>Their most ambitious mission</i>
<i>was to Antarctica,</i>

348
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,199
<i>hoping to film life</i>
<i>two-thirds of a mile down,</i>

349
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,397
<i>something never attempted before.</i>

350
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,194
We honestly do not know
what we're gonna find down there.

351
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,557
We're going to a place
that has never been explored.

352
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,354
There could be nothing,
there could be a carpet of life.

353
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,035
There could be
anything in between. Who knows?

354
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,720
<i>It's a huge technical challenge.</i>

355
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,039
<i>The water temperature here</i>

356
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,670
<i>can reach minus 1.8 degree centigrade.</i>

357
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,035
<i>No one knows for sure</i>

358
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,113
<i>how the subs will cope</i>
<i>with this extreme environment.</i>

359
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,870
Okay, all right,
I'm gonna soak it up. Uh...

360
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,599
Okay.

361
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,440
<i>Just half an hour</i>
<i>into the very first dive,</i>

362
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,354
<i>a puddle is forming</i>
<i>on the floor of the sub.</i>

363
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,677
<i>Orla confirms it's sea water.</i>

364
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,120
Yeah, roger, I'm just trying to
soak up this puddle of water

365
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,119
and then see if any more comes.

366
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,472
<i>They must find the leak</i>
<i>and repair it fast.</i>

367
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,917
Uh, are you gonna...yeah.

368
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,990
Yeah.

369
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,879
When you're 450 metres in a small bubble

370
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,155
and water's coming in...

371
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,120
That's a half an hour straight shot
back up to the surface.

372
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,954
You're kind of thinking about,
"Are we gonna fill up with water?

373
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,475
"And if we are, there's no way out."

374
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,720
Yeah.

375
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,679
<i>The sub pilots</i>
<i>are well drilled for emergencies.</i>

376
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,791
- Pass it over.
- Yeah.

377
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,399
<i>Ralph quickly</i>
<i>finds the flood and fixes it.</i>

378
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,996
He made it all seem
absolutely ordinary and normal.

379
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,151
And, "I've got this covered.
Don't you worry."

380
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,959
And within 20 minutes, he did.

381
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,876
<i>The waters of the Antarctic Sound</i>
<i>are potentially rich,</i>

382
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,440
<i>but also treacherous.</i>

383
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,353
<i>The Sound is ominously</i>
<i>known as "Iceberg Alley".</i>

384
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,400
We've got to find a place
where we can get

385
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,153
the submarines down and up safely

386
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,709
without any icebergs coming along
and bowling them over.

387
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,759
Uh, I've got a feeling it's going to
be a bit like a game of Space Invaders.

388
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,749
A metre cube of ice
weighs a tonne.

389
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,912
You start to, sort of, grinding that
around the sphere, it's...

390
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,515
It's delicate.
It's like a big Fabergé egg.

391
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,555
<i>One dive brings them</i>

392
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,633
<i>right up to the underside</i>
<i>face of an iceberg.</i>

393
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,678
There are icebergs up there
that are the size of a small car

394
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,355
and then there are icebergs
up there that are

395
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,671
the size of Hyde Park.

396
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,910
Enormous.

397
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,029
<i>Conditions here can change</i>
<i>in an instant.</i>

398
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,511
<i>The captain radios down to the subs.</i>

399
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,710
<i>Yeah, roger that.</i>

400
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,511
We've currently got
a couple of big icebergs

401
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,716
coming down the channel.

402
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,036
And it looks like
they're on a collision course.

403
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,718
<i>The impact of two icebergs</i>

404
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,952
<i>colliding overhead is clearly heard.</i>

405
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,600
That is ice.

406
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,477
<i>With icebergs colliding above,</i>

407
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,199
<i>and the weather turning fast,</i>

408
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,237
<i>the subs are quickly recalled.</i>

409
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,312
<i>Once again, their efforts are thwarted.</i>

410
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,677
<i>Finally, after two weeks,</i>

411
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,400
<i>conditions are just right.</i>

412
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,792
<i>Once again, the team</i>
<i>attempt their 1,000-metre dive</i>

413
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,473
<i>in Iceberg Alley.</i>

414
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,197
<i>An hour after leaving the surface,</i>

415
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,033
<i>they close in on their goal.</i>

416
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,229
Nine-nine-nine.

417
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,560
<i>Control, control.</i>

418
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,479
<i>This is Nadir. On bottom.</i>
<i>Depth one-zero-zero-zero metres.</i>

419
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,031
Roger. Depth 1,000 metres. Control out.

420
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,349
New record.

421
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,471
First manned sub-dive
to 1,000 metres in Antarctica.

422
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,713
<i>At the bottom of the ocean,</i>
<i>at the end of the world,</i>

423
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,872
<i>the amount of life</i>
<i>they find is astonishing.</i>

424
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,036
<i>But they're equally</i>
<i>astonished to find that</i>

425
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,396
<i>two-thirds of a mile from the surface,</i>

426
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,234
<i>icebergs are still a danger.</i>

427
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,838
<i>Rocks can drop from them as they melt.</i>

428
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,230
<i>And one lands right in front of the sub.</i>

429
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,114
I don't think
many people who are diving subs

430
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,830
ever consider big lumps of rock
landing on them.

431
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,754
Um, it's... It's not your normal risk.

432
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,749
If it had hit the sphere,

433
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,674
there's a good chance it would've
put a nice scratch down it.

434
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,231
If something of 10, 15, 20 tonne
had hit the sub,

435
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,039
it would completely destroy it.

436
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,918
<i>But over the following dives,</i>

437
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,799
<i>the team learns</i>
<i>it's these very drop stones</i>

438
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,918
<i>that enrich the Antarctic deep seabed</i>

439
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,197
<i>creating firm anchor points</i>

440
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,033
<i>for life to thrive.</i>

441
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,869
<i>Proof that the only way</i>
<i>to fully appreciate</i>

442
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,078
<i>the complexity and abundance</i>
<i>of life in the deep,</i>

443
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,550
<i>is to go there ourselves.</i>

444
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,436
<i>Next time, we travel</i>
<i>to bustling coral reefs.</i>

445
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,556
<i>Here, animals must go</i>
<i>to extraordinary lengths</i>

446
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,039
<i>to get ahead of the competition</i>
<i>in these crowded cities.</i>
