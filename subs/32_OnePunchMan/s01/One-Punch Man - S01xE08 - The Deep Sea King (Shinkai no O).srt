Who are you?

1175
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,731
What are you doing here?

1176
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:46,107
There were orders to evacuate.

1177
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,308
There were orders to evacuate.

1178
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,361
A hero?

1179
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,070
If you're after the Deep Sea King,
better forget it.

1180
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,403
If you're after the Deep Sea King,
better forget it.

1181
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:50,737
If you're after the Deep Sea King,

1182
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,071
If you're after the Deep Sea King,

1183
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,340
If you're after the Deep Sea King,
better forget it.

1184
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,448
Deep Sea King?

1185
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:53,865
You heroes could all jump him
at once and still lose.

1186
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:54,199
You heroes could all jump him
at once and still lose.

1187
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,532

1190
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,261
You heroes could all jump him

1191
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:57,619
You're fine at playing make-believe,

1192
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:57,953
You're fine at playing make-believe,

1193
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:58,286
You're fine at playing make-believe,

1194
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,513
You're fine at playing make-believe,

1195
00:17:59,537 --> 00:17:59,871
but against true power
you don't stand a chance.

1196
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:00,205
But against true power
you don't stand a chance.

1197
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,432
But against true power
you don't stand a chance.

1198
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:01,790
You can't protect a thing.

1199
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,123
You can't protect a thing.

1200
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,416
You can't protect a thing.

1201
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,504
Who was that pervert?

1202
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:07,837
Who was that pervert?

1203
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,005
Who was that pervert?

1204
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,799
The Seafolk?!

1205
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:12,842
I sense numerous
life signals nearby.

1206
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:13,176
I sense numerous
life signals nearby.

1207
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,617
I sense numerous
life signals nearby.

1208
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,471
With so many...

1209
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,807
The evacuation shelter!

1210
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,102
Daddy, are the scary monsters
still outside?

1211
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:22,435
Daddy, are the scary monsters

1217
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:25,498
Daddy, are the scary monsters

1218
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:25,855
Don't worry. As long as
we're in this shelter, we're safe.

1219
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:26,189
Don't worry. As long as

Don't worry. As long as
we're in this shelter, we're safe.

1228
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:30,151
Besides... if it comes down to it,

1229
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,379
Besides... if it comes down to it,

1230
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:31,736
I'm sure all of us together
can beat a monster or two.

1231
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,070
I'm sure all of us together
