836
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:34,916
Can I ask...

837
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:36,250
where your boss is?

838
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,460
Where your boss is?

839
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,966
This looks bad.

840
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:50,848
Is that confirmed?

841
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,100
Is that confirmed?

842
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:52,517

Have everyone take cover.

868
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,697
Have everyone take cover.

869
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,156
You'll be taking fire soon!

870
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:07,490
You'll be taking fire soon!

871
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,616

There we go.

874
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:28,970

I'll bust 'em wide open!

897
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,032
I'll bust 'em wide open!

898
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,659
Is it time?

899
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,076
Ship, bombardment, coming...

900
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:52,410

Ship, bombardment, coming...

903
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:56,998
There they are.

904
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,040
There they are.

905
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,459
All right...

906
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,542
Click!

907
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,049
It's over.

908
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:07,508
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

909
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:07,842
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

910
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,176
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

911
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:08,509
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

912
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,870
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

913
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:21,814
Huh... What happened?

914
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,148
Huh... What happened?

915
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:22,482

916
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:22,815
Huh... What happened?

917
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,858
Huh... What happened?

918
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,193
What on earth?

919
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,570
They stopped.

920
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,197
All of you would
be dead without me.

921
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:29,530
All of you would

926
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,241
Can't you even finish
one small fry?

927
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:32,575
Can't you even finish
one small fry?

928
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:32,909
Can't you even finish

929
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,310
Can't you even finish

930
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:34,785
Maybe try starting over
from Class C.

931
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,119
Maybe try starting over

934
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,227
Maybe try starting over
from Class C.

935
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,879
You can have...

936
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,631
your shells back.

937
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,182

939
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,901
I wanna go home.

940
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,365
I didn't expect you to be here.

941
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:12,698

Thank you, Mumen Rider.

948
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:17,620
Which areas are likely
to have survivors?

949
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,954
Which areas are likely

954
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:20,873
There must be more out there.

00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,207
There must be more out there.

956
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,416
There must be more out there.

957
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:22,833
But you...

958
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,085
But you...

974
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,304
Mind if we borrow this?

975
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:35,638
Mind if we borrow this?

976
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,973

Found it...

980
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,585
Found it...

981
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,668
Smush.

982
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:09,046
One left!

983
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,131
One left!

984
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,888
Silverfang!

985
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:19,181
A... direct hit.

A... direct hit.

987
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:19,849
A... direct hit.

988
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,142
A... direct hit.

989
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,274
Weak, weak!

990
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,483
Weak, weak!

991
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,067
You are all so very weak.

992
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,401
You are all so very weak.

993
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:30,735
You are all so very weak.

994
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,068
You are all so very weak.

995
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,153
You are all so very weak.

996
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:32,612
Dead after a single hit!

997
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:33,946
Dead after a single hit!

998
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,197
A change of tactics
was all I needed.

999
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:35,531
A change of tactics
was all I needed.

1000
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:35,865

A change of tactics
was all I needed.

1002
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,634
A change of tactics
was all I needed.

1003
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:37,992
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

1004
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:38,326
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

1005
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:38,659
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

1006
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:38,993
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

1007
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:39,327
If I forget defense and

1008
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:39,660
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

1009
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,096
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

1010
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,454
this will all be over quickly.

1011
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:41,787
This will all be over quickly.

1012
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,122
This will all be over quickly.

1013
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:43,664
And you're next!

1014
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,915
And you're next!

1015
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:47,835
I will spring past that sword and
squeeze your skull 'til it pops.

1016
