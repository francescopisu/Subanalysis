It is the mail.

539
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:41,451
The post office cannot come here,

557
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:54,547
The public sends these to the heroes,

The fact of the matter is

737
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:52,665
that bald guy pretty much took
care of it all by himself.

738
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:52,999

743
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:55,960
So all the other heroes
died for nothing.

744
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,294

756
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:01,966
In the end, the other "heroes"
