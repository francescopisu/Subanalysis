00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:29,257
Sorry!

1014
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:29,925
That wasn't on purpose.

1015
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,258
That wasn't on purpose.

1016
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:30,592
That wasn't on purpose.

1017
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,676
That wasn't on purpose.

1018
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,093
I meant to stop
before hitting you,

1019
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,279
I meant to stop

Speed-d-Sound Sonic?

1081
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,312
Who is that?

1082
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:24,771
And who would possess such
a redundant name?

1083
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,105

1088
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,483
Dunno.

1089
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,650
He suddenly appeared,

1090
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,026
declared we were rivals,
and took off.

1091
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:30,360

00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:34,990
Well, you're hardly different.

1100
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,191
Well, you're hardly different.

1101
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:36,825
Actually, why are you here again?

1107
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,704
Master, I must become stronger-

1108
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,037
Master, I must become stronger-

1109
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,371
