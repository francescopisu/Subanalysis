I'm not sure,

339
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,012

But...

423
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:58,900
But...

424
00:05:59,234 --> 00:05:59,568
First, from the first to the eighth floor,
we'll activate all our traps.

439
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,492
I'm fully aware of what will happen to me

440
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:07,826

Should we fail.

447
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,292
I didn't think we'd be running

453
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,170
How else are we gonna get there?

454
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,088
I was sure you could fly or something.

473
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:30,348
Actually, I hardly ever arrive on time.

474
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:30,682

We're here.

480
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:37,772
This is the place Gorilla told us of.

481
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,106
This is the place Gorilla told us of.

482
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,587
This is the place Gorilla told us of.

483
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,818
So this is...

484
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,236
the "House of Evolution".

485
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:44,529
One, two, three, four, five, six...
Looks like it's about eight stories high-
