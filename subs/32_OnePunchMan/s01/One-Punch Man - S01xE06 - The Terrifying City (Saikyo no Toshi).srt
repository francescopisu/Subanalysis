Want me to go?

573
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,588
Tornado?

574
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:08,799
Where'd you come from?

575
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:09,258
Why? Aren't I allowed in here?

Not at all.

592
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:24,815
The Association decided that

Yes, exactly right.

604
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,492
You'd better tell me if you find
anything that looks like it can fight.

605
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:35,826
You'd better tell me if you find

612
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:42,583
It'd be so much faster
if I just went myself.

613
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:42,916
It'd be so much faster

1200
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:06,920
Now that I think about it,

00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:21,601
Another hero?

1224
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:21,935
Another hero?

1225
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:22,978
Another hero?

1226
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,063
Or a regular guy?

1227
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:26,147
I thought all the humans
cleared out.

1228
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:26,481

If all those monsters
were really around,

1234
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,461
If all those monsters

1235
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:30,819
there's no way he could live here...

1236
