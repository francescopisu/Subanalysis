1172
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,209
Hey! Why was this building spared?

1173
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:41,543
Hey! Why was this building spared?

1174
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:41,877

Hey! Why was this building spared?

1178
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:44,421
We assigned Metal Knight
to construct this building.

1179
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:44,754

1184
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,424
That's why it's stronger
than the average shelter.

1185
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:47,757
That's why it's stronger
than the average shelter.

1190
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:50,719
So that's why there're no windows.

1191
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,052
So that's why there're no windows.

1192
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,413
So that's why there're no windows.

1193
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:53,221
We should go outside and see.
To be sure it's the prophecy.

1194
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:53,555
We should go outside and see.

1204
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,268
Master! Will you-

1205
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:58,602

Master...

1208
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,068
That's big! Are they aliens?

1209
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:07,402
That's big! Are they aliens?

1210
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:07,736
That's big! Are they aliens?

1211
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,069
That's big! Are they aliens?

1212
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,279
That's big! Are they aliens?

1213
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,041
So that's what blew
the city to pieces.

1214
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:21,374
So that's what blew
the city to pieces.

1217
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,549
Go back to...

1218
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,259
VOW planet!

1219
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:37,599
A militant creature.

1220
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:37,933
A militant creature.

1221
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:38,266
A militant creature.

1222
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,309
A militant creature.

1223
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:39,768
Also cautious.

1224
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,061
Also cautious.

1225
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:41,603
Hurry. Let us hurry and kill.

1226

1229
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,814
That is good.

1230
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,273
<i>Can it be killed?</i>

1231
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:45,607

1233
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:53,114
<i>Each of its strikes is lethal!</i>

1234
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:53,448

<i>I can't beat this thing...</i>

1238
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:57,452
Such a weak species.

1239
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:57,786
Such a weak species.

1240
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:58,119

Such a weak species.

1243
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,121
Easily killed.

1244
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,331
Easily killed.

1245
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,666
That is good.

1246
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,125
<i>It's splitting?</i>

1247
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:04,584
<i>Damn, not now...</i>

1248
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:04,918

Very well.

1260
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,258
I will go kill those that ran.
