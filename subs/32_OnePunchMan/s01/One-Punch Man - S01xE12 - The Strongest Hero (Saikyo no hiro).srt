00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:53,722
Do not tell me you have come
to recover the spaceship.

Do not tell me you have come

871
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,617
Do not tell me you have come
to recover the spaceship.

872
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:56,975
Are you here.

873
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:58,226
Are you here

874
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:58,852
so you can create more powerful weapons
with the alien technology?

875
00:16:58,852 --> 00:16:59,185
So you can create more powerful weapons
with the alien technology?

876
00:16:59,185 --> 00:16:59,519

879
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,689
Precisely.

880
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:03,732
Powerful weapons
are a necessity...

881
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,065
Powerful weapons

for the sake of peace.

886
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:07,944
For the sake of peace.

887
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:10,572
Even with powerful weapons,

888
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:10,906
Even with powerful weapons,

889
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:11,239
Even with powerful weapons,

890
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,324
Even with powerful weapons,

891
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:12,741
in the hands of heroes like this,
they'd be wasted.

00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,414
Hey!

903
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:20,248
I found some alien survivors!

904
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:20,582
I found some alien survivors!

905
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,917
I found some alien survivors!

906
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,004
I thought Lord Boros never lost.

907

910
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,274
I thought Lord Boros never lost.

911
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:28,632
Are we going to be killed?

912
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:28,965
Are we going to be killed?

913
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,091
Are we going to be killed?

914
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:30,550
Maybe we can talk
our way out of this.

915
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:30,884
Maybe we can talk

916

918
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:32,969
Aggh, I'm so hungry!

919
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:33,303
Aggh, I'm so hungry!

Amai Mask! What the-?

931
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:50,111
Amai Mask! What the-?

932
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:51,112
They did not deserve to live.
They were evil.

933
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:51,446

939
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,532
I swiftly implemented justice,
that's all.

940
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:54,866
