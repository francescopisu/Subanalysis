00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:25,222
I promised Doctor Kuseno that one day
I would terminate the evil cyborg.

664
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:25,555

672
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:29,851
I see-

673
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:30,268
It's been four years since that day.

674
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:30,602
It's been four years since that day.

675
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,043
It's been four years since that day.

676
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:32,479
I'm now 19 and I've been wandering
from town to town eliminating evil.

677
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:32,813
I'm now 19 and I've been wandering

688
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:37,526
The number of monsters and criminal
organizations I have destroyed.

689
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:37,859
The number of monsters and criminal
organizations I have destroyed.

690
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,212
The number of monsters and criminal
organizations I have destroyed

691
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,445
are too many to count.

692
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:40,988
But I have been unable to find any clues
about the insane cyborg.

693
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:41,321
But I have been unable to find any clues

699
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,342
But I have been unable to find any clues
about the insane cyborg

700
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:44,700
and have become increasingly
frustrated and restless.

701
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,033
And have become increasingly
frustrated and restless.

702
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:45,367
And have become increasingly

703
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,719
And have become increasingly
frustrated and restless.

704
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,077
I find myself chasing a virtual image
of that cyborg

705
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:47,411

706

708
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,263
I find myself chasing a virtual image
of that cyborg

709
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:49,621
whenever I square off
against my enemies.

710
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:49,955
Whenever I square off
against my enemies.

711
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:51,057
Whenever I square off
against my enemies.

712
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:51,415
Then last week, when that
mosquito monster appeared,

713
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:51,748
Then last week, when that
mosquito monster appeared,

714
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,082

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,185
Then last week, when that
mosquito monster appeared,

718
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:54,543
I let my concentration slip.

719
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:54,876
I let my concentration slip.

720
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,044
I let my concentration slip.

721
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:56,503
I was convinced I could not lose to
anything but the rampaging cyborg,

722
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:56,837
I was convinced I could not lose to
anything but the rampaging cyborg,

723
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,170

726
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:58,171
I was convinced I could not lose to
anything but the rampaging cyborg,

727
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,524
I was convinced I could not lose to
anything but the rampaging cyborg,

728
00:13:59,548 --> 00:13:59,881
so I neglected to even analyze the data
on my opponent and rushed to confront her.

729
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,215
So I neglected to even analyze the data
on my opponent and rushed to confront her.

730
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:00,549
So I neglected to even analyze the data

So I neglected to even analyze the data
on my opponent and rushed to confront her.

736
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,594
The result, as you know,

737
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,053
was that an opponent
with immense strength bested me.

738
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:05,387
Was that an opponent
with immense strength bested me.

739
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:05,721

Was that an opponent

742
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:07,597
If you, Master Saitama,
had not been in the area,

743
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:07,931
If you, Master Saitama,
had not been in the area,

744
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,265
If you, Master Saitama,
had not been in the area,

745
00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,534
If you, Master Saitama,
had not been in the area,

746
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:09,891
I would have undoubtedly
been destroyed.

747
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:10,225
I would have undoubtedly
been destroyed.

748
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,369
I would have undoubtedly
been destroyed.

749
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:11,727
Master, you saved my life.

750
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,060

754
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:14,229
My life that was once saved
by Doctor Kuseno.

755
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:14,563
My life that was once saved
by Doctor Kuseno.

756
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:14,896
My life that was once saved
by Doctor Kuseno.

757
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,082
My life that was once saved
by Doctor Kuseno

758
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:16,440

762
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:18,900
I feel the weight of that responsibility.

763
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,234
I feel the weight of that responsibility.

764
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:19,568
I feel the weight of that responsibility.

765
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:20,878
I feel the weight of that responsibility.

766
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,236
I must not die before
destroying that cyborg.

767
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:21,570
I must not die before
destroying that cyborg.

768

I must not die before
destroying that cyborg.

775
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,073
And to do that, I must continue
fighting evil as a righteous cyborg.

776
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:25,407
And to do that, I must continue
fighting evil as a righteous cyborg.

777

783
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:28,785

784
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,119
Until he appears before me one day.

785
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,263
Until he appears before me one day.

786
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:30,620
I need to get stronger.

787
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:31,747
I need to get stronger.

788
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:32,205

I knew I had to study under you
as your disciple.

794
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,042
I knew I had to study under you

It's for my hometown,

816
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:48,555

Doctor Kuseno is-

824
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:53,977
Enough, you idiot!
