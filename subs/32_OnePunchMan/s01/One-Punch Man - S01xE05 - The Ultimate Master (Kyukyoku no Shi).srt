00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:21,845
Hey, is there a point in you
taking fitness tests?

175
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:22,179
Hey, is there a point in you
taking fitness tests?

176
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:22,512
Hey, is there a point in you
taking fitness tests?

177
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,990
Hey, is there a point in you
taking fitness tests?

178
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:24,765
Huh?

179
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:25,182
I mean, can't you just give them
the data on your specs?

180
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:25,515
I mean, can't you just give them
the data on your specs?

181
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:25,849
I mean, can't you just give them

189
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:30,228
Well, whatever. So how was it?

190
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:30,562
Well, whatever. So how was it?

191
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:30,896

Well, whatever. So how was it?

194
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,273
Both the written and fitness tests
were far too simple.

195
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:33,607
Both the written and fitness tests
were far too simple.

196
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:33,940

202
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,295
Both the written and fitness tests
were far too simple.

203
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:37,652
Right? Is that really all there is
to becoming a hero?

204
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:37,986
Right? Is that really all there is
to becoming a hero?

205
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:38,320
Right? Is that really all there is

212
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,324
We should get our results soon.

213
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:42,657
We should get our results soon.

214
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,898
We should get our results soon.

215
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:44,576
7O points is a passing grade.

216
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:44,910
7O points is a passing grade.

217
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,244
7O points is a passing grade.

218
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:46,953
The written test was so easy
anyone could get full points on it.

219
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,287
The written test was so easy
anyone could get full points on it.

220
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:47,621
The written test was so easy

223
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:48,622
The written test was so easy

224
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:48,955

00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,058
The written test was so easy
anyone could get full points on it.

228
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,416
That just leaves the fitness test,

229
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:51,750
That just leaves the fitness test,

230
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,111
That just leaves the fitness test,

231
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:53,668
which for us should not have
posed any problems.

232
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,002
Which for us should not have
posed any problems.

233
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,563
Which for us should not have
posed any problems.

234
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:55,921
"One Hour Later."

235
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,254
"One Hour Later."

236
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:56,588
"One Hour Later."

237
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:56,922
"One Hour Later."

238
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,006
"One Hour Later."

239
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,175
I got 100 points.

240
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,509
Seriously?

241
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,552
Yes.

242
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:04,763
It says I'm certified as
a class S hero.

243
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,096

247
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:06,431
It says I'm certified as

248
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,765
It says I'm certified as
a class S hero.

249
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,034
It says I'm certified as

250
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:08,391
Class S? What's that?

251
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:08,725
Class S? What's that?

252
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,059
Class S? What's that?

253
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,101
Class S? What's that?

254
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:10,894
I am sure these rankings
mean little.

255
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,228
I am sure these rankings
mean little.

256
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:11,561
I am sure these rankings

260
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,398
How did you do, Master?

261
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,733
Huh?

262
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>Oh! The letter says I'm also...</i>

263
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,319

Class S.

267
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:22,781
I am not surprised.

268
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:23,949
I am not surprised.

269
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,325
On top of that, the font size
is bigger than mine.

270
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:25,659

I expected nothing less, Master.

277
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:31,873
By the way, what did they
ask you at the interview?

278
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,207
By the way, what did they
ask you at the interview?

279

282
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,710
Interview?

283
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,877
Yes.

284
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,213
Just one final question, Genos.

285
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:38,547
Just one final question, Genos.

286
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:38,880

311
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,061
Just when we identified

324
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:00,569
And with overwhelmingly
intense firepower.

325
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:00,902
And with overwhelmingly

329
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:05,907
Are you responsible for this?

330
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,241
Are you responsible for this?

331
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:06,575

I am.

337
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,746
Why?

338
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,085
"Certified S Class."

339
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:17,419

343
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,423
I see...

344
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,008
I suppose it must be that

00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:11,359
So he wasn't here to fight?
Then What gives?

1151
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,878
So he wasn't here to fight?
Then What gives?

1152
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,070
In short...

1153
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,572
He came to welcome me.

Shake mine too!

1173
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,301

1183
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:41,972
If you think about it, though,
isn't that like fraud money?

1184
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,306
If you think about it, though,

00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:44,767
"Welcome Gift."

1190
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,901
"Welcome Gift"
I mean, you're a cyborg, right?

1191
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:48,396
Never mind. In any case, now we're
even with a win and a loss apiece.

1192

That is my philosophy.

1229
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:10,918
It's especially true
if you're a class S hero.

1230
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,252
It's especially true
if you're a class S hero.

1231

It's especially true
if you're a class S hero.

1232
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,797

1252
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,854
If you came to fight, get on with it.

1261
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:36,610
Being hot-blooded is fine,

1270
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,742
you'll get burnt.

1271

Uh...

1302
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:35,789
So when you said,
"I'll be back..."

1303
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,150
So when you said,
"I'll be back..."
