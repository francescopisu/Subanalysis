5
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,851
Um, why "Irregular"?

6
00:01:13,853 --> 00:01:18,021
Well, they put a ladies' sock
in with the gents'.

7
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:20,724
Which one's which?

8
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:23,927
- It's unclear.
- Ah.

9
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:26,363
Eh, I'll roll the dice.

10
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:28,866
Uh, how much?

11
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:30,934
You tell me.

12
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,569
Say again?

13
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:35,739
The sign says "Best Offer."
What are you offering?

14
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:38,375
Well, I mean, uh...

15
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:40,377
Eh, what's fair?

16
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,312
Well, that's not for me to say.

17
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,749
It's three pairs of socks,
half of them ladies'.

18
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:48,719
Probably not a million dollars.

19
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,721
Uh...

20
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:52,389
Right.

21
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:57,060
Well, I don't want
to take advantage.

22
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,562
2 bucks.

23
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:06,804
Or if that's, uh...

24
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:08,172
3 bucks?

25
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,511
5.

26
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:19,516
Tell you what, you give me $55,
I'll give you the socks...

27
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:23,554
and throw in this 12-Gauge.

28
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:37,000
Thought you were getting socks.

29
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:39,503
In the bag.

30
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,271
What the heck are you
gonna do with that?

31
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:43,507
It's for protection.

32
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:45,809
Just be careful you don't
blow your own face off.

33
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,477
Not loaded, is it?

34
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,646
Well, if anyone could shoot
theirselves in the face

35
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:52,883
with an unloaded firearm,
it's you.

36
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:16,840
<i>Lester!</i>

37
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:18,141
Yeah!

38
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:20,310
I...

39
00:03:23,048 --> 00:03:24,982
Ahh...

40
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,598
Yeah?

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,101
My wife... she's in the basement, dead.

42
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:47,671
And, uh, I'm freaking out here.
I don't know what to do.

43
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:49,907
Lester, have
you been a bad boy?

44
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:54,444
Ah! Jeez. Yeah.

45
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,947
Can you come over?

46
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,451
What did you do?

47
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:04,187
You killed her.

48
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,811
<i>Evening, Lester.</i>

49
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:29,913
<i>What... what do you want?</i>

50
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,516
<i>Well, I suppose
first, I'd like to come in.</i>

51
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:34,551
<i>Is Pearl home?</i>

52
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:38,655
<i>Ah, no, no,
she's at my brother's.</i>

53
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,491
<i>Lester, listen
to me very carefully.</i>

54
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,493
<i>I need you to get down</i>
<i>on the ground.</i>

55
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:45,128
<i>Okay, now, wait...
wait just a second.</i>

56
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,997
<i>Lester, on the ground.</i>

57
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,239
<i>This is not what it looks like.</i>

58
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,739
Look, I'm sorry...

59
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:04,408
about...

60
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,245
<i>electrocuting you.</i>
<i>I was just...</i>

61
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:11,381
<i>This is obviously...</i>

62
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,150
a misunderstanding.

63
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:15,585
'Cause like... like I said,

64
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:19,456
I'm just an insurance salesman.

65
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:23,660
<i>Now, that is not...</i>
<i>I got noth...</i>

66
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:26,863
The stuff that you're mixed up in...
Not... not that you're...

67
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:29,733
I'm just say... Well...

68
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:32,536
So you... you see?

69
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:43,947
- You said "Him."
- What?

70
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,919
On the ice... you said "Him."
You said it was him.

71
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:52,255
Not you.

72
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:54,291
Him.

73
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,093
Mm, yeah.

74
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,130
Well... well, I'm... I'm just
guessing here,

75
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:03,733
but, uh, well, that Hess
was not head-stabbed by a girl.

76
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:04,734
No, no.

77
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,403
No, no.

78
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:09,606
No, you said it
like you had a face in mind.

79
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:11,074
Uh-uh.

80
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:16,413
No, wait.

81
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:24,621
Uh...

82
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:26,089
Stay with me.
Lester.

83
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:27,724
- Oh, God, please. Please.
- Stay with me.

84
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,227
- I need a name.
- Uh... huh.

85
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,396
I need a name.

86
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:35,432
- Again.
- No, wait! Please!

87
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:37,801
<i>Wait.</i>

88
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,336
God.

89
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,338
- Lester.
- No!

90
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,974
Malvo! Malvo.

91
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:45,642
Malvo?

92
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:46,910
Is that a first name?

93
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:49,346
Gaahh...

94
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,115
- Lester.
- Hmm?

95
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:55,252
Eventually you just swallow your
tongue and you die like a fish.

96
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:57,554
Lorne, I think.

97
00:07:57,556 --> 00:08:00,123
It's Lorne, like the fella
from<i> Bonanza.</i>

98
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,860
Lorne Malvo?

99
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,497
Where is he?

100
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:08,598
I'm gonna throw up.

101
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,433
No. No, you're not.

102
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:12,469
If you puke in here,
I'll kill you.

103
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,672
- I mean, I'll actually kill you, okay?
- Okay.

104
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:17,007
- Lester.
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,775
I need a location.

106
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:20,544
Okay...

107
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:23,780
He took...
he took my car.

108
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:27,317
They called me, told me
it was impounded in Duluth.

109
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,152
So he's probably...

110
00:08:29,154 --> 00:08:31,054
I got a picture...
There's a picture of him.

111
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,789
Picture of him up here.

112
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,357
Law enforcement, he had it.
It's from the...

113
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:37,060
what do you call it? An APB. So...

114
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,432
What?

115
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:46,069
Lorne Malvo?

116
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,304
- Yeah?
- Mm.

117
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,573
- He killed him.
- He killed Hess.

118
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,141
I-I mean...

119
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:55,011
<i>Okay.</i>

120
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,581
You two are free to go.
Bail's been paid.

121
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,051
Oh, God.

122
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:02,786
What if we wanna stay?

123
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:04,854
<i>Pardon?</i>

124
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,357
I don't know, I mean,
what if we like it here?

125
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,660
Yeah.
That's a good one. On your feet.

126
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:12,696
You have any doubt
we can find you?

127
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:14,798
No.

128
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,536
Hey, buddy, you might
wanna have a doctor

129
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:20,770
look at that hand, though.

130
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,505
Looks like it smarts.

131
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:40,490
<i>Are some of the
largest snakes found in the world.</i>

132
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,891
<i>Any members
of that python family</i>

133
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,460
<i>are ambush predators.</i>

134
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:45,996
<i>They remain motionless</i>
<i>before they strike.</i>

135
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:48,265
<i>It's not common
for them to attack humans</i>

136
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:50,500
<i>unless, of course,</i>
<i>they're starving.</i>

137
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:53,270
<i>Now, advancements
in the technological arena</i>

138
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:56,306
<i>allow us to examine their</i>
<i>existence in the Everglades.</i>

139
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:57,974
<i>Oh, look ahead, there, there...</i>

140
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,710
No way around it.

141
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:08,318
- I said, "More sand."
- Back then?

142
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,886
Yeah. Wild goose chase.

143
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:13,156
Salt's okay.
Hang on. Frank calling.

144
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:15,959
Well, Chief, there've been some interesting
developments while you were...

145
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,062
Chief, Frank on the line.
New storm data.

146
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:21,064
Yeah, Frank, what you got then?

147
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,833
This case is, uh, really...
it's heating up.

148
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,835
That much, huh? Jeez.

149
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,605
Saying 2 feet new accumulation.

150
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,474
So, uh, we got the phone dump
back from Lester's

151
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:32,776
from the night of the murders.

152
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:33,777
Okay, thanks much.

153
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,612
You too.

154
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,248
Call Hoenecker with State, see
if we can get some more plows,

155
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,916
and, uh, make sure
they're plowing

156
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,751
the Chief's drive
every few hours.

157
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:44,421
Can't have Ida going into labor
under a snowbound scenario.

158
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:45,588
Okay. Yah.

159
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,290
Now, what's all this?

160
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,426
I was saying we got
the phone dump back.

161
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,927
And right around
the time Pearl died,

162
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,762
an outgoing call
was placed from Lester's

163
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,798
<i>to Leroy's Motor Inn,</i>
<i>so I made a call.</i>

164
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,266
No one asked you to...

165
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,201
I know, but you were in Duluth,
so I figured...

166
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,337
- Left Knutson in charge.
<i>- Right.</i>

167
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,173
So I made a call, and get this.

168
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:04,641
Lorraine, the manager...

169
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,476
- Lorraine Abbey.
- Yeah. Yah.

170
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:08,662
Uh, no, sir, Lorraine Babbit.

171
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,043
Curly hair, looks like she dries
her eyebrows on with a sharpie.

172
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,445
No, sir, this is a severe woman
with hard hair.

173
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,281
Anyway, she IDs a photo
of the suspect

174
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,283
from the naked fella
kidnapping.

175
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:21,551
Says he stayed one night,

176
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,687
that being the night
Hess was killed.

177
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:26,623
She got a name for him too.
Lorne Malvo.

178
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,492
And you found this how?

179
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,793
<i>Like I said,</i>

180
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,328
call was placed
from Lester's house

181
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,163
to the motel where
the suspect was staying.

182
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:36,633
So I talk to housekeeping,
and they say this Malvo fella

183
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:38,301
left behind some tokens
from The Lucky Penny.

184
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:41,471
<i>They wanna know how many plows.</i>

185
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:43,373
At least three, don't ya think?

186
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,842
At least three.

187
00:11:45,844 --> 00:11:47,511
Yeah, he says he can
give you two good ones

188
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,912
and a pickup with baby plow.

189
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:50,046
Sir.

190
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:51,214
Yeah, I'm listening.

191
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:52,215
Okay, good.

192
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:53,583
So I go and talk to the lady

193
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,385
that Hess was with,
the dancer, right?

194
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,687
- And she says that before
he was stabbed... - Hold on.

195
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,890
Hess was laughing about
this fella that he bullied.

196
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:01,425
Broke the poor guy's nose,
she said.

197
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:03,059
The same day.

198
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,594
Chief, is that a yes
on the baby plow?

199
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:06,363
So right away I'm thinking,

200
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:08,098
who do we know
who got his nose broke

201
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,167
- the day Hess died?
- No.

202
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,768
- Lester.
- Wait.

203
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,403
- Chief.
- So you see,

204
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:18,408
Hess breaks Lester's nose.
Lester goes to the Emergency Room,

205
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,976
<i>where he meets our suspect.</i>

206
00:12:19,978 --> 00:12:22,145
<i>That night, Hess gets killed.</i>

207
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:24,748
<i>The next day, Lester</i>
<i>places a call to the motel</i>

208
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,449
<i>where our suspect is staying,</i>

209
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:28,084
<i>and shortly thereafter</i>
<i>or abouts,</i>

210
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,719
<i>Mrs. Nygaard</i>
<i>and the Chief are murdered.</i>

211
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:31,254
Chief.

212
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:34,157
Yeah. Tell him
I'll call him back.

213
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,692
<i>He's gotta call ya back.</i>

214
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:37,527
Son of a bitch.

215
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:38,862
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,363
So I'm thinking maybe this is

217
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,965
a murder-for-hire
type deal, right?

218
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:45,368
Where Lester hires this Malvo
fella to kill Hess,

219
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,537
only maybe Lester don't got
the money to pay,

220
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,906
so things get sour.

221
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:52,576
Listen,
I know it's not my case,

222
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:55,378
but I'd like your permission
to go back to Lester's house

223
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,148
and see what he has to say.

224
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,016
Not at his house.

225
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:01,818
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>His work then.</i>

226
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,287
No, I'm saying
he's not at his house.

227
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,855
He's in a holding cell.

228
00:13:05,857 --> 00:13:08,158
<i>Knutson says Lester</i>
<i>took a swing at him.</i>

229
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,492
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>if he was drunk or what.</i>

230
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:10,827
He's in custody?

231
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,896
I told Dougie
to keep him overnight.

232
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,331
You know, let him sleep it off.

233
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,899
Well...

234
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:19,169
I mean, we gotta talk to him,
don't ya think?

235
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,037
I guess we'd better.

236
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,662
I need to use your computer.

237
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,831
Yeah.

238
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,940
It's on the front.

239
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:51,644
Uh, computers at the precinct
have it on the back.

240
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,983
Here, let me.

241
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,959
What do ya need?

242
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:10,530
There's a pastor up in Baudette,
name of Frank Peterson.

243
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,137
A few hits.

244
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,708
A church website, um,
some stuff from the local paper.

245
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,476
There anything with a picture?

246
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,015
<i>Uffda.</i>

247
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:31,551
<i>What's this for?</i>

248
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:32,785
A case.

249
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:35,455
You said there were
other news stories.

250
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,257
<i>Nothing with a picture.</i>

251
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,791
<i>Church fundraiser.</i>

252
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:42,362
Um, new roof.
That kind of thing.

253
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:46,633
Check for, uh, uh, Lorne Malvo.

254
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,168
C-could you check, uh...

255
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:53,573
Nothing.

256
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,442
Okay.

257
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:59,145
He steals a car,
I pull him over,

258
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,615
he drives away,
car's impounded,

259
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:06,185
and he stays in Duluth.

260
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:10,156
He stays in Duluth.
I stop him on the street.

261
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,793
On that street.

262
00:15:13,795 --> 00:15:16,195
On foot.

263
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:18,531
He was on that street on foot.

264
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,700
<i>Come in, Greta. Over.</i>

265
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,936
<i>Why was he on
that street on foot?</i>

266
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,737
Dad?

267
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:25,972
- Do you wanna...
<i>- Greta. Come in, Greta.</i>

268
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,874
Oh, yeah, right.

269
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,343
Okay. It's almost bedtime.

270
00:15:30,345 --> 00:15:33,079
And, hey, I may go out
for a bit.

271
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,914
<i>Okay. Come in. Over.</i>

272
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,519
Back for more, huh?

273
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,954
I need a police scanner.

274
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:44,557
Got a special on
remote control helicopters.

275
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,793
Can you monitor
police activity on it?

276
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,795
Doubt it.

277
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:50,396
I'll just stick
with the scanner.

278
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,664
Okay.

279
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,233
I got handheld
or dashboard mountable.

280
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,869
Oh, also...

281
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,172
got this one in pink.

282
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,475
Do I look like I want
a pink police scanner?

283
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:04,644
I don't know.

284
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:06,713
Could be a gift for a lady.

285
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,481
And in your experience,

286
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,350
uh, police scanners?

287
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:12,385
Is that a gift
ladies get wet for?

288
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,921
Had an aunt once,
owned a riot shield.

289
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,255
Made her own jerky.

290
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:17,824
I'll just stick with the black.

291
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,826
'Kay.

292
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,327
Anything else?

293
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:23,062
Yeah, I need
a walkie-talkie.

294
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,398
Yeah...

295
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,067
'fraid I can't just
sell you one, stretch.

296
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,936
See, they come in pairs.

297
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:33,106
You know, so you can
chat with a friend.

298
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,941
I don't have any friends.

299
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,443
That's a sad story.

300
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,345
I still gotta sell ya two.

301
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:43,850
Hey, maybe you could make
a friend and give it to him.

302
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,185
<i>Maybe I could give it to you.</i>

303
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,054
Call ya up late at night.

304
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:50,523
And you could listen to me
shit on people.

305
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,868
- Oh.
- Where's your phone?

306
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,537
What are you...
Are you supposed to be here?

307
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,706
- The phone.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,875
In the...
in the kitchen.

309
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,882
Uh...

310
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:18,985
What's going on?

311
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,086
What's that?

312
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,488
Don't talk.

313
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,261
<i>Are you calling him?</i>

314
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:30,530
I said don't talk.

315
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,537
This is exciting.

316
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:45,078
<i>Yeah?</i>

317
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,312
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

318
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:52,552
Where were you?

319
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,253
<i>I was hunting.</i>

320
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,255
<i>I heard about the bugs.</i>
<i>You need me to swing by?</i>

321
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:57,590
It's too late now.

322
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:00,026
I'm... I'm gonna pay.

323
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,627
The blackmail.
I'm gonna pay it.

324
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:03,362
<i>Tell me what you said.</i>

325
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:05,364
It doesn't matter now.

326
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:09,769
I broke a promise.
Me. So I gotta pay.

327
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:12,772
Look, I can find the guy,
I just need a few more days.

328
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,140
I couldn't sleep last night.

329
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:17,643
I kept going over
and over it in my head.

330
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:22,115
And God brought ten plagues
upon the house of Pharaoh.

331
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:26,452
<i>Blood and locust,</i>
<i>flies and boils.</i>

332
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:29,655
And the last is the death
of the Firstborn Son.

333
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,492
What exactly do you
think is happening?

334
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,627
The Firstborn Son.

335
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:37,663
<i>It's book of Exodus.</i>
<i>God is watching and He knows.</i>

336
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,132
Knows what?

337
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,334
I told Semenchko
to take Dmitri someplace safe

338
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:42,902
till this all blows over.

339
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,738
He thinks I'm crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

340
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,940
We're only as good
as the promises we keep.

341
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:54,747
Pick me up in an hour.
We'll get the money.

342
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,849
<i>All right.</i>

343
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:00,620
So?

344
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:03,589
He's gonna pay?

345
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,058
- Mm-hmm.
- I ca...

346
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,594
A million dollars?

347
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:10,530
A milli...

348
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,899
Aw, are you kidding me?

349
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,270
- Do you have a closet that locks?
- Yeah.

350
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:19,772
Yeah, the pantry locks,
I think.

351
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:22,608
Oh, my God.
A million do...

352
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,512
Hey, uh, how big is that?
A million dollars?

353
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,181
Does it fit into a suitcase?

354
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:29,849
Or like... like,
a sack or something?

355
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:31,384
It's gotta be... it's gotta
be pretty heavy, right?

356
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,853
Hey, can I...
can I lay in it?

357
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,521
You know, I always liked
that part of movies

358
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:37,523
where the characters,
they just lay in a big pile...

359
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:40,860
- You got a drill?
- Yeah.

360
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:42,562
Oh, and then they always...
they always take the money

361
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,764
and they just, like,
throw it up in the air.

362
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,899
And the money just...

363
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,235
Just, like, flutters down
on top of 'em, you know.

364
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:53,039
Why, God damn, we're doing this.
We're really...

365
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,141
- I got goose bumps.
- Wood screws.

366
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,542
Uh, yeah.

367
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:58,778
I'm gonna buy
real marble for the spa.

368
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,446
6 inches thick.

369
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:02,448
<i>I got these, uh...</i>

370
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,083
<i>I got these</i>
<i>French lotions on hold.</i>

371
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,453
They smell like sunflowers.

372
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:08,621
Uh, these?

373
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:10,723
- Longer.
- Okay.

374
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,158
So what are we...
what are we do...

375
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,759
just, like, call him
in the morning, you know,

376
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,728
tell him where to...
tell him where to meet us?

377
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,064
- Or... I don't know. These?
- Yeah. Give me a few.

378
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,932
Look at me, I'm sweating.

379
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:22,101
Here. Oh, man.

380
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:26,005
Hey, do I get to...

381
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,173
<i>use that voice thing again?</i>

382
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,574
<i>You know, the Darth Vader</i>

383
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:31,844
super sinister, like,
"Luke, I am your father"?

384
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,946
- Please step in.
- Sure.

385
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,283
Hey, you know, I, uh...

386
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,151
I never even asked ya.

387
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:41,220
<i>What are ya gonna do</i>
<i>with your share of the money?</i>

388
00:20:41,222 --> 00:20:42,989
<i>I mean, I told ya about...</i>

389
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,291
my, uh...

390
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:49,962
Uh, yeah, my, uh...
Did you mean to lock me in here?

391
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:51,764
We got a big day tomorrow.
Get some rest.

392
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,666
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>getting cold feet.</i>

393
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,101
<i>I'll see you in the morning.</i>

394
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:59,005
No. No, no, wait, hold on, now.
Heck.

395
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,941
I'm... What am I supposed to...

396
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:04,677
What... what if I gotta
go to the toilet?

397
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,413
You're a smart guy.
You'll figure something out.

398
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:15,821
<i>Poop.</i>

399
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:48,988
Abnormal, it's... it's just
slow now at the shop.

400
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,222
Lester?

401
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:52,224
It's not my fault.

402
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,226
No, you...
you bought me the tie.

403
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:57,830
<i>And you...</i>

404
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,275
Is it a cut, or what is it?

405
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:11,278
Puncture, maybe.
Hard to tell with all the gore.

406
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,015
Mr. Nygaard,
can you hear me?

407
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:18,019
That's the towel sound.
She's washing towels.

408
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:19,720
Mr. Nygaard, we're getting you
to the hospital.

409
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:20,888
Ooh.

410
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,323
What happened to your hand?

411
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:23,357
Socks.

412
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,625
What about socks?

413
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:28,462
For 50... $55,
he threw in the shotgun.

414
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:30,998
I don't understand.
Were you shot?

415
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:38,706
Mr. Nygaard.

416
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,876
Did you pay Lorne Malvo
to kill Sam Hess?

417
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:44,678
I never paid him.

418
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,681
Okay, offered to pay then?

419
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:50,684
Made a deal, and then when he
came for the money...

420
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,319
I never paid.

421
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:54,422
I didn't pay.

422
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:55,756
Yeah, okay, but...

423
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:59,326
arrangements were made,
and then,

424
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,662
I don't know, you tell me.
Things went south?

425
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:02,863
<i>'Scuse us, miss.</i>

426
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:44,165
<i>Is that what
you're looking for then?</i>

427
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,458
Two kids.

428
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,261
I'm sorry?

429
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:51,932
I got two kids and a wife
who thinks out loud.

430
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,968
This is the time I get.

431
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,771
Accidental for me.

432
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:00,807
Troubled mind.

433
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:03,376
I'll come to you.

434
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:17,290
The winters are cold.
But I can't complain.

435
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:23,163
My socks have holes.
But again, do I complain?

436
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:26,032
I do not.

437
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:29,035
<i>The oldest needs braces.</i>

438
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:32,472
<i>The youngest once sneezed</i>
<i>for three days straight.</i>

439
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:37,410
But who could complain?
They're gifts.

440
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,212
Children?

441
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:40,347
<i>All of it.</i>

442
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,916
The cold, the holes.

443
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:50,924
Hey, so I-I have a question.

444
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,226
Spiritually, I mean.

445
00:25:53,228 --> 00:25:56,863
Or not spiritually,
but I don't know, of a...

446
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:59,065
of, like, an ethical nature.

447
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,633
Please.

448
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:05,572
Well...

449
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:09,376
Let's say I know a person is
guilty who's committed a crime,

450
00:26:09,378 --> 00:26:14,381
only, you know,
I-I can't prove it.

451
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:19,552
Like he has everyone else
fooled, but... but I know.

452
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:20,854
What am I sup...

453
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:22,422
Find the proof.

454
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:25,558
<i>Yeah, okay,</i>
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

455
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,095
I'm no detective.

456
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:32,032
I mean, Molly, she's...

457
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:36,369
amazing, but I just...

458
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:39,439
And then there's Greta,
you know, and, and...

459
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,608
am I supposed to
put myself in danger,

460
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,977
or do I just...

461
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,414
I don't know, just...
let it go?

462
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,020
A rich man
opens the paper one day.

463
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,990
<i>He sees the world</i>
<i>is full of misery.</i>

464
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,625
Is this a, uh...

465
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,593
<i>It's a parable.</i>

466
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:03,596
A rich man opens the paper
one day.

467
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:07,000
He sees the world
is full of misery.

468
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:11,905
He says, "I have money.
I can help."

469
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:14,174
_

470
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,943
So he gives away
all of his money.

471
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:24,319
But it's not enough.

472
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,721
The people are still suffering.

473
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,360
One day, the man sees
another article.

474
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,650
_

475
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,666
He decides
he was foolish to think

476
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:40,135
just giving money was enough.

477
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:41,837
So he goes to the doctor

478
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,475
and says, "Doctor,
I want to donate a kidney."

479
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:49,478
The doctors do the surgery.

480
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,113
It's a complete success.

481
00:27:56,953 --> 00:28:01,122
After, he knows he should
feel good, but he doesn't,

482
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:06,328
for people are still suffering.

483
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,397
So he goes back to the doctor.

484
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,569
He says, "Doctor, this time
I want to give it all."

485
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:17,072
The doctor says, "What does
that mean, 'Give it all'?"

486
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:20,375
He says, "This time
I want to donate my liver.

487
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:22,377
<i>But not just my liver.</i>

488
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:23,545
<i>I want to donate my heart,</i>

489
00:28:23,547 --> 00:28:25,146
but not just my heart.

490
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:26,181
I want to donate my corneas,

491
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:27,649
but not just my corneas.

492
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:30,919
I want to give it all away.

493
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:35,924
Everything I am.
All that I have."

494
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:38,760
The doctor says,
"A kidney is one thing,

495
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:41,530
but you can't give away
your whole body piece by piece.

496
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,697
That's suicide."

497
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:45,834
And he sends the man home.

498
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:52,207
But the man cannot live

499
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:55,610
knowing that the people
are suffering

500
00:28:55,612 --> 00:28:58,613
and he could help.

501
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:01,180
So he gives the one thing
he has left.

502
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:02,617
_

503
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:06,388
His life.

504
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:10,792
_

505
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:15,697
And does it work?
Does it stop the suffering?

506
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:19,634
You live in the world.
What do you think?

507
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:22,404
So he killed himself
for nothing?

508
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:23,638
Did he?

509
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,474
Well, I mean...

510
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:31,112
You're saying...

511
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:36,384
What are you saying?

512
00:29:36,386 --> 00:29:40,255
Only a fool thinks he can
solve the world's problems.

513
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,895
Yeah, but you gotta try,
don't ya?

514
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,700
Nope.

515
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,681
Keep it running.

516
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:21,705
Say, dad, I was
talking to the, uh, bug guy.

517
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:24,508
<i>He's saying</i>
<i>this is all real odd.</i>

518
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,612
The crickets... he's saying
they're not local, ya know?

519
00:31:28,614 --> 00:31:30,614
Not from around here.

520
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:32,582
<i>He's saying they're the kind</i>
<i>you buy at a pet store</i>

521
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:33,683
<i>to feed your lizard or...</i>

522
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:34,851
God sent them.

523
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,020
Yeah. But, well...

524
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,688
So...

525
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,924
<i>So I called around</i>
<i>to all the pet stores,</i>

526
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:42,325
<i>and wouldn't ya know...</i>

527
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,227
Look, kid, I don't
have time for this now.

528
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:46,662
Just clean it up.
Then pack your shit, okay?

529
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:48,150
Wally is coming to take
you to the cabin.

530
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,392
- Yeah, but, dad...
- No buts!

531
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:51,594
Just do it!

532
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:09,879
'Scuse me.

533
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,918
<i>Hey, there, Molly.</i>

534
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,253
Hey, uh, Lester okay?

535
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:19,622
- Well, he's had a bad week,
that's for sure. - Yeah.

536
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:21,724
- What's this, his third time in?
- Yeah.

537
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:24,394
On the plus side,
the nose is healing nicely.

538
00:32:24,396 --> 00:32:26,462
- Well, that's a start.
- Yeah.

539
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:30,533
So, uh, um, listen,
about that hand.

540
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:31,801
Oh, real mess there.

541
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:34,203
Super infected.
Nasty stuff.

542
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:37,273
I drained the wound,
removed the foreign object,

543
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:38,708
cut away the necrotic tissue,

544
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,411
and filled him full of
IV antibiotics.

545
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:43,546
He won't lose the hand,
but it came close.

546
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:46,382
Yeah. Now, when you say,
uh, "foreign object"?

547
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:47,817
Shotgun pellet, looked like.

548
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:49,485
Had some fabric attached to it.

549
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:51,487
It's possible the pellet

550
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:54,958
<i>passed through something before</i>
<i>getting into Lester's hand.</i>

551
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,492
Yeah, or someone.

552
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:57,961
<i>Pardon?</i>

553
00:32:57,963 --> 00:32:59,495
Can I talk to him?

554
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:00,930
Well, he's sedated now
on account

555
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:02,599
of he was septic
when you brought him in.

556
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,601
So like I said,
real nasty stuff.

557
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:06,102
Right, yeah, yeah.

558
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:08,571
Be a while before he can
answer any questions.

559
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:09,973
Hey, you seen Ida?

560
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,108
Wait, is she here?

561
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,278
Yeah, upstairs.
Just had the baby.

562
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,180
- Holy smokes.
- Yeah.

563
00:33:17,182 --> 00:33:18,181
Girl or boy?

564
00:33:18,183 --> 00:33:20,683
- Bernadette, I heard.
- Oh...

565
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:23,119
So... girl.

566
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:25,154
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

567
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:28,124
<i>Dr. Nesbit, call 1-1-8.</i>

568
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:29,359
Excuse me.

569
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:31,227
All right.

570
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:10,590
_

571
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:09,607
It was the Romans, wasn't it?

572
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,512
Huh?
What are you saying?

573
00:37:14,514 --> 00:37:16,380
Saint Lawrence, your window.

574
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:19,650
The Romans burned him alive.

575
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:21,852
They did.

576
00:37:21,854 --> 00:37:22,853
You know why?

577
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:25,890
'Cause he was Christian.

578
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,091
<i>Maybe.</i>

579
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,394
But I think it was because

580
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:34,398
the Romans
were raised by wolves.

581
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,001
Greatest empire
in human history,

582
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:40,838
founded by wolves.

583
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,542
You know what wolves do.

584
00:37:44,544 --> 00:37:46,477
They hunt.

585
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:50,715
<i>They kill.</i>

586
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:53,184
<i>It's why I never bought</i>
<i>into</i> The Jungle Book.

587
00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:54,785
Boy's raised by wolves

588
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:57,388
and becomes friends
with a bear and a panther.

589
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,824
I don't think so.

590
00:38:02,728 --> 00:38:07,732
I knew a guy once,
had a 110-pound rottweiler.

591
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:10,101
And one night this girl
thought it'd be funny

592
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:13,270
to get down on all fours
and let the dog hump her.

593
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:17,074
Dog still had its balls.

594
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:22,079
Well, the dog gets up there,
but he's not in on the joke.

595
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,850
This is just a bitch in heat
as far as he's concerned.

596
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:30,254
<i>And he's not leaving</i>
<i>till he gets what he came for.</i>

597
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:32,123
<i>Well, the girl, too late,</i>

598
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,158
<i>realizes the kind</i>
<i>of mistake she's made,</i>

599
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,662
she wants to get up.

600
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:43,100
But the dog had other ideas.

601
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:46,103
Had to shoot it behind the ear
to get it off of her.

602
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:51,642
I don't, uh...
I don't...

603
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:54,612
<i>Well, I'm saying that</i>

604
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:56,180
the Romans raised by wolves,

605
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:59,350
they see a guy
turning water into wine,

606
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:03,087
what do they do?
They eat him.

607
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:06,757
'Cause there are no saints
in the animal kingdom.

608
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:09,894
Only breakfast and dinner.

609
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,354
So what time do you want me
to pick you up in the morning?

610
00:40:10,356 --> 00:40:13,023
Nah. We're done.

611
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:16,427
You can stay the night, but you
gotta hit the road come dawn.

612
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:19,530
Here's what I owe ya.

613
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:22,234
Sorry it didn't work out.

614
00:40:53,065 --> 00:40:54,799
Grimly.

615
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,301
<i>Hey, ya. It's Molly.</i>

616
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:59,136
Oh, yeah.
How ya doing, there?

617
00:40:59,138 --> 00:41:02,600
Pretty good.
How things going with you?

618
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:07,472
Oh, not bad. Just trying
to figure this thing out.

619
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:09,641
Yeah, so I was wondering.

620
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:11,109
With this fella I arrested,

621
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:16,181
how come he was there,
ya know, on the street?

622
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,516
<i>On that street,</i>
<i>I mean, if he is our guy,</i>

623
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:22,020
<i>and not, you know,</i>
<i>some pastor, actually.</i>

624
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,788
<i>So what'd you come up with?</i>

625
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,291
Well, see, I'm not sure

626
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:28,793
what I'm looking for
is the problem.

627
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:32,363
Plus, you know, it's dark out,
so maybe go back out tomorrow.

628
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,932
<i>Oh.</i>

629
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:35,900
I was thinking I might
drive out in the morning,

630
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:37,168
take a look at Lester's car.

631
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,304
<i>Thought maybe</i>

632
00:41:39,306 --> 00:41:41,506
after we could get together?

633
00:41:41,508 --> 00:41:42,841
You know,
compare notes on this thing.

634
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:46,744
Sure. That'd be...

635
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:49,514
Ah, I'd like that.

636
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:51,082
Okay, so tomorrow then.

637
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:54,185
Okay.

638
00:42:19,446 --> 00:42:22,080
<i>What'd ya get for number three?</i>

639
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:23,982
<i>Uh, X squared.</i>

640
00:42:23,984 --> 00:42:26,718
<i>What'd ya get for four?</i>

641
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,852
<i>A rhombus.</i>

642
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:41,332
Help you?

643
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:43,234
You're not supposed to be here.

644
00:42:43,236 --> 00:42:46,771
Oh, no, pretty sure I'm
right where I'm supposed to be.

645
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:02,420
Hi.

646
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:04,189
Neighborhood watch.

647
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:06,286
If you don't move,
I'm gonna have to call the cops.

648
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:08,350
Well, friend, there's
no need for that.

649
00:43:08,357 --> 00:43:10,424
This is a nice neighborhood.

650
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:13,494
Children play in the streets.
My children.

651
00:43:13,496 --> 00:43:16,764
We have block parties,
fruit punch.

652
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:20,667
We don't need a man
in a dark car doing things.

653
00:43:20,669 --> 00:43:22,736
You mean like sitting?

654
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:24,505
<i>Don't be a nudnik.</i>

655
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:26,540
This is a community.

656
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:28,909
People watch
each other's backs.

657
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:32,846
Someone gets sick, someone dies,
you bring a casserole, help.

658
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,282
Maybe I'm here to help.

659
00:43:35,284 --> 00:43:38,252
<i>No, you have black eyes.</i>
<i>You're trouble.</i>

660
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,554
I'm going inside,
and I'm calling the cops.

661
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:41,789
Which building?

662
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:44,758
The one with
the Jew bus outside?

663
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,761
There it is.

664
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,430
Now the truth comes out.

665
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:52,633
You know, some people think

666
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:56,403
you don't need alarms
on second-story windows.

667
00:43:56,405 --> 00:44:00,207
Think they can save a few bucks,
you know, and still be safe.

668
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:03,077
Another way they
save money is they don't

669
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,346
hook up the alarm
to the phone line.

670
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:09,383
<i>So the bell rings,</i>
<i>but the cops don't come.</i>

671
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:14,154
Or they come, but only
after the neighbors call.

672
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:18,559
Which, um, if this community's
tight, as you say,

673
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:21,295
you know...

674
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:25,165
just might be quick enough
to save your life...

675
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:28,168
or your children's lives.

676
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,370
Maybe.

677
00:44:30,372 --> 00:44:31,972
<i>Se'irim.</i>

678
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:36,777
You're a nice guy.

679
00:45:09,756 --> 00:45:11,223
How come we're all
in the hall then?

680
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:14,126
Ida kicked us out.
Said we were being too loud.

681
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,494
Ah.

682
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:16,928
Well, she did just have
a baby, so...

683
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:20,065
Yeah, we all agreed
it was a good point.

684
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,339
So you're being loud
in the hall instead.

685
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:30,142
All right, boys,
let's, uh, pack it up.

686
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,843
Call 'er a night.

687
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:34,413
You're goin' away?

688
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:36,515
I gotta protect the baby here.

689
00:45:37,785 --> 00:45:41,019
You were making too much noise.

690
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,626
Sorry. You sleeping?

691
00:45:55,234 --> 00:45:57,969
Well, that's a baby, all right.

692
00:45:57,971 --> 00:46:01,330
Smell her.

693
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:03,465
Okay.

694
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:12,641
That's what
a new one smells like.

695
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:17,312
How you holding up?

696
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:20,148
Me? You're the one
just had a baby.

697
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,351
Yeah, but I get
to lie down now.

698
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:23,352
Yeah.

699
00:46:23,354 --> 00:46:25,721
I just look tired.

700
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:27,889
Inside I'm raring to go.

701
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,429
So...

702
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:38,533
- How much do you...
<i>- I don't need details.</i>

703
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:41,570
Just tell me you're
taking care of it.

704
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:43,438
I'm trying, yeah.

705
00:46:50,346 --> 00:46:51,880
Do you want me
to stay the night?

706
00:46:51,882 --> 00:46:53,281
I could sleep in the chair.

707
00:46:53,283 --> 00:46:54,916
<i>Nah. I got</i>
<i>people coming.</i>

708
00:46:54,918 --> 00:46:59,921
My sister and her daughter.
Be around 11:00, she said.

709
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:03,658
They said, uh, Bernadette.

710
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,770
Vern's idea.
His mother's name.

711
00:47:06,771 --> 00:47:10,889
I wanted Ally.
And now he's dead.

712
00:47:11,368 --> 00:47:14,036
That man always knew
how to win an argument.

713
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:19,241
I think it's pretty, so...

714
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:20,909
Good, 'cause you're
the babysitter.

715
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:23,912
Oh...

716
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:25,380
Now go home.
Let me sleep.

717
00:47:25,382 --> 00:47:28,617
You do the same.
You look like a raccoon.

718
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,919
Yeah.

719
00:47:30,921 --> 00:47:32,621
I gotta go to Duluth in the AM,

720
00:47:32,623 --> 00:47:34,056
but I'll stop by after, yeah?

721
00:47:34,058 --> 00:47:35,858
Hmm.
