1
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,665
Shit.

2
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,395
<i>...The millipede does possess glands</i>

3
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:51,771
<i>that produce highly toxic chemicals.</i>

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,560
<i>The female millipede, sensing danger,</i>

5
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,402
<i>emits her secret weapon,</i>

6
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:58,341
<i>cyanide.</i>

7
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,399
<i>Her attacker gasps its last breath.</i>

8
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,479
Housekeeping.

9
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,641
Mrs. Curtis.

10
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,202
No! No! No! No! No!

11
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,911
- No! No! No! No!
- Here.

12
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,440
Ah! Speak of the devil.

13
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,953
Here's the headhunter himself,
as promised.

14
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:46,314
- Sorry. Sorry.
- All right. Told her you were

15
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,424
- reviewing the court release.
- Huh?

16
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:50,919
- The...
- Oh. Yeah.

17
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,106
So...

18
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,083
Is it Mrs. Goldfarb, or...

19
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:01,365
- My friends call me Ruby.
- Ruby.

20
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:04,490
That's swell. I could use a drink.
Anybody else?

21
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:05,617
We're drinking rose.

22
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,219
Old-fashioned on the rocks.

23
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:14,108
Sy tells me you're in self-storage.

24
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,896
Me and my late husband.
We started in mortuaries.

25
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,097
Ah, just another kind
of storage, I suppose.

26
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,396
That's what my Tovaldt used to say.

27
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,389
Both good businesses. Steady.

28
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,871
Mmm. Heck, maybe
we should be buying you out.

29
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,806
- Oh...
- Uh...

30
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:31,374
Well, now, Emmit...

31
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:33,634
I know, I know. That's not the plan.

32
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,905
But... Thanks. Heck,

33
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,835
you don't get where I am
by sticking to the plan.

34
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,851
- Hmm.
- To new friends.

35
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:42,985
New friends.

36
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,525
He's dead, in case you couldn't tell.

37
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,035
Lady cop who printed you
said you're a little tender.

38
00:05:36,104 --> 00:05:37,470
Around the middle, maybe?

39
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,106
Got some bruises.

40
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,765
See, I'm a simple guy.

41
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,797
When it snows, I put on boots.

42
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:52,874
Sun comes out, I wear shades.

43
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,817
I see a girl like you and a
guy like that, I think...

44
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,957
"Now, how's a working man
with hillbilly hair and a beer belly

45
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,761
"land Miss State Penitentiary 2010?"

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,866
And then I get the record.

47
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:13,733
I see the girl
has got 18 months' probation

48
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,305
and the guy with his head half cut off

49
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,813
was the shlub who signed the forms.

50
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,345
Now it starts to make sense.

51
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,348
I mean, stop me if I get it wrong,

52
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,422
if this wasn't some kind of tit-for-tat

53
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:29,320
handjob-gets-you-work-release program...

54
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:33,356
If it was, whatever.
Love story of the century.

55
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,361
No? That's what I thought.

56
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:43,640
See? Simple things.

57
00:06:44,101 --> 00:06:46,179
Cause and effect, crime and punishment.

58
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,422
Mash a potato, you know what you get?

59
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,172
Mashed potatoes.

60
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,071
I want a lawyer.

61
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,240
Yeah?

62
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,943
Well, that's a mistake.

63
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,803
Think it through.

64
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,331
The evidence, shared domicile,

65
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,073
you, a known felon,
spinning a web of lies.

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,222
History of domestic violence
with a beer-drinking loser.

67
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,796
You don't have to be a mathematician
to add two plus two.

68
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,320
No. Your best bet?

69
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:23,594
Tearjerker.

70
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,587
What a monster he was.

71
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:30,876
How he beat you every night
where it wouldn't show.

72
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,223
Okay. We're done.

73
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,260
I'll leave the picture,

74
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:52,184
in case you're the type of girl
who likes to take pride in her work.

75
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,516
This can't be good, right?

76
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,011
Should I start, or...

77
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,914
- Is she mine?
- No, you got the other one.

78
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:09,485
Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

79
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,048
St. Cloud Homicide's
gonna handle this case,

80
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:14,188
and you're both gonna go back to...

81
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:15,537
What'd you do?

82
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:16,891
Traffic enforcement.

83
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,201
- Traffic enforcement.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,662
Gloria Burgle, Chief of
the Eden Valley police.

85
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,230
For about another week.

86
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:25,342
Eight days, yes, sir,
including Christmas,

87
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:26,568
which, you might be surprised to hear,

88
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:29,152
is a pretty busy day for misdemeanor
infractions in Eden Valley,

89
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:31,838
mostly surrounding too much eggnog
and a Class C motor vehicle.

90
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,172
Is she kidding?

91
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,574
She likes to think she's a smart one.

92
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:36,500
Anyhoo, given the preciousness of time,

93
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,578
I'd like to talk to
the suspect, Nikki Swango,

94
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:39,969
preferably right now.

95
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,227
I just talked to her.

96
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,653
Which, I'm sure,
was enlightening for her,

97
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,331
but without all the proper nuance.

98
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,163
See, I got a paper grid that lays out

99
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,662
all the inter-related parties
delineating their personal

100
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:50,233
and professional relationship
to the murders.

101
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,816
It's a substantial document.

102
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,889
"Murders," plural?

103
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,483
- No.
- Yes, sir. Three so far.

104
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,756
The first victim being
Ennis Stussy of Eden Valley,

105
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,190
which, again, is my purview.

106
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,260
Ennis, a green grocer,
was suffocated by Maurice LeFay,

107
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:03,885
a, last I checked, resident of St. Cloud

108
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,643
and repeat offender who was on probation

109
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,271
under the supervision of Ray Stussy,
our current victim.

110
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,166
Maurice LeFay,
in case you were wondering,

111
00:10:10,202 --> 00:10:12,202
also died under
mysterious circumstances,

112
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,470
making him victim number three.

113
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,772
Allegedly.

114
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,213
And at the heart of the case
is what we believe to be a rivalry

115
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,319
between Ray Stussy
and his brother, Emmit,

116
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,944
the parking lot king of Minnesota.

117
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,445
I know who Emmit Stussy is.

118
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,568
Then you can understand
how a rich man like that,

119
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,646
pillar of the community,
might be targeted by his younger,

120
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:27,983
less successful brother.

121
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,685
A brother with possibly shaky morals

122
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,454
and access to wily criminal elements.

123
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,088
Unfortunately, Ray's plan,

124
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,657
as far as I can tell,
went off the rails,

125
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,328
resulting in the death
of my random Stussy

126
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:38,282
and the reason I'm sitting here today.

127
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,710
Only an intellectual could
believe something so stupid.

128
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,971
Well, sirs, as you'll see
if you try working the angles,

129
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:51,773
the alternatives make even less sense.

130
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,442
Especially given the new victim...

131
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,240
Uh...

132
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:57,349
Get back to traffic enforcement.

133
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,747
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,966
And you, I got no jurisdiction over you,

135
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,715
but this is St. Cloud Metro's case now.

136
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,428
So, if we need you or your grid,

137
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,803
we'll give you a holler.

138
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:13,592
- Sir...
- You're dismissed.

139
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:15,462
Wait for me outside.

140
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:25,697
I guess that's it then.

141
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,751
We need to find Emmit.
Try his office or at home.

142
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,409
Tell him Ray died under suspicious
circumstance, Gauge his reaction.

143
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:31,962
- Are you sure? That's...
- I'm gonna brace the girlfriend,

144
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:33,433
try to get some answers. Go.

145
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:39,003
Either you're on vacation
till the handover,

146
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:41,753
take some time to grieve,
be with your family,

147
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,565
merry Christmas, all that,

148
00:11:43,757 --> 00:11:46,042
or start looking for another job.

149
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,237
Happy holidays, sir.

150
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:49,760
That's what I thought.

151
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,914
Whoo! I tell ya, they got me running

152
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:12,882
six different directions today.

153
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:15,155
- How you doing?
- Form.

154
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:19,769
Yeah, I'm supposed to talk
to Swango, looks like, Nikki.

155
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:21,265
Form.

156
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:22,574
I don't...

157
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,395
Nobody told me I needed a...

158
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:30,422
Is that an interview request form, or...

159
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:31,901
It's the blue one.

160
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:37,139
See the shift sergeant. One floor up.

161
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,724
You know, is there any way?

162
00:12:41,912 --> 00:12:43,745
I was supposed
to be out of here an hour ago,

163
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,826
Christmas Eve and all that.
My boy at home. He's 12.

164
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:48,683
I think I got a picture here somewhere.

165
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,407
One flight up, you said? All right.

166
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,264
Nope.

167
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,333
Nope.

168
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,636
Oh, maybe.

169
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:14,197
Yeah, right, Donny,
like you got a chance there.

170
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:19,645
Yeah, Eden Valley Police. What can I...

171
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:23,778
Oh, yeah? Jeez.

172
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:27,725
Did they take anything,
or you just think it's vandalism?

173
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,643
Okay, hang tight. There in a jiff.

174
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,170
Ah, God dang it!

175
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:33,015
Firing on all cylinders today, Mashman.

176
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:53,734
Hello?

177
00:15:30,437 --> 00:15:32,181
Uh, sir?

178
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:35,407
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- Shh.

179
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:40,451
Uh, you can't be in here, sir.

180
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,803
Library is closed.

181
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:47,554
You're here.

182
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:51,821
Well, sir, I work here, so that's...

183
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,258
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

184
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:00,330
Sir?

185
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,699
You're gonna have to leave.

186
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,124
I just did.

187
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:11,887
What?

188
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,647
You asked, then I left.

189
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,580
I'm not here.

190
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,349
Well, that's... I see you.

191
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:24,563
You think you see me.

192
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:27,321
But your eyes are lying.

193
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,773
That's...

194
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:34,453
Sir, in another three minutes,

195
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:36,500
we're gonna have a real...

196
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,506
You should think of what you're doing.

197
00:16:44,306 --> 00:16:46,710
Man, alone,

198
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,788
in a room full of books,

199
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:51,296
talking to himself.

200
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,757
In my country we call such people...

201
00:16:58,077 --> 00:16:59,398
<i>bezumets.</i>

202
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:04,029
Or maybe you think I'm your conscience.

203
00:17:04,492 --> 00:17:08,099
How's that story,
the Ghost of Christmas Past?

204
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,326
I...

205
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,429
You came back for a reason,
I'm thinking.

206
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,703
The gun.

207
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:21,139
It's there on the counter.

208
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,212
Pick it up, your gun.

209
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,030
Now go.

210
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:34,773
You don't seem like a guy
who's ready to retire.

211
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:37,466
Well, you know, Sy thinks it's time.

212
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,420
That's funny.

213
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,880
- He said that you...
- No. W-We're both... We're both ready.

214
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,114
That's... We agreed this was the way to...

215
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:44,771
Quit while we're ahead.

216
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,136
What's the saying?

217
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:48,237
"If you love something, let it go."

218
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,119
"If it comes back, it's yours."

219
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,604
"If it doesn't,
hunt it down and kill it."

220
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:57,044
Is the version I heard.

221
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,916
You can see why
I'm usually the negotiator.

222
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:05,243
There's something... You've got a...

223
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:08,813
Oh.

224
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,310
That's just...

225
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:13,122
Must be some red wine from lunch.

226
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:14,261
Mmm.

227
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,942
Any more questions
on the business? Projections?

228
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,654
No, it was real thorough,
your presentation.

229
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,313
My front office guy
took a look at your numbers

230
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:23,915
and he said your books really sing.

231
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,203
Mmm. Well then,
I say we call it a night.

232
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,851
And I'll get our attorney
started on the paperwork.

233
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,623
Sy said your husband died.

234
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:37,150
- That's not... We don't need to...
- That's okay. No.

235
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,547
My Tovaldt, it'll be a year
in May, he passed.

236
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,117
- Do you have a... Oh.
- Stella.

237
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:49,270
Twenty-five years. She left last week.

238
00:19:49,363 --> 00:19:50,597
Sex tape.

239
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:52,974
- That's...
- Not a real one, of course.

240
00:19:53,035 --> 00:19:56,032
I mean, it was a real sex tape,
just not my, you know...

241
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,235
Forgery, to the end of
securing a payout which...

242
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,686
You know, that's the price of it,
I guess, being rich.

243
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:06,448
- I don't know.
- Enemies, I'm saying.

244
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:08,223
Not at first.
First come the well-wishers

245
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,525
with their fake smiles.

246
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:10,926
Then the richer you get,

247
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:12,861
here come the deadbeats
with their hands out...

248
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,362
You know, it's getting pretty late.

249
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:16,645
And then the jackals,
laughing in the dark,

250
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,367
trying to pick the meat off your bones.

251
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,602
Check, please!

252
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,671
Money is a blessing and a curse.

253
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:24,937
No, don't blame money. It's people.

254
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:25,929
Mmm.

255
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,195
Sore losers making up stories
how we're villains,

256
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,539
the dreamers, the hard workers,

257
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:34,934
in the office before dawn,
toiling, saving,

258
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:37,029
like Ebenezer Scrooge and the like.

259
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:39,887
- Have you heard of the vile maxim?
- No.

260
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,817
"All for ourselves
and nothing for other people

261
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:46,149
"is the vile maxim
of the masters of mankind."

262
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:49,853
You think a rich man wrote that?

263
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,404
No, it was the others.

264
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,529
The grubby hands outside the glass,
trying to get in,

265
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:57,103
- putting their filthy peckers...
- What the Christ?

266
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,718
This is bordering on harassment now.

267
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:02,851
What's happening?

268
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,043
Uh, nothing. Just a misunderstanding.

269
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,710
Excuse me for a moment.

270
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,176
You remind me a little of my husband.

271
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,615
You two would've
gotten along really well.

272
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:54,312
- Sir.
- It's Ray.

273
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,127
Mr. Stussy, your brother...

274
00:21:58,162 --> 00:21:59,828
I've been here since 6:00.

275
00:22:00,462 --> 00:22:01,572
Huh?

276
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:03,467
Just been sitting here
all night, gabbing.

277
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:05,485
Sy'll tell you. Business.

278
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,391
Or more social I guess,
I had a few drinks.

279
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:15,242
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to say

280
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:16,914
your brother, I'm afraid, he's deceased.

281
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:19,047
We found his body earlier this evening.

282
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:22,282
Raymond.

283
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,485
Yes, sir, I'm sorry for your loss.

284
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:30,938
It's that girlfriend, the criminal.

285
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:33,700
You should bring her in,
put the cuffs on.

286
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,063
If anyone had motive...

287
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,252
Motive for what, sir? I never said...

288
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,666
We're upset. Alcohol's been shared...

289
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,568
I just meant if...

290
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:45,584
Are you saying he had a heart attack?

291
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,768
Uh... No, sir, we're thinking foul play.

292
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:52,181
See? I told you that girl was no good.

293
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,032
Some kind of a black widow,
using my brother to get...

294
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:57,407
- Sir...
- We're upset.

295
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,329
It's big news.

296
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,657
A beloved brother dying suddenly?

297
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,926
Any kind of statement you need from us,

298
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,956
talk to Bruce Lipshitz at
Green, Greene and Gruene.

299
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,308
If you don't mind me asking, Mr. Stussy,

300
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,081
when was the last time
that you saw your brother?

301
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:12,860
Like I said, call Bruce Lipshitz...

302
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:14,165
We've been here all night.

303
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:16,105
Otherwise, thank you
for the information.

304
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,805
We're devastated, obviously.
He was a real saint, Ray.

305
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,303
Troubled, but, you know, he meant well.

306
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:26,139
- He was my brother.
- I'm gonna take my friend home now.

307
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:34,334
Yeah.

308
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:36,913
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
He was acting...

309
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:39,396
Kind of weird.

310
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,354
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Hold on.

311
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:46,233
Officer Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.

312
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:48,068
I'm wondering if you might have a minute

313
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,670
to answer a few questions.

314
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,309
I'll call Kitson in the morning,

315
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,989
assuming you wanna bury Ray
in the family plot.

316
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,761
And I don't need to know where you...

317
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,198
I'll talk to the widow,

318
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,702
circle back, in case the cops wanna...

319
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,936
You got there at 6:00, like you said.

320
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:39,071
You think this was him, Varga?

321
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,165
After what happened to Irv,

322
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,281
trying to get to you, keep us from...

323
00:24:43,306 --> 00:24:44,829
What's your angle here?

324
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,916
- My...
- Your angle.

325
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,017
You don't think it's funny, the timing?

326
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,614
Ray coming to the party,
demanding money,

327
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:55,841
him and his girl, with us in the black,

328
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:59,606
and how he gained access
to my safety deposit box?

329
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:02,856
- I don't...
- Not to mention things you said to me.

330
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:06,567
Accusations, you might say,
about Ermentraub

331
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,633
and who it was that urged caution

332
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,103
as opposed to rushing in.

333
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:11,486
Blaming me, in other words.

334
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,960
I was thinking, maybe...

335
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,554
you and Ray...

336
00:25:20,544 --> 00:25:21,644
What?

337
00:25:21,742 --> 00:25:24,318
You and Ray.

338
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:26,560
Me and Ray?

339
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:30,280
Is that what he's telling you? Varga?

340
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:31,928
- 'Cause that's just crazy.
- Is it?

341
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:33,352
You really think I'm...

342
00:25:35,337 --> 00:25:37,273
In the face of all logic,

343
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:39,497
that somehow I decided, me,

344
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,773
the partner in a multi-million
dollar corporation,

345
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:45,070
that I decided to what, turn on you?

346
00:25:45,338 --> 00:25:47,728
Join forces with your leptard brother

347
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:49,643
and his syphilitic floozy,

348
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,117
so I could turn millions into thousands?

349
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,193
What's the math there?

350
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:02,682
I'm sorry. I just...

351
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,863
No. I know.

352
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:10,849
It's been a long...
The pressure I'm under...

353
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:12,283
Now this.

354
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:14,886
No, we both feel it.

355
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:16,825
Not knowing who to trust.

356
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,190
Me.

357
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,013
You can always trust me.

358
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,739
Which is why I'm more
convinced now than ever,

359
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,732
we gotta hit the eject button here

360
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:32,168
on the whole... Take the money and run.

361
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,060
- The widow Goldfarb.
- And I know you got reservations

362
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:38,859
about selling and putting her
in harm's way, a bystander,

363
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:41,130
but I really think this is...

364
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:42,796
What choice do we have?

365
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,060
We're fighting for our lives here.

366
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,987
Meat from the bones.

367
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,105
You want me to call Stella?

368
00:26:59,163 --> 00:27:01,969
I'm sure, given the circumstances,

369
00:27:02,376 --> 00:27:05,407
maybe this leads to reconciliation.

370
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:08,670
No, I just want to be alone right now.

371
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,577
Anything you need, day or night...

372
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,923
How do you feel?

373
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,495
Free.

374
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,345
When I was a kid,

375
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,283
whenever I had a nightmare,

376
00:28:17,104 --> 00:28:19,727
my mother would sit
at the foot of the bed

377
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:21,460
and say a little rhyme.

378
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,501
"There was a crooked man

379
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:29,275
"and he walked a crooked mile

380
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,963
"and he found a crooked sixpence

381
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:35,697
"besides a crooked stile,

382
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,295
"and he bought a crooked cat,

383
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:40,514
"which caught a crooked mouse,

384
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:44,038
<i>"and they all lived together</i>

385
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,463
<i>"in a little crooked house."</i>

386
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:48,151
There you are.

387
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,877
I was getting worried.

388
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,042
You just missed the girls.

389
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,600
They came by for a...

390
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:00,185
surprise visit.

391
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,985
I said you had a dinner.

392
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,576
May be back by 8:00.

393
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:10,324
Anyhoo...

394
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:13,728
You just missed them.

395
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:18,731
Oh. But...

396
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:21,729
we made butterscotch pudding.

397
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,906
I could fix you a bowl.

398
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:36,982
Oh! For Pete's sake, hon, what's wrong?

399
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:41,887
The world.

400
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:46,211
The world is wrong.

401
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,299
What are you saying? Huh?

402
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:54,659
It looks like my world,

403
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:58,361
but everything's different.

404
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:33,852
Oh. Uh... Hey there.
Merry Christmas to ya.

405
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:37,877
Um, I'm looking for
a blue form, I guess.

406
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,287
Yeah.

407
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,768
- Yeah, you're not St. Cloud.
- No, that's...

408
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,028
I'm over at Eden Valley,

409
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,637
just in town to interview a prisoner
and they told me that...

410
00:30:45,662 --> 00:30:47,497
Yeah, blue forms
are for St. Cloud officers.

411
00:30:47,522 --> 00:30:51,633
Inter-departmental requests,
that's a whole other... Yup.

412
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,602
You gotta get your superior officer's
approval on this form

413
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:56,000
before I can give you the blue one.

414
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:58,178
Well, since I'm Chief of Eden Valley,

415
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,440
couldn't I just, I don't know,
approve myself?

416
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,397
You can't do that. That's...

417
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,344
Let me guess, against regulations?

418
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:07,836
Darn right it's against regulations.

419
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:12,963
You're gonna need to
get Chief Muderlack's

420
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:14,909
John Hancock on one of these babies,

421
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,143
then I'll give you the yellow one,

422
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:18,511
and then when that's filled,
you get the blue.

423
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,449
My lawyer here?

424
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:36,207
Turn around and put your hands
through the bars.

425
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,473
Why?

426
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,920
Gotta check your cell for contraband.

427
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:45,997
How about I just stand in the corner
and mind my own business?

428
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:48,700
How about you do the electricity dance,

429
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:50,279
maybe wet your pants?

430
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:04,500
Ow!

431
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,293
Be a good girl now.

432
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,409
What's happening? Is that...

433
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:15,518
- No.
- Easy, son.

434
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,571
Put the syringe down,
on the floor, slowly.

435
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:21,605
- He was doing something.
- Quiet.

436
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:23,745
On the floor.

437
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:40,089
- Stand down, stand down!
- No! Wait!

438
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:41,967
Wait, there's an officer,
he just ran out.

439
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:44,249
I was... Somebody go after him!

440
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:46,632
- Listen to me!
- God damn it!

441
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:50,001
No, wait. There's something going on.

442
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:52,301
- The syringe...
- That's a murder weapon.

443
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:53,670
He was gonna kill me, the officer.

444
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:55,040
- He cuffed me here...
- Shut up.

445
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:00,563
Jesus Christ.

446
00:34:02,513 --> 00:34:04,880
How do I know this ain't yours? Huh?

447
00:34:05,024 --> 00:34:07,458
The tape. Check the tape.

448
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:20,226
Son of a bitch.
Who controls that, the camera?

449
00:34:20,355 --> 00:34:22,236
There's a switch on the wall,

450
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,244
but I was here the whole time.

451
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,017
Maybe a hack.

452
00:34:26,249 --> 00:34:27,416
What kind of hack?

453
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:29,971
A breach, I mean. Outside agents.

454
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:31,938
Come on, it's a glitch.

455
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,110
Try watching a movie
at my house some time.

456
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:36,828
You got a bad cable,
the thing just won't play.

457
00:34:37,112 --> 00:34:40,342
Sir, somebody came for that girl.

458
00:34:40,897 --> 00:34:43,006
A man in uniform.

459
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:45,385
Three murders in, going for a fourth,

460
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:47,251
either one of your men
or an impersonator.

461
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,063
So, it's a conspiracy now?

462
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,933
I'm not talking about certainty.

463
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:56,798
I'm saying there's doubt.

464
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:58,583
Three bodies, all connected,

465
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:00,833
and now our chief suspect,
even while she's in custody,

466
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:02,568
has these mysterious circumstances.

467
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:04,279
A syringe full of who knows what.

468
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:06,024
How do we know this is the end of it?

469
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,536
A spree.

470
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:09,441
The point is, even if it's a coincidence,

471
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,675
shouldn't we talk to her?

472
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,772
Exhaust all possibilities?

473
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,052
Damn it.

474
00:35:32,392 --> 00:35:33,827
Hey, partner, give us a minute?

475
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:44,640
I don't want you cutting him open.

476
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,343
My Ray.

477
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:49,085
He doesn't deserve that.

478
00:35:49,176 --> 00:35:52,436
It's a homicide.
We gotta do an autopsy by law.

479
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:00,555
Who was that fella,
the one with the syringe?

480
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,816
Nikki.

481
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,207
What?

482
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:06,980
We both know he came here to kill you

483
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:08,730
for something you saw
or something you know.

484
00:36:08,847 --> 00:36:10,761
That... We don't both know that.

485
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,447
I'm sticking to my mashed-potato
theory from earlier.

486
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:16,169
I think your boyfriend
hired a con to rob his brother,

487
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:17,538
and things went from bad to worse.

488
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:18,768
And then, I don't know,

489
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:20,604
maybe the brother came back at him hard.

490
00:36:24,514 --> 00:36:25,867
Maybe not the brother.

491
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,336
Meaning?

492
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:34,763
Follow the money.

493
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,435
That's all I'll say.

494
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:41,568
The money? What money?

495
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,201
Come on, it's Christmas Eve.

496
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:49,223
I got a boy at home
that can't sleep at night

497
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,575
'cause somebody murdered his grandpa

498
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:52,825
and he's afraid they might be
coming for him next.

499
00:36:57,845 --> 00:36:59,077
Follow the money.

500
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:03,047
You know what?
Your probation is revoked.

501
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:05,149
We're transferring you to the state pen.

502
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,284
Protective custody. You're welcome.

503
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,532
You know, forensics is doing
a test on the syringe.

504
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,633
You ask me to place a bet?

505
00:37:15,962 --> 00:37:18,117
I think it takes a jury
10 minutes to convict you,

506
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,830
nutbag with a syringe
or no nutbag with a syringe.

507
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,174
You like pie?

508
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,195
I'm gonna visit you after the holiday,
bring you some pie.

509
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,288
Maybe we can talk about Ray.

510
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,179
What he liked, who he was.

511
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,251
Coconut.

512
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,591
I like coconut cream pie.

513
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:52,439
With chocolate flakes on top.
