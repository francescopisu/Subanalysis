Dodd.

He came to the house

and she knocked him
on his ass.

trade him back to the family.

While we're skippin' down
memory Lane here,

49
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,290
it's worth notin'
that the Gerhardt Indian

50
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,760
is out there free -- probably
callin' for reinforcements.

51
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,090
So if I were us...

52
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,690
I-i stabbed him.
...I'd get them out of here.

53
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,260
Or cover 'em in bacon
and leave 'em for the dogs.

54
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,430
I stabbed him --
the Indian.

55
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,820
He wanted a haircut,

56
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,620
and I stabbed him
with the scissors.

57
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,860
In the back.

58
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,860

she makes us look like

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,020

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,930
...uh, my plan --
it worked.

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,750
I made a deal
for Dodd.

65
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,530
With what?
The Gerhardts?

66
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,750
No. They -- they --
they wouldn't.

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,190
They said
they weren't interested.

68
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,690
That's what they --
that's what they told me.

69
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,830
So,
i called Kansas City.

70
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,050
You did what?

71
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,230
I spoke to this fella --
Milligan --

72
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,550
and he said he'd protect us
if we gave him Dodd.

73
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,360
So got a meeting set
at 8:00 A.M.

74
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Where?

75
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,590
Sioux falls.

76
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,430
They're comin' here?

77
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,150
Yes, sir --
to the motor motel.

78
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,260
We need to get these two
into custody now.

79
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,830
Where's
the nearest precinct?

80
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,580
Tell 'em.

81
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,160
We can't vouch

82
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,290
for the safety of the precinct,
is the thing.

83
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,290
What kinda chickenshit outfit
ya runnin' here, j.C.?

84
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,490
Zip it.

85
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,890
I don't
drive to your backyard

86
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,590
and talk about
how all your heads are flat.

87
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,560
What does that mean,
you can't vouch for the safety?

88
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,290
We got graft,
I'm sayin'.

89
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,260
Money changes hands.

90
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,430
Used to be Gerhardt money.
Now it's Kansas City.

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,580
Corruption?

92
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,060
Allegedly.

93
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,930
But -- well, ya bring these two
into custody,

94
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,220
can't guarantee they won't hear
about it down in Kansas City.

95
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,880
And you know they'll send,
like, an army.

96
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,490
So, we take 'em north,

97
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,830
someplace where people
got their heads on straight.

98
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,720
My state.
My prisoners.

99
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,220
Well, wherever we're takin' 'em,
we need to go soon.

100
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,620
I've been under siege
once this week.

101
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,720
Not really interested --
there's a third way.

102
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,380
We wire the redhead.

103
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,430
Send him into the meeting
with this Milligan fella,

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,480
get the conspiracy
on tape.

105
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,430
If we're lucky,
we bust the whole operation.

106
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
No.

107
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,280

I'm lookin' around,

108
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,260

nine ways to Sunday.

109

believe me, wearin' a wire?

113
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,730
They'll make the effort

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,450

off death row.

115

it takes to blow your nose.

123
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
And I say
we squeeze the lemons we got

124
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,360
and use the juice
to catch these big fish.

125
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,560

don't take it.

<i> Meanwhile, at the crossroads</i>

176
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,190
<i>separating Minnesota
from south Dakota,</i>

177
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,850
<i>a different kind of betrayal
was taking place.</i>

178
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,260
Yes, sir, I do think
that sounds strange.

179
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,690
<i>Mike Milligan,
the low-level enforcer</i>

180
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,160
<i>for the Kansas City mafia,
was playing a dangerous game.</i>

181
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,460
<i>Just hours earlier, he had been
targeted for execution,</i>

182
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,160
<i>but he had turned the tables
on his killers.</i>

183
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,850
Well,
they never showed up.

184
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,130
<i>And now,
in a desperate gambit...</i>

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,650
I'm on my way --
me and my man --

186
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,790
to collect
the eldest Gerhardt male.

187
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,590
<i>...he sought to
rout the Gerhardt family</i>

188
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,530
<i>once and for all.</i>

189
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,850
That's right --
Dodd Gerhardt.

190
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,680
That's what I was thinking --
grab him up,

191
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,690
see if we can't end things
this minute tonight

192
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,790
with a trade or ambush.

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,050
Well, thank you, sir.

194
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,760

Clerk's dead inside.
Car keys are gone.

225
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,430
Looks like
there's a red El dorado

226
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,680
missin' from
the parkin' lot here,

227
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,030
so you should
put out an a.P.B.

228
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,990
Sir, I'm supposed to
escort ya out of state.

229
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,000
No, son, this fella
that killed the clerk --

230
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,250
he is wanted
in conjunction with

231
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,130
a double-digit number
of homicides.

232
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,250
Yeah.
I don't know about that.

233
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,300
But captain Cheney's
real scary,

234
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,620
so I'm gonna have to ask ya
to get in your prowler

235
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,050
and I'm gonna follow ya
to the state line.

236
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,030
Dispatcher:
Car 9, come in. Over.

237
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,400
Go for schmidt.

238
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,730
I got a Minnesota state cop
on the line

239
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,200
lookin' for
sheriff Larsson.

240
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,530
Okay.
Put him through.

241
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,370
Lou: Listen,
he's in a red El dorado.

242
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,490
Who's that?

243
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,200
The Indian.

244
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,830
Shot the clerk
at the convenience store,

245
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,670
the one
who called him in.

246
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,420
Looks like our man
patched up his scissor wound

247
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,200
and, uh,
took the clerk's car.

248
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah, kid,
it's me. Uh...

249
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,570
We're headed --
what is it?

250
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,960
The motor motel.

251
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,820
We're headed to
the motor motel.

252
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,570
The plan is
to ditch the prowlers

253
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,890
and then hole up for the night
under a low profile.

254
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,270
Then, uh,
prep Ed for the sting.

255
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,890
Listen, you need to --
i got a bad feelin' here.

256
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,070
And they're --
I'm being run out of town.

257
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,120
But you need
to watch yourselves.

258
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,500
This thing ain't over.

259
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,670
Gibson:
Here. Gimme that thing.

260
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,090
Listen, trooper,

261
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,330
we appreciate your giddyup
on this thing,

262
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,000
but we're not
fresh off the boat here.

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,330
If these fellas
wanna tussle,

264
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,970
they're gonna
find out a thing or two

265
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,920
about what a Dakota man
can do.

266
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,430
Yeah, but --

267
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,970
take a seat on the bench
is what I'm sayin', junior.

268
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,620
We'll handle it
from here.

269
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,100
Over and out.

270
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,500
Jeb:
Unload the prisoners,

271
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,370
then ditch the prowlers
'round back.

272
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,560
Hank: Hey, captain?
Talk to you for a second?

273
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,390
Your man
was out of line.

274
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,030
Yes, sir.
Yeah. He, uh --

275
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,670
well,
he was havin' a feelin'.

276
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,190
This --
this mess has got us --

277
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,570
you Minnesota boys
don't got much

278
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,890
in the way of backbone,
now, do ya?

279
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,970
Well, now,
i wouldn't say that.

280
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,390
Just like to
think things through.

281
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,830
Mm.

282
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,730
Army?

283
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,500
Yes, sir.

284
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,670
Liberated France
in the great war.

285
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,520
Not single-handedly,
but I like to think

286
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,230
they couldn't have done it
without me.

287
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,300
Well, then, you know
it's the generals
that do the thinkin'

288
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,230
and everybody else
just says, "how high?"

289
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I'm not gonna debate the merits
of top-down decision makin'

290
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,530
with ya, captain.

291
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,830
'Cept to say
i had a lieutenant in the war,

292
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,530
and h-he told eisenhower
to go to hell once,

293
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,900
on account of his orders
woulda got us all killed.

294
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,130
And I send that man a card
every Christmas --

295
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,700
'cause I<i> can.</i>

296
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,400
Stay or go.

297
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,570
Makes no difference
to me.

298
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,720
But tomorrow, I'm taking
the fight to the enemy.

299
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,730
Tell Simone
to come see me.

300
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,470
I want to apologize
for yesterday.

301
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,000
She left in a hurry --
when you were took.

302
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
don't think
she's back yet.

303
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,170
Okay.

304
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,620
Sorry, missus,
but, uh...

305
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,730
What? What is it?

306
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,570
It's for your son,
ma'am.

307
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,520
Supposed to talk to him
directly.

308
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,370
It's okay.
We'll go into the barn.

309
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,620
No.

310
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,470
No secrets here.

311
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,930
Well, what is it, kid?
Spit it out.

312
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,370
Your Indian...
Is on the phone -- hanzee?

313
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,390
Says he found Dodd.

314
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,070
Is he alive?

315
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,790
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,430
They got him,
but he's breathin'.

317
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,270
Who's got him?

318
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,230
Narrator:
<i> Historians of the region
have long debated</i>

319
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,470
<i>the next two words spoken by
the Gerhardts' native man.</i>

320
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,290
<i>When exactly did he decide</i>

321
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,470
<i>to betray
the rest of his employers?</i>

322
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,090
<i>Yes, he had executed
Dodd Gerhardt in cold blood,</i>

323
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,430
<i>but at what point did he decide
to finish the job?</i>

324
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,870
<i>Was it here?</i>

325
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,370
<i>Or maybe earlier.</i>

326
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,290
All you gotta do
is be straight with us.

327
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm straight.

328
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,600
<i>It's certainly possible
that the move was spontaneous.</i>

329
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,170
<i>Who knows?</i>

330
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,990
<i>Maybe it had been
building inside of him</i>

331
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
<i>since Otto Gerhardt
took him off the street</i>

332
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,500
<i>when he was 8 years old.</i>

333
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,770
<i>Whatever the answer,
when Floyd Gerhardt asked</i>

334
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,820
<i>who it was
that was holding her son,</i>

335
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,600
<i>ohanzee dent said...</i>

336
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,770
Kansas City --
that Milligan fella.

337
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,620
It was an ambush --
luverne.

338
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,100
Butcher grabbed Dodd,
fled the state.

339
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,130
Why?

340
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,430
I tracked them
to a motel in sioux falls.

341
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,770
They got numbers,

342
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,790
but they're not expecting
anything.

343
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,630
I'll be there
in three hours.

344
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,300
No, ma'am.

345
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,000
You send bear and a dozen men,
we can bring him home.

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,170
Are you telling me
what to do?

347
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,830
No.

348
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,930
Just can't vouch
for your safety, is all.

349
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,270
Three times,
i sent men to do a job.

350
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,760
Three times,
they come back unfinished.

351
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,990
I'll handle this myself.

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,530
Yes, ma'am.

353
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,870
We'll lay waste to 'em
in the devil's hours.

354
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,300
Oh.

355
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Wranglers
and white tees.

356
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,960
Captain says we're goin'
undercover for the night.

357
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,070
Poker later, if ya feel like
losin' some money.

358
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,930
You better wear pants
this time.

359
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,070
Aww.

360
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,310
Are -- are we really
doin' the right thing here?

361
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,210
What, now?

362
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,110
Anyone want tea?

363
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,500
No, thanks, hon.

364
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,660
Officer?

365
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,610
It's "detective."

366
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,860
Sorry.

367
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,640
Didja -- tea?

368
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,370
No.

369
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,340
What do ya think?

370
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,740
When he's sleeping,
we can just...

371
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
No.

372
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,070
Unh-unh-unh-unh-unh!

373
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,440
None of that, now.

374
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,010
don't make me
separate ya.

375
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,710
Okay.

376
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,810
It's "Ben," isn't it?

377
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,660
"...jamin."
Benjamin.

378
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,610
And...You're from...

379
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,660
Sorry?

380
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,340
Fargo, north Dakota.

381
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,970
I work for chief Gibson.

382
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,510
Which one is he, again?

383
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,660
Does it matter?

384
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,140
I guess not.

385
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400

Car 18. Over.

396
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,640
Solverson.

397
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,940
Yeah, just got a courtesy call
from sioux falls p.D.

398
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,910
Say they found
constance heck

399
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,060
dead in her room
at the southnik hotel.

400
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,410
Guess she went out there
for a conference.

401
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,070
You're kiddin'.

402
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,540
No, sir.
Strangled, they said.

403
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,370
I mean, when's all this madness
gonna end?

404
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,770
I surely don't know.

405
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,340
Constance: I tried.

406
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,500
You heard.

407
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,110
Yeah?

408
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,780
Just checkin' in.

409
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,550
I got 'em.

410
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,140
Not sayin' ya don't.

411
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,340
Just want to
go over the details with them,

412
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,770
explain their rights.

413
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,010
They know.
I told them.

414
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,880
Son, I get the feeling
you don't want me to come in.

415
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,350
All things equal, pops,

416
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,700
we got a lot of swingin' dicks
around here.

417
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,010
But command's
been delegated.

418
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,110
I'm in here.
You're not.

419
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,180
Let's leave it
at that.

420
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,710
You okay in there,
Ed? Peggy?

421
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,180
Wire's secure,
and no one's the wiser.

422
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,510
We got the upstairs room bugged
and ready for the meet.

423
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,880
Okay.

424
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,280
Move quickly and with authority,
troopers.

425
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,380
That's lesson one.

426
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,380
Yes, sir.

427
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,550
Ice machine's busted.

428
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,880
What?

429
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,910
I'm just sayin'.

430
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,580
I mean, it's your show --
you made that clear --

431
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,250
which means I'm here to observe,
and what I'm observin' is...

432
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,740
Ice machine's crapped out.

433
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840
We bring this case in
tomorrow,

434
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,770
and there'll be commendations
all around.

435
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,840
From this point on,
we're radio silent.

436
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,950
Lou: Motor motel. Motor motel.
Come in.

437
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,170
Motor motel,
this is Lou Solverson.

438
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,480
They're coming.
Do you hear me? They're com--

439
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,750
When we reach the motel,
i want you with the vehicle.

440
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,400
Make sure you're safe.

441
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,210
Hanzee'll stay, too.

442
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,650
Okay.

443
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,740
I miss them all.

444
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,610
We'll be together again.

445
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,310
On high.

446
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,780
Best piss I ever took
was in a kitchen sink.

447
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,250
No wonder
you got divorced.

448
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,140
I'm an outdoor guy
myself.

449
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,040
Gibson:
It's liberatin', I think --

450
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,570
pissin' someplace
where you're not supposed ta.

451
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,650
When I was a sergeant,

452
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,140
I pissed
in my C.O.'s desk drawer

453
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,070
when he was in Hawaii.

454
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,880
I drank six coffees
and a nehi first.

455
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,380
Now,
that was a good piss.

456
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,370
Well, you got
the hardware for it.

457
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,910
If that was me, I'd-a had to
climb up on the desk.

458
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,980
Two rooms upstairs,
three down.

459
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,980
Got Dodd on the bottom
next to the office.

460
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,810
One man on guard.

461
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,810
Milligan's
on the second floor.

462
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,210
Stay with ma.

463
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,120
I like
pissin' in the pool.

464
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,110
That's just gross.

465
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,560
Yeah, but -- okay, so,
why is pissin' in the pool

466
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,750
so much worse than
pissin' in the kitchen sink?

467
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,260
Screw this.

468
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,710
Well,
first of all, son,

469
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,390
were there other people
in the pool at the time?

470
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
No!

471
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Brother?

472
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,020
Brother?

473
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,850
All clear.

474
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,680
All clear!

475
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,290
Oh, Christ.

476
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,180
It's rapid city
all over again.

477
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,140
Brother?

478
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,020
Man: They're cops!

479
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,360
Aaah!

480
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,140
Nooooo!

481
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,980
Aaaaaaaaah!

482
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,820
Narrator:<i> Then, as he killed
both friend and foe alike,</i>

483
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,490
<i>it became clear
that hanzee was on a mission</i>

484
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,510
<i>to find the beautician and
her butcher's assistant husband</i>

485
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,150
<i>and silence them
once and for all.</i>

486
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,420
<i>Again, the question of why has
puzzled historians for decades.</i>

487
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,150
<i>It's true that they had
seen him execute Dodd Gerhardt</i>

488
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,760
<i>and that they were
the only ones left</i>

489
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,550
<i>who could reveal his treachery
for what it was.</i>

490
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,410
<i>But maybe
the reason was deeper.</i>

491
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,690
Peggy:
Professional, you said.

492
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,140
Yeah.

493
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,190
Tired of this life.

494
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,040
<i>The fact that he had shown
his true self to them</i>

495
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,260
<i>in a moment of vulnerability.</i>

496
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,710
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

497
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,020
Aaaaaaaah!

498
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,050
Oh! Gotta make a break
for it, hon!

499
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,920
Are -- are --
are you seein' this?

500
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,940
It's just a flyin' saucer, Ed.
We gotta go.

501
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Hank:
Officer down!

502
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,550
I shoulda gone home
with ya.

503
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,610
Turns out I didn't go.

504
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,090
Grateful for that.

505
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,420
What the...

506
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,780
Okay, then.

507
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,610
Yeah. All right.

508
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,910
Peggy? Ed?

509
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,520
Uh...

510
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,990
On the run,
with the Indian in pursuit.

511
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,460
Go.

512
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,410
I can make it.

513
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,350
Dinner Sunday?

514
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,680
