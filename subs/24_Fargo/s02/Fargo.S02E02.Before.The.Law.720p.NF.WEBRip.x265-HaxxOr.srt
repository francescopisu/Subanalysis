Jeremy Kleiner
up in Winnipeg writes...

23
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,840
"Feel better, boss man."

24
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,330
That's nice.

25
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,970
And then, uh...

26
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,580
Carter Bunch says,
"Keep fighting, you old cuss.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,920
You'll outlive us all."

28
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,120
Indian Joe sent porn.

29
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,370
Get these to the chinaman--
the usual disbursement.

30
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,100
Get your dad and uncles.

31
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,370
We need to talk.

32
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,610
You finish your chores?

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
Yes, sir, I've been helping
grandma with the bank.

34
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,470
Uh, she sent me
to get you.

35
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,410
Wants us all together
up in the house.

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,740
Dodd's inside.

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,080
Fought in the trenches
in France-- World War I.

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,990
He was an artillerieschuetzen,
my granddad, a gunner.

39
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Blasted mustard gas
at the Allies.

40
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,430
Had them dancing
like poisoned rats.

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,560
Brits caught him in a raid,

42
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,100
hung him by his thumbs
for six days straight.

43
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,300
So this, what we're doing,
this is nothing.

44
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,440
Are you listening to me?

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,540
Is he listening to me?

46
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,980
Cut off his ears.

47
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,110
Wake him up.

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,560
He's dead, I think.

49
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,430
Weak.

50
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,590
Uh, Uncle Dodd?

51
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,270
Doc's finished.

52
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,940
Grandma wants us.

53
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,690
Who were the goons?

54
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,570
Kansas City.

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,470
They want to buy us out.

56
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,240
So they came to you,
then?

57
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,470
They came to see your father,
but he's not well.

58
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,470
So they talked to me
as his surrogate.

59
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,010
I should've been there.

60
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,870
Geez, dad.
Don't be such a baby.

61
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,140
Shut up.

62
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,020
She shouldn't be
in here.

63
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,490
She's old enough.

64
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,040
I told her to stay.

65
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,340
She's a girl.

66
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,380
And girls grow up
to be women...

67
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,520
and change boys' diapers.

68
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,900
Where's
your little brother?

69
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,200
Rye?
Haven't seen him.

70
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,590
Who knows with that kid?
Probably neck deep in some pussy.

71
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,060
With a girl, you know.

72
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,330
What's the offer?

73
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,830
He talks to you.
Where is he?

74
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,840
Said he had things to do
out of town.

75
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,620
- I saw him yesterday.
- What things?

76
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,120
What's the offer?

77
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,790
The world's becoming
more corporate--

78
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,930
this was their pitch
to me.

79
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,420
And in this new world,

80
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,930
there's no room
for family business.

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,600
So war.

82
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,160
They're offering
to buy the whole operation,

83
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,840
then pay us to run it.

84
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,410
Bottom line.

85
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,740
Bottom line-- very little
changes on the ground.

86
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,240
We may
actually earn more.

87
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,270
But instead of running it,
we report to them.

88
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,170
- To who?
- Kansas City.

89
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,380
Balls.
What'd you say?

90
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,910
I said, "Thank you very much.
I'll consult with my partners."

91
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,580
Meaning grandpa.

92
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,290
No.

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,780
The stroke.

94
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,590
Your father's not
in a lucid state.

95
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,600
Nor will he be...

96
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,500
possibly ever.

97
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,660
What are you saying?

98
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,230
I'm saying your grandpa
built this business,

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,150
but he's no longer
capable of running it.

100
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,880
We should have a moment
of silence, maybe.

101
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,950
As new boss, I say we tell
these Kansas City schvantzes

102
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,350
to go to hell
in the fast lane.

103
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,560
- Now, hold on.
- What?

104
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,890
You think
it should be you?

105
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,270
No, stupid. Mom.

106
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,640
Boss
can't be a woman.

107
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,310
Who says?

108
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,110
Think about it.

109
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,570
Mom's the one
with ties to Winnipeg.

110
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,680
History with Carter B
and the Solkerk crew.

111
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,110
Suppliers trust her.

112
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,490
Should be mom.

113
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,790
Hell, yes.
I vote for grandma.

114
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,620
Shut up.
We're not voting.

115
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm oldest.

116
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm boss.

117
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,190
End of story.

118
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,500
Give us a minute.

119
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,040
Not you.

120
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,940
Sit.

121
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,650
Eat something.

122
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,840
This moment...

123
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,380
How things go
in the next few weeks--

124
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,960
will decide--

125
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,990
- That's why I--
- Let me finish.

126
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,340
Your grandfather left the ashes
of the Weimar Republic

127
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,600
and came to this country
to build a name for himself.

128
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,680
He built an empire
from a shoe-shine box.

129
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,420
And then, and only then,

130
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,620
did he send
for your father.

131
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,420
Ma, I know the story.

132
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,960
No, you don't.

133
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,120
'Cause if you did,

134
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,690
you'd know that you are
just a small part of it.

135
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,290
That's what an empire is.

136
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,700
It's bigger
than any son or daughter.

137
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,750
Eat.

138
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm not hungry.

139
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,290
I'm your mother.
You will eat with me.

140
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,430
Your time will come.

141
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,190
It will,
but this isn't it.

142
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,000
And if you stand by me now,

143
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,580
I promise you that as soon
as this crisis is over,

144
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,440
I'll hand you your legacy,

145
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,640
and I'll turn my thoughts
to the grave.

146
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,510
Now, we need to find Rye.

147
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,150
Can you do that for me?

148
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,420
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,950
Wherever he is,
whatever he's doing,

150
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,650
bring him home.

151
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,170
If you're a betting man,
I'm saying.

152
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,640
Well, I think
history's proven people

153
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,750
of the Germanic persuasion
don't surrender easy.

154
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,850
But you can kill them.

155
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,990
Unless the woman,
being a woman--

156
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,320
maybe we can scare her.

157
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,030
No.

158
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,390
I think we cut a deal
with one of the sons.

159
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,890
The youngest maybe--
Rye.

160
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,900
The olders are--

161
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,010
Well, you know,
how a lobster's got

162
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,780
a pincher claw
and a crusher claw?

163
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,640
Which one's which?

164
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
Pardon?

165
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,980
Which son
is which claw?

166
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,890
You know what?
Forget it.

167
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,430
I don't want anything to do
with your facacta metaphor.

168
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,200
Management says acquire
the territory, we acquire it.

169
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,730
Whether that's cash down
or sending bodies to the morgue,

170
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,290
that's up to the Krauts.

171
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,600
First Gerhardt to switch sides
gets a shiny, red apple.

172
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,180
No, I know.

173
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,720
I know, uh-huh.

174
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,700
No. No, Sheriff says
it's a local matter.

175
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah.

176
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,270
Okay, then.

177
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Yeah.

178
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,340
- Papa.
- That's me.

179
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,540
- Papa!
- Did you get some sleep?

180
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,340
Oh, a couple hours.

181
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,940
You know,
went pretty late.

182
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,220
- Papa, papa!
- What? What?

183
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,570
What can I make ya?

184
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,080
Uh, eggs would be good.
Not a bother.

185
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,190
I could do oatmeal, maybe.

186
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,560
Tell me a story.

187
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,290
Something about the smell
of eggs right now...

188
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,550
Okay,
coffee's fine.

189
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,830
Uh, okay, uh...

190
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,670
Once upon a time, there was,
uh, an oyster.

191
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,900
What's an oyster?

192
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,630
- It's a shellfish.
- Fish?

193
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,740
Yeah, close enough.
Lou sleeping?

194
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,410
Uh, he had a call
with the brass.

195
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,340
Should be down soon.

196
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,540
Apparently, one of your victims
was a judge.

197
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,850
- A judge, huh?
- Uh-huh.

198
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,620
The older woman.

199
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,280
Out of North Dakota.

200
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,680
Huh.

201
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,020
Papa!

202
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,550
Hello. Yes?

203
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,960
What's the story?

204
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,460
What story?

205
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,130
About the oyster.

206
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,530
Oh, uh, yeah.

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,760
Sorry,
Lieutenant called.

208
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,560
Judge, huh?

209
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,630
- Ah, Betsy told ya?
- Yeah.

210
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,890
Yeah, a municipal judge
up in Fargo.

211
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,630
Huh.
Oh, yeah.

212
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,670
One day, the, uh...

213
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,100
The oyster got caught
in the net.

214
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,850
Fisherman pulled him up,
all set to eat him.

215
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,300
Uh, except,
he happened to have his--

216
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,870
his daughter in the boat,
and she said...

217
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,680
"Daddy, how would you feel
if I peeled

218
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,760
the roof of your house
and ate you?"

219
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,910
Was that you?

220
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,880
It was.

221
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,120
That's the story
of how your mom and me

222
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,560
came to eat hot dogs
for dinner once again.

223
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,890
Hey, so, knowing she's a judge,
that change anything?

224
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,140
Well, you know,
I guess we got to ask ourselves,

225
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,170
was this judge just in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

226
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,730
or was this whole mess
about her?

227
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,540
Gonna be late
for work, huh?

228
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,410
Oh.

229
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,990
Yeah, I don't think
I'm going in today.

230
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,830
Well, got to keep up
appearances, though, right?

231
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,490
You said.

232
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,350
Geez, hon, your eye.

233
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,820
Aw, no, it doesn't hurt.

234
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,460
It just-- it looks bad.

235
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, maybe I should
stay home, too.

236
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,030
No, you should go.

237
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,010
Just tell them you hit your head
or something.

238
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,010
I got to...

239
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,540
There's to much stuff
to do here.

240
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,470
I-I-- The car's got
to be cleaned, the floors.

241
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,480
I mean...

242
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,020
Yeah.

243
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,450
Are you with me?

244
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,490
Good.

245
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,420
Bear's thrown in with mom,
and that's his loss.

246
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,400
Distributors will stand with me
if I press, but we need Rye.

247
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,440
So, when you find him,
you bring him to me first.

248
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,560
You understand?
Not her-- me.

249
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,640
There you go.

250
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,310
Thanks.

251
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Remember to cook them
all the way through this time.

252
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,130
- Oh, thank you.
- Hey, there, Peggy.

253
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,340
- Hey.
- Expecting your husband.

254
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,620
Yeah, he had--
at dinner last night--

255
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,650
I think
it was some bad clams.

256
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,980
You know, from a can.

257
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,720
Never trust anything comes
from the sea.

258
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,050
We came from the sea.

259
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,490
Tomorrow, for sure.

260
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,090
Okay. Bye.

261
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,560
Bye.

262
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,500
A Desperado, I heard.

263
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,400
The Sheriff thinks
a pair of them gunned down

264
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,360
those poor people
at The Waffle Hut

265
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,030
one after another in cold blood.

266
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,770
I mean, first Watergate,
and now this?

267
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,550
What's the world coming to?

268
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,580
Sorry, Mrs. Colson.
The car wouldn't start.

269
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,120
I'll ditch the coat
and get your squared away, okay?

270
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,080
- Big night?
- Huh?

271
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,950
Got a hangover?

272
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,860
Oh, no, it's, uh,
just a migraine.

273
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,370
You talk to Ed?

274
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,870
Did I...

275
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,070
About the seminar--
next weekend.

276
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,230
Got us a room
at the Southnik Hotel.

277
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,910
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.

278
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,150
It's a lot of money,
and we're saving up right now

279
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,580
so Ed can buy
the butcher shop.

280
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,920
What I'm hearing is
you think your husband's

281
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,590
more important than you--
his needs.

282
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,310
No, I just...

283
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,250
We got a plan, you know?

284
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,160
The word "we" is a castle, hon,
with a moat and a drawbridge.

285
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,350
And you know what gets locked up
in castles?

286
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,520
Dragons?

287
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,190
Princesses.

288
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,330
Don't be a prisoner
of "we."

289
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,040
Take the seminar.

290
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,310
It'll give you a <i>key</i>
<i>to the castle.</i>

291
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,040
Yeah.

292
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,840
Oh, hey, you don't know what
happened to all the TP, do ya?

293
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,190
The what's that?

294
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,780
Had a case of TP
in the back last week.

295
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,250
Somebody took it.

296
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,930
Yes, sir, I know I said it
was a local matter last night,

297
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,260
but I slept on it, you know?

298
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,790
And, uh, given the level
of violence

299
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,300
and with no apparent suspects
and, uh...

300
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,590
and the fact that one
of the victims was a judge...

301
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,260
Right, in North Dakota,
which means

302
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,530
you're gonna have all kinds
of interstate issues.

303
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,530
So, my thought is,
uh, you know, all--

304
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,670
all the more reason for me...

305
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,780
Yes, sir.

306
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,270
Thank you, sir.

307
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,180
Well, I'll coordinate
with Sheriff Larsson

308
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,190
and head up to Fargo
first thing tomorrow.

309
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,090
Yep.

310
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,930
Yeah, I know.

311
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,110
We-- You said all that,
but my point...

312
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,380
What I'm trying to...

313
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,210
I've got the money, see?

314
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,510
I've got...

315
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,610
Uh... I-- I mean, I will have.

316
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,820
So you just need
to hold the Selectrics

317
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:29,520
for me until, uh...

318
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,250
So just... hold them, okay?

319
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,850
Don't...

320
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,260
And I'll call you back.

321
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,600
Hi, there.

322
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,400
Money troubles?

323
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,730
What?
Oh, no.

324
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,070
He... double-billed me
for something is all.

325
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,710
Just... straightening things out.

326
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,970
I see.

327
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,080
Yeah, we're not really open
is the thing.

328
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,290
Uh, waiting for the--
for new models to come in.

329
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,320
So closed--
temporarily.

330
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,070
That's okay.
We're not really customers.

331
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,800
Okay, well...

332
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,430
Rye Gerhardt.

333
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,310
Is that your name,
or...?

334
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,510
I mean, geez,
I-- I met the guy,

335
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,590
of course, uh,
once or..

336
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,920
twice.

337
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,880
Are ya...

338
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,480
Did you need
a character reference, or...?

339
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,620
That's good.

340
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,430
I like that--
"a character reference."

341
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,000
How about you
just tell us where he is?

342
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,930
Seeing as he works
for you and all.

343
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,140
Well, isn't that what you told
Big Jim Suggs?

344
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,640
Over at the Pig 'N Poke
yesterday.

345
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,300
Had a few drinks.

346
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,310
Told him you had a Gerhardt
in your pocket.

347
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,020
I never...

348
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,390
Ow!

349
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,850
Kids today love to talk
on the phone,

350
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,990
but I'm a big believer
in correspondence,

351
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,400
friendly or otherwise.

352
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:25,330
If you've got a complaint--
it's my motto--

353
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,340
put it in writing.

354
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,410
For instance, last week,
I bought one

355
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,580
of those new automatic
coffee makers at Sears.

356
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,510
You know,
the one with the clock inside.

357
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,270
And the thing is--
pardon my French--

358
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,780
a real piece of shit.

359
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,990
So what do I do?

360
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,990
Dear General Electric,

361
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:01,130
the coffee maker that I bought
at Sears on 11 March

362
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,680
makes a noise
when it's brewing

363
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,000
that sounds like a fat man
having a heart attack.

364
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,740
Stop!

365
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,720
And it forces me
to ask the question--

366
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,850
Is this why
our once-great nation

367
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,180
is going down the crapper?

368
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,560
Yours in peace and harmony,

369
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,490
Mike Milligan.

370
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,640
- The judge.
- Go on.

371
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,170
All I said was,
"Talk to her."

372
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,870
What judge?

373
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,170
Mundt.

374
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,710
Judge Mundt!

375
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,880
Mm.

376
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,790
"Talk to her"--
That's what you said?

377
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,800
Yeah.

378
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,970
Why?

379
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,780
What happened?

380
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,010
- There he goes. Watch him.
- Don't let him get away, man.

381
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,080
Get a rope and go hang him.

that specialist appointment
Tuesday.

405
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,440
Dad
said he'd watch Molly.

406
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,900
I'll drive ya.

407
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,270
Ya sure?

408
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,810
- Ya got the case.
- I'll drive ya.

409
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,120
We feel so special, don't we,
getting daddy for lunch.

410
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,260
Daddy!

411
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,420
Uh, Captain said wait
on going up to Fargo.

412
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,930
He needs to work out some kind
of chain-of-command BS.

413
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,090
So...

414
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,070
Hon?

415
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,870
Hon?

416
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,170
Sorry.

417
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,670
I got a wild hair.

418
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,810
Something's not adding up.

419
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,300
Stay here, okay?

420
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,670
Mm-hmm.

421
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,750
What's daddy doing?

422
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,070
Work stuff.

423
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,170
You want
to build a snowman?

424
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,880
What are you gonna call
this snowman, Molly?

425
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,440
Maybe Bob.

426
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,980
Yeah.

427
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,170
_

428
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,780
All right,
we got the bottom.

429
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,440
Next,
we need to make the body.

430
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,280
I need you to find me some
sticks for the arms.

431
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,960
- Okay?
- Yeah.

432
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,090
Thank you.

433
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,360
- Mama!
- Yeah?

434
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,930
Look what I found.

435
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,290
Can I keep it?

436
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,070
_

437
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,930
No, hon,
that's got a rip.

438
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,830
That's trash now,
okay?

439
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,350
Okay, okay.

440
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,240
Hon!

441
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,010
Look at this!

442
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,490
Look what I found.

443
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,760
Oh, that's great,
hon.

444
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,020
I just--
I found it in the bushes.

445
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,520
- Fingerprints.
- Yeah, I know. Geez.

446
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,860
I got it by the barrel.

447
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,200
What's that?

448
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,330
Well, mama's doing
daddy's job again.

449
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,610
Go, mama!

450
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,000
Oh.

451
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,280
You okay, hon?

452
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,850
Yeah,
I stood up too fast is all.

453
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,670
Help you, Officer?

454
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,110
Sir, please roll up your window.

455
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,570
My friend up front doesn't like
to talk to strangers.

456
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,010
Well,
he's gonna talk to me.

457
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,740
Rock County.

458
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,750
It's like, "What's that town
on The Flintstones?"

459
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,190
Is that where we are?

460
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,720
On The Flintstones?

461
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,660
All right, that's it.
Out of the car-- all of ya.

462
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,140
Your friends, too.

463
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,380
Come around
the driver's side here.

464
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,900
Okay...
Let me see some IDs.

465
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,630
I'm gonna reach
in my pocket.

466
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,980
Now them.

467
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,170
Mike Milligan.

468
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,370
And two named Kitchen.

469
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,680
Brothers, yeah?

470
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:07,010
Yes, sir, that's us.

471
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,920
Kansas City.

472
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,110
What's this about, Sheriff,
if I'm okay to ask?

473
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,660
Now, if I were
to search you three,

474
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,320
would I find weapons?

475
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,160
Well, sir, you have
nothing to fear from us.

476
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,310
We're just passing though town
on our way to points south.

477
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,000
Thought we'd stop
for some waffles.

478
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,540
Gale's idea.

479
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,030
Heard you had some
real good ones around here.

480
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,870
So you can imagine our surprise
when we find the place closed

481
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,910
and, apparently,
the scene of a crime.

482
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,920
What size shoes
you boys wear?

483
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,580
Now, that is
a truly odd question.

484
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,320
Last time I checked,
I was a 10.

485
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,600
Boys?

486
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,430
Now, I'm gonna go ahead
and guess the boys are an 11

487
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,570
and not a 2,
which would make them toddlers.

488
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,930
Now, unless there's
some law been broken,

489
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,270
think it's time
for us to be on our way.

490
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,780
I promised the boys' wives
I'd have them home for supper,

491
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,680
and I am, if nothing else,
a man of my word.

492
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,680
Okay.

493
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,760
I got your names
and your plate number.

494
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,700
I'm gonna radio ahead

495
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,030
and make sure
you make it out of State.

496
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,970
If not,
I'm gonna put out an APB

497
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,030
and have you boys
rounded up.

498
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,370
And then
we'll talk again.

499
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,080
You understand?

500
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,840
I do.

501
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,960
And isn't that
a minor miracle?

502
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,060
The state
of the world today

503
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,190
and the level of conflict
and misunderstanding,

504
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,170
that two men could stand
on a lonely road in winter

505
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,840
and talk calmly
and rationally...

506
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,480
while all around them,
people are losing their mind.

507
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,200
You have a nice day.

508
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,280
Good night, Noreen.

509
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,540
Okay, then.

510
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,870
Don't be silly.
I'll give ya a ride.

511
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,350
Ya sure?

512
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,050
I-I don't want
to be a bother.

513
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,180
No bother.

00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,980

00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,370
Oh, no, it's nothing.
Uh, just a dust-up.

536
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,210
Ed had a few too many last night
and hit a tree.

537
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,210
Uh, he's fine, though.
Just shook up.

538
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
What about you?

539
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,740
Me? Oh, no.
I-I wasn't-- I was home.

540
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,880
Those bills
aren't gonna pay themselves.

541
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,520
You're kind of a bad girl,
aren't you?

542
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,630
Yeah, you are.

543
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,270
I'm usually able to tell
right away,

544
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,800
but you had me fooled.

545
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,160
Oh, it's nothing.

546
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,860
I just bumped it
is all.

547
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,400
In the dust-up?

548
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,040
Thought you weren't
in the car, you said.

549
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,550
It's okay. You don't have
to tell the truth.

550
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,380
I'm not even mad
about the TP.

551
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,580
Next time, just ask,
though.

552
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,180
Or maybe
that's what you like.

553
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,950
Huh?

554
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,390
Breaking the rules.

555
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,890
Thanks for the ride,
okay?

556
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,070
I just--
I-I got a real bad headache,

557
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,640
like I said before,
and maybe I-I'll just see you

558
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,310
at work tomorrow,
okay?

559
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,530
Sleep well, now.

560
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,420
I didn't expect
you'd still be here.

561
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,480
Yeah.

562
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:06,350
Found possibly the murder weapon
over in the bushes there.

563
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,280
Betsy did, I mean,

564
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,760
if I'm being honest,
which I try to be.

565
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,020
So now I'm wondering
what else I missed.

566
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,470
Ah.

567
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,120
Anything interesting
on the car I called in?

568
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,230
Oh, those fellas
were positively fascinating.

569
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,910
Nothing actionable,
though.

570
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,750
Cook fell funny is the truth--
why I'm still here.

571
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,410
Got stuck in my head--

572
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,850
a callback.

573
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,660
I've heard it referred to once
as a convergence.

574
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,520
You know, one thing
reminds you of another.

575
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,890
Yeah.

576
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,230
Want to talk about it?

577
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,580
Not especially.

578
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,090
We had a guy on the boat,

579
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,250
liked to smoke cigars
for breakfast.

580
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,180
Picked up the habit
from his granddad, he said.

581
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,190
This was
on the Bo De river,

582
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,890
seventy... four.

583
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,400
Ah.

584
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,690
So I'm on the wheel.

585
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,030
This kid comes out.

586
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,910
'Cause what
could he have been? 19?

587
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,910
Lights his shit stick,
and then...

588
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,250
Never
even saw it coming.

589
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,010
Shot him
right through the cigar.

590
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:54,580
A one-in-a-million shot.

591
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,290
And the look on his face
when he fell--

592
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:05,070
just like the cook.

593
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,010
Bafflement.

594
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,140
Yeah.

595
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,750
This...

596
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,160
German captain
hung himself-- 1945.

597
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,320
Found him in a bunker
during the mop-up.

598
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,160
Face all purple,
eyes bugged out.

599
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,460
Then, in '62,

600
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,700
I'm responding
to a suicide.

601
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:46,400
Fella's in his bathroom,
swinging from an electric cord.

602
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,820
You never know.

603
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,020
Mm.

604
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,520
War stories.

605
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,460
Yeah.

606
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,620
Different now, though.

607
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,200
After WWII,
we went six years

608
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:10,600
without a--
without a murder here.

609
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:12,600
Six years.

610
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:17,030
And these days, well...

611
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,140
Sometimes wonder
if you boys

612
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,540
didn't bring
that war home with ya.

613
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,960
Hey.

614
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,990
Burning it
at both ends, huh?

615
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,620
Uh, y-yeah.

616
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,660
Yeah.
Double shift for me.

617
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,760
Yeah.
Hear what happened?

618
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,970
- At that Waffle Hut, yeah.
- Yeah.

619
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,630
Real mess.

620
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,040
- Yeah.
- Mm.

621
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,330
The killer still
at large, they say?

622
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,600
Yeah, we think so.

623
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,110
Anyway,
saw your light on.

624
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,920
You know, Molly loves bacon
for breakfast.

625
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,690
I seem
to remember we're out.

626
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,960
So, I thought, if you don't
mind, I'd pick some up--

627
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,260
be there
when she woke up.

628
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:16,590
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

629
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,050
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.

630
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,490
Um...

631
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,960
So, uh,
you want fat back, or...?

632
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,640
Well, lean,
if you got it.

633
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,870
- Okay.
- 1/3 of a pound.

634
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,000
Mm.

635
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,610
So, how's Peggy?

636
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:45,520
Yeah, she's, uh...
She's doing... good.

637
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,380
Yeah, doing real,
you know...

638
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,890
Work's good, she says.

639
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,930
Yeah, I think Betsy's coming
in this week for a trim,

640
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,790
which, uh... don't know
why I know that.

641
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,900
Wives.

642
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,340
They talk whether
we're listening or not.

643
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,200
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah-- Oh.

644
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,020
No, it's, uh--
it's on the house.

645
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,690
Oh, no, no.
Let me.

646
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,350
No, I-I-- I got it.

647
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,080
I got it.

648
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:33,440
You gonna get that?

649
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,930
Yeah.

650
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,240
Yeah.

651
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,450
Why is it taking so long?

652
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,750
Yeah, it's just, uh...

653
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,110
My wife.

654
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,690
- Uh, I'm almost done.
- Right.

655
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,360
Well, can ya hurry up?

656
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,960
I don't like being here
by myself.

657
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,130
Thanks.

658
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,360
Ed?

659
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:05,630
Ed?

660
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,840
Ed?

661
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,340
Yeah?

662
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:14,710
Yeah, I still got to...

663
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,510
You know, it takes time,
grinding a whole--

664
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,280
No, I-I know. I...

665
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:21,150
I just miss ya is all.

666
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,480
No, I-I miss you,
too, hon.

667
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,740
It's just--

668
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,410
I'll make
some oatmeal, okay?

669
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:28,820
And we can have breakfast
when you get home.

670
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:32,480
Okay.

671
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,920
I love ya.

672
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,670
Love you, too.

673
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,470
Bye.
