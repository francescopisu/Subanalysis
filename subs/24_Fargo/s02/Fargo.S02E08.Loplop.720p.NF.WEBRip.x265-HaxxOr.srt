my Ed did anything wrong!

It's unprovable!

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,980
Lou: There was a cleaver
in the man's head, son,

5
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,430
which Noreen said was you.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,710
Not to mention there's a war
going on up in Fargo

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,940
that you may have started

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,610

Gerhardt boy.

of this butcher.

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,600
He doesn't live through
the night.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,750
Already dead, believe me.
He just doesn't know it.

No, Peggy, hey, hey.

I'm gonna make you bleed.

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,430
Ed:
I need to find Peggy.

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,780
You're still in my custody.

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,770
Do you feel cold sometimes,

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,770
Sometimes.

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,400
Do you understand the difference
between thinking and being?

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,510
What do you mean?

44
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,910
Do you understand the difference
between thinking and being?

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,400
I --

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,750
to be
is simply to exist.

47
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,100
Try it.

48
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,650
Try simply being.

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,410
But how is sitting here

51
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,110
gonna help me be
the best person I can be?

52
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,280
Ah.

53
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,510
You want an explanation.

54
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,410
Well, kinda.

55
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,310
The human mind, aroused by
an insistence for meaning,

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,140
seeks and finds nothing
but contradiction and nonsense.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,340
Okay.

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,980
It's just practically,
I'm saying.

59
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,170
Uh, as a person,
a married person,

60
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,200
a woman who's worried

61
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,310
she's not living up
to her full potential.

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,330
Think or be.

63
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,240
You can't do both.

64
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,670
You're saying...

65
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,800
don't think about
the person I want to be.

66
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,310
Just be that person.

67
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,710
Peggy.

68
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,650
don't think about
the person I want to be.

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,000
Just be that person.

70
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,680
Just be that person.

71
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,640
Peggy.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,300
Peggy, are you okay?

73
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,810
We were just talking,

74
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,440
and -- and it all
finally makes sense.

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
This lady has lost her mind,
brother.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,030
Shut up.

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,750
She's seeing people
who are not there.

78
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,740
I said "shut up."
And here I am,
tied up for no reason,

79
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,370
a concerned citizen
just walking past,

80
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,370
and I -- and I hear
a cry for help.

81
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,570
No, you're a Gerhardt.

82
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,240
And you're shit on my shoe.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Why don't you come here
and let me wipe you off?

84
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,280
Okay. The cops are coming.
Who knows who else.

85
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,900
Okay, no time to pack.
Just the clothes on our back.

-Okay.
-Okay?

87
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,880
Okay.

no.

90
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,080
It was him.

He's the leader,
i think.

Yeah, they'll be looking

120
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,910
It's like
when you're a kid and --

121
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,280
and you need permission
to go to the washroom, and --

122
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,130
and you raise your hand and wait
for the teacher to call on you.

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,560
What are you gonna say?

183
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,450
Well...

184
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,510
You know, uh...

185
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,290
"If we give him
back to you,

186
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,380
you got to promise
we'll go unmolested."

187
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,460
What if they say no?

188
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,550
Well, then, I'll show them
which part's the flank steak.

189
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,950
Yeah, uh, it's, uh...

190
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,350
Is this
the Gerhardt headquarters?

191
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,610
Good.

192
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,960
Well, this is the butcher.

193
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,780
And, uh, i-i need to talk
to who's in charge.

194
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,590
No, not<i> your</i> butcher,
<i> the</i> butcher.

195
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,460
Yeah.

196
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,080
From luverne.

197
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,580
So, let me talk
to who's in charge.

198
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,460
I got Dodd.

199
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,750
You heard me.

200
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,150
Yeah.

201
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,780
Yeah.

202
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,980
What do you mean a message?

203
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,160
don't they --
i-i mean I got Dodd.

204
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,950
Did you tell them that?

205
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,950
Just -- just tell them
I'll call them back, okay?

206
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,090
♪♪

207
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,420
Foot's
on the other shoe now.

208
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,380
Shut up.

209
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,820
Oh, now that's just rude.

210
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,890
Come on,
for shit's sake!

211
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,590
Hey.

212
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,220
Ed'll be back any minute,
so don't get any ideas.

213
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,550
I got four daughters,
you know.

214
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,380
I'm not a bad guy.

215
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,480
You called me a whore.
I heard.

216
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,890
I swear to Christ,
when I'm free,

217
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,260
you're gonna see
the back of my hand.

218
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,160
We're gonna be spending
some time together,

219
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,910
so you need to be civil.

220
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,660
Go to hell.

221
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,460
Ow! Bitch!

222
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,910
Ohh!

223
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,320
Bitch.

224
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,590
What did I just say?!

225
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,790
You gonna be nice?

226
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,090
Yeah.

227
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,710
Okay, okay, all right!
All right!

228
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,290
Good.

229
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,110
Now, I'm making beans.
You want some beans?

230
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,960
No.

231
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,820
No what?

232
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,150
No, thank you.

233
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,880
That's better.

234
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I got to say this whole thing
has just been...

235
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
And, I mean,
I'm sorry about your brother.

236
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,220
I am,
but it was an accident.

237
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,890
And this whole thing
has just been so --

238
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,060
I mean, I'm trying
to stay positive.

239
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,510
That's one thing.

240
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,620
If you spend any time with me,
you'll see.

241
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Positive Peggy
is what they call me.

242
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,110
But this whole thing
has just been super hard on Ed.

243
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,120
He's a little more delicate,
you know?

244
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,790
I mean, he's a big guy and all,
but deep down, I mean,

245
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,390
this whole thing has just been
really hard on him.

246
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,960
And it's my fault.
I know.

247
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,810
I mean...

248
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,560
I hit the guy.

249
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,010
Your brother.

250
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,520
And I'm sorry about that.
I am.

251
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,960
And he was...Stepping out
into the road.

252
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,780
Didn't even look
where he was going.

253
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,060
No. No.

254
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,680
No.

255
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,790
And so, Ed, you know,
all he did was clean it up.

256
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,620
And then you sent
those other fellas,

257
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,690
and, I mean, what were
we supposed to do?

258
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,890
You know?

259
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,660
So, now I'm hoping --
we're both hoping --

260
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,310
that we can just
smooth this all over now

261
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,990
and everything can go
back to normal.

262
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,860
Oh, wait.

263
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,710
No, you said you didn't want
beans, didn't you?

264
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
No, it's okay.
They're good.

265
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,960
Really good,
good stuff.

266
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,710
No, i-i mean,
i should've...

267
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,190
Well...

268
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,480
Everything
that's been going on,

269
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,460
and I mean, here I am,

270
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,310
trying to actualize fully,
you know?

271
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,990
And I mean,
that's no small thing.

272
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,060
To review and reflect,
contextualize.

273
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,050
Not just keep making
past mistakes.

274
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,860
Will you listen to me
nattering on.

275
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,460
Oh, hey, hon.
We're just --

276
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,680
I made some beans.
You want some?

277
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,290
Ed:
No, that's okay.

278
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,410
What happened to him?

279
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,560
Oh, well, now,

280
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,880
we don't need to talk
about that, do we?

281
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,060
Water under the bridge.

282
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,360
Hon, did you stab
the hostage?

283
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,610
Yes.
No.

284
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,090
Yes.

285
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,850
I mean, I had to teach him
some manners is all

286
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,450
if we're gonna be
spending time together.

287
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,950
And him so angry when we're
the ones who should be angry.

288
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,880
I mean, when you get
right down to it,

289
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,120
it's our shop
that burned down.

290
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,060
Help.
Our house
we had to leave behind.

291
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,280
She's crazy.
Keep her away from me.

292
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,750
Hon.
Help.

293
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,550
Hon. Hon.
Hmm?

294
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,950
They're -- they're not
gonna want him back

295
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,380
if we --
if we cut him up too much.

296
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,960
Oh, I hardly stuck him
at all.

297
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,880
-I'm hurt real bad.
-Shut up.

298
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,460
I think
she punctured a lung.

299
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,080
How'd it go with the family?
They gonna negotiate?

300
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,610
Had to leave a message.

301
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,790
Well, you --
you said we had him.

302
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,320
Yeah, but it -- it was just like
a flunky or something,

303
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
so I said I'd call back.

304
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,460
Okay,
well, maybe there's --

305
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,080
sounds like there's a war
going on up there.

306
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,680
Maybe they're busy.

307
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,290
Yeah, but I mean, if he's such
an important guy, you know?

308
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,350
Well, hon, don't...

309
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,580
don't doubt yourself, Ed.
That was my undoing.

310
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,020
See it then be it, right?

311
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,590
So, just...Have some beans
and call back.

312
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,990
They'll be home
next time for sure.

313
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,580
Good?

314
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,390
Hon, you got to stop
stabbing him.

315
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,890
Water.

316
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,150
Did you spit in this?

317
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,820
What?

318
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,880
Tequila.

319
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,030
Pour it in front of me.

320
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,820
Here you go, chief.

321
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,260
Looking for a couple.

322
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,950
Redheaded man and a blond woman
driving a blue Lincoln.

323
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,250
White couple?

324
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,920
Didn't you guys try to start
your own country a while back?

325
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,550
Wounded knee.

326
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,080
What happened there?

327
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,060
Didn't you feel like
being Americans anymore?

328
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,020
I'm not from there.

329
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,420
Yeah.

330
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,520
See, well, I'm not sure
i want to serve alcohol

331
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,550
to a man who doesn't want
to be an American.

332
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,420
How about a man who did
three tours in Vietnam

333
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,680
who's got a purple heart
and a bronze star?

334
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,090
Who, you?

335
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,680
You're welcome.

336
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,720
- Me, oh, my, oh.

337
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,050
- Where you going, Geronimo? Huh?

338
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,980
You gonna grab
your bow and arrow there?

339
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,630
I don't think
his teepee's here.

340
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,650
No.

341
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,580
We're talking to you,
shit bird.

342
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,630
Is that a teepee?

343
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,180
Ooh.

344
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,690
What are you doing,
buddy?

345
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,960
Ooh.

346
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,950
Just wanted
a glass of water.

347
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,280
Oh, shit bird's thirsty.
Get a load of that.

348
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,130
Is he crying, Earl?
I think he's crying.

349
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,250
Huh?

350
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,750
Aah!

351
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,480
Whoa, now.
Now, hold on.

352
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,660
Aah!

353
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,680
-Aah!
-Aah!

354
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,320
Aah! Aah!

355
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,780
No, look.
I called the cop--

356
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,820
Freeze, cochise!

357
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Excuse me, your lordship.
I got to go to the John.

358
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,720
Well, i-i can't risk
untying you.

359
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,520
Not after before.

360
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,220
Yeah, but I'm gonna...Pee
in my pants in a minute here.

361
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,320
Well, that's okay,
i guess.

362
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,980
No.
Look, I'm not gonna --

363
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,660
not gonna pee in my pants
like a half-wit.

364
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,420
I got rights here.

365
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,020
Peggy: He's right, hon.

366
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,380
There's, uh, what do ya --
the Geneva convention.

367
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,160
Are we talking number one
or number two?

368
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,050
What?

369
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,820
You got to pee
or you got to poop, I'm saying?

370
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,880
Geez, kid, I got --
I'm gonna blow a sack here.

371
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,060
Hon, you're gonna have to...
Help him with his pants.

372
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,320
I'll do it.

373
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,650
-No.
-No, no.

374
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,720
No, i-I'll do it.

375
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,650
Hurry up.
Hurry up.

376
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,880
Come on.

377
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,990
Now...

378
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:08,560
I'm gonna open your drawers,
okay?

379
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,080
I can't hold it.

380
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,920
Come on.

381
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,380
Well..

382
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,820
don't --
don't pee on me.

383
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,720
I'm -- I'm
helping you out here.

384
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,750
-don't look at me.
-Yeah, I'm hel--

385
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,980
ahh!

386
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,790
Oh, sweet Jesus.

387
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,230
Ahh.

388
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,050
-Done?
-Yeah.

389
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,060
Well, okay.
Uh, I'm gonna go make the call.

390
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,980
You'll be okay?

391
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,530
Affirmative.

392
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,960
Hey, doll.

393
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,020
I got some chablis on ice.

394
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,550
♪♪

395
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,280
How you doing?

396
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,120
You know,
with a song in my heart.

397
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,720
Warm for march.

398
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,910
Yeah, has been, I guess.

399
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,910
No opinion required.
Just factual.

400
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,110
The hippies want you to believe
the planet's heating up

401
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,140
because of
my wife's hair spray.

402
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,590
Yeah.
That's, uh...

403
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,710
I don't know about that,
but...It's been warm.

404
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,710
Saw you earlier
on the phone.

405
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,410
Yeah,
down at the lake there.

406
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,440
Having a-a holiday,
i guess you'd call it.

407
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,620
No phone
at the cabin, so...

408
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,810
Wrong time of year
for a holiday.

409
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,680
Can't swim,
can't hunt.

410
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,310
Yep,
it's been pretty quiet.

411
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,540
These, too.

412
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,850
Yep,
just you and the moose.

413
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,850
Yeah.
Just us and the moose.

414
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,220
Going crazy down there,
to be honest.

415
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,810
I bet.
How about a pack of cards?

416
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,310
Just 39 cents.

417
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,470
Yeah, sure. Okay.

418
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,850
You know what?
On the house.

419
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,690
For you and the missus.

420
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,370
Well, thanks.

421
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:12,050
It is, uh,
you and the missus, yeah?

422
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,980
Say, what -- what time
do you open in the morning?

423
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,320
Usually around 7:00,

424
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,870
unless I sleep in,
which I don't.

425
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,480
Just between you and me,
if you could eat a rooster,

426
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,550
I'd have done it by now.

427
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,020
Okay, then.

428
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,110
Okay, then.

429
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,510
Stupid.

430
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,870
Stupid.

431
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,240
Hi. Hi, there.

432
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,620
I'm good, thanks.
How are you?

433
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,170
Well, fantastic.

434
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
I'm trying to reach
the southnik hotel.

435
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,180
It's in sioux falls.

436
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,320
Uh, just the front desk,
please.

437
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,440
Okay. Great.

438
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,980
Uh, hi. Um, I'm looking for
one of your guests,

439
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,850
last name heck.

440
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,920
Yeah, spelled just like that.
First name constance.

441
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,420
Okay, I'll wait.

442
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,610
Hello?

443
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,410
Oh, gosh,
did I wake you?

444
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,010
No, I'm...

445
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,970
Where are you, sweetie?
You're missing the seminar.

446
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
I know,
and I feel terrible,

447
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,080
but we're kind of
in a little trouble.

448
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,280
You and Ed?

449
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,480
Yeah.

450
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,280
Well...

451
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,750
It's a long story,
but I'm dealing with it.

452
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,220
How's it going?

453
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,840
What?
The seminar.

454
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,920
Is it amazing?

455
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,140
Oh, it's...

456
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,350
You should come.
There's still time.

457
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,080
I wish.

458
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,350
Although, I did have
kind of a breakthrough.

459
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,050
Like a-a vision, you know?

460
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,690
I can see things
a whole lot more clear now.

461
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,140
And I -- maybe I don't need it
as much anymore.

462
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,880
Well, vision's important,
but --

463
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,720
yeah, so I just wanted to call
and say thanks.

464
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,910
I know you paid
for the room and --

465
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,010
don't be silly.
The room.

466
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,310
I'm just glad you're --
and -- and maybe --

467
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,680
I mean,
where are you?

468
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,510
Maybe we could meet
for a drink.

469
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,470
You could fill me in,
tell me about your vision.

470
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,050
Oh.
No. No, no, no, no.

471
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,520
Better not.

472
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,580
I mean,
we're out in the woods here.

473
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,680
Not -- not far,
but like I said,

474
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,740
we had some trouble
and we're hiding out.

475
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,880
Ooh.
Sounds romantic.

476
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,550
No. Well, sort of.

477
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,450
Ed and me,
it's not been easy lately,

478
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,050
but we're
coming together now.

479
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,790
Working as equals,
which is --

480
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,740
-that's great, hon.
-Mm-hmm.

481
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,880
Yeah, so I should go.

482
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
Hey, you know --
you know,

483
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,790
there's all this great material
here as part of the course.

484
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,870
Workbooks and the like.

485
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,050
And since you already paid,
i got them right here.

486
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,220
Maybe I should send them
to you.

487
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,780
Oh, yeah.

488
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,440
Yeah.
Real eye-opening stuff.

489
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,920
I mean,
I've made more progress

490
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,610
since this morning
than ever maybe.

491
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,140
Tsk. Not sure how long
we'll be here is the thing.

492
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,620
Sure.

493
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,740
But, I mean, mail service
is what, three days?

494
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,220
Yeah.

495
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,410
Just -- no, no.
C-can you hold onto it for me

496
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,270
if it's not too much
of a bother?

497
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,320
It's no problem.
You said you're close.

498
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,610
I'll just --
where are you?

499
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,040
I'll jump in the car
and --

500
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,120
wait till you see
this workbook.

501
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,110
It's like a road map to
unlocking your inner go-getter.

502
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,640
We're -- I don't know
exactly where we are.

503
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,820
I think southwest,
near vermillion.

504
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,210
The lake.

505
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,840
It's a kind of cabin.

506
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,150
Well, i-I'll just --
is there a phonebook there?

507
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,790
A piece of mail?

508
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,780
I'll come over with
the workbooks and you could --

509
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,370
like I said, I made more
progress in hours than ever --

510
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,690
no, you're sweet,

511
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,840
but like I said,
we're hiding out,

512
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,380
so I'll just --

513
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,720
I'll call you
as soon as it's over, okay?

514
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,780
I'll give you a call.
Okay?

515
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,270
Yeah? But...

516
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,020
Okay, bye.

517
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,520
I tried.
You heard.

518
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,390
He's looking at us.

519
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,820
He's looking at us.

520
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,490
Hmm?

521
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,990
-Make him stop.
-Stop looking at us.

522
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,590
Where am I supposed to look?

523
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:02,760
Just close your eyes.

524
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,550
I'm not tired.

525
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,180
I don't care.

526
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,180
don't you do it.

527
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,760
don't you do it.

528
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,050
Hey.

529
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,460
Thanks, hon.

530
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,090
God damn it.

531
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,120
Man:
<i> The perfect grind every time.</i>

532
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,410
<i>And now back to
the south Dakota morning movie</i>

533
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,120
<i>"operation eagle's nest"
starring Ronald Reagan.</i>

534
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,590
Okay, I'm gonna give it
one more go

535
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,890
and not take no
for an answer.

536
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,560
Go get 'em, hon.

537
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,890
<i>We must hide.
He's coming.</i>

538
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:06,290
<i> Marie...
You must make me a promise.</i>

539
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,290
<i>If something
should happen to me --</i>

540
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,290
<i>no.</i>

541
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,220
<i>don't say it.</i>

542
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,620
<i>You must continue on
without me.</i>

543
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,220
<i>This war
is bigger than us.</i>

544
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,390
<i>No.</i>
<i>And our love.</i>

545
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,920
<i>No.</i>

546
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,120
<i>Shh.</i>

547
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,120
<i>Smoke.</i>

548
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,890
<i>He's trying
to force us out.</i>

549
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,560
<i>But we can't go out there.</i>

550
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,210
<i>If we stay here,
we burn in our own little hell.</i>

551
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,560
<i>We have no choice.</i>

552
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,510
<i>But he'll shoot us down.</i>

553
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,890
<i>Us?</i>

554
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,150
<i>No.</i>

555
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,150
<i>Pierre,
what are you suggesting?</i>

556
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,560
<i>I will be your shield.</i>

557
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,810
<i>One of us must make it
across the border.</i>

558
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,720
<i>Take that, you Nazi rat.</i>

559
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,390
<i>Come on.</i>

560
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,690
<i>Hurry!</i>

561
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,790
♪♪

562
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,220
I'm telling you
I've got your man.

563
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,590
I've got your boss man,
and you --

564
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,090
well, you know what, sir?
Uh...

565
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,710
I-i might just call over
to the other side,

566
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,360
see if they want him.

567
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,250
Thank you so much for your help.
Bye-bye.

568
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,580
Uh, Fargo, please.

569
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,040
It's the Pearl hotel.

570
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,790
Hi. Uh, I'm looking for,
uh, Mike Milligan.

571
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,110
He's, uh --
he's with a party of fellas.

572
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,320
Kind of rough types.

573
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,890
No, ma'am, I'm not a reporter.

574
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,980
He left his wallet in my store
the other day,

575
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,610
and, uh,
it's got 100 bucks in it,

576
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,450
so I thought
he might want that back.

577
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,290
Bag 'em
and drop 'em in the woods.

578
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,310
We tell the boss
the Gerhardts got 'em.

579
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,380
Hello?

580
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,950
Mike Milligan?

581
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,390
Yes.

582
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,380
Today's your lucky day,
Mike.

583
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,880
I've got Dodd Gerhardt
in the trunk of my car.

584
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,680
You want him?

585
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,540
Sir...

586
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,390
If I kiss you when we meet,
would that be inappropriate?

587
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,440
What? I don't...

588
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,160
Nothing, just...

589
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,680
Well, it's been a day.

590
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,640
But the fact is I do.
I do want him.

591
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,490
The question is,
what do you want?

592
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,480
Well, I got the whole
Gerhardt family after me,

593
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,180
and I need you
to make them stop.

594
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,880
Oh. Then I think you and i
can make a deal.

595
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,380
Well, that's good, then.

596
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,540
That's real good.

597
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,390
Uh, meet me in sioux falls
tomorrow morning, 8:00.

598
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,740
There's a motel
off the interstate here.

599
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,290
Motor motel, I think.

600
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,680
It's two stories.

601
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,540
8:00 A.M.

602
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,950
Yeah, and no funny business,
either, you hear?

603
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,190
'Cause I've killed people
before,

604
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,080
and I'm not afraid
to do it again.

605
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,250
Maybe you heard of me --
the butcher of luverne.

606
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,350
I have heard of you.

607
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:02,610
And may I say, brother,
i like your style.

608
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,650
Announcer:<i> This capacity crowd
is ready to go.</i>

609
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,590
<i>And we're getting ready
for the puck.</i>

610
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:40,620
Man: Well, like I was saying,
groundhog saw his shadow.

611
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,750
Did it seem like six more weeks
of winter to you?

612
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:50,260
Well, not that I'm complaining,
mind you.

613
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,780
I mean,
I'm just passing time here

614
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,410
till they carry me out of here
toes up.

615
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,840
Okay, then.

616
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,850
<i>And that will get a whistle
and draw a penalty.</i>

617
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,090
<i>I can't believe
they're calling a penalty.</i>

618
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,680
Looking for a redhead.

619
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,310
Well, uh

620
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,590
Not sure
i can help you there.

621
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,740
Redhead, heavyset.

622
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:31,090
Okay, well, there's a bar
a mile or so up the road.

623
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,540
You could potentially meet
a fat-type girl there.

624
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,080
I'm not looking for a girl.
I'm looking for a man.

625
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,710
Heavyset, he parts his hair
in the middle.

626
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,220
Look,
this is a family place.

627
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,820
We sell motor oil and pop

628
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,050
and, you know,
maps for tourists.

629
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,050
Get a lot of tourists?

630
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,920
Not so many, no.

631
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,720
Sometimes people
on their way to rushmore.

632
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,720
He's driving
a blue Lincoln.

633
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,890
Heavyset,
redheaded man.

634
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,250
L-look, if you're not gonna
buy something,

635
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,480
i-i think
you should leave.

636
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,150
Yeah.
You know him.

637
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,640
No.

638
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,490
Look...

639
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,740
All I know is fella comes
in here two, three times,

640
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,120
uses the phone outside.

641
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,650
Redhead?

642
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,120
Yeah.
Heavyset, like you said.

643
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,220
One time comes in
and says something like, uh...

644
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,750
Yeah.

645
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,490
"We're going crazy
down there at the lake."

646
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,710
See, this time of year,
not much to do --

647
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,090
at the lake.
Yeah.

648
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,980
We were just --

649
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,210
h-he wasn't agitated, uh,
but that's what he said.

650
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,950
"We're going crazy
down there at the lake."

651
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,920
Even bought
a pack of cards.

652
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,320
Okay.

653
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,750
<i>...shot and scores!</i>

654
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,990
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

655
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,750
Hon.

656
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,690
Hon?

657
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,020
Son, you got yourself
a woman problem.

658
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,060
How I know is

659
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,600
they've been plaguing me
my whole life.

660
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,250
What's the joke?

661
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,360
Can't live with them,
can't turn them into cat food.

662
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,460
Personally, I don't see
the value in all that talking

663
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:00,200
and the mood swings and
the lack of rational thinking,

664
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,750
which, brother, your bitch
has got that in spades.

665
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,060
See,
the male of the species

666
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,700
has got the potential
for greatness.

667
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,690
Dodd:
Look at your kings of old.

668
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,290
Napoleon,
kublai Khan, Samson.

669
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,820
Giants made
of muscle and steel.

670
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,120
But these women,
even in those Bible movies,

671
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,120
you see a Delilah
and, uh, scheherazade...

672
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,090
I want to tell you
my own private belief here.

673
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:39,320
I think Satan is a woman.

674
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,350
Think about it.

675
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,460
With her snake tongue
always undermin--

676
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,260
see?

677
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,360
What did I tell you?

678
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,160
No matter
what you do to them,

679
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,860
these goddamn twats
just won't stop

680
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,660
till you put them down.

681
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,600
Aah!

682
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,090
Aah!

683
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,850
Aah!

684
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
-Aah!
-Ohh!

685
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Ed?

686
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Ed?

687
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,650
Ed? Are you okay?

688
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,060
Are you okay? Ed?

689
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,230
Is he...

690
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,920
Is he dead?

691
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,150
I don't know.

692
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,050
Watch him, Ed.

693
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,500
Yeah,
my eyes are open now.

694
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,390
I could almost hear
Mike Milligan

695
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,490
drooling
over the phone.

696
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,150
He'll know
what to do with you.

697
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,430
Dodd: My neck.
Something -- something's wrong.

698
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,450
Ohh.

699
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,500
Step away from him now.

700
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,820
Oh, thank Christ.
Get me out of here.

701
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,620
Sit down, both of you.

702
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,150
What if we say no?

703
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,900
Just shoot 'em,
you half breed.

704
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,520
I'm hurt real bad here.

705
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:27,790
I can't feel my legs.

706
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,700
Thinking
of getting a haircut.

707
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,330
How do you...?

708
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,450
Something professional.

709
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,790
Shorter,
like on the sides and back.

710
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:53,820
Well, I mean,
you got the bone structure.

711
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,020
Jesus Christ,
you mongrel...

712
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,150
Just shoot these two

713
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,130
and get me
to a goddamn hospital.

714
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,360
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

715
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,130
Can you do it?

716
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,220
Huh?

717
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,020
Haircut.
Can you do it?

718
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,350
Look, w-we thank you
for --

719
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,230
shut up.

720
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,290
Can you do it?

721
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,090
Yeah. Yeah.

722
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:29,420
Um...Let me just, uh --

723
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,290
let me...

724
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,390
Can you...

725
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,290
Can you sit?

726
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:41,590
And...I'll go get
the scissors.

727
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,920
Ed, can you make sure --
our guest may be thirsty.

728
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,190
What?

729
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:51,420
Oh.
Uh...You want a pop?

730
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,390
No pop.

731
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,350
I said sit down.

732
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,190
Not sure
how sharp they'll be.

733
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,250
No funny tricks.

734
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,100
No.

735
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,850
I mean, you saved us.

736
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,460
And...We're grateful for that.

737
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,630
Aren't we, Ed?

738
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,650
Of course we are,
and...

739
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,030
You know, if there's anything
we could do to repay you...

740
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,630
...you just...

741
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,360
Professional, you said?

742
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,030
Yeah.

743
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,820
