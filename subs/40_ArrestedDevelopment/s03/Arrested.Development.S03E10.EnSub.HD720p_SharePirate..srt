1
00:00:00,268 --> 00:00:03,601
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,705 --> 00:00:05,696
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:07,798
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,043
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,810
<i>Michael had received a witness list...</i>

6
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:21,821
<i>for his father's upcoming trial.</i>

7
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:23,891
Who's on the list?
Any blabbers?

8
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:26,051
They've got one guy
who won't be talking.

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,652
That is, unless,
there's a hand inside of him.

10
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:31,493
Please, Michael. Even then, I wouldn't
say anything. - That's reassuring.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,851
But I was referring to
Gob's puppet Franklin.

12
00:00:32,864 --> 00:00:34,125
Yes!

13
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:36,727
- I got him in the system.
- You did this on purpose?

14
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:40,604
Oh, yeah. He is re-dyed, rested,
and ready to work.

15
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,405
Oughta be a good way to get some press.
Oh, I gotta tell Franklin.

16
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,241
- I think he meant "get Franklin."
- Am I on the list?

17
00:00:46,348 --> 00:00:48,816
<i>- We all are.
- Franklin, guess what.</i>

18
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:51,078
- But I don't know anything.
- He hasn't heard anything from me.

19
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:54,121
- I don't know anything.
- You both certainly act innocent.

20
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,190
<i>Buster knew a great deal...</i>

21
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,089
<i>for Lucille almost nightly
got drunk and told him.</i>

22
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:03,392
Your father says he wants me
to go all the way to Fallujah.

23
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:06,934
I thought he meant the sex act
that's so popular with your generation.

24
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:09,765
I know you're awake. Faker!

25
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,274
More significantly, they've put
an N. Bluth on the witness list.

26
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:18,005
I hope that doesn't stand for what I think
it stands for. Whoa! I did not say that.

27
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:20,033
You did, Gob.
Your mouth moved. Your hand didn't.

28
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:22,447
Oh. Well, I should work on that.

29
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,178
Is there an N. Bluth in the family
that we don't know about?

30
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:28,450
They say there's been money found
in an account under that name.

31
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,024
Of course not.
The prosecution is trying to test us...

32
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:33,526
see if we're gonna
turn against each other.

33
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:37,291
They make stuff up.
She doesn't exist.

34
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:39,629
Uh, yet, you refer to her as a "she."

35
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,669
- He, she... What's the difference?
- Hear! Hear!

36
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:45,706
In the dark, it all looks the same.

37
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:48,503
They're probably just taking
a shot in the darkness.

38
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,511
But the good news is that
Jan Eagleman called...

39
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,480
and she is willing
to consider our case.

40
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:57,483
- Jan Eagleman?
- She's from the Justice TV.

41
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,815
Not another media whore.

42
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,856
You know, frankly, I think I can
put together a pretty good defense.

43
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,982
Oh, no.
He thinks he's a lawyer again.

44
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,754
<i>Devotees will remember that Michael...</i>

45
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,989
<i>once played a lawyer
in a school play.</i>

46
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:16,832
You know, just because
you played a role doesn't make it real.

47
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,771
Of course, Buster did grow up
to be Captain Hook.

48
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:23,503
- Not cool, Mom.
- Oh, please. You'd be a lousy attorney.

49
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,307
The first piece of evidence against us,
you'd run for the hills.

50
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,746
No, Jan is interested.
She carries a lot of weight...

51
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,216
and she is not
charging us anything.

52
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,219
Like to see a whore that does that!

53
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:35,585
Not the "carrying the weight" part.

54
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,590
But, on the other hand,
if it's free...

55
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:41,685
She wants us to do a mock trial.
Sort of a dry run just to get us ready.

56
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:45,061
I guess we could all use some experience
in the courtroom. I'll go check her out.

57
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,397
But I'll tell you all right now,
no one is going to lie on that stand.

58
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,529
And no one is gonna
betray the family.

59
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,301
<i>Buster was nervous.</i>

60
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,606
<i>That's what all the rocking
and humming was about.</i>

61
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:00,806
<i>And Michael met with
Justice TV's Jan Eagleman...</i>

62
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,941
<i>who was currently doing
a tech rehearsal.</i>

63
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,543
<i>We're doing a tech rehearsal
for my new show... Judge Reinhold.</i>

64
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,589
It's a reality courtroom show. - You know
that there's an actor by that name, right?

65
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:11,784
This is what they put me in.
Why did I lose all the weight...

66
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,793
if they're gonna
put me in a pool cover?

67
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:17,831
- I'm sorry. Are you an actual judge?
- No. That's just a coincidence.

68
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:22,164
I read somewhere Judge Judy
made $25 million last year.

69
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,103
I'm, like, hey,
I never even heard of the guy.

70
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:28,300
So you just... You're doin' this
because your name is Judge?

71
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,072
Honestly, this is the first time
I put those two things together.

72
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:33,306
Maybe we should take "Judge"
out of the title...

73
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:36,077
<i>and go with my original title:
Mr. Reinhold's Courtroom.</i>

74
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,812
No, no, no.
We're changin' the name.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,115
Thanks, Michael.

76
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,783
I've got 250,000 talking magazine ads,
and he wants to change the name.

77
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,861
<i>My name is Judge.</i>

78
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,861
- Hear you wanna do a mock trial.
- Mmm.

79
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,760
- Yeah?
- And we can do it here on the set.

80
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,546
'Cause I'm looking for Judge Reinhold
to have a little practice too.

81
00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:55,603
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be acting as the prosecutor.

82
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,830
That way, I can see
how your family holds up.

83
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,931
Families that do well are
the ones that stick together.

84
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,310
Well, that's-that's us.

85
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,677
Um, we are going to need a defense
attorney, right, for the mock trial?

86
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:10,945
- And that's not gonna be cheap.
- You know the case. Why not you?

87
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:17,119
Yes. Yeah, give me a chance
to show my dad what I can do.

88
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:19,955
I'll-I'll-I'll show him.
I'll make a fool out of him...

89
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,689
while sticking together.

90
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:25,960
<i>- Excuse me one minute.
- And that's when Michael found out...</i>

91
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,194
<i>his brother Buster was in a coma.</i>

92
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:30,623
- What happened? How is he?
- We're waiting for the doctor.

93
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,742
I just pray it's one of
those things where he's

94
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,836
unconscious throughout
the entire trial...

95
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,470
and when it's over he wakes up
and gets a big toy.

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,810
Wait a minute.
Are you responsible for this, Mom?

97
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:44,214
Did you put one of your sons
into a coma so that he can't testify?

98
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,848
Michael, how dare you! Of course, it
crossed my mind, but this was all Buster.

99
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:53,450
- He got into your brother's pills.
- Not the Forget-Me-Nows?

100
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,428
He asked me for them. I didn't know.
I thought he was dating again.

101
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,659
Hope you don't mind me saying,
but these things can go on indefinitely.

102
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:02,361
My mother's been in that bed
for two years.

103
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,735
Oh, how awful!
We don't have a private room.

104
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,604
They won't let me take out
her feeding tube. And I'm lucky.

105
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,837
I have the resources to pay
for these medical bills.

106
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,879
You have resources?

107
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:14,368
What good is my money if
I can't bring her back?

108
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,779
But you can't.

109
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:19,183
Money should be spent on dating.
Is that what you were gonna say?

110
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:22,518
- Let's go ahead and wait outside.
- So, you come here often?

111
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,785
Cute button.

112
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,623
- How is he?
- We're still waitin' to find out.

113
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,357
I got here as soon as I could.
Oh, the red tape.

114
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,336
Looks a little bit more
like Red Prawn, Dad.

115
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:34,231
It's the shrimp fest.

116
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,859
Oh, the shrimp.

117
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,098
Do you realize Buster's probably
in this state because of you and Mom?

118
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:42,540
He's obviously afraid of what he knows,
and he's just trying to forget.

119
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:44,544
Does he know who N. Bluth is?

120
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:47,206
Right now, he doesn't know
who B. Bluth is.

121
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,443
I'm gonna need some real answers outta you,
because I've just discussed it with Jan.

122
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,512
I am going to be pretending
to be your attorney...

123
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:55,648
at the mock trial
before Judge Reinhold.

124
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:58,624
You're the lawyer? That's the same
representation Captain Hook had.

125
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,786
It's so good to laugh again.

126
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:03,796
- Oh, it feels good.
- It does.

127
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,991
They say seven minutes
heals all wounds.

128
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,161
<i>Wait. Not the Judge Reinhold show
from all those magazine ads?</i>

129
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:14,674
<i>- They're all over the place. Look at this.
- My name is Judge.</i>

130
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,801
I didn't even know that
this kind of technology existed.

131
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,402
I could use this
in my ventriloquism act.

132
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,142
There a bar here?

133
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,686
Well, Buster's in what we call
a light-to-no coma.

134
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:29,655
In layman's terms, it might be
considered a very heavy nap.

135
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,282
- Could that mean that he's faking it?
- Highly likely this is fake.

136
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:34,827
Although, there doesn't seem
to be very much brain activity.

137
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,592
No. That's him. - I think it's very
important we remember he's fully insured.

138
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,430
- I say we see how this plays out.
- Absolutely.

139
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,436
We're gonna be here every day.

140
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:47,941
I don't care if it takes from now
till the end of shrimp fest.

141
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:51,637
If this young man gets bored, we need
a lot of volunteers here at the hospital.

142
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,805
Turning over the bedridden,
changing bedpans.

143
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:56,543
- Or there's a mall across the street.
- Oh, you want excitement?

144
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,551
Well, we have a group
of young people...

145
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,144
who put on fake weddings
for our Alzheimer's patients.

146
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,622
It actually would probably look pretty good
on some college applications.

147
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:07,320
- Would I have to touch the old people?
- Only their hearts.

148
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:10,295
You could be a groom. Bring a little
girlfriend up there with you.

149
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:13,128
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Sister then, or a cousin.

150
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,725
Of course,
you're gonna have to kiss.

151
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:17,805
<i>Guess who liked that idea?</i>

152
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,594
He says he doesn't wanna do it.
I'm actually

153
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,306
trying to respect
his choices lately.

154
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,344
Great. I was just...
Well, don't answer for... I, um...

155
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:29,178
Yeah, 'cause I know exactly the cousin.
I mean, the girl.

156
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,183
I would want to give,
and she'll wanna give too.

157
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:34,652
And we'll do that together for them,
for the sake of...

158
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,156
It's a great day...

159
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,752
for being sad.

160
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:45,060
<i>And later,
Michael was preparing for his case.</i>

161
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,498
So I've got a date with the guy
with the brain-dead mom.

162
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:51,094
I mean, it's just a picket for them
to pull the plug on our loved ones.

163
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,696
Given up hope on Buster
pretty quickly there, Lindsay.

164
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,743
Listen, I know Buster.
I know what he wants.

165
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,539
Oh, I love soup.

166
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:01,945
If the only thing I could do was lay in bed
all day and eat soup, I'd be happy.

167
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,178
I wouldn't even have to taste it.
I could just take it through a tube.

168
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,312
That would actually be better,
'cause I wouldn't even burn my mouth.

169
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:12,084
Never let me die.

170
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:16,596
Yeah, he wants out. Anyway, you and I
both know he's probably just faking.

171
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,598
- Busy?
- Actually, I'm...

172
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,861
Check this out. My lips don't move.
You'll call me up to the stand.

173
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:23,334
Say something like,
"Who is this little friend?" And he'll say:

174
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:25,736
<i>- My name is Judge.
- Whose name is Judge?</i>

175
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,138
<i>- My name is... - Okay.
- That's a silly name.</i>

176
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,972
<i>- That's enough.
- Judge. My name...</i>

177
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,809
<i>- Yes, I am judging your name. It am silly.
- Is...</i>

178
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:36,110
- Please stop.
- Now you're correcting my grammar?

179
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:39,209
Gob, not gonna put Franklin on the stand.
And your lips are moving just a little bit.

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,720
- Judge.
- He's right. His name is Judge now.

181
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,257
You know, I think Dad
might actually have a case here.

182
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,758
I mean, I am concerned
about this N. Bluth.

183
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,846
But if it is indeed
just a ploy on their

184
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,854
part, then the only
bombshell they've got...

185
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:54,526
is a blueprint
of an Iraqi model home...

186
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,433
the same blueprint as ours
with no record...

187
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,438
that we actually got paid for it.

188
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,496
Although, this is strange.
Looks like there's

189
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,476
a secret room in this
one off the hallway.

190
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:05,779
I wonder if we've got that.
I'm gonna go check that out.

191
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,748
Okay, and we're gonna
go back to the hospital.

192
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:09,739
Yeah, good. Check on Buster.

193
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:12,012
We do need to stick together
as a family on this.

194
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,105
Actually, gonna go swipe
some more talking

195
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,113
magazines, but I'll make
sure to poke the head in.

196
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,522
Bye.

197
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:25,532
<i>And Michael found that
there was indeed a secret room...</i>

198
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:30,730
<i>where his father had stored the family
mementoes, including his birth certificate.</i>

199
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,772
<i>"Nichael Bluth"?</i>

200
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:36,268
Am I N. Bluth?

201
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:41,440
Is he trying to set me up?
If I'm N. Bluth, I'm going to prison.

202
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,847
<i>Nichael was worried.</i>

203
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,088
<i>Michael had just discovered
a hidden room in the model home...</i>

204
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,683
<i>where all the family secrets
were stored.</i>

205
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:58,199
My dad's trying to pin all of his crimes
on N. Bluth, and I might be N. Bluth.

206
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,326
Huh. - That's what it says
according to my birth certificate.

207
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,904
- All of our family records are up here.
- Hmm.

208
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:06,998
And for some reason, this stack
of bodybuilding magazines.

209
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:10,636
Well, I guess your dad must've
had these from way back when, huh?

210
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,873
<i>- My name is...
- That seems kind of current.</i>

211
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,143
Oh! Who am I trying to kid, Michael?

212
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:17,446
I was trying to beef up
to impress that wife of mine.

213
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:20,033
But now she's after some rich guy
who's trying to kill his mom.

214
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,852
I gotta go talk to my dad.
You comin' out?

215
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,983
No. No, I have
to fight for my wife.

216
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,925
I'm gonna keep my marriage alive.

217
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:31,560
<i>One room over, George Michael...</i>

218
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,159
<i>was also trying to convince someone
to pursue a fake marriage.</i>

219
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:38,832
We'd have to kiss. Wouldn't that be kind
of weird after what we've been through?

220
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,841
Well, that was a long time ago.

221
00:10:40,943 --> 00:10:43,377
<i>It had been two months since they'd kissed.</i>

222
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,073
Well, it does sound like
a good twist on a wedding film.

223
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:49,345
AA film? - Without the corny
"runaway bride" bit in the middle.

224
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,943
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- And so, like many people...</i>

225
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:56,115
<i>who no longer felt anything for
each other, they decided to get married.</i>

226
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:59,683
I'm N. Bluth, aren't I?
Legally, that's my real name.

227
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:03,356
You've been doing all the Iraq business
under it thinking it wouldn't be traceable.

228
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:07,334
- But it is, and I'm going down.
- For God's sakes, it's a typo, Michael.

229
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:10,633
What kind of father do you think I am?
They even got your birth date wrong.

230
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,301
- That is my birthday.
- It's close to Christmas. Was that hard?

231
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,404
It's a coincidence, Michael.
You're not N. Bluth. There is no N. Bluth.

232
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:22,973
I called Jan Eagleman about this,
and she says it sounds pretty bad.

233
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,723
You called her? She's
with the prosecution.

234
00:11:24,736 --> 00:11:26,384
Just for the mock trial.

235
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:28,889
Yeah, but what if she wasn't?

236
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:32,154
I am glad we're having this mock trial,
because it has shown me...

237
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:35,321
that you cannot be involved
in the real defense.

238
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,331
- Oh, come on.
- Why can't you be like Buster?

239
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:42,666
He put himself in a coma
to protect this family, poor kid.

240
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:45,332
- I gotta get down there now.
- Shrimp fest is over, Pop.

241
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:48,899
Really?
Better go to Chili's.

242
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:53,141
<i>Back at the hospital,
Lindsay had joined Brian in protest.</i>

243
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:55,740
All they're doing in there
is trying to keep people alive.

244
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,581
- It's a life mill.
- Oh, hello, Lindsay.

245
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:01,781
I'd like to introduce you to a friend
of mine that I met at the gym.

246
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:06,992
Hi. I'm Father Ben. - Ben is a Franciscan
who can bench-press over 200 pounds.

247
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:10,964
And he talked me into protesting too.
Show 'em your sign.

248
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:15,035
No, the other side, 'cause that...

249
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:18,163
Tobias, Brian and I believe in
the dignity of every human being.

250
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:21,539
Now, why don't we leave the fruits with
the vegetables and go get a coffee?

251
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:23,544
Do some pushups.

252
00:12:23,646 --> 00:12:26,171
<i>George Michael and Maeby
were also at the hospital...</i>

253
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:29,877
<i>putting on a wedding
for the Alzheimer's patients.</i>

254
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:33,284
And now, they are truly family.
It is permanent...

255
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,619
eternal.

256
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,488
<i>And Maeby did the thing
she had always thought was so corny...</i>

257
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,062
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

258
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:43,131
- But we're not...
- What am I doing?

259
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:45,223
<i>And ran away.</i>

260
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,234
What are we gonna do?

261
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:50,032
Just give it a minute.

262
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,736
Now it's a bar mitzvah.

263
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,973
<i>And as George Michael
acted like a boy becoming a man...</i>

264
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:02,482
<i>Michael returned to his office
to find a man acting like a boy.</i>

265
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,302
What's this?

266
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,043
Just practicing my testimony.
Fake witness box.

267
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,844
And you couldn't have
just taken my stuff off

268
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:09,556
the desk first or
unplugged my computer?

269
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:13,059
Justice is swift, Michael. Plus,
we need to be prepared for our testimony.

270
00:13:13,162 --> 00:13:17,326
You're not doing any of that "My name
is Judge" stuff on the stand, okay?

271
00:13:17,433 --> 00:13:19,003
No. They're all out of
magazines at the hospital.

272
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,596
Besides, I've got a better idea.

273
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,603
<i>Which he got at the hospital.</i>

274
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:27,404
Patient presented with gastric bacterial
infection coupled with peptic ulcers.

275
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,172
Tetracycline should not be
administered due to allergies.

276
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,543
Check this out. You'll say,
"Who's this little friend?"

277
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:35,139
And I'll say,
"Well, he's not really feeling that well."

278
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,219
And you'll say,
"Oh, what's wrong with the little guy?"

279
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,412
And he'll say...

280
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:42,184
<i>Patient presented with
gastric bacterial infection.</i>

281
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:46,694
Wow. Sounds like you
could use some try-cycling.

282
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,888
<i>Tetracycline should not be
administered due to allergies.</i>

283
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:53,264
Your lips are still moving, and...
You stole the doctor's tape recorder?

284
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,129
- Just the tape.
- I'm giving it back to him.

285
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:57,196
- Come on, Michael! - Gob...
- I need this!

286
00:13:57,306 --> 00:13:59,866
My career needs this.
You know what? Dad was right.

287
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:02,808
If you really cared about this family,
you'd be more supportive of me in this.

288
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:06,712
Gob, I'm not gonna turn
this mock trial into some kind of...

289
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,419
You were gonna say mockery.

290
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,046
I was in trouble, like,
three words into that.

291
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,279
<i>So Michael went back to the hospital...</i>

292
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:15,551
<i>when he had a visit
from the real prosecutor.</i>

293
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:18,388
Wayne, what are you doin' here?

294
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:20,894
We heard about the trial. We wanna
make a deal with you. - A deal?

295
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:23,226
- It's a mock trial.
- Read the Patriot Act.

296
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:26,199
Anything said in a mock trial
or daytime courtroom show...

297
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:29,829
can be used in any real criminal proceeding
or prime-time procedural show...

298
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,397
subject to the interpretation of the
presiding judge or the executive producer.

299
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,500
In our case, Judge Reinhold is both.

300
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:37,078
- Did he get EP?
- Sure did.

301
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,477
Good for him.
Anyway, put your dad on the stand...

302
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,607
get him talking,
and you get full immunity.

303
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:44,845
If you don't do it, we're gonna go after
N. Bluth, and we think that's you.

304
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:48,314
You're asking me to conspire against my own
client. Couldn't you go to jail for that?

305
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,779
Think about it, Michael. It
may be time to cut and run.

306
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,191
We don't do that in my family.

307
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,765
<i>Maeby had just
run away from a fake wedding...</i>

308
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:03,567
<i>that had gotten a little too real.</i>

309
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:07,337
- You know about this room too?
- Yeah, it's my dad's exercise room.

310
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:09,913
<i>Although, for all her worldliness...</i>

311
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:12,414
<i>Maeby was still
a child in many ways.</i>

312
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:15,417
Yeah, I-I come here to think myself
sometimes. But I always knock first.

313
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,386
I-I always do that. I always do that
anyway, no matter what room.

314
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,458
- So what happened back there?
- I don't know.

315
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,720
I guess I just got
a little weirded out.

316
00:15:23,828 --> 00:15:26,456
I mean, we're cousins.
It's wrong.

317
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:28,498
Well, you know, the Torah tells us
that the larger wrong...

318
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:31,090
is to put our own feelings
before the commitments we've made.

319
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,102
You know, towards the sick,
aged and gross.

320
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:35,536
<i>- That's not in the Torah.
- And, I mean, you know...</i>

321
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,631
we weren't there
for ourselves today.

322
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,336
We were there
to bring happiness to others.

323
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:46,110
And I just... I just feel now like we left
a lot of old people sad there today.

324
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,117
<i>Again, not true.</i>

325
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:57,251
I mean, you know,
I'm not saying it's not weird for me too.

326
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:59,181
I'm saying maybe we
could take those weird

327
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:01,035
feelings and turn them
into something positive.

328
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,100
<i>He really wanted that kiss.</i>

329
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,896
I mean, I guess it would be
a good way to freak out our parents.

330
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:08,301
Let's freak them out.

331
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:10,397
Hey, you guys know
about this room too, huh?

332
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:14,467
I'm just lookin' for some evidence for
my trial against Pop-Pop... for Pop-Pop.

333
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,815
I mean, seriously, Doctor,
when are we gonna know something?

334
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,943
- I'm tryin' to get on with my life.
- So is what remains of Buster.

335
00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:25,249
Dr. Farmer,
there's a problem in 302.

336
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:27,620
The patient's having a bad reaction
to the tetracycline.

337
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,592
Tetracycline?
Didn't I say not to give him that?

338
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,595
Didn't you listen to my notes?

339
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:40,496
I'm trying to get on with my life,
and you know what? You can't deal with it.

340
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:42,799
- No, I can't, Lindsay.
- You're not interested in me.

341
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:45,876
- And you're not capable of intimacy.
- Well, just fake it!

342
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:49,178
Coma.

343
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,976
<i>And, believe it or not,
that actually got through to them.</i>

344
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:57,447
Now, will you please turn on the Cartoon
Network and get the hell out of here?

345
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:59,455
<i>And the next day...</i>

346
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:02,424
<i>the mock trial began,
as did the mock episode...</i>

347
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,517
<i>of what had
now been renamed...</i>

348
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,528
<i>- Mock Trial with J. Reinhold.
- Mock Trial with J. Reinhold.</i>

349
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,031
Take one.
In five, four, three...

350
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:25,040
All rise for acting's highest honor,
Judge Reinhold!

351
00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:28,585
Judge Reinhold is neither a real judge,
nor has he received acting's highest honor.

352
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:32,551
Wow. Thank you.

353
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:36,057
That's the first time I ever got
a standing ovation before the show.

354
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,192
- They're not clapping.
- They don't in a courtroom.

355
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:42,731
Please be seated. f.

356
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,892
<i>The proceedings got under way...</i>

357
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:48,995
<i>and the Bluths set about pretending
they were a family that stays together.</i>

358
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:51,336
<i>You never heard anyone
in your family discuss plans...</i>

359
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:54,639
to either travel to Iraq
or do business there?

360
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:59,409
Well, I spend so much time
making sweet love on my wife...

361
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:03,453
that it's hard to hear anything
over the clatter of her breasts and...

362
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:05,685
- Your witness.
- I have nothing.

363
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,459
Oh, how should I know
where the money comes from?

364
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:15,863
I just know where it goes...
to taking care of my poor comatose son.

365
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:18,799
And if this were the real trial,
I'd cry here.

366
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:22,031
I'm saving my good stuff too.

367
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:24,209
I have no cross at this time.

368
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:26,303
This is why you're not
handling my real defense.

369
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,310
I have one witness, Dad,
and he'll clear everything up.

370
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,972
<i>- Gob had a little trouble.
- State your name.</i>

371
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,049
<i>My name is Judge.</i>

372
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:36,881
What kind of name is that, magazine?

373
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,820
I'm just gonna go ahead and jump
in right here. I have nothing for him.

374
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:43,955
<i>But now, it was Michael's turn.</i>

375
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:45,961
Listen, have fun out there,
because this is the last time...

376
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:47,917
you're gonna see this
side of a courtroom till

377
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,794
your second wife divorces
your freckled ass.

378
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,061
Look at that.
You just blew your wedding speech.

379
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,332
I'd like to jump right ahead
to calling a surprise witness.

380
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:58,567
- Only witnesses on the list.
- Oh, he's on the list.

381
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:02,339
I would like to call to the stand...

382
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:05,745
Franklin Delano Bluth.

383
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,478
- You're callin' Franklin, Mikey?
- I sure am, pal.

384
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:11,419
I support my brother.

385
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,590
Your Honor, this is highly unusual.

386
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, I'm very curious to see
where this is going. I'm gonna allow it.

387
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,306
But I'm warning you, Mr. Bluth,
this better make for a good promo.

388
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,637
I was approached by
the real prosecution recently...

389
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:37,043
and was asked if I would be willing
to turn on my family and save myself.

390
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,479
Would you please
press the play button...

391
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,450
on the tape recorder
inside the puppet?

392
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:45,579
<i>If you don't do it, we're gonna go
after N. Bluth, and we think that's you.</i>

393
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:48,624
<i>You're asking me to conspire
against my own client.</i>

394
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:50,785
Why do there have
to be puppets like Frank?

395
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:54,126
<i>- Think about it, Michael.
- Well, it looks like we've got a mistrial.</i>

396
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:58,327
But on the plus side,
we've also got a hung jury. Hit it!

397
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:09,406
You did good out there, Michael.

398
00:20:09,513 --> 00:20:12,393
But it's just a mock trial. Why don't
you just take it to the grand jury?

399
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:16,852
Wanted to prove to you that I could do it.
I'm going to a grand jury with that now.

400
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,979
<i>Actually, Michael had no idea...</i>

401
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,489
<i>that's what he was supposed to do.</i>

402
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:24,720
Nice job. You have a real shot. You all
stuck together, and that's what wins cases.

403
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:26,557
We don't abandon each other.

404
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:29,997
<i>- No one's closer than the Bluth family.
- They were.</i>

405
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,228
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

406
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:37,706
<i>For as it turns out, the fake priest
was called to a patient's room...</i>

407
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:41,642
<i>and Father Ben filled in,
not knowing it was fake.</i>

408
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:44,179
<i>And that's how
the kids got married.</i>

409
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,841
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

410
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:50,284
<i>Mock Trial with J. Reinhold
leads to imitators.</i>

411
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:52,287
<i>All rise. Bud Cort is now in session.</i>

412
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:58,225
Please be seated. - Hard to sit when
you got someone's hand up your ass.

413
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,229
All right, let's lose the puppet.

414
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:04,267
<i>And Michael discovers
that he wasn't N. Bluth after all.</i>

415
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:08,462
<i>I have an older sister?</i>

416
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:10,938
<i>So much for not abandoning family.</i>
