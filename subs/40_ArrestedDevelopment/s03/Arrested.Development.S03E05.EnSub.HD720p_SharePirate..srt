1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:03,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,853
<i>Michael had snuck out
of work to see a British film...</i>

6
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:23,516
<i>with his British girlfriend, Rita.</i>

7
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,650
I hate it when they hire
Yanks to play Brits.

8
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:27,353
You can always tell.

9
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,862
<i>When they came upon a toy store.</i>

10
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,957
We should get George Michael one
of these.

11
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,968
Oh, no, that-that-that's
not really him.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,766
Besides, I already got him his
big present for his birthday.

13
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:39,534
A suit!
Dad, it's a Jack Welch.

14
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,940
I want you to look
under the pants.

15
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:46,037
Quicken! Premier. Dad,
I hope you kept the receipt.

16
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:48,412
- You wanna return that?
- No, I wanna deduct it.

17
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:52,812
Come on, let's get him the train.

18
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,889
It's... Really, he would
only like it for the receipt.

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,981
And this is crazy. I-I really...

20
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,992
I can't be seeing movies in the afternoon,
then going to toy stores.

21
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:01,014
I have to work. I'm not
even supposed to be here.

22
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:04,293
<i>Michael couldn't
tear himself away.</i>

23
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:07,493
<i>- Could you?
- I can't promise it'll be fun.</i>

24
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,233
Okay, that's, uh,
that wa... that was fun.

25
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:19,541
Still, the land probably shouldn't have
given out beneath us.

26
00:01:19,648 --> 00:01:21,582
But we got a mole problem.

27
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:23,583
A mole problem?

28
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,585
Yeah, they've undermined
this whole hill.

29
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,814
We won't be able to build on it
for a few months. But it's my fault.

30
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,458
This is exactly why I should
have been coming to work.

31
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,017
The Japanese backers...

32
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:33,356
if they find out about this...
that we haven't started building...

33
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:36,659
they might not come through with
their investments. - I won't tattle.

34
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:39,928
I really fancy you.

35
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,026
I fancy you too.

36
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:46,096
<i>Michael was falling for Rita.</i>

37
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,803
<i>- Whee!
- And Rita was falling for Michael too.</i>

38
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,176
<i>But that wasn't part of the plan.</i>

39
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,715
Rita, you've dirt on your face.

40
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:57,904
It's from school.

41
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,015
I called the school,
and you weren't there.

42
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:02,113
You know, we're here to learn
things, not fall in love.

43
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:06,820
So what if I have?
I've got feelings, all right?

44
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:10,125
I'm a woman too! Not some robot
you get to tell everything to.

45
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:13,633
I'm sick of it!
I'm sick of it all!

46
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:16,363
Your instructions and your letters!

47
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:19,998
And your little missions.
And your stupid assignments.

48
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:23,407
"You do the math, Rita."
Well, no, you do the math.

49
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:25,707
- Oh, God.
- Do you remember this?

50
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,806
And the pledge that you made
when you were promised it?

51
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:32,148
- I said I'd do anything for it.
- I want him out of the picture.

52
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:34,688
- Can you do that?
- I'm a big girl.

53
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,021
<i>And Michael returned
home as well.</i>

54
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,828
- Hey, what happened to you?
- Oh, I got highlights.

55
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:49,022
It'll blend in about a week.

56
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,133
Here. Yeah, I actually
meant the collapse.

57
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,335
It probably has something to do with
the 4,000 hair plugs I had in one sitting.

58
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,502
Well, maybe you oughta
see a doctor.

59
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,638
Yeah, but he's too busy going to the gym
to see his friend Frank.

60
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:03,718
Oh, we're more than friends.
I'm kind of his spotter.

61
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:06,406
Missed a spot. Anyway,
we should be looking

62
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,017
at some big yen coming
in from the Japanese.

63
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:12,423
And when it does, I'm taking
my gym buddy out to dinner.

64
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,461
I barely even know you.

65
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,218
Who's Frank?

66
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:17,896
I've been wanting to
talk to you about that...

67
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:21,196
- but it's a little awkward.
- Oh, well.

68
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,635
I've been wanting to have
my own awkward talk as well.

69
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:27,265
I think we can be more
than just gym buddies.

70
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,179
You're blowing my mind, Frank.

71
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:33,007
I'm an agent, and I'd
like to work with you.

72
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,309
Oh. Oh!

73
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,612
Well, that is great news.
Okay, good.

74
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,244
I'm so glad you went first.
Uh, uh what agency are you with?

75
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:46,157
<i>Frank said CIA, a government agency
that was responsible for this catastrophe.</i>

76
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:51,893
<i>But Tobias thought he said CAA, a talent
agency that was responsible for this one.</i>

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,128
Frank's in the business, Michael.
He's got a big project for me.

78
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:59,264
Says it's "top secret."
He kind of looks like you. Same size.

79
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,063
Same curly hair.

80
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,775
Tobias, maybe you
should spend less time...

81
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:06,005
focused on your looks, and more time
focused on your daughter, okay?

82
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,378
Her grades are terrible.
She's gonna start getting F's.

83
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:10,474
<i>Actually, she'd
already gotten one...</i>

84
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,338
<i>as the movie she'd
released in her secret</i>

85
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:16,114
<i>life as a studio executive
was losing money.</i>

86
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:18,658
<i>But Maeby had a way to fix that.</i>

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,092
- We turn it into a ride.
- A ride.

88
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:24,427
On the studio tour.
What used to be the Hell Tunnel...

89
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,628
<i>now becomes the Tunnel
of Love, Indubitably.</i>

90
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,426
But didn't some people
die in Hell Tunnel?

91
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,138
That is an urban legend.

92
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,674
Two elderly people
got badly scalded...

93
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:39,213
when they tried to climb into the lava
cauldron, but I've got that covered.

94
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:41,282
Just like the poster!

95
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,237
Grades like those, she's
gonna be taking tickets

96
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,114
at a movie theater the
rest of her life.

97
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,383
You know what, you're one to talk.
You've completely ignored this family...

98
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,458
since that British bird
flew into your life.

99
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:54,927
No, I haven't. Well, maybe a little.
But, you know, she's amazing.

100
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,990
<i>- You know, she was in the Olympics?
- She wasn't.</i>

101
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:58,965
She's that Rita Leeds?

102
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,967
<i>- Wasn't she on the cover of Newsweek?
- No.</i>

103
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,470
<i>- Yes.
- Michael was thinking of this man.</i>

104
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:07,973
She even plays the banjo. Although,
I do have to spend more time at work.

105
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:10,237
I was at the property
the Japanese funded today.

106
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,643
The whole backside has moles.

107
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,841
That's Frank's problem too.

108
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,387
<i>Later that day, Michael went into
the office to find the rest of his family.</i>

109
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,389
Well, look who's finally gracing us
with his presence.

110
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,172
- What's the surrogate doing here?
- We're meeting with the lawyers.

111
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,525
So I've hired this guy
to be my eyes and ears.

112
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,182
<i>You know, Dad, this
guy costs us a fortune.</i>

113
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:31,758
<i>He's worth every penny.</i>

114
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,494
- Hey, I didn't say that.
- Oh, Michael.

115
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,194
- Mr. Loblaw.
- I'll catch you up.

116
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,238
- The Japanese are coming.
- They are?

117
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,865
Somebody tipped them off that
the property wasn't ready for building.

118
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:45,002
Which it would have been if Michael hadn't
been so busy with his English muffin.

119
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:46,910
- Typical.
- Delicious.

120
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,245
- I need a drink.
- I'll take an English muffin.

121
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:52,115
We'll have to be honest
with these Japanese investors.

122
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,246
They, uh, come from a culture
that values honor and respect.

123
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,351
And Godzilla!

124
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:02,123
<i>- Godzirra!
- Just sit down.</i>

125
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,596
<i>- Okay, guys.
- Godzirra!</i>

126
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:09,764
This needs to stop now!

127
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,930
Okay, this is exactly what we shouldn't do
when they show up.

128
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,031
Mom! That's enough.

129
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,610
- What? We're out of vodka.
- Sorry.

130
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,202
I thought you were doing Godzilla.

131
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,908
- Mom, that's enough.
- What? I'm laughing.

132
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:23,381
- Oh.
- Hey, maybe that's it.

133
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:26,283
Maybe we should do to the Japanese
what they do in their movies.

134
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,549
Build a miniature city.
Put it outside their window.

135
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:33,389
Tell them it's far away. It'll look real
if you squint. God knows they're squinters.

136
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:37,727
What do you think, Dad?
A whole... "Tiny Town."

137
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:41,233
- Another brilliant idea, Einstein.
- Really?

138
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,992
You like to build it with me?

139
00:06:44,005 --> 00:06:46,672
Larry really never knows
how to sell the sarcasm.

140
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:50,802
- It's a stupid idea.
- Uh. I'll build it with you, Gob.

141
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:54,313
Oh, great. That's another
brilliant idea, Steinberg.

142
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,510
I agree with Michael. If you take money
from these people under false pretenses...

143
00:06:57,619 --> 00:06:59,519
you'll be committing fraud.

144
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:01,741
The government's already
watching your father closely.

145
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,987
They're going through his mail. They want
to put your father in prison for good.

146
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,584
Yeah, Bob's right. We've got to start
thinking practically.

147
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,062
Life is not some cheesy Japanese movie...

148
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,259
where the hero pulls on
a pair of jet pants and...

149
00:07:13,368 --> 00:07:15,632
flies off the balcony like Astroboy.

150
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:21,039
And that's when George Sr. Did
a Web search for the words, "Jet pants."

151
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:22,780
Even better.

152
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:24,441
The bigger problem is,
who alerted the Japanese?

153
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,276
I think you might have a spy.
This room, or someone in it...

154
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,441
might even be wired
with a listening device.

155
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,389
You need to find
that leak and plug it.

156
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,890
Your father said that he was
set up by a British syndicate.

157
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,960
Maybe you should look
for somebody English.

158
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,497
What?

159
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,692
I think Michael's
already plugged our leak.

160
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,206
What is that supposed to mean?

161
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,634
You've been spending a
lot of time with Rita.

162
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,706
- And she's "Britishish."
- She's a spy.

163
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,607
<i>- I haven't told Rita anything.
- This was not strictly true.</i>

164
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,077
Let's start with
my family's misdemeanors...

165
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,648
and then push right on through
to the lighter treasons.

166
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,749
The Japanese backers... if they find out
that we haven't started building...

167
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,980
they might not come through
with their investments.

168
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:11,081
Then he siphoned off the entire pension
fund into a dummy corporation...

169
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:14,218
filed for bankruptcy, and used...
Do you know any other songs?

170
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,389
- She's a spy!
- Rita is not a spy, okay?

171
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,558
She's a beautiful, elegant woman.
It doesn't make any sense.

172
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,072
What doesn't make any sense
is why she's dating you.

173
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:22,500
No, that's a good point.

174
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:26,540
Actually, my sources tell me that
the leak goes by the name "Mr. F."

175
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,201
<i>Ah, Mister F. Rita's not a man.</i>

176
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,074
- As far as you know.
- And it could be an alias.

177
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,616
<i>- Alias is a show about a spy!
- All right, that's it!</i>

178
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,743
I finally find someone that I really care
about, my family tries to drive us apart.

179
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,845
It's not gonna work. So you know what?
I got a switch for you.

180
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:46,188
You guys handle this problem.
I am gonna go have some fun.

181
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:49,695
Unbelievable. Deserting the family
when we most need him.

182
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,425
- Shameful.
- Gob, I'm sending you a package.

183
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:55,025
You'll know what to do with it.

184
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,627
<i>Michael was upset, and he called Rita.</i>

185
00:08:57,739 --> 00:09:01,539
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, I've been thinking.</i>

186
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:05,670
I'm going to start working less,
and I do want to start having more fun.

187
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,975
So, I'd like to
take you out tomorrow.

188
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:10,448
<i>All day, anywhere you want.
What do you say?</i>

189
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:14,044
<i>Hell Tunnel takes another name.
Will it take another life?</i>

190
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:17,056
Oh, I say yes.

191
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,649
Only, I'm going
to take you out.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,525
<i>The next morning, Michael
was heading out for his day with Rita.</i>

193
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:28,604
- George Michael.
- Hey, I love my present, Dad.

194
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:31,639
I'd wear it to school, but who needs
a Welch wedge, right? - Yeah.

195
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,175
That's when they... - Enough business.
In fact, I got you another present.

196
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,905
It's something I saw yesterday
when I was out with Rita.

197
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:38,167
It's time for us to
start having some fun.

198
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,345
I don't know.

199
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,644
"Fun" and "Failure"
both start out the same way.

200
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:46,019
Let's just go ahead
and rip this down, huh?

201
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,921
<i>And Larry, the surrogate...</i>

202
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,363
<i>showed up to pick up the jet pack that
George Sr. Had sent to the model home.</i>

203
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,129
What is that, a train set?
Look down, Larry.

204
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:03,797
- No, not down at your feet.
- Left.

205
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:06,932
- My left, your right.
- What is the matter with this guy?

206
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:09,773
- And, let me guess, he's probably...
- Saying all that too.

207
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,475
It is a train set!
Those Japanese sites.

208
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:17,810
- I'm never gonna find my way...
- Past that hallway sensor.

209
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,016
Dad, what are you doing here?
Is this the package you sent me?

210
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:27,789
<i>Tiny Town. This is for
Tiny Town, isn't it?</i>

211
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:30,457
<i>You did like my idea,
didn't you, Dad?</i>

212
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,557
<i>I think he's in the can.</i>

213
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:35,068
<i>Actually, George Sr. Was in the kitchen...</i>

214
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:38,732
<i>trying to soothe himself
with an ice cream sandwich.</i>

215
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:46,148
<i>And that's when he discovered a way
to possibly slip by the sensors.</i>

216
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,514
If mother sees this,
she will blow a cow.

217
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:56,590
- Uh-oh.
- Dad?

218
00:10:58,427 --> 00:11:02,158
- Oh, cool, a train set.
- Oh, I've always wanted one of those.

219
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:05,564
<i>Maybe we could build
our Tiny Town together.</i>

220
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,863
<i>Do you want to, Dad?</i>

221
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,438
<i>Buster had always wanted
to do the same with Gob.</i>

222
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,873
Goody! Yeah.
I do want to.

223
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,410
Yea. I do want to. Goody.

224
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:20,448
<i>Gob was thrilled,
as was Buster.</i>

225
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,112
<i>Only Larry was disappointed. But he was
such a pro you'd never know it.</i>

226
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:27,723
<i>And back at the gym,
Tobias was finding out</i>

227
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:30,249
<i>more about the project
the agent had suggested.</i>

228
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,351
Come on! What are you gonna tell me?
What've you got for me?

229
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:36,863
The Japanese investors you told us about
are going over to your place today.

230
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:40,094
I need you there when they are.
We need you to be a mole.

231
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:43,502
Oh.
Kind of a backer's audition.

232
00:11:43,606 --> 00:11:45,904
Okay, I get it.
All right. Well then, Frank...

233
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:50,411
I shall be a bigger, hairier mole than
the one on your inner left thigh.

234
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:55,473
<i>And later, Michael and Rita were
on the Tantamount Studios tour.</i>

235
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:58,554
The thing she doesn't understand about
bovine spongiform encephalitis is...

236
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:01,088
Hold! Hold! The tram. Let's get
out of here, folks! Make some room!

237
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,057
<i>- Make some room!
- Look! It's Malcolm in the Middle!</i>

238
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,788
In the middle of shooting, I guess.

239
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,966
Oh, that's okay. It's
more important to show

240
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,060
how we make the show
than actually make it.

241
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,569
!@%$? Tantamount.

242
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,934
<i>- Hello?
- They dropped off the package you sent...</i>

243
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,939
<i>but I don't think
I'm old enough for it.</i>

244
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,963
Of course you are. I want
you to have a little fun.

245
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,909
You're not gonna break anything.

246
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:26,448
<i>But of course, Michael
thought he was talking about the train set.</i>

247
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:31,145
<i>Not the extremely dangerous jet pack
the boy had just found at the front door.</i>

248
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:33,586
- Well, what if I crash it?
- That's half the fun.

249
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:40,455
<i>And soon the tour arrived at the
Tunnel of Love, Indubitably.</i>

250
00:12:40,563 --> 00:12:43,794
<i>So take the hand of someone you love...</i>

251
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,096
<i>as we enter the Tunnel
of Love, Indubitably.</i>

252
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:49,433
<i>Nnel of Hell.</i>

253
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:53,804
<i>But Michael was happy
to hold the hand of someone he did love.</i>

254
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,275
<i>And then,
he noticed her bracelet.</i>

255
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,547
<i>Michael had just noticed that
Rita was wearing a suspicious bracelet.</i>

256
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:10,058
- What does your bracelet say?
- Nothing.

257
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:13,892
Oh, look. Look, there they are
on the bicycle made for two.

258
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:16,694
It says Mr. F, doesn't it?
Who is he?

259
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:19,133
Nobody.
I can't tell you!

260
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,228
Oh, God. He followed us.

261
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,967
<i>- But why?
- Wait a minute. You know that man?</i>

262
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:27,805
It's not what you think it is.
It's my uncle.

263
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,311
Is that Mr. F?
What does he want?

264
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,313
He wants you out of the picture.

265
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:33,645
- Bloody right I do.
- H-Hey!

266
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:37,847
- Oh!
- You lied to me, Rita!

267
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:40,480
You made me turn against my family.
But it's over now.

268
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:45,223
Oh! Me!@%s are wet.

269
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:50,399
<i>And Maeby received a call about
the latest lava cauldron accident.</i>

270
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:52,662
Already?
It's only been an hour.

271
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,001
I'm gonna lose this job. Maybe
I should let Mort take me out to dinner.

272
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:58,870
- Maeby?
- Okay, I'm definitely gonna lose this job.

273
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,342
- I can explain.
- Rita set me up. She set us all up.

274
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,676
This beautiful, funny, brilliant woman
was a spy. Everybody was right.

275
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,410
It was too good to be true.
And I... am turning her in.

276
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,440
Let me tell you something else.
I would not

277
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:11,386
want to be the next woman
who tries to fool me.

278
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:16,185
Well, that was a freebie.

279
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:19,922
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was trying to solve a mystery of his own.</i>

280
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,930
<i>The jet pack...</i>

281
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:27,368
<i>had come with an instructional DVD
that seemed to confuse more than clarify.</i>

282
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:31,931
<i>What was clear was that
the gift was extremely dangerous.</i>

283
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:44,017
<i>And it did seem like a lot of work...</i>

284
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:46,954
<i>for a little payoff.</i>

285
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:48,752
- Have fun!
- Have fun.

286
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:52,590
<i>Meanwhile, Gob was bonding with the man
he thought his father was controlling.</i>

287
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:56,632
- Almost done with the water tower.
- Neat-o.

288
00:14:56,734 --> 00:15:01,228
<i>His real father, however,
had gotten lost within the walls.</i>

289
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,238
Where the hell am I?

290
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,776
<i>He was actually somewhere between
the linen closet and the guest room.</i>

291
00:15:06,877 --> 00:15:09,072
<i>I'm really glad that we're
doing this together.</i>

292
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,639
<i>- I've never felt so close to you.
- Oh! I feel the same way.</i>

293
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:17,187
- He's crying now.
- Oh, God, look at us.

294
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:20,018
<i>We're like a couple of girls
on the last day of camp.</i>

295
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:28,192
<i>Right outside the house, Tobias was working
with the man he thought was a talent agent.</i>

296
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:31,132
- You ready?
- Oh, yes. I'm gonna be a great mole.

297
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:34,170
Check, two, three.
"Let Lilly lick Lionel's lusty leathers.

298
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,432
- Let Lilly lick Lionel's"...
- The levels are fine.

299
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,269
- All right.
- Remember, no one can know it's you.

300
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:42,141
- We need to capture George Sr.
- Capture George Sr.?

301
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:45,613
- What... Is that what you hired me to do?
- You didn't realize that?

302
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:50,210
No. But it does make perfect sense.
I have played him before.

303
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:54,951
<i>He had, in the poorly narrated
reality series, Scandalmakers.</i>

304
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,959
It's gonna be tough to work
that into the character...

305
00:15:57,061 --> 00:15:59,029
and it's going to fight
the costume I rented...

306
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:02,895
but I didn't take six weeks of improv
classes at the Groundlings for nothing.

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,300
<i>Michael was on the phone to Bob Loblaw.</i>

308
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,338
I don't even think
she's here legally, all right?

309
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,466
She's taken advantage of me.
I-I want you to take care of this.

310
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:14,976
<i>Call the CIA, do whatever you have to do.</i>

311
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:18,139
Fine, but you take care of your family.
I think they're going ahead with this hoax.

312
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:21,513
And if money changes hands,
you're all going to jail.

313
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:23,620
Well, unfortunately the
roads are out, so we

314
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,645
can't take you up there
to see it in person...

315
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:28,725
but if you stand absolutely
still right there...

316
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:32,387
and just squint in-into the light,
and behold, Sudden Hill!

317
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:35,158
Gob! Don't!

318
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:39,167
<i>It actually looked pretty
good. Even the financiers thought so.</i>

319
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,399
<i>Ishiro said, "I am reassured. And they
treat us with respect this time. ".</i>

320
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:48,069
<i>Motoyoshi said, "I thought the woman
was pretending as a monster...</i>

321
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:50,009
<i>but she was
just out of vodka. ".</i>

322
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:53,675
Let's go ahead and close the curtains, and
not accept any money while we're ahead.

323
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:58,153
So, as you can see, any rumor of
a mole problem is completely untrue.

324
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:02,715
<i>But, unfortunately, this was just as Tobias
appeared in his rented mole outfit.</i>

325
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:05,522
- I'm a mole!
- Not the village!

326
00:17:05,629 --> 00:17:08,427
Families can come... Ow! Ow!

327
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:12,866
<i>- I'm very particular about building codes.
- The water tower.</i>

328
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,201
And this water tower
does not pass muster.

329
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,864
- Lucille!
- Who can save our village?

330
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,664
<i>Michael!</i>

331
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,376
<i>As it turned out, it
was George Michael...</i>

332
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:24,379
<i>who had finally gotten
his grandfather's jet pack to work.</i>

333
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:31,045
Hard to breathe in this thing. It's
really hot. I'm sweating all over myself.

334
00:17:32,055 --> 00:17:33,623
I can't stop this thing!

335
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:37,956
<i>- You're blowing my audition!
- I ache with embarrassment.</i>

336
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:43,563
<i>The Japanese were never
to be heard from again.</i>

337
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,158
Okay, what's going on here?

338
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:50,229
Okay, that's no surprise.
George Michael?

339
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,740
Dad, I-I'm sorry. I can't
fly it very well, all right?

340
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,743
I think I would
rather have the Welch.

341
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:58,679
I didn't buy you that. I bought you the
train set, which you guys just destroyed.

342
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:01,012
Did you keep the receipt?

343
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:05,054
<i>- What is that?
- It's feedback. Is someone else wired?</i>

344
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:08,147
<i>Oh, that's me.
My friend Frank wired me.</i>

345
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:10,783
- He wanted me to be a mole.
- Our cover's blown.

346
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:14,421
Let's get out of here.

347
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:16,692
Good-bye, Tobias.

348
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,928
He wanted you to be a mole?

349
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:22,335
Oh, my God. Tobias Fünke.

350
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:26,773
You're Mr. F. Which means that man
was Rita's uncle. What have I done?

351
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,778
- I have to get this suit back.
- They destroyed our town.

352
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,781
- But they can't take away our memories.
- Oh! I've had...

353
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:36,785
<i>- the time of my life.
- I think he's being sarcastic, Gob.</i>

354
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:40,345
No, I'm not, Mother.
I mean lover.

355
00:18:40,457 --> 00:18:42,982
- I like making love to Mother.
- I mean lover!

356
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:46,221
<i>- Oh, my God. Buster, is that you?
- Yes.</i>

357
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,629
Gob, it's just I wanted
to spend some time with you.

358
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:52,793
That's all. And you enjoyed it.
You can't deny that.

359
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:55,895
<i>I guess you're right.</i>

360
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,837
<i>Maybe we should spend
more time together.</i>

361
00:18:57,941 --> 00:19:01,707
<i>- Oh, I'd really like that.
- It's weird.</i>

362
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:06,146
<i>It took some idiot parrot man with
a camera in his hat to bring us together.</i>

363
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:10,652
<i>But even a pro
like Larry has a breaking point.</i>

364
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:14,451
Rita.

365
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,994
- What do you want? I have to pack.
- Pack? Where are you going?

366
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:21,223
- Someone called the bobbies on us.
- No, no.

367
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,650
My uncle and I have to
go back to big Britain.

368
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,993
Oh, that was me, Rita.

369
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:27,161
I am so, so sorry. I didn't
know what was going on.

370
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:29,330
Why did your uncle
threaten me?

371
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,066
He thought
you might be trouble.

372
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:36,078
- That was actually very astute of him.
- Good-bye, Michael.

373
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,946
You know, I really did fancy you.
I can't stay here now.

374
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,678
- Marry me.
- What?

375
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,777
Let me marry you.

376
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:46,776
You can get a green
card, you-you can stay

377
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,688
and we can just see if
this works, you know?

378
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,158
It sounds crazy, but this
will give us a chance...

379
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:54,719
to get away from both of our families
and see if this works.

380
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:56,562
Might be fun.

381
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:02,195
- Really?
- Yes.

382
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:05,275
Yes, yes, yes!

383
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,343
But let's go right now, okay?
Before my uncle

384
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,334
gets out of the shower for
some more cigarettes.

385
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:11,471
You take that,
I gotta leave a note.

386
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:22,419
<i>But there was one piece of
intelligence that Michael didn't have.</i>

387
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:24,699
Interesting.

388
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:26,895
Don't even think about it, Jay.
She's an MRF.

389
00:20:26,997 --> 00:20:30,831
- MRF? What's that?
- Mentally retarded female.

390
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:34,927
- That explains what she's doing with him.
- And the hats.

391
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:42,341
Oh, my God!
She's gonna marry him.

392
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:45,176
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

393
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:51,016
<i>George Sr., disoriented in the walls,
almost makes contact with a new mole.</i>

394
00:20:54,424 --> 00:20:57,188
<i>Not that one. Wait for it.</i>

395
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:03,529
<i>And Michael and Rita
start a new life together.</i>

396
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:06,865
- What's that?
- A prize.

397
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,734
A lovely, lovely prize.
