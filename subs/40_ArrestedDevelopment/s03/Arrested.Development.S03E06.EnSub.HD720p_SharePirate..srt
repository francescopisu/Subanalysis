1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:03,003
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:05,505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:21,121
<i>Michael was sharing
some very important news with his parents.</i>

6
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:23,453
I am getting married.

7
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:25,958
Who the hell to?

8
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,052
Who do you think? Rita.

9
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:30,757
- Her?
- Why?

10
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,959
First, she needs a green card
to stay in the country.

11
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,205
There it is.

12
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:35,366
She needs a green card
to stay in the country...

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,735
because, secondly,
we're really crazy about each other.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,638
- You hardly know her.
- I know all the important stuff.

15
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:43,240
She was in the Olympics.

16
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:45,914
<i>She's sweet, smart, beautiful.
She's special.</i>

17
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:48,207
<i>She was special.</i>

18
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:50,136
Are houses hard to make?

19
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:51,990
Actually, the hardest
part is finding the land.

20
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:54,351
<i>But she wasn't smart.</i>

21
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:58,324
Instead of making houses,
maybe you should make land...

22
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,952
<i>- For Rita had only mentally progressed...
- On the ocean.</i>

23
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,963
<i>To the level of a first-grader.</i>

24
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,397
There's no land on the ocean.

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,060
<i>Michael might have noticed
her disability...</i>

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,900
<i>if it had not been masked
by her English accent.</i>

27
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,442
<i>- You're brilliant.
- Yeah, she wasn't.</i>

28
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:18,172
She's a really good person. Everything else
is gonna be little surprises along the way.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,305
<i>With the exception of that one big one.</i>

30
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:24,818
- The wedding is in one month.
- Oh.

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,820
- A month!
- Now, look.

32
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:30,085
Just because a woman gets pregnant,
it doesn't mean you have to marry her.

33
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,922
Too many lives have been ruined
because some cheap waitress at a HoJo...

34
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,019
said she used an IUD.

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,621
- It was Stuckey's.
- But I believed you.

36
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:40,963
She's not pregnant.
We haven't even slept together.

37
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,764
This is funny.

38
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:46,102
- He's gay!
- Where's your hand?

39
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:50,008
I'm having my high school ring put on it,
and my hook is stuck in the stair car.

40
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,381
Oh.

41
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,538
Do you think getting married
will solve your sex problem?

42
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,615
No, we don't have a problem.

43
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:02,627
We just haven't had the
right opportunity yet.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,556
Lindsay said Rita slept over.

45
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,685
Yes, but I gave her the bedroom because
I didn't want her to feel pressured.

46
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:10,959
<i>Actually, it was Michael
who felt a little pressured.</i>

47
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:12,966
I like to keep the light on.

48
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:17,004
That way, I can see
if you have a monster.

49
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,665
Night-night. Can you shut the door
on your way out?

50
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,674
I can't believe
you're not supporting this.

51
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:23,903
Because it is obvious
what she's after.

52
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,640
- Our money.
- Oh, God! Our money.

53
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:29,154
Let's all remind ourselves
we don't have any money.

54
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,583
She's already
gotten our money!

55
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,608
Let's not forget she's
the one that gave us the

56
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,554
idea for that ocean-top
town called Bluthton.

57
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:40,521
Big deal. I had that same
basic idea years ago.

58
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,831
I thought you'd be happy.
I should've known better.

59
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,599
Michael, be careful.
People just see what they want to see.

60
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:51,069
If she loved you, she'd show it.

61
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,141
<i>Michael was worried.</i>

62
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,505
<i>His mother may have
been making sense.</i>

63
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,976
<i>So he returned home
to talk to Rita.</i>

64
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,276
- Here comes the bride!
- What are you doing in a wheelchair?

65
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:04,045
No, no. It's a dolly...
to help videotape your nuptials.

66
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,781
I don't think I need any
footage of my nuptials.

67
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,689
Tobias, are you sure that this dolly isn't
related to your recent health problems?

68
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:15,229
Okay, so my legs and my left arm
occasionally "go to sleep."

69
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,525
And you want to call it
a health problem.

70
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,862
- Oop.
- Hey. Hey, hey!

71
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:21,698
I can get up myself.

72
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,931
- Here we go.
- Let me get in the dolly.

73
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,871
No, thank you.
I don't need your help.

74
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:30,176
It does seem like you've been having a lot
of trouble since the hair transplants.

75
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:34,204
- Maybe you should see a "bubaman."
- A bubaman?

76
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,580
Oh, uh, doctor.
It's a British expression.

77
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:38,778
Like they say "go up box"
instead of â€œelevator."

78
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:41,287
Like when they say "poofter"
to mean "tourist."

79
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,873
Boy, that Rita's a smarty.

80
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,381
True, but it's not like
anybody appreciates it.

81
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,222
- Mom and Dad do not like Rita.
- Are they crazy? She's amazing.

82
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,059
I saw her last night. She helped me
with this project I was doing.

83
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:52,565
<i>Maeby was struggling with a screenplay...</i>

84
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,828
<i>in her secret life as a film executive.</i>

85
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:57,769
- Is that a story?
- Not yet. It doesn't have an ending.

86
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:01,103
He's in LA. She's in Japan. How do I get
these two characters together?

87
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,269
- Maybe they could walk.
- Across the ocean?

88
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:07,280
- If it's not too deep.
- No. Deep is good.

89
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,249
People are gonna say, " What the hell
just happened? I'd better say I like it."

90
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:12,912
- 'Cause nobody wants to seem stupid.
- I like it.

91
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,751
<i>The Ocean Walker. Holy crap.
That's gonna look good on a hat.</i>

92
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:18,485
<i>And Michael caught up with his brother.</i>

93
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,084
I need a favor. As you know,
I'm gettin' married in a month.

94
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:24,597
- Say no more.
- Great. Are you sure that you know what...

95
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,465
- Yep, yep, yep. Got it.
- Super. Just so that we're both clear...

96
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,437
You want me to do a magic show
at the wedding. I'm on it.

97
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,508
I'm so glad we pushed
through that. No magic.

98
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,510
Why, because of the one
little screw-up last time?

99
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:40,308
<i>- Put her out! Put her out!
- Tracey! On fire! Roll!</i>

100
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,315
<i>Thank God we already did the pictures.</i>

101
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:46,012
Which reminds me that Rita shouldn't
wear any hair spray at this thing.

102
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,851
- I just want you to be my witness.
- You want me to...

103
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,287
be your best man?

104
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:55,022
It's just a signature
I need on the license.

105
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,462
My son's not old enough.
It's... It's no big deal.

106
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,999
I will not take
this sacred duty lightly.

107
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:05,505
I am gonna get you the single healthiest
call girl that this town has ever seen.

108
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,808
This is why I'm calling it a witness
and not a best man.

109
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,902
All you gotta do is watch.

110
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,411
I'm not gonna spend
this kind of money and not watch.

111
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:14,744
This may have been a bad choice.

112
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:19,251
Hey, hello. Look at you two...
Tweedledee, Tweedledum.

113
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:21,345
<i>Michael didn't mean it in that way.</i>

114
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,981
<i>How could he?
He didn't even know.</i>

115
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:27,152
We had the best time.
She's got such an amazing fashion sense.

116
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:30,182
- You guys got these jackets on inside-out?
- That way, you see the label.

117
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,894
That's what you're paying for, right?
It's a great statement on fashion.

118
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,563
Plus it doesn't tickle your neck.

119
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,971
<i>Michael took Lindsay aside
to share his concerns.</i>

120
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:44,170
Lindsay, when did you first realize
that you and Tobias...

121
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,179
had no chance
at a physical relationship?

122
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:49,512
Oh, my God. Do you think we have no chance
at a physical relationship?

123
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:53,917
So, just now. See, Rita and I
have not been physical yet, and...

124
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,513
You don't think she's doing this
just for a green card, do you?

125
00:05:56,624 --> 00:06:00,560
No. She's not that kind of person.
You just haven't been alone with her.

126
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:03,460
Ask her to stay over
at a hotel with you tonight.

127
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:06,193
- She's gonna know what that means.
- That is not a bad idea.

128
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:09,099
Don't... Don't do that.

129
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:12,469
<i>And Gob began to prepare
a magic trick for Michael's wedding.</i>

130
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:15,543
Takes his queen...

131
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,168
and showers her with diamonds!

132
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,839
Clubs. Club sauce.

133
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,383
He covers her with club sauce.

134
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,385
That'll be my line
if that happens.

135
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:28,081
Is that a magic trick?
I love magic.

136
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,817
I don't appreciate
the dry British humor.

137
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:36,227
Please do a magic trick for me.

138
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,357
Well, I shouldn't.
I'd hate to be blamed...

139
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:42,994
for setting another one
of Michael's brides... on fire!

140
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,407
Oh. Lighter fluid,
like Uncle Trevor uses.

141
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:49,068
But wherever did it come from?

142
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:52,305
Okay, I've gotta get you
into an illusion at the wedding.

143
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:55,508
- How long can you hold your breath?
- Oh, long. One time, 20 minutes.

144
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,950
<i>Actually, her record was 20 seconds.</i>

145
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,851
You can stop it. It's okay.
I'm gonna take your word for it.

146
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:05,187
Now I just need to find a trick that
puts you out of oxygen for 20 minutes.

147
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,888
Sorry? Did I hear the word "trick"? And it
smells a lot like lighter fluid in here.

148
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:10,988
I did say no tricks, Gob,
and I mean it.

149
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,432
What if I find a trick that has her
float to the altar or something?

150
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,504
No, no. Love for her to walk
and not to drown...

151
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,129
or fly through the air
or catch on fire.

152
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,970
- Is she allergic to cat fur?
- Uh, no tigers.

153
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,976
Great.

154
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,410
So, uh, Rita, um...

155
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:29,176
I was wondering
if maybe you and I...

156
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,718
might head down to a hotel?

157
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,051
- Maybe some alone time.
- Oh, yes.

158
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,784
- Yeah?
- Maybe our rooms could touch.

159
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,693
I... I was hoping maybe for more
than just our rooms to touch.

160
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,322
I was thinking maybe
we could be...

161
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:49,494
in the same room,
be in the same bed.

162
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:53,301
I see what you mean...
a real sleepover.

163
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,239
- Well, maybe.
- Okay.

164
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,834
- Really?
- Maybe I should go home and get my things.

165
00:07:57,946 --> 00:07:59,846
I do kinda miss my jammies.

166
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:02,028
I think they're gonna have
a lot of that stuff there.

167
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,210
And my tiny teddy.

168
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,811
Good. Yes, get that.

169
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,823
<i>And so George Michael
drove Rita to Wee Britain.</i>

170
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:13,519
It's nice to be
with someone young.

171
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:16,324
We can listen to young people's music
for a change.

172
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:18,399
Great. Yeah, please.

173
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,373
<i>That's when he first grew concerned.</i>

174
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:32,605
<i>And Rita packed for her sleepover.</i>

175
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:36,047
Do you have any idea what a sleepover is?
'Cause it's not just sleep.

176
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,517
I know what it is, Trevor.
I've seen your secret magazine.

177
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,021
I want to have grown-up fun...
spoon and figgy pudding...

178
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:48,527
rabbit down dum,
druggeries hollow.

179
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,530
And I want to have pop-pop.

180
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:53,260
The very fact that you call it that
tells me you're not ready.

181
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,895
And for your information,
that's a cricket magazine.

182
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,247
Whether you like it or not,
you're still a child in many ways.

183
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,438
I got a problem with you having
sexual relations with that man.

184
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:06,917
<i>So do I.</i>

185
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,311
<i>It's not your fault your
parents were cousins.</i>

186
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,754
But here we are, and I've
been charged with taking

187
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,115
care of you, and I'm
bloody well gonna do it.

188
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:17,658
Well, Michael will be my cousin soon
enough, 'cause we're getting married.

189
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,317
- Married?
- Married!

190
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:22,555
- Totally out of the question!
- Married, married, married!

191
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,859
All right, that does it.
You're not going anywhere.

192
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,353
I'm puttin' the invisible
locks on the door.

193
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,764
That's not fair.

194
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:29,928
- Lock, lock.
- It's not fair!

195
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,006
- It's just not fair!
- Lock, lock.

196
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,275
I gotta find a new hiding place
for that magazine.

197
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:38,845
<i>And Michael was waiting at the hotel.</i>

198
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:41,211
Hey, Dad. Just wanted
to let you know...

199
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:44,046
that I'm at a hotel
with my wife-to-be.

200
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:48,248
- And we're very, very much in love.
- Put her on.

201
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:50,324
<i>Michael briefly considered
faking the voice.</i>

202
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:52,315
<i>I...</i>

203
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,361
- She's in the shower.
- I'll wait.

204
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,430
Let's wait.

205
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,268
Don't you want me
to just call you back or...

206
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,964
No. I got nowhere to go.
I'm under house arrest.

207
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:07,098
Let's watch something together.

208
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,435
Wow. That Blossom grew up, huh?

209
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:13,514
<i>Say, how's that shower comin'?</i>

210
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:15,776
- All right, look, she's not in the shower.
- Really?

211
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:17,783
She said that she'd
meet me at the hotel.

212
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,377
I called you a little prematurely,
but she is coming. - Really?

213
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,986
Uh! Hey, put Rita on.

214
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:31,122
<i>That's when Michael finally accepted...</i>

215
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,167
<i>that Rita wasn't coming...</i>

216
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,362
<i>and that local calls
were 2.95 a minute.</i>

217
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,771
<i>- Come on!
- That's where they get you.</i>

218
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,540
<i>Michael drove to Wee Britain
to call off the wedding...</i>

219
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,346
<i>that he now realized was not based on love.</i>

220
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:52,250
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Michael, Rita. Can I come in?</i>

221
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:55,324
<i>- I can't let you in.
- You didn't show up last night.</i>

222
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:57,893
The least you can do
is talk to me face-to-face.

223
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,258
<i>I can't.
Trevor locked the door.</i>

224
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,797
<i>He doesn't want me to be with you.</i>

225
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,163
What? He locked the door?
You can't unlock this door?

226
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:08,499
<i>- I can't even see half the locks.
- Rita? What?</i>

227
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:11,768
<i>They're invisible.
Trevor's the only one who can see them.</i>

228
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,844
I've got an idea. Go next to the window.
I'm gonna climb up.

229
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:19,542
- Be careful.
- I will.

230
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:25,744
<i>And so Michael set about
rescuing the beautiful...</i>

231
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:29,222
<i>sweet, mentally challenged
woman he'd fallen in love with...</i>

232
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:32,817
<i>without realizing
she was mentally challenged.</i>

233
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:35,329
<i>- Yea, Michael! Yea!
- Who undid the locks?</i>

234
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:37,366
- Come on out.
- Trevor's back.

235
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,992
- Come on. Hop on.
- What?

236
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,832
- Hop on.
- Huh?

237
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:46,068
- Ready?
- Oh! Oh!

238
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:48,144
Whee! Oh!

239
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:51,111
Hey! Stop that!
The both of ya come back!

240
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:54,240
- You can't stop us.
- Nothing can stop us now.

241
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,186
Nothing in the world of man nor
beast nor time can...

242
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,453
!@%$ all!

243
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,587
<i>Reunited with Rita, Michael told his
parents he'd be getting married tomorrow.</i>

244
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:09,517
We're getting
married tomorrow.

245
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,360
God help her if she
tries to rename Bluthton.

246
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:14,096
I'll sink it first. I swear,
I'll sink the whole damn thing.

247
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:16,866
They're goin' through with it... tomorrow.

248
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:20,841
<i>But George and Lucille
had a surprise visitor.</i>

249
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:22,969
All right!
Where the hell is Rita?

250
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:25,513
- I'm her uncle.
- Let the handouts begin.

251
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:28,812
There's not gonna be any handouts,
and she is not gonna marry your son.

252
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,443
- You're against this marriage too.
- Well, of course I am.

253
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:34,284
Rita's not capable of makin'
a decision like that.

254
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,655
You are not gonna get Rita's millions
just because she's mentally challenged.

255
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:40,059
- Millions?
- Millions?

256
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:43,326
- Mentally challenged?
- Shh! It's not polite.

257
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:47,233
She owns all of Wee Britain
and also the Wee Britain in Cleveland.

258
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,362
'Course, we're probably
gonna lose all that...

259
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:52,168
if her ridiculous idea
for Sea Britain goes through.

260
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,744
We are not after her money.

261
00:12:55,845 --> 00:13:00,475
And I don't think Michael
even knows about her... condition.

262
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,483
It's funny how Americans
don't pick up on that.

263
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:06,316
I think it's 'cause of her accent and the
plastic surgery she's been able to afford.

264
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,982
We wouldn't have this trouble
if they'd met last year.

265
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,355
I gotta put a stop to this. I'm gonna
search every bloody hotel in town.

266
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,864
Oh! Legoland.
I think they said...

267
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,934
- they were going to Legoland.
- They did say Legoland.

268
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,900
I didn't hear anything
about Legoland.

269
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:23,734
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

270
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,400
We think he may be mentally challenged.

271
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,534
- Huh?
- All right then.

272
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,944
We have got 24 hours to get them married...

273
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:35,176
before Michael figures out
what she really is.

274
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:40,382
This is the first time in two years
you sound like George Bluth.

275
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:47,122
<i>Later that night, Michael
was at the hotel with his bride-to-be.</i>

276
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,919
Rita, I've been really
looking forward to this.

277
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:50,631
Me too.

278
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:55,033
I want to have sexual relations.

279
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:58,198
The mere fact that you call it that
tells me that you are ready.

280
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:00,674
<i>- That's why I brought this.
- Oh!</i>

281
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,211
You go ahead and whip
out that tiny teddy...

282
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:05,873
and then we're gonna think up
a fun safe word.

283
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:09,213
George Michael,
I did not know that you were...

284
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,914
Um, go ahead and talk out here.

285
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:15,923
Just got back
from the "bumpaddle" courts.

286
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,959
Tomorrow, I'm teachin' her baseball.

287
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,926
- It might take a while.
- Sorry?

288
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:22,395
Listen, Dad, th-this is... hard...

289
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,659
This is hard for me to say.

290
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,269
I was videotaping Rita.
Let's just say it

291
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,795
would be cute if it was
someone much younger.

292
00:14:31,908 --> 00:14:35,002
I'm sorry. Maybe I should get another tape.
They're not expensive.

293
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:41,249
That's the plastic fruit, Dad.

294
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:44,980
It's very convincing fruit. Okay?

295
00:14:45,088 --> 00:14:49,354
And... She's goin'
back in for another?

296
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:53,361
You know, they don't even have bananas
in England. Okay, Son?

297
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,795
Now, I know this is hard for you...

298
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,630
but it would be nice
to be supported in some...

299
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:01,704
Now she's goin' into the grapes.

300
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:04,170
Yeah. She really liked those.

301
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:06,538
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:10,511
I think she might be...
retar-retarded.

303
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:15,479
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

304
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:22,654
Say hello to my tiny teddy.

305
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,855
Tiny Teddy? Oh!

306
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,227
<i>And that's when it dawned on Michael.</i>

307
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:32,130
- Oh, you teach kids, huh?
- I like to think they teach me.

308
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:35,794
That way I can see
if you have a monster.

309
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:40,572
Be careful.

310
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,917
I have made a huge mistake.

311
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,388
<i>Michael had just been shown...</i>

312
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:01,465
<i>that his fiancÃ©e
might be mentally challenged.</i>

313
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:04,262
<i>So, - But he needed proof. - Are you
ready for lie-down kisses with me?</i>

314
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:06,633
Maybe we oughta just talk a little bit.

315
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:09,673
I mean, what the heck?
For instance, you've never told me...

316
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:12,265
how many houses there are
in the British Parliament.

317
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:14,675
- Seven.
- Are there?

318
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,509
<i>- The answer is three.
- Does sound about right.</i>

319
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,708
<i>Three is the correct answer.</i>

320
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:22,582
- Rita... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on. Let's have our fun!

321
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:26,145
Rita corny Michael.

322
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:29,283
<i>So Michael used a line
that was just as corny.</i>

323
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,885
You know,
I think that we should wait...

324
00:16:31,997 --> 00:16:34,261
until after we're married.

325
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,299
Married!
Married, married, married!

326
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,702
Okay! Night-night!

327
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:46,539
<i>And Michael felt he deserved
a $15 thing of candy beans.</i>

328
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,342
<i>The next morning, however, as Michael
prepared to let Rita down gently...</i>

329
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:57,921
<i>- he was met with another surprise.
- Surprise!</i>

330
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,651
- What's this?
- We're throwing you a wedding.

331
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:04,889
- Oh, how lovely!
- On us.

332
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:07,726
Everything you see.
Show him the waffle bar, Larry.

333
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:10,562
- It's over there.
- And check out banner, Michael.

334
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:13,432
I'm gonna go set up.

335
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:16,166
I was just gonna talk to Rita
about all of this.

336
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:20,904
Rita, I think that we should, um,
wait a little while.

337
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:23,412
Wait? Why?
I don't wanna wait.

338
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:29,181
I want to get married and have
sexual relations like you promised.

339
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,984
Where did you get this firecracker?
I love her, Michael.

340
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:35,616
So do I. I wanna kiss
my new daughter-in-law.

341
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:38,321
- Hey, not on our time, Larry.
- Right on the lips.

342
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,267
No, no. Please, take it easy.

343
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm gonna get my dress from the...
from the room.

344
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:44,428
Yes. I'll help you
put it on inside-out.

345
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:47,403
Let's... Let's not all get, um...

346
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:50,269
Mom, what's goin' on? I thought
you guys were against all this.

347
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,343
Well, we feel
that you know best...

348
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:55,174
and who are we to interfere,
and you love this girl.

349
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,477
And the rest will just be
little happy surprises...

350
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,381
- along the way, like you said.
- Yeah.

351
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:04,614
With the exception
of the retard thing.

352
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:08,453
- Oh, God.
- Tell me you didn't just say that.

353
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,651
You knew?

354
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:13,443
You knew, yet you still wanted me
to go through with this.

355
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:16,797
What can I say?
I'm crazy about the little dullard.

356
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:18,960
Oh, my God. She's rich.

357
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,005
This is a new low,
even for you, Mom.

358
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,477
What is wrong with you?

359
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,478
Larry, go to a mirror.

360
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:33,179
- You're fired.
- You're fired. What?

361
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:37,015
It's over. And this is how you tell me...
in the middle of a wedding?

362
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:39,147
<i>You shouldn't have said anything.
You shouldn't have said anything.</i>

363
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,316
You were right.
Now what am I gonna do?

364
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:45,021
I've been thinking. Every society
has their own rules about this stuff.

365
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,826
For instance, in some states,
it's legal to marry your own cousin.

366
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,917
California's blocked it
twice, but only because

367
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,925
they tacked it onto
an estate law thing.

368
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:54,396
- We had the signatures.
- You're 16, and you know all that.

369
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:57,439
She's 30 and a half. She probably can't
list the seven houses of Parliament.

370
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:59,773
- There's three.
- Now I gotta break her heart.

371
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,506
Doesn't she have to leave the country
if you don't marry her?

372
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:05,879
Yeah, I guess I can keep my promise
about that, huh?

373
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,952
There wouldn't be any
real intimacy...

374
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:10,953
and it would be the strongest marriage
in the family.

375
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:13,290
But as much as I'd like
to, you can't ignore

376
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:15,549
the fact that she is
mentally disabled.

377
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,685
Oh, my God.

378
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,099
I'm wearing an inside-out
bridesmaid's dress.

379
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,020
You'd better catch her, Dad.

380
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,863
Not gonna be easy. She's
an Olympic silver...

381
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:30,131
I just figured that one out.

382
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:34,803
<i>Okay. Well, I have to go stop production
on The Ocean Walker.</i>

383
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:40,883
- You found out.
- Took me long enough.

384
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:46,821
Maybe you're not smart either.
I didn't know until they told me.

385
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,088
No. I'm just a narcissist
who was too self-involved to see the truth.

386
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:51,890
That makes no sense to me.

387
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:54,829
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm being too hard on myself.

388
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:59,029
You know, the truth is... is that I
did just see what I wanted to see.

389
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:02,573
Rita, you're so beautiful,
and you're so sweet.

390
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:06,474
And you deserve to find somebody
a lot more like you.

391
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:09,775
I don't think that either one of us
would be happy.

392
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,974
So, it's bye-bye to Rita then?

393
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,415
Unless you really want
to stay in America.

394
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,478
- I wanted to be with you.
- Hoy! Rita!

395
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,684
Time to go now.
Back to England, love.

396
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:24,921
Oh, Michael, will you
come visit me lots?

397
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,430
That's gonna be difficult, Rita.
You're gonna be across an ocean.

398
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,093
- Well, you can always walk.
- Not on the water.

399
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:34,433
Oh, Michael, you're such a grown-up.

400
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,279
Hey! He-Hey!

401
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:50,043
Hang on a sec.
That's part of your trick, right?

402
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:53,646
No. That's not my trick, Michael.

403
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:00,223
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

404
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:03,027
<i>It's my illusion!</i>

405
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:05,125
<i>Michael relives a wedding nightmare.</i>

406
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:07,796
- Help! Put him out!
- My hair! My beautiful hair!

407
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:11,170
- Push him in the pool!
- Why am I not going underwater?

408
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:14,643
Dear God! Why am I not going underwater?
