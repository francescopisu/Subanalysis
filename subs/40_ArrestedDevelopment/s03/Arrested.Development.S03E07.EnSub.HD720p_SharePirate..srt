1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:03,003
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:05,505
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,507
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,776
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,144
<i>Michael Bluth paid an
unexpected visit to his mother.</i>

6
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:22,382
- You look pretty, Mom.
- What do you need?

7
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:25,016
- Need? Why do you think I need something?
- Well, you're too busy for us.

8
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:27,527
No one's seen you.
Going on all those dates with Rita.

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,963
<i>- Or should I say playdates?
- Michael had recently dated a woman...</i>

10
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,558
<i>he later found out
was mentally challenged.</i>

11
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,269
We're not seeing each other anymore,
but it's... it's for the best.

12
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,205
I'm actually kind of relieved it's over.

13
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:42,640
<i>Actually, Michael
had been so devastated by their break-up...</i>

14
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:47,875
<i>that he'd even broken out the old guitar.</i>

15
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,383
- Maybe you should talk to someone.
- Like my mom?

16
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,052
I don't know.
Does she play guitar?

17
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,960
Can't a guy call his mom pretty
without it seeming strange?

18
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:06,193
Amen. And how about that
little piece of tail on her?

19
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,929
- Cu-ute!
- I've opened a door here that I regret.

20
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:11,505
Oh, he's just talking about
his stupid turtle.

21
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:12,828
Oh.

22
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,074
She has a name, Mother.
And it's "Mother."

23
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:16,770
<i>Buster had recently
brought home a turtle...</i>

24
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:20,473
<i>in an incredibly misguided attempt
to make his mother jealous.</i>

25
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,712
You can stay in this box
that Uncle-father Oscar left behind.

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,654
<i>In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally
obtained medical marijuana. - Oh, good.</i>

27
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:31,749
<i>- Hey, it's already got grass.
- Primo bud. Real sticky weed.</i>

28
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,629
Although I was getting a
little worried because

29
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:35,421
she was moving really
slowly last week...

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,761
and then she stopped.
Hmm.

31
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,768
Yeah. Well, in any event I'm here,
Mom, because you need me.

32
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,067
As you know the Bluth Foundation dinner
is a week away.

33
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:49,303
I am your co-chair,
and we don't wanna relive the TBA debacle.

34
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:52,005
<i>Years earlier, the Bluths
had a hard time...</i>

35
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:55,606
<i>agreeing on a cause
for their foundation's first fund-raiser.</i>

36
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:59,153
"Herpes." "Shrinkage."

37
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:02,280
<i>Somebody saw Seinfeld last night.</i>

38
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,690
"Neck flap." "Ovarian cancer."
Gee, I wonder who that was?

39
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,625
- One more for "neck flap."
- Yes.

40
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,529
Well, I'll be honest. I haven't
heard anything that beats herpes.

41
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,898
<i>So, they sent out invitations
with the disease...</i>

42
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,903
<i>still "to be announced."</i>

43
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:22,170
<i>And much to their surprise,
the Bluths ended up raising over $25,000...</i>

44
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:24,438
<i>to fight TBA.</i>

45
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:26,912
<i>And then...
and here's the really horrible part...</i>

46
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:29,449
<i>they did it again
the following year.</i>

47
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,987
Keep fighting, little guy. With your
support of the Bluth Foundation...

48
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,252
we'll live in a galaxy
where TBA does not exist.

49
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,692
When people at the last gala found out,
we almost had a riot on our hands.

50
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:44,356
Well, you don't have to worry about
anything like that this year, because...

51
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:47,264
Warden Gentles is the new co-chair.

52
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:50,668
- The guy who ran Dad's prison?
- He's here now installing cameras...

53
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:53,104
because of all your
father's escape attempts.

54
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,244
Uh, yeah. It looks like I
won't be goin' anywhere

55
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:57,304
for a little while. But
what do I care, huh?

56
00:02:57,412 --> 00:03:00,939
I got a beautiful wife.
I got a wonderful hobby. Ha! Look at me.

57
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,949
I'm having the time of my life.

58
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,952
<i>His hobby was making papier-mâché copies...</i>

59
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:10,047
<i>of his own head. - Before I forget,
do you know if these cameras are high def?</i>

60
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,061
I certainly hope so. It'll help me
better understand "George Bluth"...

61
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:18,121
<i>the main character of
the latest and, I pray,</i>

62
00:03:18,134 --> 00:03:21,102
<i>final draft of my
screenplay, New Warden.</i>

63
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:22,522
You wrote a screenplay, huh?

64
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,865
I promised myself I
wasn't gonna become...

65
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,873
one of those people who are always going on
about their screenplays...

66
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:31,935
so I'll just say, I put together a staged
reading with some fabulous young actors...

67
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,015
and it was very well received.

68
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,743
<i>Warden Gentles had convinced
his granddaughter's teacher...</i>

69
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,581
<i>to mount New Warden
as a school play.</i>

70
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:41,144
I understand you've
been causing problems.

71
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:42,623
Nobody sells any coke...

72
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,215
in this pen
without daddy getting a taste.

73
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:48,387
Beat him with a pillowcase
full of batteries.

74
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:52,432
Ward's letting us hold the event
in the new wing of the prison.

75
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:56,470
After lockdown, everyone's going
to spend the night in a cell.

76
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,407
Are they color or black and white?

77
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,966
So, Michael, I don't
need your help at all...

78
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,446
unless you need
something from me?

79
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:11,451
No. I'm fine. Just thought I could help.
Relieved I don't have to.

80
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:15,580
<i>But he wasn't relieved. So he went home
to complain to his sister, Lindsay.</i>

81
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,557
Prison's the last thing we want people
associating with the Bluth name.

82
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,094
- Plus, who's gonna want to go?
- Wait, this is gonna be at the prison?

83
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:23,687
Oh, great.
Probably gonna run into that warden.

84
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:26,289
- How do you know the warden?
- Oh, right.

85
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,926
Uh, he spoke at my school
for a "Startled Straight" assembly.

86
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,471
<i>Actually, she'd met with
him in the hopes...</i>

87
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,770
<i>of using his prison
as a location for a film.</i>

88
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:40,337
I think you will find the desert
both engrossing... and high grossing.

89
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,507
So we don't get dessert.

90
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,585
I guess I have some reading to do.

91
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,807
Besides I doubt very
much Mom's come up with

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,952
a real disease to have
a fund-raiser for.

93
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:51,355
I forgot. We have a real disease.
I chose it:

94
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,656
GVH, "Graft Versus Host."

95
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:57,493
It's new, it's fatal,
and guess who's got it?

96
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,067
You've heard of bodies
rejecting transplants.

97
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:03,626
Well, in this case, your transplanted hair
is rejecting your body.

98
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,638
Either you remove your hair graft...

99
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,504
or the host, you, will get
sicker and eventually die.

100
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,013
- Can you think of any benefits?
- Benefits? No. He'll die.

101
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:16,675
Oh, oh, yeah. No, I... I get that.
But have there ever been any fund-raisers?

102
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:21,381
A husband with the headlining disease.
Everyone's gonna wanna talk to me.

103
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,326
You're making him
keep the hair?

104
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,186
Did you see the attention
Superman's wife got?

105
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,591
- Besides, Tobias wants it too.
- Oh, she's right.

106
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,290
Th-This is gonna be great for me,
because I am gonna star...

107
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,491
in the video Gob's making for the gala.

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,228
Oh, yeah.
It'll be very uplifting.

109
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:37,669
- Oh, here, let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

110
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,672
Oh. Oh, this is gonna hurt. Oh!

111
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:45,177
You know what? We're gonna
need this from another angle.

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,612
- And you're sure you're okay?
- Oh, probably.

113
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:50,150
I can't feel anything.
How's my hair?

114
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:53,084
It's fine.
It's sucking the life out of you, Tobias.

115
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:56,316
I mean, everything's gone crazy...
the gala, Mom and Warden Gentles.

116
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,892
I mean, what is in it for him?
I think he's taking advantage of Mom.

117
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,894
And did it ever occur to you
that maybe Warden Gentles likes her?

118
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,419
Likes her what?

119
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,865
No, I... I mean, likes her,
like, is attracted to her.

120
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:10,768
- Who's the "her" in that sentence?
- Mom. Warden Gentles likes Mom.

121
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,898
- Her?
- I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this.

122
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:17,273
The guy runs a prison.
He can have any piece of ass he wants.

123
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,813
And if he likes her in that sense,
it makes it even worse.

124
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,974
I don't want Mom mixed up with the sort
of creep that would have her as a fetish.

125
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,814
Oh, Michael, you're just feeling
neglected by your mother.

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,820
You wanted to go to this with her,
didn't you?

127
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,254
Hey, I... I don't need
to take my mom to a gala, okay?

128
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,383
Only losers go to those things
with their parents.

129
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,792
- I'm going with my son.
- Oh, I may skip that. I don't like galas.

130
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,330
<i>Actually, he loved galas.</i>

131
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:41,334
<i>All kids do. - Oh, come on.
Don't leave your Uncle Tea Bag hangin'.</i>

132
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,996
<i>- Please don't call yourself that.
- What he was having trouble with...</i>

133
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,801
<i>was looking directly at his dying uncle.</i>

134
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:50,400
I can't stand by and watch Mom get hurt.
I gotta get down there.

135
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:54,346
This is heartbreaking.
Gotta get this for the video.

136
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,418
George Michael, you wanna put your head
down there by his drainage shunt?

137
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,717
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was also feeling abandoned by Mother.</i>

138
00:07:01,823 --> 00:07:05,919
Mo... Mother! I have no one now.

139
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:10,088
<i>But at that very moment,
his true father returned.</i>

140
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:13,190
Uncle-father Oscar,
what are you doing here?

141
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:18,204
Well, you know me. I could
never leave a little bud behind.

142
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:23,334
Oh, a hug. Nice. You haven't seen
a little box with a turtle on it, have you?

143
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:27,279
Oh, yeah. My turtle was living in it
before he ate all the grass and died.

144
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,282
- He ate all the grass?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:31,443
- It's been great catching up.
- W-W-Wait, where you going?

146
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:34,613
No, I can't stay, because if my
brother finds out that I'm here...

147
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:38,818
he's gonna try switching places again,
and I can't go back to prison.

148
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,688
If my father comes in, you can hide
in one of Gob's tricks. - I can't.

149
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:46,632
At least you can stay and help me bury
my poor turtle. - Or we could cremate it.

150
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,924
<i>And Maeby was having a
harder time finishing.</i>

151
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:51,137
<i>Warden Gentle's
screenplay than he did.</i>

152
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,343
How'd you like to read
something fun that we

153
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,471
could talk about on the
way to the prison gala?

154
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:59,809
Oh, I'm actually gonna sit that out.
I'm just burnt out on prisons lately.

155
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:02,075
- Well, this might change your mind.
- Is that a screenplay?

156
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,310
Well, that's what you're gonna tell me.

157
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,320
<i>And Michael raced to warn his mother
of the warden's intentions.</i>

158
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:09,322
- Hey! You can't park there.
- Oh, sorry.

159
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:11,915
- I'm sorry.
- No stairs. No parking.

160
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,826
Sorry.

161
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,065
Everything looks delicious.

162
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,533
Oh, One-Eye's a wonderful chef.

163
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:26,096
I've had to go to his parole hearings twice
and lie through my teeth to keep him here.

164
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,665
Hi, I just, um...

165
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:32,245
Wow.
What are you guys doing?

166
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:36,784
It's perfectly innocent, but I can see
how if our roles were reversed...

167
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:40,446
I might have you beaten
with a pillowcase full of batteries.

168
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,455
- I'll give you two a moment.
- Thank you.

169
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,617
I don't know why I always assume
that everyone's read my screenplay.

170
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:49,163
What is wrong with you?
That man is being wonderful to us.

171
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:50,970
And that doesn't concern you, Mother?
For all

172
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,700
you know he could be
trying to seduce you.

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
- Oh, Michael, you're crazy.
- I certainly hope so.

174
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:58,602
I'm trying to seduce him.

175
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,970
- Who's the "I" in that sentence?
- Me.

176
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:04,044
<i>- You?
- Her.</i>

177
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,277
<i>Michael had just discovered that
his mother was interested in another man.</i>

178
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:14,483
- Mom wants to sleep with the warden.
- What? Oh, God!

179
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:17,754
Great. - Great? The man is old enough
to be her contemporary, Lindsay.

180
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:21,262
Plus, she's married, okay? She can't be
writhing around underneath the covers...

181
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:23,054
What is wrong with you?
It's disgusting! God!

182
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,766
Take it easy.

183
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,668
No, it's just I've always had a thing
about Mom and Dad being together.

184
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,296
- I know that.
- I have a sense of propriety, my God.

185
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,466
- Gob, we've had this conversation.
- When?

186
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,943
The last time you ended up seeing Mom
and Dad go at it. - What? No! God, Michael!

187
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:39,482
<i>- I did no such thing.
- He did very much that thing...</i>

188
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,178
<i>when his parents got intimate
in a conjugal trailer two years ago.</i>

189
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,312
<i>But thankfully,
he'd found a way to forget that.</i>

190
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:47,725
I got a thing of pills in my pocket.
I don't

191
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:50,052
suppose I could convince
you to grab me one.

192
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,323
<i>- Luckily, that worked too.
- I can't even hear this.</i>

193
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,455
You may not like it
that Mom has needs...

194
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,726
but it never bothered you
when Dad was running around.

195
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,524
Well, that was different.

196
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,237
Well, how 'bout when she was
sleeping with Uncle Oscar?

197
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,238
The guy looks just like Dad.

198
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,366
I don't know. He's family.
It seemed very natural they'd be together.

199
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:09,343
Who? What? What is natural?
Is there new legislation on this now?

200
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:13,382
<i>George Michael was concerned about
family love after reading Maeby's script...</i>

201
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:18,216
<i>which he took as a subtle message to him
from his cousin. - Listen, new fish.</i>

202
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:20,290
That bunk was open
because the last guy...

203
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,688
wouldn't do the things
that you're going to do.

204
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,295
We're going to... do things?

205
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,821
Anything can happen when two
people share a cell, coz.

206
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,900
Um, I'll go...
Okay, I'll go with you to the prison.

207
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,407
George Michael, what I
want you to do is run

208
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,836
upstairs and run a nice
bath for Uncle Tobias.

209
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,568
And I want you to help him get in the tub.
Can you do that for me? Thanks.

210
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:42,372
And don't make the water too hot.
The scabs come right off.

211
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,866
<i>Come on, Lindsay. What are
we gonna do about Mother?</i>

212
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,277
<i>Honestly, Michael...</i>

213
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:49,318
all this "Mother" talk...
you're starting to sound a lot like Buster.

214
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,683
<i>And Michael realized there
was somebody else...</i>

215
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,688
<i>in the family who would care about this.</i>

216
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,191
Buster's gonna take this so hard.
I cannot let my brother get hurt.

217
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:59,194
Oh!

218
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:09,273
Oh, it's on standby. Got
another one in you?

219
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:13,036
<i>Buster, meanwhile,
was enjoying being with Oscar.</i>

220
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,634
<i>But Oscar was longing
for his sweet freedom.</i>

221
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,385
Say, you don't have any
Sweet Freedom or Tropical.

222
00:11:18,398 --> 00:11:21,048
Ease or any of the
Hawaiian blends, do you?

223
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,449
Someone's coming.

224
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:27,284
Oh, Dad, get in the cage and hide
behind the mirror. It'll look empty.

225
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:31,521
<i>Oscar never got a chance
to hide behind the mirror.</i>

226
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,926
<i>Although it was not the first time...</i>

227
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,430
<i>he was knocked out
by a powerful lid.</i>

228
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:40,902
Hey, Buster, listen.
I got some bad news about Mom.

229
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,837
She's planning on spending the night
with another man.

230
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,408
- Gob?
- N-No. Not another brother.

231
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,638
- Oh. Then why do we care?
- What is wrong with everyone?

232
00:11:49,746 --> 00:11:52,943
Uh, B-Buster, you've got to talk to Mom
about this. She can't possibly do it.

233
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:56,177
- If Dad finds out, he'll go berserk.
- If Dad finds out about what?

234
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:59,722
Oh. Well, I guess I've got no choice now.
Dad, I-I've got some bad news...

235
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:04,487
about Mom and Warden Gentles...
dating.

236
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:07,392
Oh. Better sit down.

237
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:10,796
Okay, what's the news?

238
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:14,428
- They're dating.
- Oh, yeah. Because she's... she's my wife.

239
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:15,823
Oh, yeah. Damn it!

240
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,132
I'm surprised you're not
more upset about this.

241
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,640
When you first told me,
but you see, time... time passes.

242
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:21,330
Besides, it's only, uh,
dinner in the office.

243
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,940
I mean it's not Le Cirque.

244
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:26,140
- How'd you know that it was in his office?
- Well, wh-where...

245
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:29,275
where the hell else are they gonna go
at 4:00 in the afternoon?

246
00:12:29,386 --> 00:12:31,266
It was around 4:00.
You already know about this.

247
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:32,788
- Come on.
- You're up to something, right?

248
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:35,153
- No.
- You both are. She's workin' the warden.

249
00:12:35,258 --> 00:12:38,523
You're makin' fake heads. You're planning
an escape. - How dare you?

250
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,708
I oughta shave your head and make you
sit under that camera all night, mister.

251
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,783
It's unbelievable. You
know, I was worried

252
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,791
that this guy was gonna
take advantage of Mom.

253
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:48,342
You both were taking advantage of him.
I don't

254
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,805
know why I work to keep
this family together.

255
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,704
Michael, can I talk to you
for one sec?

256
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,346
<i>And that's when George Sr.
Got a call from Lucille.</i>

257
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,906
<i>Three, two, two, five, two.</i>

258
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:01,210
Howdy doody, that's it.

259
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:03,946
Now, y-you get back here
so you can smuggle me out...

260
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:06,022
past the guards
before Michael starts blabbing.

261
00:13:06,122 --> 00:13:08,420
You know what?
You can smuggle yourself out.

262
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:10,720
You wanna get away from me so bad?
You're free.

263
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:13,091
But I'm free too, baby.

264
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:16,723
I'm staying in the conjugal trailer
with the warden tonight.

265
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,502
Him?

266
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:24,938
- Hey, why is there an ambulance out front?
- Honey, the car is here.

267
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,839
Hey, do you need a ride?
I mean, you'll have to lie down, but...

268
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:29,866
I'm not goin'. The whole
thing is a scam. Mom

269
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,812
was using that warden
to try to get Dad out.

270
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:34,645
- She's not trying to seduce him at all.
- Oh, no. She is.

271
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,584
She's spending the night with him.
She just called to ask me to bring her...

272
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:41,748
a tube of "Vagis-table" paste.
Hi, George Michael.

273
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,479
You're goin' too, huh?

274
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,123
Yeah. I thought I would,
um, just go with Maeby...

275
00:13:45,228 --> 00:13:48,061
and support her through this whole
Graft Versus Host thing.

276
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:51,099
<i>And Michael himself was
feeling a little like...</i>

277
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,795
<i>the host that the grafting family
was rejecting.</i>

278
00:13:53,904 --> 00:13:56,560
Good. Great. Go. It's a
very important cause.

279
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:59,240
So I'll just stay here and read.

280
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:03,472
<i>But this, too, would prove challenging
as the family had no books.</i>

281
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:10,714
<i>Other than those.
And that's when Michael got a glimpse...</i>

282
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,085
<i>into the warden's true intentions
with his mother.</i>

283
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,627
You were just using me to get even
with the man who broke out of your prison?

284
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:20,787
That escape cost me my promotion.

285
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:24,833
And you will pay for
the loss of $2,300 a year.

286
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:27,836
But you gave me presents.
We made love.

287
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:33,843
I've given you one last present.
Enjoy the chlamydia, Lucille. Ha, ha, ha.

288
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:37,471
Take this newly diseased
woman to the hole. Ha.

289
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:40,345
<i>I wish I'd read
The Man Inside Me.</i>

290
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:44,945
<i>George Sr. Needed to escape...</i>

291
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:48,958
<i>but his handmade replica
would never fool the cameras.</i>

292
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,656
<i>So he searched through Gob's magic stuff
to find something that might.</i>

293
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,920
Well, that was a freebie.

294
00:14:55,933 --> 00:14:58,099
Hey, Gob, I'm glad you're here.
I thought you'd be at the gala.

295
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:00,603
Yeah, Dad made me move my stuff
outta Buster's room.

296
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:03,435
<i>But only after hiding
himself in the cage...</i>

297
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,975
<i>to get past the cops at the door.</i>

298
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:09,274
Go. Mom's being set up.
We have to get into that prison.

299
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,853
It's after lockdown.

300
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,349
Come on, Gob. You were gonna
break out of this place once.

301
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,817
- I know you can help me break in.
- It's not a Jamba Juice, Michael.

302
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,115
It shouldn't be that hard to break into.

303
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:23,217
<i>And Buster returned only to find
no evidence of his uncle-father.</i>

304
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:25,455
Hey, Father-uncle Dad...

305
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,463
I was just bringin' some juice for my pet.

306
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,966
Wait a minute.
You're not really smiling.

307
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,503
I'm Oscar. He did it again.

308
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:38,406
I told you he would. I can't go
through this again. I can't be caged!

309
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>And Buster realized he needed to
give his true father his freedom.</i>

310
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,787
<i>Hey! Let's get him!</i>

311
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,716
<i>But it was a freedom
that didn't last long.</i>

312
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,379
<i>And as the prison gala was underway...</i>

313
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,581
<i>the guys arrived for their break-in...</i>

314
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,057
<i>with the help of one of George Sr.'s
instruments of escape.</i>

315
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:58,117
You think this is gonna work?

316
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,097
It's a jet pack, Michael.
What could possibly go wrong?

317
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:01,950
All right.

318
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:04,323
Now just make sure you tell me
before you hit any buttons...

319
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,929
- Good. Now we know what the strap is for.
- Okay.

320
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,941
- Under the crotch. Yup.
- We need a new plan.

321
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:16,446
- Wish I knew the layout of this place.
- Way ahead of you, Michael.

322
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:20,211
Drew a map of it on my stomach. It's upside
down, so it might be a little awkward.

323
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:22,445
<i>- It was awkward.
- I drew us.</i>

324
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:25,250
- I think we're, like, right there.
- Hey, guys.

325
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:27,460
If you're gonna party,
you wanna bring it inside?

326
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,588
That was a freebie.

327
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:31,787
Well, the new facility isn't so bad, huh?

328
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,856
It's a lot like school,
only it's air-conditioned.

329
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:37,664
So I guess we can just, uh... just choose
a cell to stay overnight in and, uh...

330
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,500
Oh, great. And you can take me through your
thoughts about the screenplay beat by beat.

331
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:46,202
Sure. Yeah. "Because anything can happen
when two people share a cell, coz."

332
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:49,576
<i>It's a line from...
from New Warden.</i>

333
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:54,380
Oh. Oh! Okay, yeah.
I don't know what I was worried about.

334
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:57,283
<i>That would be the happiest moment...</i>

335
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:59,948
<i>George Michael
would ever experience in his life.</i>

336
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:04,953
<i>- And the warden was happy too.
- What a treat.</i>

337
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:09,227
The man who cost me my promotion
ends up back in my care.

338
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:14,328
And I don't think there's going to be
an "I'm Oscar" Web site this time.

339
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,897
Think this time I'll do a podcast.

340
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:21,342
"Graft Versus Host."
Sounds like a tennis match...

341
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:24,415
<i>between Steffi Graf
and Happy Days star Donny "Host."</i>

342
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:26,745
<i>- It's "Most."
- But it's far deadlier.</i>

343
00:17:26,851 --> 00:17:28,910
Hello. I'm Gob Bluth.

344
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:33,584
As a magician,
I can make a lot of things disappear.

345
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:36,421
There are some things
I can't make disappear...

346
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,928
no, not that candy ball machine...

347
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:42,761
the disease GVH without your help.

348
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:45,961
This is Tobias.
When Toby first came into the family...

349
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,300
none of us much wanted him around...

350
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,966
but that's because we couldn't see
what was on the inside.

351
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,806
But lately, that's all
we've been able to see.

352
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,910
But what was Tobias to do...

353
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,943
Have his hair plugs removed?

354
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:03,452
The doctor says I'd be completely healed
if I were to do that.

355
00:18:03,554 --> 00:18:07,320
- He just needs his hair plugs out?
- Doctor says that's the cure.

356
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:11,657
There's a cure? - No way. That horsehair
is my ticket back into society.

357
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:14,789
You cut it after those idiots at the gala
accept me as one of their own.

358
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,561
We're giving money for this guy
to keep his hair transplants?

359
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,829
I'd rather give to TBA!

360
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:22,704
<i>The crowd began to grow unruly.</i>

361
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:25,469
We have a riot in the ballroom.

362
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:28,170
<i>And, just as the prisoners had proven...</i>

363
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,713
<i>they could throw a gala
as well as the rich...</i>

364
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:34,751
<i>so the rich proved they could throw a riot
just as well as the prisoners.</i>

365
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,655
<i>And Lucille was brought
to the conjugal trailer.</i>

366
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,481
<i>Mom.</i>

367
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:41,023
- Michael, what are you doing?
- I cannot let you go through with this.

368
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,685
- You can't sleep with him.
- Oh, yes I can.

369
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:47,162
I'm making up for the heartbreak your
father has caused me. He doesn't need me.

370
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:50,996
- You don't need me.
- Of course I need you, Mom.

371
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:54,560
My heart is kind of broken too.
I've been kind of denying it lately, but...

372
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:57,038
um, you know, it just... I can't...
I can't deal with the fact...

373
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:59,575
that my family's falling apart,
now that I really need you.

374
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:04,580
Oh, Michael, honey.
I wanna cry so bad...

375
00:19:05,783 --> 00:19:08,013
but I don't think
I can spare the moisture.

376
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,918
Well, listen. Here's...

377
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,958
The problem is that, uh,
Gentles doesn't really care for you.

378
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,811
He's just using you to
get back at Dad for

379
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,665
escaping, at least according
to his screenplay.

380
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,357
- You read it?
- Yeah.

381
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,353
<i>Did you like the chlamydia thing?
I gave him that.</i>

382
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,265
<i>You gave him chlamydia?</i>

383
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:26,689
He had "crabs," and I said,
"You're gonna get laughs."

384
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:29,033
Then what am I doing?

385
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,338
I mean, if Dad doesn't care, there's...
there's no real threat...

386
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:35,878
and, I guess,
just knock yourself out, huh?

387
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,210
Where's Gentles? I'll kill him!

388
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,375
- George? - Dad?
- I can't let you do this.

389
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:46,219
I can't let what we have... as lousy
as it may be at times... be destroyed.

390
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:49,555
This is where you escaped to?
To prison? For me?

391
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,595
No one is breaking this family apart.
No one.

392
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:54,824
You know what?
I think I needed to hear that.

393
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:59,635
Sorry about the wait.
George? If you're here...

394
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,604
who do we have
in the delousing tank?

395
00:20:01,706 --> 00:20:04,539
- I'm guessing Oscar.
- No.

396
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,906
I cannot take another $2,300 hit.

397
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:11,004
I'll tell you what: You let Oscar out,
and you give us an hour in here...

398
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:14,812
and, uh, we'll call it even.

399
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,346
Please, Ward?

400
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:24,088
I can't say no to the woman
who gave me "chlamydia." One hour.

401
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,828
Are you ready to have some fun?

402
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:33,461
<i>- I am so glad I didn't cry.
- That I didn't need to hear.</i>

403
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:38,174
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

404
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:40,401
<i>George Michael gets closer to his family.</i>

405
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:45,508
<i>- Lockdown!
- That was close, huh, Maeby?</i>

406
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:49,143
Oh, she's in the next cell. Looks like
we're gonna be bunk buddies all night, coz.

407
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,949
<i>George Michael experiences...</i>

408
00:20:52,056 --> 00:20:54,149
<i>his unhappiest moment ever.</i>

409
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,927
<i>Buster tries to forget
his recent losses...</i>

410
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,557
<i>by breaking out the old guitar...</i>

411
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,857
<i>and Gob finally faces a
phobia he'd faced before.</i>

412
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,070
<i>No! Not here!</i>

413
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:11,870
Wait, I've seen this before.
Oh, God, I've seen this before!
