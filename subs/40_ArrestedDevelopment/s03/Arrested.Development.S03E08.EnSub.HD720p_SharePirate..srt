1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:03,401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:05,496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,843
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

5
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:20,584
<i>Michael was trying to include
his brother in the business...</i>

6
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,249
<i>at his father's request...</i>

7
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:26,225
So, the last couple of months
have seen us hemorrhaging money...

8
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:30,628
<i>But he was finding himself
overwhelmed by the change.</i>

9
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:33,064
Is it my turn to speak yet?
I've got a good one.

10
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:34,504
We're gonna wait till
after lunch for the tricks.

11
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:35,864
It's not a trick, Michael.

12
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,769
It's a business opportunity.

13
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:41,104
You can turn the music off.
I already shot my wad.

14
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,109
Off.

15
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,702
No, that's tape. It's a...

16
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:49,614
I have got a quick way for us...

17
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:52,619
to literally be showered with money.

18
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:55,588
That's where the penny thing would have...

19
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:00,725
Bonus. Anyway, it involves
us making some money...

20
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,389
with our Mexican friends from Colombia.

21
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,295
I think they're called Colombians.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,064
Oh, I forgot. We're being
"politically correct."

23
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:13,005
Anyway, there's a company there that
wants to develop some time-shares with us.

24
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:15,474
I told them that we'll
sell them our blueprints...

25
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:18,774
- for 100 grand.
- Gob, we're prohibited...

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,440
from doing any business outside the
country while we're under investigation.

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,575
Translation: "Wish I'd thought of that."

28
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,085
- Nice translating, Dad.
- Oh.

29
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:28,213
I also had this slogan made up.

30
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,588
<i>"A Colombian cartel that won't
kidnap and kill you."</i>

31
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:34,321
Underline "won't," 'cause
that makes the competition look like...

32
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:36,389
- maybe they...
- I'm serious. We're not doing it.

33
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:39,696
It's illegal, and, uh, it's also kind
of a stupid way to make a quick buck.

34
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,793
- It's not stupid. You're stupid.
- Nice pout, Dad.

35
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:45,566
I wasn't calling you stupid.
I was calling the idea stupid.

36
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:47,574
If you'd spend a little more time
learning about the business...

37
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:49,837
and less time with the tricks,
you'd know that.

38
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,539
If I didn't have a live dove
in my pants right now...

39
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:56,139
I would leap across this table and...
You know what? Forget it.

40
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,571
<i>- Let's go ahead and take five.
- Michael was frustrated...</i>

41
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:02,180
<i>and returned to his office to find Lindsay.</i>

42
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,690
Gob is driving me crazy. I finally
got rid of him for a little while...

43
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,693
and Dad put him
right back in the business.

44
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,695
You two have always fought.

45
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,130
- I think I even have video of that.
- You and half of Orange County.

46
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:15,965
<i>As children, George Sr. Would often
provoke the boys to fight one another.</i>

47
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,971
He's calling you a liar.

48
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,041
I don't want your cards, Michael.

49
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,906
<i>He believed it created a
competitive spirit...</i>

50
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:25,241
<i>which equipped them for
the challenges of life.</i>

51
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:27,247
Let's keep it in frame.

52
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,250
<i>He also believed footage
of the tussles would be a big hit...</i>

53
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,912
<i>in the burgeoning
home video market.</i>

54
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:36,650
<i>He soon franchised the concept
with such titles...</i>

55
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:40,159
<i>as Boyfights 2...</i>

56
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:42,196
A Boyfights Cookout...

57
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:47,098
<i>and Backseat Boyfights:
The Trip to Uncle Jack's 70th.</i>

58
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:49,830
- How do you think I feel?
- You weren't even in the tapes.

59
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:53,339
I was talking about my marriage.
Are we still talking about the tapes?

60
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:55,170
Apparently not.
What's going on with your marriage?

61
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:59,839
Well, as you know, Bob Loblaw and I
have had a secret little thing going.

62
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:03,748
- Very secret. He doesn't know.
- He has not known of it. That's correct.

63
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:07,515
But last night he finally
responded to one of my little hints.

64
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,749
- Why won't you!@%$ me?
- Look...

65
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:13,521
You're an attractive woman, and you've
been dressing like a common whore.

66
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:17,291
Well, I've been trying. - But you asked
me to represent you in your divorce.

67
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:20,891
- I can't see a client.
- Then recommend somebody else.

68
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,902
Well, our copy boy is very striking...

69
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,904
but he often has toner on his fingers.

70
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,873
- I meant another lawyer.
- Oh.

71
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:31,377
So now I have to tell Tobias we're getting
divorced, break the news to Maeby...

72
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,947
plus fit an eyebrow pluck in there,
all before the weekend.

73
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,574
Perhaps you can talk to Maeby while
you're getting your eyebrows plucked.

74
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:39,779
It'll look like your eyes
are watering 'cause you're sad.

75
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,482
<i>Later that day Michael
went to his parents' apartment...</i>

76
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:45,924
<i>to talk about the problem
he was having with Gob.</i>

77
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:48,427
- What's going on here?
- They're painting the whole building...

78
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,555
so I'm having the inside done too.

79
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:55,899
And that goes into storage, right?
Not into your apartment.

80
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,495
What's Spanish for
"I know you speak English"?

81
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:00,507
Mom, if you're gonna speak
to these guys like this...

82
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,509
you might want to sleep
with one eye open.

83
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,478
Actually, I'll be sleeping at your place.

84
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,277
- Paint fumes are deadly.
- You know Dad's under house arrest here.

85
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,284
It'll be nice to get
a break from him too.

86
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:14,321
Besides, I certainly
can't recuperate here.

87
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,721
- Recuperate?
- I didn't want to worry anyone.

88
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:21,284
It's a routine procedure...
Very common for women my age.

89
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:24,854
I see. The apartment's not
the only thing getting a face lift, huh?

90
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,264
Hope you kept your punch cards.
You're about due for a free one.

91
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,269
- We have to pay for the paint.
- No, no, no.

92
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,362
You're not getting a centavo
until you finish all the work.

93
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:33,771
You guys are both gonna be
sleeping with your eyes open.

94
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,843
Mom, however, will not have a choice.

95
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:37,844
Dad, need you to help me get rid of Gob.

96
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:41,347
- That ship sailed 35 years ago.
- Doesn't know anything about the business.

97
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,883
Today he suggested that we do
an illegal Colombian deal.

98
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:47,182
- You said that was legal.
- That was your idea?

99
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:51,316
- I may have mentioned it.
- You told Gob to do it, didn't you?

100
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:53,326
Did you just want to get us
at each other's throats again...

101
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:54,850
<i>like you used to do with
the Boyfights videos?</i>

102
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,295
<i>Boyfights?</i>

103
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,128
<i>- Luchas de Muchachos.
- Oh, sí, Luchas de Muchachos.</i>

104
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,634
- We had this video.
- Sí.

105
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,533
<i>The tapes were a big hit in Latin America.</i>

106
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,868
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with them...

107
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,965
Except for some
of the Baby Buster shorts.

108
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,976
Maybe I was trying
to teach you something.

109
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,978
Maybe I was trying
to teach you how to compete.

110
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,015
I didn't do it with Buster,
and look how he turned out.

111
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:18,483
- Is Buster.
- Baby Buster.

112
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,578
"Yo quiero leche.
Yo quiero leche de madre."

113
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,158
Even though I am so old.

114
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,250
Those tapes made quite
an impression on these painters.

115
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:29,159
I think I turned out
pretty darn well, myself.

116
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:31,164
Oh, you just turned out great.

117
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,996
I used my contacts
to get you a job, and you quit.

118
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:37,299
<i>The job was at an Iraqi-owned toy store...</i>

119
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,067
<i>that was hoping
to deter shoplifting.</i>

120
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:44,168
Okay, I'll just take off
this cheap fake hand...

121
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,907
and we gonna put on this sign.

122
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,074
Beautiful. You like?

123
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:52,051
They only wanted me because
I had one hand... and I won't do it!

124
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:54,553
- That's not the way Mother is raising me.
- Like I won't compete...

125
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:58,615
with my older brother anymore,
despite the way Father raised me.

126
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:02,595
We'll show you. - Just like I showed
Mr. Al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat.

127
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:06,064
I stole this sign.

128
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,362
Of course, I left my hand there also.

129
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,566
<i>But FAO al-Jibaaly Muhammed a-Abat...</i>

130
00:06:12,674 --> 00:06:16,303
<i>wasn't the only one
having trouble scaring kids.</i>

131
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:20,939
<i>So was Hollywood's third-youngest
movie studio executive, Maeby Fünke.</i>

132
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,950
The creature's in your imagination.

133
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,327
That's the bloodsucker? It looks like Alf.
You got a week to fix it.

134
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:35,953
This must be the creature that ate our cat.

135
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:40,496
<i>- And Michael met up with Gob.
- Hey, Gob.</i>

136
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:43,400
Why didn't you tell me that
Colombian thing was Dad's idea?

137
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:46,235
Well, Dad said not to
because you don't think I'm smart...

138
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,741
- and that I should take credit for it.
- It was just Dad...

139
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:51,744
trying to turn us against each other again,
and of course I think you're smart.

140
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,127
Okay? Hey, what's going on
down there? What are you doing?

141
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,241
You don't want a hungry dove
down your pants.

142
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,649
That's how Tony Wonder lost a nut.

143
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:02,348
Look, I know that I don't know
about this housing stuff...

144
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,823
but I've got this
Christian girlfriend now...

145
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,258
and she's trying to get me
to be a better man...

146
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:09,262
and reconnect with my son...

147
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,855
and I'm trying to get her
to renounce God and!@%$ me...

148
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:15,868
and I just want to prove to her
that I'm worth it.

149
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,961
As always, Gob, a mixed bag there...

150
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,607
but the middle part
sounded pretty admirable

151
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,260
for a second, so here's
what I want to do.

152
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:23,540
I want to get you your own
banana stand franchise...

153
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:26,205
and you can have Steve work at it.

154
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:29,977
- You'd do that for me?
- Yes. Yeah. You can design your own shack.

155
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,642
- And choose my own location?
- Whatever you want.

156
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,778
You're gonna be 100%
in charge, all right?

157
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,288
But the most important thing
is that we never let Dad...

158
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:40,293
- turn us against each other again.
- Thanks, Michael.

159
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:47,834
If you feel something moving
down there, it's just the bird.

160
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:50,803
I know it.

161
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,841
<i>And a few days later...</i>

162
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,002
<i>Michael got a call from his son.</i>

163
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,875
Hey, Dad, did you know Gob started
a banana stand? - Yeah, that was my idea.

164
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,677
I'm trying to get us
to be less competitive.

165
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:05,218
That's gonna be difficult.

166
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,050
Plus they have a very aggressive slogan.

167
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:17,094
<i>Gob had opened a new
frozen banana stand, like...</i>

168
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,498
<i>twenty feet from the old
frozen banana stand.</i>

169
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:22,264
What's going on? You just thought
you'd put the stand right here?

170
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,602
Did the research. Do you know
that more frozen bananas are sold...

171
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:27,005
right here on this boardwalk
than anywhere in the OC?

172
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,213
Don't call it that.

173
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:29,340
Also gonna need a check,
'cause I kind of went...

174
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,346
out of pocket on the new sign... and
I need some bananas and some chocolate...

175
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,473
from the other branch. - Just take
the sign down... Take the whole booth down.

176
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:37,018
You're cannibalizing our business.

177
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,554
You're just scared
of a little "competish."

178
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:41,897
You guys don't even have bananas,
so I'm not too worried.

179
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:45,188
In fact, you know what? Me and my son
are gonna kick your little shack's ass.

180
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:47,627
Dad, it's okay. We can just work
together with them, you know?

181
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,631
That makes sense. I mean, we
don't really even know the recipe.

182
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:54,191
You just freeze the banana,
and then you stick it... - Don't tell 'em.

183
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:56,204
- Stick it in the what?
- No, it's okay. We'll figure it out.

184
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:58,501
And when we do,
we'll have the last laugh.

185
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:02,408
We'll be the laughingstock
of the boardwalk.

186
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:06,141
<i>Meanwhile, Lindsay was
preparing for her own competition.</i>

187
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,649
This is Treat. He'll be representing you.

188
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,652
He started off as my paralegal,
but he's a lawyer now.

189
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:14,484
- Well, as of next Monday.
- Well, we'll fudge that.

190
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:16,218
Lindsay, just do me one favor.

191
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:19,124
Don't mention me by name when you
talk about your future plans for dating.

192
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:21,322
It reflects poorly on me.

193
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:23,831
Right, right.
The conflict of interest.

194
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:26,163
Yeah, that too.

195
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,602
- Hello, Lindsay.
- Tobias. Did you get a lawyer?

196
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:33,506
Only the best-looking and
best-educated lawyer in the whole OC.

197
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,510
- Don't call it that.
- Okay.

198
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,376
- Bob Loblaw. How are you?
- Bob's representing you?

199
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:42,247
<i>He was. One day earlier,
Tobias had spoken to him...</i>

200
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:45,185
<i>on the phone. - Whether or not
those promises were made explicit.</i>

201
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:49,782
You... want me to be explicit?

202
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,793
Anyway, as it turns out...

203
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:55,126
Bob was offering to be my lawyer.

204
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:57,131
<i>And that night...</i>

205
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:00,964
<i>- Buster arrived with a post-op Lucille.
- There she is.</i>

206
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,699
She wants to know where
you want to put her.

207
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:06,934
She can take my room.

208
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:08,738
She wants to know
if I can sleep there too.

209
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:11,473
She said that's very important to her.

210
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:14,550
All right. I'll meet you
up there, Mother.

211
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:21,584
You better not lock it!
I'll kick it in!

212
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,990
Oh, by the way. Doctor said
no kissing her on the face for one week.

213
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:28,154
I was like, "Make it two weeks.
See if I care."

214
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,732
Got a new hand?

215
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,892
Oh, yeah. I'm trying it out.

216
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:35,232
Guess who I ran into at the prosthetic
shop while I was waiting for Mother.

217
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,238
Sorry, no refunds...

218
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,607
And that's why you don't take your foot
out of its wrapper. - J. Walter Weatherman.

219
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:45,510
You're the man who used to scare us
as children, and one time as an adult.

220
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:48,243
<i>George Sr. Had always used him...</i>

221
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,649
<i>to teach his children
lasting lessons.</i>

222
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:55,156
<i>They usually involved
his prosthetic arm being ripped off.</i>

223
00:10:55,258 --> 00:11:01,094
And that's why you always leave a note.

224
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:04,132
- You're one of George Bluth's kids.
- Uh-huh.

225
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,985
I guess you'll be scaring
children yourself now.

226
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,760
As a matter of fact, I won't.

227
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,202
If anything, it
strengthened my resolve...

228
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:12,706
to be more than just
a one-armed man...

229
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,277
Even if it means me never
taking a job again.

230
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,614
Almost makes it worth it.

231
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:21,479
<i>- Hello.
- Listen. I heard...</i>

232
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:24,109
that you gave Gob
a banana stand.

233
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,654
<i>They did great.
He and Steve took in over $700.</i>

234
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:28,656
<i>- They did?
- Yeah.</i>

235
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,192
So I guess the Bluth Company's
got a new heir.

236
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:35,162
<i>That's when Michael
realized it was time to get serious.</i>

237
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:38,392
George Michael, do you know
where the banana suit is?

238
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,006
<i>That night,
Maeby, displaced by Buster, heard a noise.</i>

239
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,810
Hello? George Michael?

240
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:53,314
I'm thirsty.

241
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,578
<i>And Maeby knew she had found
her bloodsucking creature.</i>

242
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:02,849
<i>The next day, Michael took
off work to man the banana stand...</i>

243
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,190
<i>- while his son manned a banana.
- How you doin' there, champ?</i>

244
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:09,731
- Is my name champ? It's so hot.
- Why don't you take five?

245
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:12,096
That's not including the five minutes
it takes to get out of this thing?

246
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:14,101
- You're not getting out of it.
- Attention, everyone.

247
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:18,833
<i>Why go to a banana stand when
we can make your banana stand?</i>

248
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,535
I give you Barbara and Dee.

249
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,574
Don't worry. These young beauties have
been nowhere near the bananas.

250
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:29,583
Dad, are they strippers?

251
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:32,950
If I know your uncle, they're at least
strippers. I guess we gotta up the ante.

252
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:36,753
No, Dad. Then they're just gonna up it
and it'll go back and forth all day.

253
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:39,953
<i>If that's what it takes, that's what
we're gonna do. - And they did...</i>

254
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,521
<i>But it was less entertaining
than you might imagine...</i>

255
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:47,398
<i>no matter what music
was put under it.</i>

256
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,311
<i>It was kind of funny
to "Yellow Submarine"...</i>

257
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,220
<i>but who could afford it?</i>

258
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:14,260
<i>So here's what happened at the end.</i>

259
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:15,897
- Hey, stop fighting!
- Stop it!

260
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:16,956
- Hey, stop fighting!
- Stop it!

261
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,334
That's it. They're right, okay?
This is insane.

262
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:19,626
We're just "boyfighting" again.

263
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,727
And for what?
A hefty bag full of pesos.

264
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,899
- You've been taking pesos?
- Dad said I should.

265
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,738
- Dad's involved with this?
- Well, he chose the location...

266
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:31,746
And the strippers and the sign.
Every part of it, really.

267
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:33,941
Wait a minute. Don't you see
what's happening here?

268
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,950
Dad's clearly going ahead
with the Colombian deal...

269
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,972
and he's laundering it
through your banana shack.

270
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:40,079
He pitted us against each other
so I'd be too busy to notice.

271
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,623
Well, you know what? I think it's
time for us to teach Dad a lesson.

272
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,751
Get the person who terrorized us
the most in our childhood.

273
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:49,320
She's still healing.
Let's get J. Walter Weatherman.

274
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:56,831
<i>Michael and Gob had decided...</i>

275
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,909
<i>to teach their father a lesson.</i>

276
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,911
- We need the number of the one-armed man.
- I'm not giving you that.

277
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,504
You want to use his disability
to scare someone.

278
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,846
That's everything I'm against.
Read the button, mister!

279
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,653
"The only scary thing about...

280
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:15,157
a one-armed man trying to
scare someone is the fact that"...

281
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,023
That he feels that his one arm is good
for nothing but trying to scare somebody.

282
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,858
- It's upside down.
- Let's see you try to put a button on...

283
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:22,091
with this.

284
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,860
Stop screaming.
It's not scary.

285
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,868
I'm gonna get the number myself,
'cause we're not gonna...

286
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,930
go through our lives
being controlled by this guy.

287
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,031
What is more pathetic than grown men
being scared of their father?

288
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:32,871
- I'm thirsty.
- Oh, my God!

289
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:36,875
<i>This continued for a while.</i>

290
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:39,609
<i>And later, Michael and Gob
went to put their plan in action.</i>

291
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:41,685
I gave the Colombians back
their money, and I told them...

292
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,913
that you had no right
to make the deal.

293
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,955
I have to warn you, though,
they didn't sound too happy.

294
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,525
Let's just hope they don't try to get
even by "cir-sum-venting" the law.

295
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,925
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Kidnap or... Michael said it.

296
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,395
What, are you kidding?
I have an ankle monitor.

297
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:56,591
I can't even go into the hallway
without the cops coming up.

298
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:58,601
- Stop it!
- Clearly you know what you're doing.

299
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:01,866
There's an off chance they might
just want to take you, leave the ankle.

300
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:04,497
But anyhow...
Stall him.

301
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,406
<i>And Michael
went to solicit help for the lesson.</i>

302
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,752
How would you and some
of your friends like to help us...

303
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:11,782
teach Mr. Bluth a lesson?

304
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,782
Maybe pose as Colombians.

305
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:16,375
But we are Guatemalan.
Won't he know the difference?

306
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:19,047
I think anything south
of San Diego will be just fine.

307
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:22,387
- Orlando was in the Groundlings.
- Just classes.

308
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:25,053
<i>Is it going to be unscripted, like Curb?</i>

309
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:29,064
<i>George Sr., meanwhile,
had grown suspicious of his sons.</i>

310
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,396
What was that with Michael just now?

311
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:34,403
He wants to teach you a lesson.

312
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:36,632
- What kind of lesson?
- J. Walter Weatherman lesson.

313
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,301
He's gonna fake your kidnapping
and helicopter ride to Colombia.

314
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,311
He's gonna teach me a lesson
using my own scare toy?

315
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:44,745
Weatherman wouldn't do it.
I think Buster turned him.

316
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,749
Yeah, well, he'll say yes for me.

317
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:49,911
We'll go along with his lesson, but
we're gonna teach him one of our own...

318
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,478
But it's gotta be a secret, okay?
Between a dad and his...

319
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:56,321
His favorite son.

320
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,799
- Don't worry, Pop. Gob Bluth doesn't cave.
- Yeah, you just did for me.

321
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,335
- Well, you asked me to so I thought...
- Okay, go, go, go. It's fine.

322
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:09,668
<i>And Lindsay and Tobias
were back with the arbitrator.</i>

323
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:11,708
As you know, it is very difficult...

324
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:14,869
to establish fault in a divorce,
but one indicator is fidelity.

325
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:18,676
My client has not pursued sex
outside of this marriage.

326
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,978
- Nor in it.
- I got this one.

327
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:23,110
- Can the same be said for you?
- Oh, absolutely.

328
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,625
I've done everything to
make this marriage work.

329
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:26,053
That's interesting.

330
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:28,625
Can you tell me what your
plans are for this evening?

331
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,524
Uh, I have plans with a friend.

332
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,359
- A man? What's his name, please?
- Don't answer that.

333
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:37,525
I withdraw the question.
Why don't we stop for the day?

334
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,660
<i>So Mrs. Fünke...</i>

335
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,738
can get to her date
with her mysterious...

336
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,307
Mr. Blah-blah-blah.

337
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:47,343
At 8:30, unless you want
to sit at the bar.

338
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:49,639
<i>It was the first time
someone took Tobias's side...</i>

339
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:51,601
<i>and he wanted to thank him.</i>

340
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:53,574
<i>As much as I hate losing
Lindsay and everything...</i>

341
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,882
I feel like I'm making
a friend in you...

342
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:58,511
so I was wondering if maybe
tonight you just want to...

343
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:00,522
<i>take in a movie... or a schvitz...</i>

344
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,683
or just stay in and nest.

345
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,853
Actually, I was going to stay in my
office tonight and work on my law blog.

346
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,329
Of course...
The Bob Loblaw Law Blog.

347
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:11,492
Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful.

348
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:16,005
<i>While Tobias was trying
to get his mouth around Bob Loblaw...</i>

349
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:19,542
<i>Maeby was showing Mort Meyers
a monster of her own.</i>

350
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:21,543
Oh, that's terrifying.

351
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,772
Who did that for you,
Industrial Light & Magic?

352
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:26,679
<i>- Topelson Plastic and Silicone.
- Did he do Land of the Dead?</i>

353
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:29,344
Yeah. He's been
in Beverly Hills for years.

354
00:17:29,453 --> 00:17:32,081
<i>- Get our makeup people on it.
- And George Sr. Waited...</i>

355
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:35,124
<i>for the fake kidnapping
he knew Michael had orchestrated.</i>

356
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,720
- Don't move!
- Hey, well, let's do it.

357
00:17:40,831 --> 00:17:42,731
Get into the box, old man.

358
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,733
Oh, blankets. That's...
Who thought of that?

359
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:47,269
- That is very nice.
- Come on, get in the trunk!

360
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:49,771
What about...
What about my ankle monitor?

361
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:52,138
We have an ankle monitor deactivator.

362
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,143
Oh, good. See, I've been
meaning to get one of those.

363
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,976
I'm not gonna resist you guys because,
you know, I don't want you to beat me.

364
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:00,107
<i>But the mistreated painters...</i>

365
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:02,276
<i>were actually looking forward to that part.</i>

366
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,850
Oh! Forgot my iPod.

367
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:15,492
<i>- Start the helicopter!
- And so Michael, believing himself...</i>

368
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,729
<i>to be aided by Gob, set to work.</i>

369
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:23,102
<i>But this too produced
less-than-compelling footage.</i>

370
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,014
<i>And this is how that ended.</i>

371
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,915
Put on the sound effects.
Put on the sound effects.

372
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,011
CD... CD one. CD one.

373
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:40,852
Track two. Track two.

374
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,153
Put the hostage here by the ottoman.

375
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,353
Get it out of here.
What's it doing in here?

376
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:48,295
<i>- Ottoman out.
- And George Sr. Was released...</i>

377
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:49,872
<i>from his long journey
into the living room.</i>

378
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,368
<i>Where am I?</i>

379
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:54,699
- Colombia. Where do you think?
- And you just missed the last train...

380
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:57,296
that will come through
the jungle for three days.

381
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:59,376
- He's good.
- He's a Groundling.

382
00:18:59,476 --> 00:19:01,171
You have betrayed us,
and we will make you pay...

383
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:04,543
- and then we will go back for your sons.
- My sons? No.

384
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:07,947
They too will suffer
for your terrible decisions.

385
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,986
And you should really
pay your workers what they deserve...

386
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,987
not make them have to buy
their own supplies.

387
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,886
Not just the painting.
The sanding too.

388
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:16,619
Yeah, and the taping
is very time-consuming.

389
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:20,493
<i>Michael decided
his father was ready to learn his lesson.</i>

390
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:22,326
- And that is why...
- He's got a gun!

391
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,829
I can't let you do it! Get away!

392
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,534
Get away. I'll shoot. I will, I will.
I'll take you all out.

393
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,044
This is all fake. These
guys are painters.

394
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:31,472
I will, I will!

395
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:36,137
- Oh, God! My arm.
- Dad, you just shot off this guy...

396
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:38,146
This guy's arm.

397
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:42,241
And that's why you don't
teach your father a lesson.

398
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:45,914
Who's the stupid one now?
Thank you, Gob.

399
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:49,322
Gob? You told him?
I thought we were a team.

400
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:52,862
- It's not fun feeling stupid, is it?
- You son of a...

401
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,499
- Wait a minute. I gotta get my camera.
- Get off of me!

402
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:00,001
What is all this?
What's going on?

403
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,163
Keep it in frame.
You wanna... Cheat out.

404
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,331
- I will kill you!
- I'm gonna kill you.

405
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,341
- You're going out of frame.
- I'll kill you.

406
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:08,535
No!

407
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:10,909
Oh, my God! Michael!

408
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:15,782
Dad... It was an accident. I'm sorry.

409
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:19,515
And that's why you don't pit
Gob and me against each other.

410
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:22,353
- Yes! Yeah!
- Gob.

411
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:24,359
- You set me up.
- That's right.

412
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:28,192
- No more "boyfights."
- J. Walter Weatherman was in on it too?

413
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,562
- Right from the very start.
- So you did use him.

414
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,761
Look at this place.
Look at my home.

415
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,975
Freeze! Drop the gun.

416
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:38,189
It's okay. We're just trying
to teach this guy a lesson.

417
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,905
- Drop the gun!
- Oh, my good hand!

418
00:20:42,012 --> 00:20:44,037
<i>Buster's good hand just came...</i>

419
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:46,480
flying off.

420
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:51,577
And that's why you don't use a
one-armed person to scare someone.

421
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:56,452
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

422
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,994
<i>Maeby finds a way
to scare an entire generation.</i>

423
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:02,793
<i>This Christmas, terror has a new face.</i>

424
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,892
I'm thirsty.

425
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,268
<i>Gangy.</i>

426
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,466
<i>We should start production
on Gangy Two.</i>

427
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:13,475
Well, I know she
wanted a skin peel.
