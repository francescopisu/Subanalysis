1
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>Michael and the family attorney</i>

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,800
<i>- were visiting Buster in jail.</i>
- I take it Mother's not coming.

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,890
- Mom? No. She couldn't make it.
- Why is that?

4
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,270
She said that I could make up
whatever reason I want.

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,930
You tell me what is easiest on you.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,810
Hmm, no, it's too mean.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,270
I think you're entitled, Buster.

8
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,520
She hates you, Michael.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,780
- We'll use that one. Sure.
- Mothers cannot accept the idea

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,950
that they've raised someone
who could do something so vile.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,660
- What?
- In my case, twice. Well,

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,620
two times, allegedly. Hey.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,790
This falls under client-attorney
privilege, right? Mother's disgusted by me.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,580
- No.
- She thinks I didn't just tamper

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,840
with the evidence,
she thinks I tampered with Lucille 2.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,250
- No, no, no.
- She must think I'm guilty of murder.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,510
- Don't say that.
- Or she's busy frolicking

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,720
on the beach with Dusty,

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,760
- her trophy son.
- I should never have put

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,090
that image in your mind.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,890
The good news is,
you thought I said "frolicking."

22
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,970
I don't think it's that.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,600
She knows more than she's letting on.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,440
Like where Lucille 2 actually is.
Think about it.

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,730
She made a deal with her.

26
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,610
Or maybe she just tricked her
to leave town.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,610
I don't know,
but there is something going on,

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,150
and she needs to let that play out,

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,280
even if you need to stay in prison
a little while.

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,700
No pounding!

31
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,620
She holds the keys to my freedom,

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,120
and she won't use it
until she gets her selfish needs met.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Like when she used to lock me
in the bathroom

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,040
for grown-up selfish needs night.

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,420
- Oh, did we have a good time.
- What?

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,170
- No, it ended in tears.
- Guys, hey, let's focus.

37
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,090
I'm wondering if there is a way
we can get Mom to think

38
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,930
that the DA is onto whatever
her scheme is, like,

39
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,930
we tell Mom that the DA knows
where there is some evidence,

40
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,260
and then, Mom or Dad slip out
and try to get rid of it.

41
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,890
And then I follow them.

42
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,640
What evidence should
we say they have, Michael?

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,400
Lucille 2's head in a box?

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,070
- Spooky.
- Well, no. Hang on. That's... It's gotta be real.

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Okay, so, if it's gotta be real,

46
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,780
how about the DA is close to locating

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,120
the stair car that she was last seen on,

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,620
because they have a picture of it
from a security cam

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,660
- or traffic light cam?
- That's getting there.

50
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,960
Okay, now inside the stair car
are two heads.

51
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,840
One bald, one spiky.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,670
- Spooky.
- No. I loved it, all the way up

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,470
till the end. I think stair car's plenty.

54
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,930
- Okay.
- Why don't I have the family

55
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,470
gather at the beach cottage
about 3:00?

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,270
You call me.
You tell me you found out they've got

57
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,810
the stair car evidence, and I wait

58
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,770
for either Mom or Dad
to make their next move.

59
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,230
Any questions?

60
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,480
What's the beach cottage?

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,900
I found out, Buster.

62
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,530
- Oh.
- What a relief.

63
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,610
- Yeah.
- I almost said "the cottage."

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,450
I changed it to
"ing on the beach."

65
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,110
- It's "frolicking."
- "Frolicking."

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,490
<i>Now,
the story of a wealthy family</i>

67
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,660
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

68
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,330
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>It's </i>Arrested Development.

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,970
<i>Michael group-texted his family
to meet at the cottage,</i>

71
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,600
<i>but accidentally included...</i>

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,260
- Gangee's renting this place?
<i>- ...his son.</i>

73
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,060
No, this is her place.
It's been in the family forever.

74
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,730
They never told either of us, huh?

75
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,600
- Oh.
- Says "Maeby" here.

76
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,150
What?

77
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,980
How dare they keep track of
my height while not telling me?

78
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,030
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,860
So, how did it go with Rebel's family?

80
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,910
You guys seem
really buddy-buddy on Instagram.

81
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,240
<i>I also saw that that hair thing backfired,
huh?</i>

82
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,080
Yeah, it was great.
I mean, they're just such a nice...

83
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,870
I don't want to use "family,"
'cause they like each other,

84
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,540
but they're a nice group of people.

85
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,340
I think I really like her.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,420
Isn't it still weird with your dad?

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,170
Well, maybe that was just me.

88
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,720
I'm worried she might have been seeing
her ex all summer.

89
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,720
- Your dad?
- No, no. On the movie set,

90
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,720
down in Mexico.

91
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,680
Didn't your dad say
he was down in Mexico, too?

92
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,850
- They shoot a lot of things there.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,900
It was fun. I'm not gonna see her
for the next few days,

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,940
'cause she's going
to Mexico for reshoots.

95
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,730
Reshoots? Oof.

96
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,450
She must not be a very good
actress, huh?

97
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,910
Hope she gets it right this time.

98
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,700
Well, she's not perfect, but, uh,

99
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,950
it doesn't turn my stomach
to see her eat an ice cream cone.

100
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,000
Speaking of that,
how are things with Stan?

101
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,460
Did he finish that ice cream cone
after I looked away?

102
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,040
I don't know.
I threw away all the ice cream.

103
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,630
But, not to make you jealous,

104
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,130
turns out we <i>are </i>dating.

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,050
For some reason,
he wants to wait till after the election

106
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,760
to be what he likes to call "intimate."

107
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,720
<i>In fact, Stan was waiting
so there would be no scandal...</i>

108
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,730
You gotta try this new eyebrow glue.
You can eat soup again.

109
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,770
<i>...especially once his daughter
joined the race.</i>

110
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,600
Have you thought about what I asked?

111
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,190
You have to run for office.

112
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,110
You said we couldn't risk it,

113
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,400
with... with Lucille 2 missing.

114
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,320
That's the best part. She's gone.

115
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,530
I'm dating this woman
who's a gossip hound.

116
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,830
Somehow, she got intel that
Lindsay Bluth has skipped town.

117
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,410
- But the Bluths are running her anyway.
- Oh.

118
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,790
It would be nice to oppose
Lindsay's sudden interest

119
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,630
in building this awful border wall.

120
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,340
Which was my idea.

121
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,840
I have to say, Dad,

122
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,420
I'm surprised you're taking
such an interest in this race.

123
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,470
If you tried the new eyebrow glue,
you could <i>look </i>surprised, too.

124
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,970
<i>He expects sex
after the election?</i>

125
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,600
What are you gonna do?
That's in two days.

126
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
I know. I mean,
I can't let the guy see me naked,

127
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,810
'cause, not to brag, but, you know,

128
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,610
there's not a lot of 75-year-old women
who got a body like this.

129
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,860
- You know?
- I don't think that's bragging.

130
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,820
Wow.
Well, I guess you are jealous, huh?

131
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,610
I'm waiting to hear from Barry,

132
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,740
so I don't have
too much new information.

133
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,290
Uh, Barry's probably trying to mitigate
the damage you caused

134
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,500
by taunting Buster with a skinhead.

135
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,540
Okay,
you gotta blame Buster for that.

136
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,880
Say what you will about Ron Howard
as a filmmaker,

137
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,130
but the man is not a Nazi sympathizer.

138
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,130
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- I've heard things

139
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,720
about what's really going on
in that Grinch movie he made.

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
You know, that anti-Christmas thing,
with the Who-ish people?

141
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,470
I don't know what you want me to say.

142
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,310
I offered to talk to the DA.
You shot that down.

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,850
Lottie-Dottie-DA?
Oh, she's a shark, Michael.

144
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,520
I don't want you swimming
anywhere near her.

145
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Especially after you tried
to drown yourself

146
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,150
in the bay the other day. We're sticking with that, huh?

147
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,030
Mom, if you're not gonna bail out Buster,

148
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,990
- you can visit.
- And risk having

149
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,240
a story come out
that I went to a prison

150
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,580
to visit my son before the election?

151
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,580
That would be bad for Lindsay's campaign.

152
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,330
So the plan is to run her,
even though she's not here?

153
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,500
- Yes.
- Got it.

154
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,460
Especially now that Sally's in the race.

155
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,210
Tobias better find Lindsay
before the 4th of July parade,

156
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,880
which is on the 2nd.

157
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,420
- The 4th of July parade is on the 2nd?
- Mm.

158
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,970
Yes. They moved it
because they don't want the Hispanics

159
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,930
to get even by using up
all the supplies a day early

160
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,390
like we do with Cinco.

161
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,890
Yeah, and good luck using
the 4th of July fireworks on the 3rd,

162
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,810
because we will have done it
on the 2nd.

163
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,320
By the way, guys,
as far as the Bluth company float goes,

164
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,570
I bet you guys are thinking, uh,
will he, won't he?

165
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,360
- "Willy Wondy?"
- Who's Willy Wondy?

166
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,450
"Will he, won't he"
do magic on our float.

167
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,030
- Won't he.
- Tony?

168
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,990
- Did you say Tony?
- Won't he.

169
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,210
Wonder. What? Why are you trying
to say "Tony Wonder"?

170
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,870
- No one's saying Tony...
- Stay out of it!

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,170
Why are you saying Tony Wonder?
Is he doing a trick?

172
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,290
No one's saying that

173
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,460
- or asking anything.
- Good.

174
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,760
Let's keep it that way.

175
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,470
Anyway, you're probably saying
or wondering... Now I'm doing it.

176
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,890
...why I won't be doing
a magic show on our float.

177
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,520
And the answer is:

178
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,230
because I've been asked
to do so on another float.

179
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,690
A great company, Laguna Closet
Conversions. Know those guys?

180
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,070
It's not what you think.

181
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,780
They, like, convert closets
to, like, organize and stuff.

182
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,280
Who would think anything different?

183
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,030
<i>This geo-bead would.</i>

184
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,540
So, what do we have to do
to get you into a closet, huh?

185
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,160
Wow, you guys don't mince words,
huh?

186
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,130
<i>After realizing his friendship
with Tony Wonder was over...</i>

187
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,040
<i>I don't think we can hang out.</i>

188
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,720
<i>...Gob, desperate to push
his feelings back into the closet,</i>

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,590
<i>decided conversion therapy
was the only answer.</i>

190
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,350
- We're different.
- <i>Although, it's worth noting</i>

191
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,930
<i>he didn't do a lot of research.</i>

192
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,930
<i>Plus, it's great
for your resale value.</i>

193
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,810
How's your resale value now?

194
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,150
<i>Gob didn't want to let on
that he didn't know</i>

195
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,270
<i>what "resale value" was gay slang for.</i>

196
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,980
I've never had any complaints.

197
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,740
Let's talk about you.
The more we know about you,

198
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,740
the happier you're gonna be
with your results.

199
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,740
I love Tony Wonder.

200
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,910
I guess you want the details.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,290
- Anyway, it's...
- <i>Gob told the closet salesmen</i>

202
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,040
<i>all about his night with Tony,</i>

203
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,340
<i>and how devastated he was
by being ghosted.</i>

204
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,300
...Michael walked in,
I had to waste my roofie...

205
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,590
But he doesn't remember...
Him, with my...

206
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,930
I guess that's how we're different,
in the same way.

207
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,640
We should put him

208
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,640
in the Catalina cedar walk-in

209
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,770
with the pocket doors
and the floor lighting.

210
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,980
<i>And that's when Gob
realized his mistake.</i>

211
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,110
<i>But keep in mind,
we edited, like, an hour out of this.</i>

212
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,820
What are the confidentiality laws
concerning people

213
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,330
who walk into a closet store?

214
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,250
<i>They're kind of sane
and, you know, they just,</i>

215
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,160
they listen, they're good...
and they work for us

216
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,290
'cause I bought the company.

217
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,960
Ah. Oh.

218
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,920
Hang on, this might be him. It is.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,340
- Barry.
- <i>Michael, I'm calling you,</i>

220
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,880
<i>I've got new info. It can be whatever</i>

221
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,840
you want to say, I'm saying.

222
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,010
I understand, so you are saying...

223
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,680
<i>I'm not saying anything.</i>

224
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,640
- I didn't think I had to.
<i>- I see.</i>

225
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,270
- What does that mean, "discovered"?
- <i>Oh, they're listening, right?</i>

226
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,650
If they're listening, just say "dogshit."

227
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,360
Mm. What you said, I would repeat,

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,530
but the family is here,
and I want to make sure

229
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,030
- that I don't get it wrong.
<i>- Get it wrong?</i>

230
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,740
<i>- Say "dogshit."</i>
- Apparently, they know

231
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,450
where the stair car is,
and they might even know

232
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,410
where Lucille 2 is,
which means they will talk to her,

233
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,580
and we'll get all this sorted out.

234
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,080
- Did I get that right?
- <i>Well, with two heads in it.</i>

235
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,590
One spiky one and one bald one.

236
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,340
<i>No, that's plenty.</i>

237
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,670
- Thank you. Good job, Barry.
<i>- Know what's funny?</i>

238
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,390
In the 30 years that
I've represented this family,

239
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,050
<i>that is the first time anyone
has said "good j..."</i>

240
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,720
Well, listen.

241
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,180
If that's all true,

242
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,730
they might be closer to figuring
this out than we thought.

243
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,440
<i>And now,
Michael had to just sit back</i>

244
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,900
<i>and wait for something
out of the ordinary to happen.</i>

245
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,860
I'm gonna take off.

246
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,990
And I'll check back on you later
and we can, uh...

247
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,990
Um, can I speak to you privately
for a moment?

248
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh. Yeah?

249
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,450
You need to speak privately?

250
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,330
Oh, it's just so mundane.
I don't want to bore everyone.

251
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,710
- It's just so mundane.
- I'll get out of your hair.

252
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,000
<i>And Michael went
to stake out the parking lot.</i>

253
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,750
- Hey, Dad. Wait. You're leaving?
- Hey.

254
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,210
You never even said hello.

255
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,050
- Yeah, I just...
- Or good-bye.

256
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,970
- Thank you for coming out.
- I was glad to come out

257
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,260
because I have some good news.

258
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,310
Um, do you still need
that 50 grand for Buster's bail?

259
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,060
Because I can get that
from the business.

260
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,690
No. No, no, no, no. I told you
I'm not gonna be taking your money.

261
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,690
And it's 75 grand
that I'm not gonna be taking

262
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,940
because the bail went up.

263
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,860
Buster tried to strangle a, uh...

264
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,320
Well, he technically
did strangle a skinhead.

265
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
- Very cool.
- I guess, in a way.

266
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,370
Now that we're talking about money,
I want to tell you,

267
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,410
I couldn't be more proud
of what you've been able

268
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,500
to do with the Fakeblock thing.

269
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,120
But with this kind of success,
it puts a target on your back.

270
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,960
People are gonna think,
"Here comes the next Steve Gobs."

271
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,090
- They're gonna want...
- Jobs.

272
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,130
Jobs, for sure,
but they're also gonna want money.

273
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,590
And don't be throwing it away.
Not just to family.

274
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,550
Be careful with friends, too.

275
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,010
New friends,
a girlfriend that might be trying

276
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,300
to slow things down.
Isn't that what you...

277
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,260
Isn't that how you described it?

278
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,600
- With Rebel?
- Huh? Yeah.

279
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,850
She just works a lot.
She's in Mexico right now.

280
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,230
But we're better than ever.

281
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,730
Actually, that money that I mentioned?
That was from Rebel.

282
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,860
You know, to be a friend and support me.

283
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Oh, boy. There's some of that
Hollywood BS. There it is.

284
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,780
Right there.
That's how they use people.

285
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,740
That's the culture there,
and I want to make sure

286
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,320
you don't give too much away. Don't change yourself.

287
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,620
You don't change your look

288
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,830
to be a part of the gang.

289
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,460
You talking about my hair?

290
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,880
Why'd you dye your hair?

291
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,340
Come on.

292
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,670
<i>George Michael
couldn't tell his father</i>

293
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,170
<i>that he'd attempted
to dye his hair pink</i>

294
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,090
<i>- to push Rebel away.</i>
- Um...

295
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,510
Yeah, I guess, you know,

296
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,890
so... so Rebel would think
that I was cool.

297
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,970
- I see.
- Look at this.

298
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,100
Three generations of Bluths
in one place.

299
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,850
Anybody have a camera?

300
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,230
- On my phone.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,270
Oh, no.

302
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,020
It's a figure of speech. I gotta run.

303
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,490
Where you off to, Dad?
I could run some errands.

304
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,570
- Need a hop on?
- No, thanks.

305
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,910
Personal business. Heading northward.

306
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,830
Okay. I'm actually
complete opposite direction.

307
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,240
Where you heading, Dad?

308
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,580
Uh, west.

309
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,170
Well, I'll hang out with you
at the, uh, beach.

310
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,130
Oh, uh... No.
Why did I say west?

311
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,210
East is where I'm going.
Northeast. Northeast, actually.

312
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,050
I'm going up to Search campus.

313
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,800
I love the idea of you going to the beach.
Do that.

314
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,260
Make sure
it doesn't turn your hair red again.

315
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,930
And, Dad... Well, he's gone.
Okay, I gotta go.

316
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,020
How'd you know I had red hair?

317
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,560
- Did you see it on Instagram?
- Yes.

318
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,230
I did. I did. I did.

319
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,190
I just didn't want to embarrass you.

320
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,650
Showed up on my e-mail
this morning.

321
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,320
So you use Instagram?

322
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,700
Mm-mm. No, no.
Your uncle showed it to me.

323
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,790
You know me. I'm a 20th-century guy.

324
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,620
You can keep that futuristic stuff.

325
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,790
Okay?

326
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,710
Okay. Prismo.

327
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,750
Begin.

328
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,040
User, Michael Bluth. Lost my keys.

329
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,380
Okay, Prismo, reverse.

330
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,550
<i>I will. And how was...</i>

331
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,260
- <i>Mom's fucking cottage</i>
- <i>...with Gob.</i>

332
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,180
<i>And so,
a suspicious Michael took off</i>

333
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,550
<i>after his father...</i>

334
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,980
- He was there.
- <i>...while his own son...</i>

335
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,650
Where are you going?

336
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,940
<i>...found himself
feeling suspicious as well.</i>

337
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
<i>And Barry</i>

338
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,490
<i>showed up at the cottage
to make sure</i>

339
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,740
<i>the scheme had worked.</i>

340
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,070
You are here. Why was Michael

341
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,740
- so stingy with the dogshit?
- What are you doing here?

342
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,580
Was Michael lying about talking
to you on the phone just now?

343
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,040
Oh, no. That was me.

344
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,380
I just wanted to see
how Michael was enjoying

345
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
- knowing about the cottage.
- You want to know

346
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,260
if we fell for Michael's
and your little trap.

347
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,880
It was a trap, wasn't it?

348
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,630
You're wrong.
Why would I do that?

349
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,260
Because he paid your bail
and threatened

350
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,300
to make trouble if you didn't play along.

351
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,430
You're right.

352
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,430
I knew it.

353
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,640
The DA has a picture of the stair car?

354
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,020
Like Lucille 2 would be stupid enough

355
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,310
to disappear in a truck
with her name on it?

356
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,770
- What kind of lie is that?
- I totally agree with you.

357
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,280
A good lie is head in a box,

358
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,650
but they wanted
to go with something real,

359
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,280
so we went with the evidence
they actually had.

360
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
This is real?

361
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,250
Yeah, and he doesn't want
to use the best part, the two heads.

362
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,250
One spiky, one bald.

363
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,790
Lucille 2 and Oscar.

364
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,380
That idiot.
I told him to keep her out of sight.

365
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,210
Speaking of out of sight,

366
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
do you know where your husband is
with that Winnebago?

367
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,180
Because since I got
out of prison,

368
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,720
George is letting me stay there,
without him knowing it.

369
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,470
- I don't know where he went.
- Hmm.

370
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,520
Maybe he went to find Oscar,
warn him about the picture.

371
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,140
You think he really did?

372
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,650
I think the prosecution
gave us this picture

373
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,190
so that George or you
would lead them to Lucille 2.

374
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,150
Go find him. Track him down.

375
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,400
Get to him before he finds Lucille 2.

376
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,030
I will not let that woman steal
everything I've taken from her.

377
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,710
<i>George Sr. turned south
on Coast Highway,</i>

378
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,500
<i>unaware he was being followed
by Michael,</i>

379
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,210
<i>unaware </i>he <i>was being followed
by George Michael.</i>

380
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,850
- <i>Maeby? Hello?</i>
- I think my phone's ringing.

381
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>Maeby. Hello?
Come on. Hello?</i>

382
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,020
- Hello?
- <i>It's me.</i>

383
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,150
<i>I know you're not old. Can we have a system
where I don't have to wait the 40 seconds?</i>

384
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,780
Look, I have to be careful, okay?

385
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,490
These are not tech-savvy people.

386
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,450
The other day,
I turned the lounge TV on,

387
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,910
and now that's my job.

388
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,240
They call me "Buttons" now. Buttons.

389
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,830
- He's going to meet Rebel.
- <i>Who? Your dad?</i>

390
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,000
I think you were right.

391
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,160
<i>They were together in Mexico,
and that's why</i>

392
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,580
<i>my dad has been weird with me.</i>

393
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,750
Wow, I was just "specu-lying."

394
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,540
<i>Well, you nailed it, Buttons.</i>

395
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,090
And he probably made plans
to see her this time in Mexico

396
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,380
when I said my relationship
was slowing down.

397
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,510
You know,
it's hard to believe because...

398
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,220
my niece always told me

399
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,220
<i>never to give away
my Social Security number,</i>

400
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,720
but if it really is
a free trip to Aruba...

401
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,310
Oh, you have to go, Buttons.

402
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,980
Sign me up!

403
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,690
Peg's walking by.

404
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,270
<i>No, you have to.</i>

405
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,400
He lied about being
at the Howard barbecue. He was there.

406
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,400
Wow, and I thought my parents
were the selfish ones.

407
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,160
At least my mom never tried to sleep
with somebody I was da...

408
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,580
Oh, wait. No. Steve Holt.

409
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Uh, but he's family.

410
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,660
We've got to stop the lying
in this family.

411
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,120
<i>Tell me about it.
You tell one little story</i>

412
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,130
to get a place to live.
Next thing you know,

413
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,960
you're sorting through
your roommate's pills

414
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,710
to figure out which one
will kill his sex drive.

415
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,760
- Like estrogen?
- <i>Wait, that's a thing?</i>

416
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,300
I mean, I was just day plotting.

417
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,140
Stop right there.
The minute you start talking

418
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
about neutering your romantic partner,

419
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,520
<i>you're into shit
that even Gangee wouldn't do.</i>

420
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,890
The monster or the grandmother?

421
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>The monster.
But, yeah, I don't think</i> our grandmother would do that.

422
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,810
<i>Yeah, maybe it is too far.
I guess I can just</i>

423
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,650
pretend like I have an illness
where I forget everything.

424
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,110
<i>Like Alzheimer's?</i>

425
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,700
That's a thing, too?
I was just crime-storming.

426
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,160
You know, just lying out loud.
How funny.

427
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,490
<i>Gob was having trouble</i>

428
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,540
<i>forgetting someone himself.</i>

429
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,500
Okay? Now you're gonna be
in the closet...

430
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,210
<i>Which was why he was distracted</i>

431
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,670
<i>as the closet guys helped him
with his parade float illusion.</i>

432
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,090
Sorry. I'm still really torn up
about this love affair with Tony,

433
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,430
which, if you guys mention,
you're fired.

434
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,340
We can't change
your feelings, okay?

435
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,260
But we can change whether Tony
is in your life.

436
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,480
After you left,
we got to talking about you, and...

437
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,890
You're a magician,

438
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,650
he's a magician...
Go double magician.

439
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,520
Two guys, one trick.
Do an act together.

440
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,940
God.
Why are all the cute ones so dumb?

441
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,570
Look, guys, this is not that hard.

442
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,780
I am pretending to be
a Christian magician.

443
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,910
Tony's pretending
to be a gay magician.

444
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
We're like oil and vinegar.

445
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,160
What trick is gonna have room for both?

446
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,290
Yes, everyone could be smarter,
that's true,

447
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,130
but what we meant was that

448
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,510
we could book you <i>and </i>Tony
to do a trick on our float.

449
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,720
Yeah. A classic two-fister.

450
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,930
An old-fashioned will he, won't he?

451
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,970
We're just gonna need the perfect trick.

452
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,850
We're wasting daylight.
Let's do this.

453
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,360
What did we decide on?
Sorry, I...

454
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,360
<i>And soon, George Sr. arrived
at the border...</i>

455
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,400
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Dad.</i>

456
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,740
<i>...two cars ahead of...</i>

457
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,950
Michael. I thought I'd give you a call,
see how the drive

458
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,160
<i>- north is going.</i>
- Oh, it's fine.

459
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,370
<i>I took Highway 5,
so there's, you know, no view,</i>

460
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,750
but there's no traffic.

461
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,380
<i>What's the bell?</i>

462
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,670
Oh, there's this Salvation Army
Santa Claus guy

463
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,880
who's just going from car to car here.

464
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,380
Ice cream?

465
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,140
<i>Stop screaming
and get off the highway!</i>

466
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,430
Oh, there's an Andersen's Pea Soup,

467
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,640
so I think I'm gonna buy him soup.

468
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,430
<i>That's George Michael.
I gotta go.</i>

469
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,480
I hope that I'm half the father
to him that you are to me.

470
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,860
You're embarrassing me.

471
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,400
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- You should be.

472
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,400
George Michael.

473
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,820
<i>Hey,
where are you?</i>

474
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,950
I'm approaching,
uh, Andersen's Pea Soup.

475
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,200
<i>Oh, that's north.
You said you were going northeast.</i>

476
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,620
Well, I'm headed north,
then I'm headed east.

477
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,710
Otherwise you don't
pass the Andersen's P.S.

478
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,750
Oh, right.

479
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,750
<i>Michael felt doubly guilty</i>

480
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,800
<i>for not just telling a lie,
but stealing one.</i>

481
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,760
- What's that bell?
- <i>That's, uh,</i>

482
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,760
we got a Danish girl ringing a bell

483
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,430
- in front of, uh, A's Pea Soup.
- Ice cream?

484
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,760
Ice cream?
What's that about ice cream?

485
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,230
<i>No, thank you. Uh, </i>nein, danke.

486
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,890
Big boy, I gotta go. Okay?

487
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,980
<i>- I'll talk to you later.</i>
- Love you.

488
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,860
<i>They made their way
through the border crossing.</i>

489
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,070
Next one.

490
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,910
Oh.

491
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,950
He's going to Father B's.

492
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,950
<i>Which, to Barry,
could only mean one thing.</i>

493
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,910
I have time for an ice cream.

494
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,040
- Ice cream!
- <i>In fact,</i>

495
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,250
<i>George Sr. was returning to property</i>

496
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,130
<i>he used as a motivational
retreat called Father B's</i>

497
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,050
<i>for the first time in months.</i>

498
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,760
<i>And, unseen, Michael snuck
into his blind spot.</i>

499
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,180
Of course this is where
they'd hide Lucille 2.

500
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,110
- Mm.
- Hey.

501
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,780
How'd Santa like his pea soup?

502
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,870
Michael, uh...
What are you doing here?

503
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,210
Figuring out why you lied
about where you were going.

504
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,290
I didn't want you to know.
I was embarrassed.

505
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,550
I would've been embarrassed
if I was making Buster rot in prison,

506
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,920
while I was hiding Lucille
down in Mexico.

507
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,800
Hiding Lucille?
What are you talking about?

508
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,050
I set you up.
I told you that the DA

509
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,100
found the stair car.
You took the bait and you had

510
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
that private conversation with Mom.
She said to you,

511
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,680
"Make sure Lucille 2 stays hidden."
Did she not say that?

512
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,310
- Tell me she didn't.
- <i>She didn't.</i>

513
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,770
- It's so mundane.
<i>-</i> Let me get out of your hair.

514
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,980
<i>Lucille had something else
on her mind.</i>

515
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,360
I know you said
you wanted to check in on me,

516
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,240
and I have plans with Dusty,

517
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,700
and I didn't want you
to find us together

518
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,120
and get your feelings
hurt tonight.

519
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,660
So you want to hurt my feelings
now instead?

520
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,500
- To get it out of the way.
- Is that it, or are you afraid

521
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,460
- I'll tear him in two?
- Hey.

522
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,580
If you could tear anything in two,
you'd still have a shot at me.

523
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,380
Okay, you want to see
a real man, you're going to.

524
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,720
I know. I just didn't want you
to see me with him.

525
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
Don't cry.

526
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,100
Then,

527
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,810
what are you doing down here?

528
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,890
This is where the curse began.

529
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,600
This is where that guy
turned me into Oscar, and Oscar...

530
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,570
- into me.
- Mm.

531
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,530
<i>Years earlier,
when Oscar introduced</i>

532
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,190
<i>George Sr. to maca...</i> The strong will become the weak,

533
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,950
the weak will become the strong.

534
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,660
<i>...the brothers had
an ominous vision.</i>

535
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,580
Probably so they can build
a border wall.

536
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,790
They want to separate...

537
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,410
<i>Which is what
Lindsay's boyfriend</i>

538
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,910
<i>wanted them to think.</i>

539
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,790
You don't believe that maca
does all this crap, do you?

540
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,340
George!

541
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,590
- You see that?
- I have something for you!

542
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,840
Great spirit,
that's why I'm here!

543
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,010
My son doesn't believe.

544
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,180
Please, take his strength,
and give it to me!

545
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,230
- Take it easy.
- No, it's me, Tobias.

546
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,480
Fünke. I'm still legally
recognized as your son-in-law.

547
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,480
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Humorous anecdote.

548
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,070
Oh.

549
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,360
Ugh... Come...

550
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,240
One...

551
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,160
Here... here it comes.

552
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,750
<i>Well, maybe I'll jump in here.</i>

553
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,340
<i>After being kicked off
Father B's land,</i>

554
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,710
<i>the men finally found their way
to Marky Bark's trailer.</i>

555
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,930
It was worth it. Now you know
how to do a proper spit take.

556
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,100
Now, if Lindsay's here,
let me do the talking.

557
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,100
Hello?

558
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,100
- No water.
- Oh, uh,

559
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,810
we're looking for Lindsay.

560
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,810
Lindsay? That dumb blonde slut

561
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,480
my moron son keeps calling
every five minutes

562
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,520
since she came back
on Cinco de Mayo?

563
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,280
Yes, yes, my wife.

564
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,530
- Nice girl, but you just missed her.
- Oh.

565
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,110
Well, uh, could we wait here
until she gets back?

566
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,280
Normally, I would say no,
but the ostriches

567
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,450
have been making a hell
of a mess this past year.

568
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,750
How's your gag reflex?

569
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,250
Well, if you mean is my son anything

570
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,710
like his father, well,
he's never had any complaints.

571
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,880
<i>And Tobias explained
what happened next.</i>

572
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,300
I...

573
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,390
I got it... hey, hey... I... One...

574
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,310
<i>Okay, well, so...
Tobias, also, was given a job.</i>

575
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,680
The mail's been piling up.
You can start at Father B's.

576
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh, no, no, I can't go there.

577
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,730
They held me up
at gunpoint,

578
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,400
so you'll understand
if I pass on going back.

579
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,770
If you're that worried,

580
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,230
you can wear the ostrich suit.

581
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,440
Mark always did.

582
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,280
Oh, fun.

583
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
If you pass out,
it keeps buzzards off your eyes.

584
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,410
Double fun!

585
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,660
Tuna fish... sandwich.

586
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,080
So, I got a job delivering mail
for the day.

587
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,830
Yes, I suppose I could've told you that
from up there,

588
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,790
but I <i>am </i>glad to see you,

589
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,170
uh, 'cause your mail certainly
has been piling up.

590
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,380
And this is my last delivery,
so I get to put on my human clothes.

591
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,890
Adios, muchachos.

592
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,430
Oh, my Viagra.

593
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,260
See, and this used to work.

594
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,020
Since when is Viagra pink?

595
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,060
Your mom says that the Medicare
only does the generic.

596
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,600
You know, this is estrogen.

597
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,440
- Really?
- How long you been taking that?

598
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,400
Uh, two years.

599
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,110
Two years. Isn't that about
the time that Mom was in jail

600
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,150
and started, uh...

601
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,490
- Forwarding my mail.
- Yeah. Why do you think she did that?

602
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,200
Maybe she figured that
if she was gonna do hard time,

603
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,290
I should do... Soft time. Yeah.

604
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,080
But that doesn't explain Oscar.

605
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,250
He has my mojo,
and all he eats is maca.

606
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,380
And, actually,
it's this particular maca

607
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
that grows all over this gully.

608
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,380
- Down the hill from that.
- Yeah.

609
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,300
It's from when I was running
the executive training camp.

610
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,930
Boy, talk about guys high
on testosterone.

611
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,140
I wish I could get
some of what they were on. Yeah. Sounds like Oscar has.

612
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,900
♪ <i>Coincidence? </i>♪

613
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,320
<i>Having kept a safe distance,</i>

614
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,200
<i>George Michael soon arrived
at Father B's ranch.</i>

615
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,820
How is the Pea Soup Andersen's
pea soup, Dad?

616
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,330
<i>Assuming his father was
inside the Winnebago with Rebel,</i>

617
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,790
<i>he rang her to catch her off guard

618
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,250
- Hey, where are you?
- <i>In Culver City.</i>

619
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,170
- I thought you were in Mexico.
<i>- No, my character's in Mexico.</i>

620
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,010
- I'm in Culver City.
<i>- Oh.</i>

621
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,260
<i>- I'm on set.</i>
- I see.

622
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,060
<i>All right, well, then,
I guess all that's left to say is</i>

623
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,470
lights, camera,

624
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,430
action!

625
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,400
Always so lovely to hear your voice.

626
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,020
<i>George Michael knew
he had made a horrible mistake,</i>

627
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,440
<i>and knew he had to get out
of there before anyone saw him.</i>

628
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,320
<i>But he couldn't
get to his car unseen</i>

629
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,410
<i>now that Barry had arrived.</i>

630
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,870
<i>With the coast clear,
George Michael made for an exit</i>

631
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,960
<i>to avoid running into his father...</i>

632
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,870
I can't believe
you're suspicious.

633
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,000
<i>...who was behind him.</i>

634
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,090
You have to trust me.
I don't know where Lucille 2 is.

635
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,210
Dad, trust

636
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,340
is a two-way street. Okay?

637
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,010
That's Lucille 2's car.

638
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,510
I swear to you, I didn't know
she was here. I...

639
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
You're probably not impotent, either.

640
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,810
- We should be following her.
- Get in the Anustart,

641
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,390
and I'll follow. Go.

642
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,520
Follow Lucille 2.
If we get her, Buster goes free.

643
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,940
Ooh, triple fun.

644
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,700
<i>And so, Michael rushed after
Lucille 2's Cadillac</i>

645
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,580
<i>with Tobias at the wheel,</i>

646
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,620
<i>which only made his son more
desperate to lose his father.</i>

647
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,470
<i>Yet, none of them saw
the spike strips.</i>

648
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,550
Oh!

649
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,850
I'm okay.

650
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,890
The bathroom doesn't work back here,

651
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,390
so I peed in a Wetzel bag.

652
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,730
What are you doing here?

653
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,270
I live here.

654
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,900
<i>And the family that
was chasing itself for no reason...</i>

655
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,400
<i>soon had a reason to stop.</i>

656
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,490
- George Michael? What are you doing?
- Uh...

657
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,830
Three, four, five, six, seven,
eight flat tires?

658
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,200
- Yeah.
- Who do we sue?

659
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,040
You, until we find out
who put down the spike strips.

660
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,880
That would be us!

661
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,920
Hyah! <i>Ándale.</i>

662
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,630
Oh. Hi.

663
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,890
We're sorry
about the spike strips,

664
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,260
but we can't always
personally patrol our land.

665
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,020
<i>Your </i>land?

666
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,390
This is Bluth land.

667
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,230
This has been Romney land

668
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,900
since my great-grandfather
