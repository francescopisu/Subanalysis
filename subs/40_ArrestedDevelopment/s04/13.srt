1
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,654
George Michael Bluth had never been

2
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,156
more popular. No.

3
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,699
He was surrounded by people

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,285
who were thrilled to be in his company.

5
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:19,744
Carlos was just... tickling me.

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,454
They're almost out of root beer.

7
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,498
So I got you one with
the last bit of root beer

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,209
because I remember that
somebody was saying that, um,

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,626
George Michael likes root beer.

10
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:28,503
And as his business was taking off...

11
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:30,005
I do. Thanks a lot.

12
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,715
You guys don't have to
do all this, you know?

13
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:32,883
This was just a little
get-together for my girlfriend

14
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:34,759
to show her I'm doing well, you know?

15
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,094
- ... So was his romantic life.
- Show her I'm an adult.

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,304
Hey, stop it!

17
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:38,680
You're dead, man, you are so dead.

18
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,724
That was the last root beer snow cone.

19
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:42,142
I got that for him, Carlos.

20
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,643
Teach you for being such a kiss ass, Terry.

21
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:44,895
And it was an ex-Bluth Company employee...

22
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,730
Come on, you guys, not cool.

23
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,773
Who was the most grateful
to be in his company.

24
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,901
- Want any of these?
- No, I'm fine.

25
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:53,028
You know, I really appreciate
you guys doing all this.

26
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,155
I just wish I understood...

27
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:56,823
why.

28
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:59,159
That's why... because you could ask us

29
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:01,078
why we do this, and mean it.

30
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,122
The fact that you could
be so down to earth...

31
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,623
And look so young.

32
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,584
While you're starting this giant company.

33
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,669
You created an opportunity many of us

34
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,462
thought we'd never have again.

35
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:15,508
See that's the part I
don't understand, Carlos.

36
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,177
You know my name! What's his name?

37
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,720
- You're the kiss-ass, Carlos.
- What's his name?

38
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:20,138
Okay, guys, I'm gonna learn all your names.

39
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,681
- I promise.
- George.

40
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,350
- And that's when he heard what
- Rebel.

41
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,560
- Had become his name.
- What is all this?

42
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,895
Oh, it's just a little surprise.

43
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:28,605
- You did this for me?
- Yes!

44
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,399
Well... well, they did it for me, but...

45
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,318
but only because they knew I
wanted to do something for you.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,113
Maybe we could talk without your friends.

47
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:37,614
I mean, these guys aren't
really my friends, you know.

48
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:38,823
I barely know their names.

49
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,825
I mean, I know Carlos, but...

50
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,536
only because of that old song
"Carlos the Tickle Monster."

51
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:45,080
Wait, what song is that?

52
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,540
Oh, god, I knew he made that up.

53
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,418
But it did help me remember.

54
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,961
Anyway, don't worry about these
guys... they're not listening

55
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,379
to a word we're saying.

56
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:53,422
How about that kiss?

57
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,839
We need to talk.

58
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,011
Now the story of a family

59
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,513
whose future was abruptly cancelled

60
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,891
and the one son who had no choice

61
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:07,144
but to keep himself together.

62
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,858
It's George Michael's Arrested Development.

63
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,738
George Michael's life was very different

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,740
months before developing

65
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:22,326
the software program that would

66
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,244
change his life.

67
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,413
♪ Those balls in the air ♪

68
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:30,250
♪ Those balls in the air. ♪

69
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,545
And...

70
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,589
that's where the song should've ended.

71
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,633
So I guess we all got
a little carried away.

72
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,760
Are you sure? We all
ended at the same time.

73
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,762
Yeah, well, it's because
you all sped up together.

74
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,014
Now, you know if I was

75
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,556
playing in your band, I would say,

76
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,225
"Hey, you know, let's do
the whole fast and loose

77
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,393
with tempo thing."

78
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,436
But this is about my demo tape

79
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:50,519
to Juilliard and they've got

80
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:52,147
to dig what I do so much

81
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,316
that they start an entire
department for wood block.

82
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,692
So I'm sorry guys.

83
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,152
And you're leaving, okay.

84
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:58,153
They left early.

85
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,696
Proves my point.

86
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,906
She was cute.

87
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,241
They were playing way
too loud anyway, right?

88
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,284
Could you even hear the wood block?

89
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,452
Right at the end.

90
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:07,371
We could record you separately,

91
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,705
and then mix it louder on the computer.

92
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:10,207
Well, then I'm not playing in a band.

93
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:11,875
I mean, the whole point of the band

94
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,793
is to showcase my amazing internal clock.

95
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,586
You know, that's something
you have to be born with.

96
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,088
Or bred with.

97
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,216
Which was the case with George Michael.

98
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:22,219
Who, as a small child,
appeared in a promotional video

99
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,429
for a developmental tool called "BabyTock"

100
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,474
BabyTock! will give your
child a head start at math.

101
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:30,435
And if I were a doctor,
I would guarantee you

102
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:34,022
that it would also boost
their brain power 110%.

103
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:36,900
That's a lot of brain power.

104
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,277
You've been using BabyTock!, correct?

105
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,571
- For how long?
- For two months.

106
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,949
But George Michael really
enjoys listening to the sound.

107
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,784
And would you say it's...

108
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,037
changed the power of his brain?

109
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,331
Uh, well, that's impossible...

110
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,291
To deny.

111
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,877
I've always wanted a smart baby.

112
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,962
This thing really works, George.

113
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,257
In fact it came from something that didn't.

114
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:04,428
So we're stuck with 5,000 of
these worthless corn-ballers?

115
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,971
When they were looking to
recoup some of their costs

116
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,640
after an ill-fated foray

117
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:12,143
into the fry-at-home snack-food market.

118
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,103
Whoa, whoa.

119
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,854
They're not worthless.

120
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,773
You know? The timer still works.

121
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:19,359
There's no numbers on it,
but it's very loud, so...

122
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:22,695
Perfect for those who
like the sound of a clock,

123
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,072
but don't know their numbers.

124
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,407
That's good.

125
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,534
We'll sell this to baby...

126
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:29,619
Mother of!

127
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,704
We should put these in cribs.

128
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:33,623
That's not a half puny thought.

129
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:34,916
And that Julliard thing is

130
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,126
confidential from my Dad by the way.

131
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,544
He's never gonna want me to pursue

132
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,588
- a career in...
- Hitting a block of wood.

133
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,381
Music, yes

134
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:43,425
You know, he still thinks of
me as the same George Michael

135
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,759
that I was before my life

136
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,261
blew apart, you know?

137
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,971
Before the world cracked me open

138
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,223
and I became the guy that
you're looking at now.

139
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,933
George Michael 2.0.

140
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,102
God, I hate my name.

141
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,686
The last five years

142
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,439
had been a whirlwind for George Michael.

143
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,358
He celebrated going off to college

144
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,692
- at a party with his family.
- Hey! Next week, huh?

145
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,571
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

146
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:07,407
- We are so proud.
- We have a little something for you.

147
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,992
Oh, no, you don't have to do anything.

148
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,453
I mean, you threw me this... meeting.

149
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:13,997
Little something-something...

150
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,457
to buy a car.

151
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,167
Oh, God, really?

152
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,337
- No!
- Yes.

153
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,506
Maeby!

154
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:24,299
But the party wouldn't last long.

155
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,425
You know what?

156
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:26,968
I am done with this family.

157
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,428
I hope you've saved some money,

158
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,221
'cause you're going to need every dime now.

159
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,848
What's this?

160
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,766
Return it... or rip it up.

161
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:35,143
- Michael.
- Come on.

162
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,520
Give it a rip.

163
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,855
Rip it up... right down the center.

164
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,905
That's it. Rip it.

165
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,407
Couple more.

166
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,076
Did you get it?

167
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,453
Proud of you.

168
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:54,745
Happy birthday.

169
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,498
- Happy birthday, George Michael.
- Happy birthday.

170
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,125
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

171
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,545
- * Happy birthday to you... *
- But don't worry.

172
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,589
Michael did make sure his son got a car...

173
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,133
Get out of here.

174
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:10,719
As he sent him off to college.

175
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,222
And although he arrived at college

176
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,806
without his possessions,

177
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:16,976
he was finally at a place where he felt

178
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:18,936
he'd fit in.

179
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,063
Hey, hey, check it out.

180
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,074
N... no.

181
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:32,741
No, no.

182
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:35,495
What?

183
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,124
In his Freshman year, George Michael

184
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,086
- hit the ground running.
- Sorry.

185
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,795
He was breaking some of the old taboos.

186
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,465
- Let's make it a... Pepsi.
- Drinking Pepsi in the morning.

187
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,301
So, it's a breakfast combo with a Pepsi.

188
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,469
Sometimes having eggs at night.

189
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,555
How about some eggs?

190
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,348
Oh, excuse me, I forgot it wasn't morning.

191
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,475
He was soon finding that others
enjoyed his sense of humor.

192
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,686
I forgot it wasn't morning.

193
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,479
A present from his Uncle Gob elevated

194
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,106
- his newfound confidence.
- Hi.

195
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,358
My uncle is a magician.

196
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,068
Before diminishing it.

197
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,614
But before he knew it

198
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:12,657
sophomore year was upon him,

199
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,326
- and everything got turned up to 11.
- Boom!

200
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,705
And that's what we call
only being behind by three.

201
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,457
So then that stuff's all going
on with this Sitwell company.

202
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:23,501
And then... we end up playing
them in a softball game.

203
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,045
Highlights... loyal friends.

204
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:27,672
I'm like, "How can that...?"

205
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,549
Romance.

206
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:30,675
Becky.

207
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,176
Betrayal.

208
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,762
Becky?

209
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,096
What's up, Ray?

210
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,473
You guys broke up.

211
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:39,392
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

212
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,687
The triumph of friendship.

213
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,854
- What's up, Ray?
- Hey.

214
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,149
Oh, thanks, Ray, I almost forgot.

215
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,776
You know who I was thinking
about before you sat down?

216
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,068
- What?
- Becky.

217
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,445
Do you remember?

218
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,863
And as surely as stability returned,

219
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,493
junior year ushered in a
new era of experimentation...

220
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:57,994
It's all about the science of kissing

221
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,537
between a man and a woman.

222
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,122
That always has fascinated me.

223
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,540
Oh, good. Sheila will take you.

224
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,041
As George Michael tried to compensate

225
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,544
for the lack of income from his father

226
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,339
by volunteering for experiments.

227
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,257
Hi.

228
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:15,094
So I don't run off?

229
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,472
- I hope you're not feeling too awkward.
- Oh, don't be crazy.

230
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,057
- Okay.
- Now when the mouth to mouth test begins,

231
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,269
I'm gonna be yelling out letters
that indicate mouth movements.

232
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,813
What I need you to do is just give me

233
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,481
on a scale of one to
ten your pleasure level.

234
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,775
- Fine.
- Ten being the most
pleasurable, one the least.

235
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,610
Let's hope we get to ten.

236
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:33,488
- Well, work our way up to it.
- Bringing in the mouth unit!

237
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,824
And that's when he realized
what the straps were for.

238
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,202
Is that...? Okay, I guess it's
not, uh, not gonna be a person.

239
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:41,162
- And C?
- I think one on C.

240
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,331
- M? M?
- Oh, one on...

241
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,875
- M?
- One for sure on... one.

242
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,210
- And Z?
- One.

243
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,336
- N?
- One.

244
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,171
- F? F?
- One. One.

245
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,632
But it wasn't until his year abroad

246
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:55,051
that George Michael got
an education in life.

247
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:01,224
Because after a year of trying
not to be an imposing guest

248
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,684
in his new country,

249
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,602
he was ready

250
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,272
for a summer that would end up
turning his life upside down...

251
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,530
when the woman whose
children he was nannying...

252
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,034
opened him up sexually.

253
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,495
Hey, hey, did Ernesto get his 4: 00?

254
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,248
The drones are coming.

255
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,999
Nothing matters now.

256
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,007
- Why do you kiss like this?
- Like what?

257
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,260
The teeth, they must not be used like this.

258
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,136
It was actually a jaw and lip

259
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,431
retraction issue, but
she had neither a command

260
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:44,601
of the language nor the data that we do.

261
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,061
You make love like a boy.

262
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:48,563
Spanish, speak to me in Spanish.

263
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,481
Because the only way that college credit is

264
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:51,733
actually activated is if I have...

265
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,360
- Tómame.
- Cook... cook at...

266
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:55,986
- Cooking at you?
- Overpower me.

267
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,072
Oh, yes, make me cry.

268
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,449
You're a terrible mother.

269
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,661
And so it was a very
different George Michael

270
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,330
that returned to school for senior year.

271
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,250
Eager to unleash his new

272
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,545
overt sexuality on an unsuspecting campus.

273
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,922
Hey, man.

274
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,715
It gets better.

275
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,342
And for George Michael,

276
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,720
senior year did get better.

277
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:22,680
- He was like a king
- I sort of feel like a king

278
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,933
- returning to his castle...
- Returning to his castle.

279
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,810
Only to discover that they thought

280
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,436
he was two kings.

281
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:29,938
Welcome to your castle.

282
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,899
And they had doubled
the size of his castle.

283
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,233
Double castle.

284
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:36,110
Can't wait to meet Michael, George.

285
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:38,195
It would be the perfect backdrop

286
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,698
to unveil George Michael 2.0.

287
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,325
Todo mio.

288
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:45,286
Todo mia?

289
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,413
Mio.

290
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,169
But George Michael's development was about

291
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,712
- to be forestalled.
- Hey.

292
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,256
- Dad.
- Pete died.

293
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,592
Oh, God.

294
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:02,052
- Uh, who's, uh, Pete?
- Don't worry about it.

295
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,805
Don't you worry about it.

296
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:05,097
I like this.

297
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,641
- I like the mustache.
- Oh, yeah.

298
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,643
- Oh... it's kind of fun.
- That's great.

299
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:09,936
Probably gonna want to shave it off

300
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:11,604
before the start of next quarter.

301
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:13,147
Otherwise, they're gonna
think you're a musician, huh?

302
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,274
But I love it... dude.

303
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,068
I'm never going to be

304
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,445
louder than an electric guitar.

305
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:20,780
Maybe using a band to showcase

306
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,532
my wood block skill is a dumb idea.

307
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,158
Too bad there's no such thing

308
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,869
as an electric wood block.

309
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,663
That sounds like a mother of an invention.

310
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,665
And so they set to work

311
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:32,542
inventing a downloadable app

312
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,627
that would allow one to
play an electronic version

313
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,462
of a wood block on their smartphone.

314
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:38,339
You see, that's important.

315
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,757
Well, that's what it is.

316
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,384
So it's basically like you'll always

317
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:42,760
have a wood block with you.

318
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,722
I can't believe nobody's ever done this.

319
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,140
A quick something search
would have shown the guys

320
00:11:48,182 --> 00:11:51,895
that there were already three
wood block apps on the market.

321
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,813
So, there are three on the market.

322
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:57,206
- Which they did.
- Así estamos en la jungla.

323
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:58,860
But even after doing that search,

324
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,277
they were undeterred.

325
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,572
Download them. Come on, let's do it.

326
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:04,657
I hope we're not doing this on my account.

327
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,325
No, we're doing it so that we can see

328
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:07,618
what the competition is like.

329
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,662
No, I mean on my iTunes account.

330
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,039
It's 99 cents.

331
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:12,498
Yeah, times three.

332
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,291
And soon, they realized

333
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,461
what kind of competition
they were up against.

334
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,800
Well, these are a joke.

335
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,552
I know. Where are the mallet options?

336
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:27,095
There's no choice of
wood weight or grain type.

337
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,806
There's no diameter hole option.

338
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,433
I mean, what is this, BabyTock?

339
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,768
- BabyTock?
- You know, the sharp

340
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,561
metal box that you put in the crib.

341
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:35,271
Is that not a well-known...?

342
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,105
- But this is fine.
- And they set to work.

343
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,482
No, I understand that. I get that.

344
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,526
But it just seems like
you're leaving a hole

345
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:41,819
just right in the middle of the block.

346
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,821
It won't be a block on anything 3G.

347
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,990
Although some of the work had
to happen outside the room.

348
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,825
Buddy, is that schoolwork?

349
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,159
Which was challenging.

350
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,663
And soon, they were
close to finishing an app

351
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,082
they had decided to call...

352
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:55,750
Woodblock.

353
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,334
It's taken.

354
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,170
Blockwood.

355
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:02,465
It's taken.

356
00:13:02,506 --> 00:13:04,008
And that's when he came up with...

357
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,217
Block of Wood?

358
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,636
- Which was also taken.
- Wow.

359
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:08,512
- Block-block?
- No.

360
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,222
People are going to think we're
in the chicken-noise business.

361
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:11,641
How is that a chicken noise?

362
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,142
You know... well, it's kind of hard to do

363
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:17,105
in these matador pants, but, you know...

364
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:19,649
- Block-bl...
- Fakeblock is available.

365
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,900
Do you want Fakeblock?

366
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,693
Oh, uh, okay. They have Fakeblock.

367
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,320
Okay, yes, we'll take that.

368
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:26,447
No problem. That's no problem.

369
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,365
Could you hang on to that for me, please?

370
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,868
And I'll call you back. Thank you.

371
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,370
It's $5,000 for the domain name,

372
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,332
and then there's this
whole XML Web site fee.

373
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,583
I got the last one.

374
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,376
That was 99 cents.

375
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,711
Times three.

376
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,421
And George Michael realized

377
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:44,007
he needed to bring in some cash.

378
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,508
We actually have a variety of subjects

379
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,384
that high school students need tutoring in.

380
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,970
If you want to just
take a look at that list

381
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:50,680
and let me know if there's anything there

382
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,598
- that you've handled before.
- There was...

383
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,058
although George Michael

384
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,977
couldn't imagine it was the same Maeby.

385
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,980
Is this "F" in "Maeby F."
her last name or her grade?

386
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,773
Oh, it's her last name.

387
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:02,232
But her most recent grade is...

388
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,029
well, this just shows
an Elvis Presley head.

389
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:08,823
So, that bad?

390
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,324
I'll take her.

391
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,993
Stay on top of her.

392
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:14,286
You may need to ride her pretty hard.

393
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:16,497
Hey, you must be...

394
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,290
What?

395
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,501
- This is the girl you broke up with?
- Huh?

396
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,545
I can't wear this.

397
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:24,296
Yeah, well, we dated for
a while, but, you know,

398
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,673
I was a kid, and I didn't know

399
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,675
how to kiss yet. I don't know,

400
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:29,093
for whatever reason, I listened to my dad

401
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,511
who said we shouldn't make it work.

402
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,513
- Was she your first?
- Cousin? No.

403
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,974
Why would you... why would
your mind go right to...? No.

404
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:36,934
No, it's just that he was right.

405
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,978
We were kids. I wasn't yet O.S.

406
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,312
- Overtly sexual.
- Overtly sexual.

407
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,439
Right. As I live and breathe. Crazy.

408
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,400
That's just crazy.

409
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,985
Okay, so listen.

410
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,487
After I let her in, you go
and try and keep my dad out.

411
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,948
All right? I can't let him
get in the way of this one.

412
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,075
Hey, you must be...

413
00:14:52,116 --> 00:14:53,283
But first, he had to cover his tracks.

414
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,161
- What?
- This had to look like fate.

415
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:56,704
- George Michael?
- Huh?

416
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,831
What is this? Maeby, what are you...

417
00:14:58,873 --> 00:15:01,209
doing here?

418
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,335
- As I live and breathe.
- But for the phrase, "as I live

419
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,088
- I thought you were the girl.
- And breathe," he nailed it.

420
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,756
I'm supposed to tutor a kid from...

421
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,383
High school. Yeah. That's me.

422
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,427
Crazy. That is just crazy.

423
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,387
And even though George
Michael wanted to seduce her,

424
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,305
he couldn't helpbut challenge

425
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,891
her strategy for staying in high school.

426
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,643
But still, I mean, you have
to make a living, right?

427
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,062
Don't you need an education?

428
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,522
Well, don't forget... I'm a Harris.

429
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,566
- Harris?
- Yeah.

430
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,735
Someone who "inharris" a lot of money.

431
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,153
Yeah, well, you know,

432
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,405
I wouldn't put all my Anns in that basket.

433
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,490
You know, it's fine. You don't get it.

434
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,159
You've never been a risk taker.

435
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,535
I like to with people.

436
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,037
That's what I do.

437
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,748
- I'm making a statement.
- I love it.

438
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,916
You know, I knew you were cool

439
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,126
when I saw you wearing that shirt.

440
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,002
Thanks.

441
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,212
More betrayal.

442
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:47,463
Oh, no, I get it, too.

443
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,132
No, I love... I love it, too.

444
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:53,302
You know, I... I love to... love now.

445
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,512
George Michael found himself

446
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,556
less overtly sexual than he'd hoped.

447
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,850
I made a 40-year-old woman cry in Spain.

448
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,228
I love making love to Spanish women.

449
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,980
Get out.

450
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,482
And George Michael slipped
back into seduction mode.

451
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:10,278
Oh, a man, a woman...

452
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,779
a bedroom.

453
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,741
Let's solve for "X."

454
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,035
I don't know what you're talking about.

455
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,871
Well, you know, in algebra,
you have an unknown element,

456
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,082
and, uh, we call it "X," and then you have

457
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,335
to solve for it to find
out what number "X" is.

458
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,587
"X" isn't a number.

459
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:30,631
So you don't even really know the basic...

460
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,591
But in that moment, the urge to educate her

461
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,551
was more powerful than
the urge to kiss her.

462
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,263
Let me show you. I'll just
show you some stuff real quick.

463
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:40,474
All right, so if you take
something like this... 3X+1=10...

464
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:42,226
And with the algebra lesson complete,

465
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:43,811
George Michael pivoted back

466
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,855
to his overtly sexual seduction.

467
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,982
Therefore, when I say,

468
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:52,402
"You and me in a bedroom,
let's solve for 'X, '" I'm...

469
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,072
I'm stating it as a kind of formula.

470
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,490
Yeah, let's get wasted.

471
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,575
Let's drink that formula.

472
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,494
It's not that kind of formula.

473
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,454
No, I'll show you what
a formula is real quick,

474
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,040
'cause that's very important.

475
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,916
- But when the door opened,
- Dad?

476
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,711
George Michael's window
of opportunity closed.

477
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:11,130
Bad news... P-Hound is
yanking our chain again.

478
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:12,798
- Uncle Michael.
- Oh, my God.

479
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,634
And after a brief
reunion, George Michael had

480
00:17:15,676 --> 00:17:18,054
another opportunity to impress his cousin.

481
00:17:18,095 --> 00:17:20,430
He's got this privacy software,

482
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,683
keeps people from stealing
your stuff. Tell her, pal.

483
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,769
So its privacy software
that's also anti-piracy?

484
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,647
George Michael weighed his options.

485
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,859
Maeby had chastised him
for not taking risks,

486
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:33,944
and what would be a bigger risk

487
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,779
than perpetuating a lie about software

488
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,615
just to ignite the passions of a woman?

489
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,951
Of course, it would be a lie,

490
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,246
and since Maeby wouldn't know it was a lie,

491
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:45,748
he wouldn't appear to be taking a risk.

492
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:48,042
Perhaps the bigger risk
was to tell his father

493
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,418
he was lying.

494
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,878
That he came up with it

495
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,880
because he wanted his father to leave

496
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:55,674
so he could enjoy what
remained of his senior year.

497
00:17:55,716 --> 00:17:58,094
After all, he wondered, wouldn't that be

498
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:01,264
the course of action taken
by an overtly sexual man...

499
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,016
a man who owns a pair of matador pants?

500
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:07,937
He had not responded now for 41 seconds,

501
00:18:07,978 --> 00:18:10,273
according to his unfailing internal clock,

502
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:13,109
and it was time to come clean.

503
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,568
Well, thanks. Yeah.

504
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,445
It's a... well, it's just a Boolean-driven

505
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:20,490
aggregation, really, of what
programmers call "hacker traps."

506
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,493
And he found himself
suddenly and effortlessly

507
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,414
tapping into a long-inbred
instinct for lying.

508
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,750
A Bluth taking his first steps in deceit.

509
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,794
But the more he talked,

510
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,670
the more he actually
started to like the idea.

511
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,423
So, you know, in other words, when...

512
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,300
when you have friends over,
you know, and you're...

513
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:38,926
you're listening to music and they want

514
00:18:38,968 --> 00:18:41,387
to steal your music and
copy your movies or...

515
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,931
or just look at your photos,
you know, this prevents that.

516
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:47,684
It just neutralizes that so
it's not even a threat anymore.

517
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,728
It's called Fakeblock.

518
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,688
- Great name. Right?
- Yeah, well, you know,

519
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,065
it's super low-hanging fruit.

520
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:54,566
Someone's going to do it.

521
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:56,693
We're just trying to
be those guys, you know?

522
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,196
And, impressed with his

523
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,157
- own invention...
- It's a fake profile

524
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,908
that leads hackers away
from your actual data.

525
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,701
He set about making an
impossible dream a reality.

526
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:05,953
You mean something that keeps

527
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,371
everything on the Internet private

528
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,831
and protects everyone's digital rights?

529
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,124
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

530
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,459
Everyone has something

531
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,377
that they want removed from the Internet.

532
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,212
George Michael certainly did.

533
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,881
And if the new software served

534
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,967
no other person than removing this...

535
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,054
it would be worth it.

536
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,056
Ay, dios mio.

537
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,433
I mean, if we could
make something like that,

538
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:29,018
it could be bigger than Facebook.

539
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,727
I mean, who wouldn't
want something like that?

540
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,979
You think you can do it?

541
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,605
No.

542
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:36,108
No, of course not. No.

543
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,985
I mean, this is my chance with Maeby,

544
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,903
and I can't even get rid of my own father.

545
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,572
You know, what if we just did
a vote... just the roommates?

546
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,741
We do a quick vote, and
it's, "Ciao, Fathero."

547
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,036
He's going to know who voted against him.

548
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:50,706
Not if I get him to vote against himself.

549
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,042
Why would he do that?

550
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,502
No, he wouldn't. He... I...

551
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:56,128
I was just leaning back,
so it looked like I...

552
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,629
I got this chair again, didn't I?

553
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,174
Maybe I just need to be clear and just say,

554
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,717
"I'm putting up a wall.

555
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,053
We need to rework our whole system here."

556
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,722
Sounds like you guys are working
on your privacy software, huh?

557
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:09,558
And, long story short, Michael did end up

558
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,436
embracing the voting-out-a-roommate idea.

559
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,063
And it's, "Adios, brothiero."

560
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:15,481
It cannot fail.

561
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,570
That was fun.

562
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:22,905
Did he look betrayed to you?

563
00:20:22,946 --> 00:20:24,407
He kind of always looks that way.

564
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:27,326
I'm going to catch the bus.

565
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:29,286
- Bye.
- Well, uh, okay. Hey, listen.

566
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,080
Are you going to come by on Thursday or...?

567
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:34,124
Um, I don't think so. I
have this thing in L.A.

568
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,751
Well, can you blow it off? I
mean, you know, you might want

569
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,503
to get "graduating high
school" out of the way.

570
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:40,423
Well, I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award at this gala.

571
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:43,509
Well, you might want to get that
out of the way, too, I guess.

572
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,927
Yeah.

573
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:46,678
Hey, you want me to go
with you to that or...?

574
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,597
Yeah, I can pick you up at your place.

575
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,183
Oh, they're actually
shooting a thing at my place.

576
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,102
As it turns out, they'd end up

577
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,686
- just clubbing a Thing.
- Oh!

578
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,106
You know what? Yeah, that
might actually be a good idea.

579
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:59,066
Because I can't bring
any of my friends without

580
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,484
getting permission
slips from their parents.

581
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,652
Well, that's not really a problem for me.

582
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,030
Yeah, 'cause you just
betrayed yours, right?

583
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:06,949
Awesome.

584
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:12,162
George Michael and Maeby arrived

585
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,249
at a hotel busy with three separate events.

586
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,086
No, no, no...

587
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:22,172
Well, it's really nice to be
out with you as adults, you know?

588
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,592
In Spain, they don't even
eat dinner until after 11:00 p.m.

589
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,594
Wow, Spain really changed you.

590
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,053
Well, you grow up very quickly in Spain.

591
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:29,721
Oh, my God, I know this guy. Hey.

592
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,014
Hey, man. Hey.

593
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,100
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

594
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,562
What are you on?

595
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,773
Oh, he's nobody.

596
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,609
Oh. It's Justin.

597
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,152
That's David Henrie.

598
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,820
He's Justin from Wizards of Waverly Place.

599
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,071
Hmm.

600
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,365
It's on a lot in Spain.

601
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,242
Well, I'm going to go mingle
with a bunch of 13-year-olds

602
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,535
who think they can still play fifth grade.

603
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,911
- Have fun.
- I'll catch up.

604
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:54,455
And George Michael set out

605
00:21:54,497 --> 00:21:56,873
to re-unleash his overtly sexual persona.

606
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,793
Well, gentlemen, start your engines.

607
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:01,962
Buenas noches, pequeño Scarlet.

608
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,255
I will be needing a room, please.

609
00:22:03,297 --> 00:22:04,965
How many nights?

610
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,425
Two. Sorry. No, just one night.

611
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,552
I thought you were saying how many people.

612
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,929
- And how many beds?
- Two.

613
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,140
- Two.
- No. Uh, one bed.

614
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:14,975
Why give her the option?
Keep it real simple.

615
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,978
One bed, one night, two
people, let's solve for "X."

616
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,022
I hate young Hollywood.

617
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:22,483
It's called Fakeblock, Mort.

618
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:24,876
- It's going to blow Schnoodle out of the water!
- And it was on his way back

619
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,487
- to Maeby that he heard her say...
- Fakeblock's the next big thing.

620
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,657
- It's called Fakeblock!
- What's this? You're talking... talking about Fakeblock?

621
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:32,117
- Oh. How does your privacy software work?
- Huh? It's private.

622
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,627
And that's how George
Michael not only met Rebel...

623
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:37,421
I don't want people to
know that I'm doing this.

624
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:38,838
But finally found a way to prove

625
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,425
to Maeby that he was a risk taker.

626
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:44,010
Yes. Yes. George Maharis.

627
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,555
Only to discover, moments later...

628
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:47,765
- Perfecto!
- ... that she was dating

629
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:50,726
- an even bigger risk taker.
- De nada.

630
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:52,978
That's my undercover cop boyfriend.

631
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,396
I'm trying to get him in bed.

632
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:55,813
Boyfriend?

633
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:59,359
So funny that didn't come up in the car.

634
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:01,528
So, how does it work?

635
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,863
Huh? How does what work?

636
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,658
Your privacy software.

637
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:08,285
How does it protect you from piracy?

638
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:09,953
Oh, I don't know.

639
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:12,247
Don't worry about it.

640
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,167
No, no, no. No, you
really piqued my interest.

641
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,628
I'm sorry.

642
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,172
And discouraged that he'd lost Maeby,

643
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:23,300
he tried to salvage his night

644
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:25,678
by taking a picture of Gibby from "iCarly."

645
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,096
As he was doing this,
however, this happened.

646
00:23:30,557 --> 00:23:33,185
The explosion caused an electrical surge

647
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:35,646
rendering the Schnoodle
software inoperable.

648
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:38,357
Which, to those who saw him,

649
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:40,651
seemed like a genius act of cyber sabotage,

650
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:42,944
which led to this.

651
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,823
- What happened?
- Ah, it's dead.

652
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:48,325
That geek Maharis
destroyed the whole thing.

653
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,994
And you know why? Just because he could.

654
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:53,871
Those Internet geniuses...
that's what they do. I'm ruined.

655
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,166
I'll probably never get
to drive the Schnoodle car.

656
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,001
We should work together.

657
00:23:58,043 --> 00:23:59,628
- No.
- Smart.

658
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,257
And a few days later,
it would lead to this.

659
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,593
I'm John Beard. Here's
your 15 seconds of news.

660
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:08,178
Fakeblock's mystery man, George Maharis,

661
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,430
may have just found a way to screw a cap

662
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:13,183
on the Internet, and
investors are lining up

663
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:14,810
to fill the company's tank with money,

664
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,478
even though he himself remains anonymous.

665
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,314
That's all the news
that's fit to pump. I quit.

666
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,400
By the time

667
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:23,360
George Michael returned tocampus,

668
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:26,196
even his roommate had heard
of George Maharis' Fakeblock.

669
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:27,740
This George Maharis guy stole our name,

670
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:29,700
but we have it registered,

671
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:31,493
so we can sell it to him for a fortune.

672
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:32,745
No, I am George Maharis!

673
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,204
I'm behind the whole thing.

674
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:35,748
I... I wanted to impress Maeby,

675
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,999
so I told her that I created
this privacy software.

676
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,668
Why would you do that?

677
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,378
You know, it's like the
time that you told that girl

678
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,088
that you were George Takei's son.

679
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:45,716
Well, it's too late.
This thing's taking off.

680
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,677
They're saying Fakeblock
knocked out Schnoodle.

681
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,512
That was a coincidence. It
must have been a power surge.

682
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:52,681
Well, we got to get something... at least

683
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:54,307
get our five grand back.

684
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:56,059
Well, I put in the five grand,
you put in three dollars.

685
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:58,061
Well, you may have put in
the most money to Fakeblock,

686
00:24:58,103 --> 00:24:59,813
but I put in the first three dollars,

687
00:24:59,855 --> 00:25:01,273
so that makes you a hop-on.

688
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:02,982
No, you're the hop-on, Paul,

689
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:05,569
and I know exactly who
you're trying to hop on to.

690
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:07,195
- Maeby.
- Maeby.

691
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:10,741
Yeah, well, you know
she's dating a cop, right?

692
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:12,242
- Yeah, she likes risk takers, like the P...
- Hi.

693
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,869
Hound...

694
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:16,121
Keep moving. Can you believe this?

695
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:18,039
- Maeby was excited...
- Fakeblock! It's exploding!

696
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,875
- ... but George Michael knew
- I got my PR company fanning it

697
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,334
the stakes were too high
for him to continue the lie.

698
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:22,502
And I even cashed in a favor

699
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:23,629
to get us mentioned on "Mad Money."

700
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,046
You know, I think we just might want

701
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,132
to slow down a little bit
on the whole Fakeblock thing

702
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,092
'cause I'm still not 100% finished with it.

703
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,469
Well, how finished are you with it?

704
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,721
200%? 500%

705
00:25:32,763 --> 00:25:34,264
I also feel like I'm not 100% finished

706
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:35,933
- with your math tutoring.
- And then Maeby said something

707
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:39,853
- that made his change his mind.
- Do we have those books here?

708
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:41,396
I trust you, George Michael.

709
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,481
I would not get into bed with you

710
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:43,941
on this thing if I didn't trust you.

711
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:47,193
No. Yeah, of... of course
you can trust me in bed.

712
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,946
No, I mean, I trust you
not to take advantage of me.

713
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:52,407
No. I wouldn't. We would...
we would just lie there.

714
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:55,076
We'd just lie there? I mean,
I'm talking about business.

715
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:58,497
So am I. That's why we
would just lie there.

716
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,624
Okay. 'Cause I was going to say,

717
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:02,083
when you become an Internet billionaire,

718
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,544
you could do whatever
you want with me in bed.

719
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:06,588
It was that. That's what
made him change his mind.

720
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,882
- I will. I will.
- And if it was so wrong to lie,

721
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:11,134
surely he would receive some sort of sign.

722
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:12,970
Oh, hey, I should get this.

723
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,263
- But that wasn't it.
- Hi, Uncle Gob.

724
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:16,682
That was his uncle Gob wanting
to meet him at a gay club

725
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:18,266
- to tell him his father
- I need to see you tonight.

726
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:20,602
- Was anxious to see him.
- It's about your father and you.

727
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:22,061
Really? Is... is he upset?

728
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:24,773
- Do I seem like a clown to you?
- I got it.

729
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,358
George Michael was
worried, and even more so,

730
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:28,610
when he caught up with
his uncle at a magic club.

731
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,362
That Fakeblock thing will scrub it away.

732
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:31,989
You know about Fakeblock?
You know that's my software.

733
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,407
I wonder if my dad
thinks I'm blowing him off

734
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:36,493
because that's starting to take off now.

735
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,411
Well, you should go
find out 'cause I do know

736
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,706
that your dad is really,
really, really upset with you.

737
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:42,499
He is upset? I asked you that.

738
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,668
That was literally the
first thing I asked you.

739
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,712
So you're giving me these crazy...

740
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:48,171
Mad?

741
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,215
So, it was a very shaken George Michael

742
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:52,801
who arrived later at the Ealing Club...

743
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:54,344
What do you mean, I'm already
up there? Obviously, I'm not...

744
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,095
as a frustrated Andy
Richter was having trouble

745
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:57,806
already up there because I'm here.

746
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:59,349
Getting into the club he was a member of.

747
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:01,768
It's my stupid brother!
He looks just like me.

748
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,396
I'll just go up, I'll find
him, I'll... Oh, come on.

749
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:05,731
Oh, hey, Donny!

750
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,106
Hey, I had you for a semester at Openings.

751
00:27:07,148 --> 00:27:08,525
Yeah, okay, all right.

752
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,235
Hey, come. I'm... I'm his guest.

753
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,695
Is this man your guest?

754
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,488
Oh, no, no. I'm just meeting my dad here.

755
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,907
Oh, screw this. I'm going up.

756
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,533
- Oh, come on.
- Going up, going up.

757
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,493
Oh, come on!

758
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:20,286
Oh, some Openings child you are, man!

759
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:22,831
And George Michael girded himself

760
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:25,417
for his first meeting with his father

761
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:27,335
since he voted him out of the dorm.

762
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:28,962
Hi. Yeah, just a sea-breeze, please.

763
00:27:29,004 --> 00:27:30,589
Make it a strong one.

764
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,007
Put some stank on that.

765
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,508
George?

766
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,510
George Maharis?

767
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,345
And that's when he heard

768
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:40,807
the name he'd forgotten
he'd given out as his own.

769
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,351
So he tried not to act surprised to hear it

770
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:44,770
when he saw it was Rebel.

771
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,187
I see you.

772
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,023
Unfortunately, that meant being stuck

773
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,608
affecting a blasé attitude.

774
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,150
Rebel Alley?

775
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,485
We spoke three days ago.

776
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,529
I know, I know. I remember.

777
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,949
- Are you a member here?
- No, I'm not.

778
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,034
No, I just walked in past
the big black security guard.

779
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,493
All of which now worked against him.

780
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,203
Okay, you know what?

781
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,039
I was trying to be nice,
but you're just a jerk.

782
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,541
You're a bigger jerk than
Andy Richter over there!

783
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,960
Loosen up, bitch.

784
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,502
I'm Andy Richter!

785
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:13,298
I probably make, like,
$8,000 a day or something.

786
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:15,467
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry. I... I...

787
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:17,928
You know, I'm in the
middle of a whole thing

788
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,846
with my dad right now, and I, um...

789
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:22,808
I didn't mean to be...
however I just came off.

790
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:23,976
Badly.

791
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:25,435
Well, I'm sorry, you know.

792
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,520
I've never met a beautiful actress before.

793
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:28,772
Oh, so you do know who I am?

794
00:28:28,814 --> 00:28:30,356
God, of course I know who you are!

795
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:32,358
You were in the remake
of "Dangerous Cousins."

796
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,444
I signed up to Netflix
because of that movie.

797
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,071
Uh-huh.

798
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,406
I think I was thrown that you
were interested in who I am.

799
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:39,992
Well, you are George Maharis.

800
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,243
- Everyone's talking about your software company.
- Oh, yeah.

801
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:45,914
I'm sure women are just
throwing themselves at your feet.

802
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:49,417
Well, you know, I, uh... I
prefer a woman who aims higher.

803
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,756
- That was funny.
- Yeah, I know.

804
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,091
- That was good. That was...
- Smooth.

805
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,384
Smooth. Hey, we have
the same taste in words.

806
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:00,804
Okay, should we get a drink? I'm buying.

807
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:03,598
I don't want you to think
I'm after you for your money.

808
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,058
George Michael was
thrown by what was clearly

809
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,309
Rebel's stated interest in him.

810
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:07,853
George Michael? George Michael?

811
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,312
Which is perhaps why he ignored the page...

812
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:10,772
- George Michael?
- ... that he assumed

813
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,816
- was from his father.
- George Michael?

814
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:16,319
Is George Michael here?
Is George Michael here?

815
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:17,779
Oh, God.

816
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,156
Just remind me not to go in the men's room!

817
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:22,742
Uh, would you excuse me?

818
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:24,327
I... I'm just gonna use the men's room.

819
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:26,454
- Okay.
- And while checking

820
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,123
his messages, he got some good news.

821
00:29:28,165 --> 00:29:30,458
Hey, buddy, it's Dad. Um, I am having

822
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,085
real trouble getting up there.

823
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,379
Uh, this traffic is unbelievable.

824
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,674
We got a light aircraft right
in the middle of the freeway.

825
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:40,177
Call me back when you get this?

826
00:29:40,218 --> 00:29:43,596
But while Michael was
leaving a second message,

827
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:44,973
George Michael left one for him.

828
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,225
Oh. Hey, hang on. This is you.

829
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,144
Hey, it's me. You know what?

830
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:51,646
I bet we're sitting in the exact
same traffic; this is a mess.

831
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,398
Now hoping to ensure

832
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,150
that his father didn't
make it to their meeting.

833
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,735
Maybe that's better. Oh,
God, they're forcing us off.

834
00:29:56,776 --> 00:29:58,195
Oh, God, they're forcing us off,

835
00:29:58,236 --> 00:29:59,696
but you know, we can
just do this another time

836
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:02,032
if that works. Maybe that's better.

837
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:04,659
Oh, they're closing the
lanes. Oh, this is beautiful.

838
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,954
Same traffic. Unreal.

839
00:30:07,996 --> 00:30:10,082
Unreal. Kind of looking around for you now.

840
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:12,042
Maybe you're right near me.

841
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:13,626
Anyhow, if you get this,

842
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:17,380
maybe we will just meet... somewhere else.

843
00:30:17,422 --> 00:30:18,965
Gonna hang up now.

844
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:21,134
I'm going to video this
and send it in to the news.

845
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,802
Glad you're getting some footage of this,

846
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:24,554
'cause I can't really
get a good angle myself.

847
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:26,890
They're forcing us off here
like a bunch of animals.

848
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:28,975
You know, maybe we'll do this
another time, 'cause this is...

849
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:30,852
It's sad to say, but it's left me...

850
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:32,437
animals. You know maybe
we'll do this another time.

851
00:30:32,478 --> 00:30:33,772
It's sad to say,

852
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,190
but it's left me pretty shaken up.

853
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:37,525
God, I just hope there
are no kids on that plane.

854
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,318
'Cause, you know, they don't
have any choice in the matter.

855
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,362
Well, I'll tell you what.

856
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,948
I feel worse for the parents, okay?

857
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,449
Probably the kids thought

858
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,492
that they could fly the
plane all by themselves.

859
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:49,704
Bet you 500 bucks they find
a dead kid behind the stick.

860
00:30:49,746 --> 00:30:52,624
You know, or maybe on the dead dad's lap

861
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:54,960
whose only fault was
loving that kid too much

862
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,419
and letting him fly the plane.

863
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,337
Next thing he knows,
he's bouncing of the top

864
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,339
of the Sports Chalet onto
the express lane of the 605.

865
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:02,217
- I'll bet you 500 bucks.
- Michael was hurt

866
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,511
- and on his way out...
- See you. I'm out of your hair.

867
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:07,346
When he heard something
that cheered him up.

868
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:09,307
The guy that was harassing
Rebel... he's on his way down.

869
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:10,892
Say, Rebel?

870
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:13,186
Hey, Andy Richter.

871
00:31:13,228 --> 00:31:14,896
Michael Bluth. How you doing, Andy?

872
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:16,648
Oh, yeah. I... I'm Andy.

873
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:19,234
So, I know him. Can I
get on your membership,

874
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,986
- and can you vouch for me? Okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

875
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,195
Whatever you want... it's on Andy.

876
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:23,571
Thank you.

877
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:25,157
It's on this rich hole.

878
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:26,616
Bye.

879
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:28,451
But before Michael could find Rebel,

880
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:30,996
he ran into the man, that at that point,

881
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:33,081
he still thought was her lover.

882
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,373
Ron!

883
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:36,709
- Hey.
- No, no. It's Michael.

884
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:39,963
Michael Bluth... doing the
film about my family and...

885
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:42,048
Yeah, when are we gonna get
your kid's signature, though?

886
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,382
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Oh.

887
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:44,717
- And I... I got a hold of him.
- Oh, oh.

888
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,136
And we're gonna meet here tonight,

889
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:47,553
but I think that he's blowing me off.

890
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:50,056
Well, yeah, kids will be kids, right?

891
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:52,267
Well, you know, a month
ago, I would have told you

892
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:54,686
that he and I were exactly
the same, that we were twins.

893
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:59,482
But now, I wouldn't even
think of my son as my brother.

894
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:01,734
You know, the thing is...

895
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:04,279
He's busy.

896
00:32:08,449 --> 00:32:10,618
George Michael finds himself the subject

897
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,620
of a lawsuit over the ownership

898
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:14,622
- of Fakeblock.
- Could you put in a good word

899
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,124
on the missing Lucille 2 case?

900
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,458
That's a career maker.

901
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,543
That's an O.J.

902
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,128
You just need one of those. Huh?

903
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,506
Uh, excuse me, uh, but was
it or was it not my client

904
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:26,759
who put up the initial seed
money for the block software

905
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,971
that served as the underlying
architecture of Fakeblock?

906
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:32,640
- It was 99 cents.
- Times three.
- Times three.

907
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:34,267
Times three.

908
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:39,438
Can I say something to my client?

909
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,733
Take to the sea!
