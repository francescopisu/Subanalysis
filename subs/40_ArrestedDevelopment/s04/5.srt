00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:16,476
Keep your eyes open.

3
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,939
All right, guys, what do we got?

4
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:22,273
It's quiet out there.

5
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,817
Stand by.

6
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,904
Yeah, we, uh,
we better be ready.

7
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:29,363
Yeah, I'm a man.

8
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,658
Don't make it look like makeup.

9
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:34,458
Car.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,085
Car.

11
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:37,874
Is that guy one of ours?

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:40,668
Look at the license plate.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,546
Looks like we got ourselves
an anus tart.

14
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:47,300
Tobias Funke
was on his way to reconnect

15
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:49,219
with a daughter
he'd lost touch with.

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,220
Hey, there.

17
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:51,846
It's Big Daddy.

18
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:54,974
I thought I'd try to call you
before I surprised you.

19
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:58,269
Things are...
really looking up, and...

20
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:00,688
Hello? Oh, damn it.

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,773
What Sudden Valley does
to these cell phones.

22
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:03,900
Oops.

23
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:05,735
Unbeknownst to Tobias, however,

24
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:08,529
the Sudden Valley home
he was on his way to visit...

25
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:10,447
Anus tart is turning
on Tracey Lane.

26
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,909
...had been rented out
to a television crew.

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,993
He's creeping up George Michael.

28
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:15,411
All right, guys, let's entrap

29
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,829
a local predator.

30
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,248
Come on. Lowlife.

31
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:20,333
We got to put
this piece of (bleep)...

32
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,775
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

33
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,127
Who, what, where, when,
why and how.

34
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,796
Who, what, when,
where, why and how.

35
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:29,466
Anus tart is
approaching the portico.

36
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,262
Yes, Tobias was
finally about to get

37
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:35,265
a starring role
on a hit TV show.

38
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:38,642
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

39
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:40,644
And now the story
of the awful people

40
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:43,064
who are about to lose
everything, and the one newsman

41
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,608
who had no choice but to
entrap them all together.

42
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,612
It's John Beard's To Entrap
a Local Predator, "Supercreeps."

43
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,697
Now the story of a family

44
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,951
whose future
was abruptly cancelled,

45
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:56,911
and the one son-in-law
who had no choice

46
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:58,454
but to keep himself together.

47
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:04,835
It's Tobias's
Arrested Development.

48
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:12,927
Five years before Tobias was to
appear on John Beard's TV show,

49
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,263
his acting career
was as washed up...

50
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,265
- None taken.
- ...as his family...

51
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:18,975
You are soaked to the bone.

52
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:21,477
...and those men he was
touching for some reason.

53
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:23,354
And his wife challenged him

54
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:25,940
to reexamine the other parts
of his life as well.

55
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:27,650
There's nothing
keeping us together.

56
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,611
It's time to give up our dreams
if they're not working.

57
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,405
You know, your acting career,

58
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,032
this marriage
that everyone thinks is a sham

59
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:36,159
because you're gay.

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,827
I-I'm sorry.

61
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:41,038
Everyone thinks I'm gay?

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,460
Well, I mean, it's kind of
a running joke in the family.

63
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:48,296
I mean, y-you know that, right?

64
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,589
'Cause of the misleading way
you talk sometimes.

65
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,884
Oh, you're saying the way I talk
makes me sound gay?

66
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,178
When in the last year

67
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:57,763
have I said anything
remotely mis...

68
00:02:57,805 --> 00:03:00,515
♪ It's just a fallacy! ♪

69
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,394
...leading? Is this because
I want to be an actor,

70
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,104
and all the leading men
in Hollywood are gay?

71
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:06,939
I don't think
that all the leading men

72
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,024
in Hollywood are gay.

73
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,566
Oh, honey.

74
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:12,278
Look, we're chasing things
that aren't real.

75
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,031
Maybe we need to go out there
and find out

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,615
what we're meant to do.

77
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:20,119
His wife was giving him
the cold shoulder.

78
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,745
And after kissing it good-bye,

79
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:25,666
he sat with her family,
feeling lost...

80
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,543
Well, you look like I feel.

81
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,463
...and very misunderstood.

82
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:31,881
Gay?

83
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:33,966
No, I...

84
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,385
No.

85
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:38,012
Tobias knew
it was time to find out

86
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:39,254
what he was truly meant to do.

87
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,349
So when he came across a book

88
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:43,600
the universe
had placed in his path,

89
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:44,935
he was open to its inspiration.

90
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:47,063
Oh, they're still reading,
but...

91
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:49,315
well, I guess I can
leave them some love.

92
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:51,359
So he just took
"eat" and "pray."

93
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:54,945
"Eat" was easy,

94
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:58,324
although it provided
no cosmic answers for him.

95
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,536
But it was the part about India
that really got to him.

96
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:04,038
And so, like the heroine
of Eat, Pray,

97
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,956
- Tobias decided
- Wait a minute.

98
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:09,085
to get as far away
from his wife as possible.

99
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:15,716
And so Tobias found himself
booking passage to India.

100
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,511
And soon, he discovered
his wife was also

101
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,471
preparing to go somewhere...

102
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:22,432
- I think you have my suitcase.
- ...far away.

103
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:24,434
I'm so sorry, Tobias.

104
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:25,768
Look, I've already packed.

105
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,769
Can I just use this one?

106
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,604
Oh, what the heck.

107
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,899
I guess having matching luggage
isn't so romantic anymore.

108
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:33,568
And these romantic gestures are

109
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:36,237
possibly why people think
I'm a homosexual.

110
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,032
Well, it's time to correct
old misconceptions.

111
00:04:40,074 --> 00:04:42,452
And that is why
I'm making a new start.

112
00:04:42,493 --> 00:04:44,870
Oh, a new start.

113
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:47,415
Filled with compassion and love.

114
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:48,791
I like that.

115
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,209
Well, I've already got
the license plate,

116
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:51,335
so go cry in your pie!

117
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:53,546
And so Tobias, hoping to

118
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:57,674
"straighten out" his image,
set out on a new start,

119
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:01,011
beginning with a trip
to the airport in an outfit

120
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,306
he pretty much put together
himself.

121
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:05,015
Well, I guess this is why

122
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,476
you never see them
driving convertibles.

123
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:07,977
I'll have to check on that one.

124
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:10,062
But it certainly
wasn't embraced...

125
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,439
Stay in your lane, anus tart!

126
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:12,815
(bleep) anus tart!

127
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:14,233
...by the local
Indian community.

128
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,651
You have the true sense
of the oneness of all.

129
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:18,279
And his quest
hit a bump early on,

130
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:21,532
as he struggled to learn
the customs and gestures of

131
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:23,534
- the culture he hoped to adopt.
- Oh, goddamn it!

132
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:26,621
Am I the only one
who still dresses to fly?

133
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,872
Well, there we go.

134
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,249
India clean.

135
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,294
Now, how did I...

136
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,587
No. No.

137
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:36,922
Unfortunately,
recreating the look

138
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:38,757
- of the traditional Indian garb
- Are you finished? Oh.

139
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,426
turned out to be more
difficult...

140
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,348
I look like one of those
hot guys from Spartacus.

141
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:45,556
...without the aid of Pradeep,
the helpful Indian salesman...

142
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:47,766
I feel like there was
less up top.

143
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:50,727
...at Bed, Bath & Beyond, who
helped him learn how to tie it.

144
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,229
Ah, got it, okay.

145
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:57,109
Yes, I actually
like this better.

146
00:05:57,151 --> 00:05:58,611
Yes?

147
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,406
Canadian?

148
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:04,074
No, I'm American.

149
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:06,202
Oh, yeah. I'm Canadian.

150
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:07,578
Oh. Sorry.

151
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,497
But because it was
a long flight,

152
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,208
he figured he'd wait a beat
on finding his true calling

153
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,168
and watch something to
take his mind off Lindsay...

154
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,587
How could they not have
Failure to Launch?

155
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,713
...who he knew was far away
at the time.

156
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,216
Goddamn it.

157
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,885
And after taking

158
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,470
the wrong bag at the airport...

159
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:26,096
Do not leave
any goats unattended.

160
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:29,517
All unattended goats
will be confiscated.

161
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,894
...Tobias finally arrived...

162
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,522
And so Tobias Funke
embarked on a--

163
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:38,234
Oh, dear, Lord, it's... hot!

164
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:41,153
...in India, yes, where he was
very uncomfortable.

165
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,447
Not only because
the wind whipped up

166
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,658
his queen-sized
fitted mini-sarong,

167
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,494
but because he looked
the wrong direction

168
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:49,736
when stepping into the street.

169
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,040
And so Tobias experienced India

170
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:55,042
from the inside
of a hospital room,

171
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:56,544
where the staff
was being trained...

172
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:58,504
This man here broke his skull
in two places.

173
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:00,797
...by the same doctor
he'd had in America.

174
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,966
Once outside the airport
and once in the elevator

175
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:05,760
when his sheet got caught and
he was pulled off his gurney.

176
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:06,929
Literally.

177
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,250
Two places indeed.

178
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,848
This is very funny.

179
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,642
It's like that new show
we just caught, Laugh-In.

180
00:07:11,684 --> 00:07:12,976
My name is...

181
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,604
Oh!

182
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:17,940
Now I've broken my skull
in a third place!

183
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:20,610
On this elephant guy statue!

184
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:23,320
Tobias had wanted the universe
to provide him a sign.

185
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,072
You should be a comedy actor.

186
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:27,241
And finally it had.

187
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:29,285
This is the sign I've been...

188
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,495
Looking for.

189
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:33,414
And after two more weeks
in the hospital,

190
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,625
it was time
for his flight home.

191
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,543
And that's when he got
another sign.

192
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:42,089
A call from Lindsay.

193
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,882
Although he wouldn't be able
to reach the phone for hours...

194
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:45,593
I'm ready to make this work.

195
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:47,928
...due to his already
weakened spine.

196
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:53,142
Tobias and Lindsay

197
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:55,018
shared the news
of their new start

198
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,437
at a family gathering.

199
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,105
I got the part.

200
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:00,316
You know, it's funny,
for I, too, find that

201
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:01,734
I am on a journey.

202
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,068
Although, as we discovered

203
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,987
when our MasterCard bill
came back,

204
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,572
it was the same one she took.

205
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:08,407
But mine has confirmed
that I should

206
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,826
redouble my efforts to achieve

207
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:14,789
the unachievable dream
of being an actor.

208
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,625
A journey
that has left me eager

209
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:21,295
to connect with my true love.

210
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,547
Particularly if she finds her...

211
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,300
way clear to covering
a 2, 000-rupee

212
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:29,470
City of Hopelessness
hospital debt.

213
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:31,639
The trick is going to be
getting anyone to believe

214
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,931
that her husband
is straight enough

215
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,850
to have a true love
that's a woman.

216
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,602
What are you implying?

217
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:38,646
Oh, I don't think there was
any implying going on at all.

218
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:39,855
Didn't hear any implying.

219
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:41,064
I wasn't implying.

220
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:42,441
I'm sorry, Mother.

221
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,026
It's just, I've got
a bit of a stick

222
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,528
up my "bunghole"
about what I've now found

223
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:46,987
is a running joke about me.

224
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,823
But let's be honest.

225
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:52,451
For 2, 000 rupees, we'd both
go down on Matthew McConaughey.

226
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:54,328
Yes, Michael?

227
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,372
At the time of this
family meeting,

228
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,581
2, 000 rupees was $36.

229
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,542
I wouldn't.

230
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,627
Of course you wouldn't, Michael.

231
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:03,629
You never accept help
from anyone.

232
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:05,922
And hoping to do things
differently this time,

233
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:08,801
Lindsay immediately started
spending money she didn't have.

234
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,427
Are you ready to make a move?

235
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:15,057
As you can see,
I'm ready for a lot that's new.

236
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,559
Oh, good heavens.

237
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,561
While Tobias pursued

238
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:20,563
the life of
a professional actor.

239
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,606
Listen, I'm an actor,
you're an agent.

240
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:23,733
You do the math.

241
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,234
I want you to represent me.

242
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,444
In other words,
you do the math--

243
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:28,863
the money, the negotiating.

244
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,947
You know I'm not
that kind of agent, right?

245
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,575
I'm a real estate agent.

246
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:35,327
I'm a predator; I sell
giant houses to very poor people

247
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,079
who can't afford them
with predatory loans.

248
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,039
No, see, that's the money stuff
I don't understand.

249
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,957
All you need to do
is tell people

250
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,043
what a terrific actor I am,
'cause I can't do it believably.

251
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,420
What do you say?

252
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,171
Sounds like it shouldn't be
too much work.

253
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:47,339
Huzzah!

254
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,591
Okay, here's the number

255
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,634
of my current agent
Mike Matthews.

256
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:53,721
He's at Allstate. Fire him.

257
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:57,725
Tobias started seeing positive
career signs everywhere...

258
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,142
...decorating my quarters.

259
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:02,605
...he chose to put them.

260
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:04,440
And at his new agent's
suggestion...

261
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:06,358
Hi. I'm after pending.

262
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,985
...he even snuck on to a studio
lot to hand out head shots

263
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,239
to extras and other
show business insiders.

264
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:13,908
Taft-Hartley pending.

265
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:15,659
Things were
looking up for the Funkes.

266
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,036
They even celebrated
their first

267
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,289
- home-cooked Thanksgiving.
- Including duck l'orange.

268
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,582
Oh!

269
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:23,500
Oh, no!

270
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,836
Lindsay!
Lindsay, get the scooper!

271
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:27,212
Throw oranges at it.

272
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,172
Hot orange! Hot orange.

273
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,466
All right...

274
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,092
It's throwing its voice!

275
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,677
- Oh!
- Lindsay!

276
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:36,931
And so they went

277
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,683
to the Fountain Valley
China Garden instead.

278
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:42,895
And if the collapse
of the housing market,

279
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:45,355
- his lack of auditions...
- Tobias Funke.

280
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,316
or even the writers' strike

281
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:49,401
couldn't deter Tobias
from his dream,

282
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:51,361
the suicide of his ruined

283
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,363
and despondent agent
certainly could.

284
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:57,660
I believe he died as a warning,
in a way, his message perhaps

285
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,703
to live within our means

286
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,539
and be realistic
about our lives.

287
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:04,124
And yet it didn't.

288
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,585
Well, then I shall
redouble my efforts

289
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:09,463
so that he died in vain.

290
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:13,550
Meaning he will have led
a pointless life,

291
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:14,677
is what I mean.

292
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:15,970
Yes, carry on. Thank you.

293
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,387
And he soon found himself

294
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:20,808
bringing his wife
to an acting class

295
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,435
in an effort to jump-start
his career and marriage.

296
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:25,312
If everyone's good,
you'll get your juice.

297
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,857
What did you say the name
of this acting class was again?

298
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:29,358
Method One Clinic.

299
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,919
Okay, I'm gonna go get coffee.

300
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,070
Garden Grove Method One Clinic.

301
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:35,948
And Tobias found himself
captivated

302
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,616
by one of the monologues.

303
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:40,327
And I made it in that movie,
the Fantastic Four,

304
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:43,205
uh, but it wasn't fantastic
for me.

305
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:45,165
Uh, I got carried away.

306
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,751
And I'm like,
"This (bleep) is (bleep) up,

307
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:50,212
"and I've got to get
my (bleep) together

308
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,339
or I'm gonna be (bleep), too."

309
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,842
Anyways, now I'm sober,
and I'm trying.

310
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:56,719
It's... super hard.

311
00:11:58,261 --> 00:11:59,763
Thank you. Thank you.

312
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,056
It was a devastating
and personal story.

313
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,767
Okay, notes:

314
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,936
um, first of all, it seemed
you were slurring a bit there,

315
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:08,438
and I just think
you'd have so much more fun

316
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,940
punching those... those words.

317
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:11,358
Get it out there.

318
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,068
"This (bleep)
is (bleep) up, sir."

319
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,070
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm not familiar
with the piece, so...

320
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,990
No, no, that's it.

321
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:21,744
But I am familiar with your work
in the Fantastic Four, however.

322
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,662
- You've seen that?
- Of course I have.

323
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:25,789
20 years earlier,
DeBrie Bardeaux

324
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:28,000
had played Sue Storm
in the low-budget version

325
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:31,045
of the Fantastic Four, produced
by Imagine Entertainment,

326
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,047
when, during Imagine's
Christmas party,

327
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:36,008
a drunk lawyer reminded them
they'd lose the rights

328
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,261
if they didn't make the film
in the next six days.

329
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:43,933
After a two-hour search,
they found their entire cast.

330
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:47,061
They also proved useful six
days later at the wrap party.

331
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:50,104
I almost never get recognized
as the Invisible Girl.

332
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:51,774
I can't believe you saw me.

333
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:54,568
Well, I-I thought it was
"fantastic."

334
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,653
Actually, most
of the performance

335
00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:58,238
that had so captivated
Tobias...

336
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,032
Hey, maybe she came into
this Light Bulbs Unlimited.

337
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,700
She was here a minute ago.

338
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:03,786
...was performed
by a fishing line.

339
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:06,038
This is the gayest
Starbucks ever!

340
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,082
Did his fishing line break, too?

341
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,542
Well, my acting career is over.

342
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:13,837
Oh, don't say that. You've got
to say, "Keep the dream alive."

343
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,255
That's what helps me.

344
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,131
Well, this is what's helping me.

345
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,259
- Oh.
- It's really good.

346
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,303
Carl Weathers used to give us
grape juice.

347
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,764
But then he'd add five dollars
to our credit card.

348
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,140
Well, here is to
our acting addiction.

349
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,141
Yep.

350
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,185
May we never be cured.

351
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,480
Are you crying? Oh, I'm crying.

352
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:34,190
Oh, it's a nosebleed.

353
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:37,987
Oh, thank you so much.

354
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,114
Tobias had found a friend.

355
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,657
- You're neat!
- You're neat.

356
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,075
You're neat.

357
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,576
You're neat.

358
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,247
And after a
not-very-cute meet-cute,

359
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,792
Tobias continued to find
DeBrie's behavior delightful,

360
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,794
even when the methadone
made her think

361
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:56,797
she was a piece of toast.

362
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,799
There, now I can see

363
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,760
a pretty face under all that
butter substitute.

364
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,846
And I recognize you
from somewhere,

365
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:07,557
but it's not the Fantastic Four;
it's from somewhere else.

366
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:10,019
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

367
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,603
Episodics? Been there.

368
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:14,564
It wasn't episodic.

369
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,108
She had been in a series

370
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,567
of soft-core porn movies
about women

371
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,402
leading straight men
into gay sex,

372
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,655
- called Straight Bait.
- This is my brother. He's gay.

373
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,239
If you want to have sex with me,

374
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,283
then you've got to have sex
with him first.

375
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:28,662
And if you don't want to have
sex with her, you must be gay.

376
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,873
I'll show you how not gay I am.

377
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,836
She did six of these movies,

378
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:38,797
and after lunch,
did three more.

379
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:40,549
It's nice to be
recognized though.

380
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,342
Marky Bark--
sometimes he doesn't know

381
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:44,427
when I'm in the same room.

382
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:45,804
And sometimes it feels like

383
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:47,366
it's not the face blindness,
you know?

384
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:49,349
It's the same
with me and Lindsay.

385
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,727
I know she's trying,
but she doesn't believe

386
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:53,729
in my acting career.

387
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,481
Maybe she's right. I've yet
to make more money as an actor

388
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,525
than I ever did as a doctor.

389
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,360
And that's with
Country-Wide behind me.

390
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,571
You're... wait, you're a doctor?
You can write scripts?

391
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:04,531
Well, I like to think so.

392
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:07,910
You should never give up a dream
if you can write scripts.

393
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,913
You seem like you'd be
a good doctor/actor.

394
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,248
It was the first
positive reinforcement

395
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,375
Tobias had had since India.

396
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:19,004
You remind me of
Billy Crystal... Mmm, mmm!

397
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:21,715
It would have broken
Tobias's heart if he knew

398
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:23,884
she was about to say
"Billy Crystal Meth,"

399
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,343
a funny drug dealer.

400
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:28,889
Uh, I... got a bit carried away

401
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:31,183
when you compared me
to Billy Crystal.

402
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,727
You remind me
of Billy Crystal...

403
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,313
Once again, she was going
to say "Billy Crystal Meth."

404
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:40,067
I'm sorry, but, DeBrie,
I-I've never met anyone

405
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:41,944
who understands me like you do.

406
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,154
- Or at all.
- Maybe, with someone like you,

407
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,822
I could have a new start.

408
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:49,284
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,996
Did you see my license plate--
"A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T"?

410
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:55,582
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

411
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:59,335
Did you see my Straight Bait
movie of the same name?

412
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,713
Coincidence.

413
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,257
We should be together.

414
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:04,674
We should run away.

415
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,385
Oh, my gosh.

416
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,054
Well, this is happening so fast.

417
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,639
Well, what do I do
about Lindsay?

418
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,433
I mean, can I just improv my way
out of a marriage?

419
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:18,021
Yes, and... let's do this.

420
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,106
Blackout.

421
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:20,774
Unaware that a similar

422
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,318
off-menu swap had just occurred
at Swappigans,

423
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,903
Tobias broke the news

424
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:27,281
that he was leaving Lindsay
in a phone call.

425
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,782
...for I have met someone.

426
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,408
It's not important who it is.

427
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,994
It's Sue Storm.

428
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:34,163
I'm so sorry,
but DeBrie believes in me,

429
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,123
and she stopped my heart, too.

430
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:39,209
If you're wondering what "too"
referred to, it was this:

431
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:40,543
Let's do this.

432
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,045
Blackout.

433
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:44,256
And scene, as they say.

434
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,659
Her heart stopped!
She-She's dying!

435
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:48,135
Please, someone!
She had too much butter!

436
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,636
- She's a very famous actress!
- Someone say "butter" out here?

437
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:51,387
Oh, my God,
that's a butter face.

438
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,682
- How much butter did the patient have?
- I don't know.

439
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,517
- A Star Trek chess set's worth.
- Damn it, that Swappigans

440
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,978
puts more people in
this hospital. Make way, people!

441
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,229
We got a 61-year-old male

442
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,689
in full cardiac arrest
coming through.

443
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,940
You have to wait outside, sir.

444
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:03,233
Be careful of her face!

445
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,027
She's an actress!

446
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,363
It's worth noting that Tobias

447
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,699
had heard this hospital
in Orange County

448
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,285
was a favorite
of show business big shots

449
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,786
seeking plastic surgery.

450
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:16,913
We're both actors!

451
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,046
On the day of Lucille's trial,

452
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,340
Tobias was in a hospital
with a woman

453
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:29,051
he'd both fallen for
and had rushed into an ICU.

454
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,803
See? Makeup makes everyone
feel a little better.

455
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,305
You didn't leave me.

456
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:35,224
Everybody leaves me.

457
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:39,019
I've been left in Dumpsters
and on a curb and...

458
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:40,562
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

459
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,981
Excuse me. Could you, uh,
leave us alone for...

460
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,733
- Yeah, absolutely, yes.
- Thank you.

461
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:47,027
Oh, no, I-I'd like him
to-to stay.

462
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,111
- Really?
- Yeah.

463
00:17:48,153 --> 00:17:49,112
Okay.

464
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,405
I'm afraid that you have

465
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,324
tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

466
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:53,783
gonorrhea, hepatitis,
pancreatitis,

467
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:57,120
trichomonitis,
nongonococcal urethritis.

468
00:17:57,162 --> 00:18:00,082
All the itises, really,
and there's also

469
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:01,333
a host of osises.

470
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,085
Now, what this means
in nonmedical terms

471
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:06,046
is that you have landed, uh,
a real party girl.

472
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,964
Well, will she be okay?

473
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,674
Well, we can treat
all of these things,

474
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,343
but if she's really
gonna be okay,

475
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,345
uh, she's gonna have to tackle
this drug problem.

476
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,597
You didn't tell me
you had a drug problem.

477
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,807
We met at a methadone clinic.

478
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:18,808
Are you high?

479
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,269
We met at an acting class.

480
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,020
The Method One...

481
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:24,731
There it is. I'm gonna let
you guys, uh, hash this out.

482
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,816
I guess I shouldn't have
lied about being clean

483
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:30,070
when I took that methadone,
but I'll do better this time.

484
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:31,405
Or are you gonna leave me

485
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:33,615
now that you know
that I'm a druggie?

486
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:36,952
DeBrie, look, some people
struggle with addiction,

487
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,579
other people are incapable
of ever being nude.

488
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,123
Everybody has something.

489
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:44,167
And it's my professional opinion
that your drug use

490
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:48,130
is a direct result of your
abandoning your dream of acting.

491
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,923
You are a gifted actress.

492
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,925
When I first saw Straight Bait,

493
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,260
there were two men making love,

494
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:55,304
but I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

495
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:57,055
You watched Straight Bait?

496
00:18:57,097 --> 00:18:58,598
Oh, just2, 4and9.

497
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,017
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you.

498
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,271
But stick with me,
and I'll make you famous.

499
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:08,024
By cashing in
on your most celebrated role.

500
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,192
Come one, come all!

501
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:11,653
Get your photo taken
with Sue Storm

502
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,155
from the Fantastic Four!

503
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,781
Hey, is that Jessica Alba?

504
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:17,700
No, this is the original
Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux!

505
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:19,619
- Who?
- The original Sue Storm,

506
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,246
DeBrie Bardeaux. She--
No, no!

507
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:22,247
No free pictures, kids!

508
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:23,248
No, no, scram!

509
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,291
Get out of here! Go!

510
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,625
Go, get out of here.

511
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:27,169
I don't think this is working.

512
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,545
Maybe I need to get
a regular job.

513
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,714
I do have a law degree.

514
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:33,591
I know, I know,
and I'm a doctor.

515
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:35,551
But no, let's not settle.

516
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:37,553
Look, it's the Fantastic Four.

517
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,098
No one recognizes one alone.

518
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,475
I've got an idea.

519
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,601
Ten dollars gets you
a picture with

520
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:44,853
real Hollywood characters!

521
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:46,062
What do you say? Ten dollars.

522
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:47,063
That's certainly cheap.

523
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,316
Oh! Hello, young man,

524
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,609
and his... uncle? Neighbor?

525
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:52,902
Father.

526
00:19:52,944 --> 00:19:54,196
Oh! That's terrific.

527
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:55,613
Well, how would you like

528
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:56,990
to have your picture taken

529
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:59,868
with real Hollywood
movie land characters?

530
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,286
Are you the Smurfs?

531
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:02,871
No, no, no.

532
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:04,456
They're the Ambiguously Gay Duo.

533
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:05,790
Oh, I assure you,

534
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,625
there's nothing ambiguous
about me.

535
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,919
I'm Johnny Storm,
the human flamer.

536
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:13,756
And this is Sue Storm, my sister
and fellow fighter-in-law.

537
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,925
Now watch as I get--
no, I have special effects!

538
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,802
Look, children love fire.

539
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:18,845
Oh.

540
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:19,846
This isn't working either.

541
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:21,515
You're right.

542
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,975
Two people in blue
doesn't say Fantastic Four.

543
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:25,685
You know what though?

544
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,770
I think I may have
just the thing.

545
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:28,980
Oh?

546
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:31,066
Just "the thing."

547
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,526
Cut to...

548
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,111
Now that I'm the iconic
rock man The Thing,

549
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:36,738
no one will misunderstand.

550
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,491
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

551
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,368
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm
and The Thing?

552
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,203
Oh, who's smart now?

553
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,913
Indeed we are.

554
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,040
In fact, they were orthodox
members of the law firm

555
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:49,751
Feinberg, Feinberg, Feinberg
& Feinberg.

556
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:52,504
We represent Stan Lee
and Marvel Enterprises.

557
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:54,172
This is a cease and desist

558
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:55,965
ordering you
to stop impersonating

559
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,633
any of our trademark characters.

560
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,135
Oh, let me take a look at that.

561
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,220
I have a law degree.

562
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:01,430
No, DeBrie, I've got this.

563
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,639
Mr. Feinberg?

564
00:21:03,681 --> 00:21:05,308
Uh, would it change your mind

565
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,396
if I offered you
a free Sue Storm armband?

566
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:11,314
It did not change his mind.

567
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:14,067
And although the hate crime
charges were dismissed,

568
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,818
they were told
they could not continue

569
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,320
to pose as the Fantastic Four.

570
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:20,073
Can they really make us leave
Hollywood Boulevard?

571
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:23,201
Well, apparently in
this instance, paper beats rock.

572
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:24,202
You have a rock?

573
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:26,538
No, I am your rock now.

574
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,581
Oh.

575
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,748
So what are we gonna do

576
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,459
now that we don't
have the rights?

577
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,252
Well, we just go off-brand.

578
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:35,838
Uh, we'll just change the names
and do a cheap generic knockoff.

579
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,632
Kids don't care.

580
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,384
Tobias took them down
to a street

581
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:42,095
near Harbor Boulevard,
where his friend Gary Goose

582
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,679
told him
they didn't police very much.

583
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:45,601
Rock Monster and Ability
to Be Invisible Person.

584
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,225
Hello, young man.
What brings you

585
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:50,186
to at least 500 feet
past the entrance of Disneyland?

586
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:51,354
Dad, can I get my picture taken

587
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,522
with The Thing
and Invisible Girl?

588
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:54,065
They're the Fantastic Four.

589
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,067
Well, actually, technically,
I'm Rock Monster,

590
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,403
and this is
Ability to Be Invisible Person.

591
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,322
- Hey, you guys want the ten dollars or not?
- Yeah.

592
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:01,864
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah.

593
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:03,575
Yes. Okay.

594
00:22:03,617 --> 00:22:06,161
We're The Thing
and the Invisible Girl.

595
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:07,287
- You're under arrest.
- What?

596
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,830
Boom. Turn around.

597
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,206
- Let's go.
- I didn't...

598
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:11,625
- Let's go. Get up there.
- Oh! Oh!

599
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,418
Come on.

600
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,420
- Oh, come on, now.
- No, no, no.

601
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:17,839
We're not gonna kill him,
we're just gonna handcuff him.

602
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,466
You can't shoot us
'cause it's not a felony.

603
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,593
Keep your eyes on her.
I'll be right back.

604
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:23,595
Okay.

605
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,307
If it happens again,

606
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,434
you know, it will be
a third strike.

607
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:31,144
Three-strikes law's up for
review in the appellate courts,

608
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:32,479
but we really
shouldn't be charging.

609
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,230
I know of a street
in Garden Grove

610
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:36,232
- where they don't police very much.
- Okay.

611
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:37,775
Things were looking down.

612
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:40,445
And over the following weeks,

613
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,280
their financial situation
grew dire enough

614
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,573
for this to happen.

615
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:45,492
We're broke.

616
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,452
But you can't sell
your Fantastic Four costume.

617
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:48,828
I mean, that would be
like a fisherman

618
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,872
selling his fishing costume.

619
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,124
No, I was gonna
have sex with him.

620
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,708
For money.

621
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,419
What? No. Put that back on.

622
00:22:56,461 --> 00:22:58,421
You don't have to
degrade yourself this way.

623
00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:00,590
Hey, I'm not a thing.

624
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,842
Hey, I am a Thing.

625
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,428
And so, with no other options,
Tobias returned

626
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,929
to his in-laws' penthouse,

627
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:09,891
desperate enough
to ransack the place,

628
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,852
when it appeared
someone had beaten him to it.

629
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,688
Michael.

630
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,398
No, George Michael.

631
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,316
Somebody, help!

632
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,235
And that's when he heard
what sounded like two ostriches

633
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:22,362
making love to a pop hit.

634
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:24,072
But was actually this.

635
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:27,617
♪ Why don't you
go away, go away ♪

636
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,160
♪ Get away, get away ♪

637
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:31,120
♪ Stay away ♪

638
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,707
♪ You're hopelessly
hopeless... ♪

639
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,125
Good bird.

640
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,170
Stop it, chicken!

641
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:41,381
Somebody help!

642
00:23:41,423 --> 00:23:42,591
Lucille 2!

643
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:44,426
Help! Help!
Kevin, give me a hand!

644
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:45,968
Get Dr. Bowman or Alicia.

645
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,345
Either one.

646
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,514
This woman's been
attacked by an ostrich!

647
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:51,474
Ah, Tobias got a new girlfriend.

648
00:23:56,312 --> 00:23:57,980
Tobias had acted like
an actual superhero

649
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,107
- and saved Lucille 2.
- There's my hero.

650
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:00,609
You know, the doctor said

651
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,901
if that bird had gotten through

652
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:03,861
my second layer of makeup,
it could've done

653
00:24:03,903 --> 00:24:05,113
permanent damage to my skin.

654
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:06,864
And I want to repay you.

655
00:24:06,906 --> 00:24:09,534
You're a doctor,
and you're out of work.

656
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,453
- Well...
- How would you like to come work for me,

657
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:12,912
at Austerity?

658
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,956
The rehab center? That's yours?

659
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,999
Well, my brother Argyle
runs it day to day.

660
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,209
But we are so understaffed.

661
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,711
You'd be such a gift.

662
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:22,796
It would only pay
120 grand a year to start.

663
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,049
Tobias, whose girlfriend
had nearly

664
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,469
sold her body for money
in front of him,

665
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,722
knew that everyone at some time
has to face reality.

666
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,894
- But that this wasn't the time.
- No.

667
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,647
- You turned it down?!
- Uh-huh.

668
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:41,524
I almost  a guy
for a hamburger,

669
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:44,444
and you turned down
$120, 000 a year?

670
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:46,904
To keep our dream alive,
yes, I did.

671
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,657
I thought you'd be proud of me.

672
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,575
After all, a doctor in India

673
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:53,161
told me that I have the gift
to make people laugh.

674
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:54,828
Why are you crying?

675
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,914
You're worse than Marky.

676
00:24:56,956 --> 00:25:00,918
He couldn't see me,
but you can't hear me.

677
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:05,423
The setback sent
an emotionally fragile DeBrie

678
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:08,134
back to her old ways.

679
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:10,720
And before long,
she was picked up by a limo

680
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:12,472
for a night of
being passed around

681
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:14,932
amongst Hollywood creeps.

682
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:18,978
For three weeks, Tobias waited,
hoping DeBrie would return.

683
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,190
Perhaps it was
the morning he awoke to find

684
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,775
two bums using him as a pillow

685
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:25,985
that he realized
she wasn't coming back.

686
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:27,570
Who are you supposed to be?

687
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:30,072
Oh, I'm The Thing
from Fantastic Four.

688
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:33,075
You've been served, (bleep).

689
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,662
Oh, (bleep) me.

690
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:37,497
Are you undercover as well?

691
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,457
I'm CIA.
Not here for you though.

692
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,835
Scoping out
Imagine Entertainment.

693
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,253
So, with nowhere to go...

694
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:45,963
Thought I'd try you again.

695
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,674
...and no one to help him
out of his rock suit...

696
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:49,801
Honey, you read
comic books, yes?

697
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:51,344
...he went to see
if his daughter

698
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:53,847
would give him a place to stay.

699
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:01,187
Now the fun begins,
right, Officer Three?

700
00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:03,064
I'll say.

701
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,650
...and why and how. Who, what,
when, where, why and how.

702
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:09,821
Is there a little girl here
all by herself?

703
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,156
And perhaps it was this
that would finally

704
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:14,743
get him to admit
that he sometimes did speak

705
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:16,452
in a misleading way.

706
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,288
Daddy needs to get
his rocks off.

707
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,755
On the next
To Entrap a Local Predator...

708
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:28,757
I'll be down in a minute.

709
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:30,550
Have some lemonade.

710
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:32,343
Predator gets
its first rock-solid case.

711
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:35,054
Pretty good lemonade, huh?

712
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,347
It is.

713
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:38,057
Is there alcohol in here--
John Beard!

714
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,058
Please, have a seat.

715
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,059
Okay.

716
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,227
Why are you here?

717
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,645
I'm here to see my little girl.

718
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:44,898
I wanted to show her
Daddy's Thing.

719
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,232
What are you doing here?

720
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:49,026
I'm doing a, um,
a local interest piece.

721
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,027
Mm.

722
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:51,112
Okay, get in there, boys.

723
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:52,822
Oh, really local.

724
00:26:52,864 --> 00:26:53,865
That's right, yeah.

725
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:54,948
Is this about my daughter?

726
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,117
Oh, so it's your daughter

727
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:57,827
- you're here to see?
- Yes.

728
00:26:58,578 --> 00:26:59,953
Maeby.

729
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,831
If he's got a daughter,
then how old is she?

730
00:27:01,873 --> 00:27:02,956
Let me ask you this.

731
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:03,957
How old is she?

732
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,001
Oh.

733
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:07,879
Why do you put me on the spot?

734
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:10,799
Um, I want to say 19?

735
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,384
But I like
to think of her as 15.

736
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:14,427
Well, you're free to go.

737
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:16,053
She's not here.

738
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,775
But this creep won't take "go"

739
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,223
- for an answer.
- Oh, that's all right.

740
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:20,809
I'll stay, I'll wait.

741
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,811
And this creep makes himself
right at home.

742
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:24,813
- Give me just a minute.
- He's not leaving.

743
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,773
- He's not leaving.
- He's not leaving.

744
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:28,691
Tell him there's a raccoon
in the backyard.

745
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,276
Hey, guess what.

746
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:32,069
There's a raccoon
out on the patio!

747
00:27:32,111 --> 00:27:33,137
Bull (bleep).

748
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:34,427
Where is that little guy?

749
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:37,325
And this guy turns out to be
a real comedian.

750
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:40,050
I just broke my skull
in a fourth place:

751
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,654
the patio!

752
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:44,699
