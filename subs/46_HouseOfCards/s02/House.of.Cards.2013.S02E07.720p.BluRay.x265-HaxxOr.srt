1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,645
 Jackie Sharp.

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,649
<i>Terry Womack.</i>

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,114
<i>Bob Birch.</i>

4
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:16,617
 <i>President Walker has surrounded
himself with</i> a <i>broken Congress.</i>

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,324
<i>He even brought one of them
into the White House.</i>

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,060
<i>Now, they've broken
the economy,</i>

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,034
<i>and put us on a collision
course with China.</i>

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,332
<i>Put a stop to them
before it's too late.</i>

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,972
<i>Send a message
at the midterms.</i>

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>Let's start
fixing the country.</i>

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,147
 <i>Paid for by
Friends of a Better America.</i>

12
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,248
 $25 million?
Out of thin air?

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,150
 That's our estimate.
Where's the money coming from?

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,382
Super PACs.
These are issue-based attack ads.

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,583
So, who's giving to them?

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,887
We can't trace the money until
this quarter's filings come in.

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,861
We get killed in the midterms,
we can kiss 2016 goodbye.

18
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,330
And then you can deal
with a Republican majority

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,094
and a Republican president.
 We're trying to counter with D-trip.

20
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,566
 Make $25 million
appear outta nowhere?

21
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,228
We can make a dent.
Dents don't cut it.

22
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,068
No matter how fast we ramp up
fundraising, we can't close the gap.

23
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,506
We have to stop their money flow.
 I want to know how.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,408
 Locate the source
and then cut off the tap.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,740
With this sort of influx,
you can be sure that

26
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,541
somebody's not playing
by the rules,

27
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,048
but we can't whistle-blow
until we find the source.

28
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,846
Then find it. And you sure
as hell better find it soon.

29
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,908
 In the meantime,

30
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,885
I've been working on a proposal
to counter the attacks.

31
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,719
A coordinated
national messaging effort.

32
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,417
I'll be sending all of
you copies later today.

33
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,524
Well, we should be open to every idea.
Now, go. Get to work.

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,365
Frank.

35
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,708
You were supposed to steer
Congress on my behalf.

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,744
No one is as
concerned as me.

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,938
I should've kept you
in the House,

38
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,036
like Raymond suggested
from day one.

39
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,385
But you've been distracted by
the Senate, State of the Union,

40
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,613
meddling with foreign diplomacy...
You asked me to negotiate...

41
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,283
I know what I've done. And I
know where it's gotten us.

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,417
Sir, the attack ads are not
a result of anything...

43
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,622
You're scrambling from fire to
fire, instead of preventing them.

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,495
I'm not the FEC.
I can't wave a wand and...

45
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,727
Give me more
than excuses, Frank.

46
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,463
You're better than that.
Or maybe you're not.

47
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,464
If you need a punching bag, I will
stand here and take the punches,

48
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:15,513
as I have done time and time
again since I swore my oath.

49
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,640
But I would much rather get back
to work, as you've asked me to do.

50
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,446
You are out of line, Frank.

51
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,447
Dismiss me or keep
swinging, Mr. President.

52
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,756
You're dismissed.

53
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,792
Thank you, sir.

54
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,066
Dan Lanagin
switched teams.

55
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,729
That doesn't
make any sense.

56
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,365
I couldn't find any anomalies
among big Republican donors.

57
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,102
So, I checked our own.

58
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,768
Lanagin hasn't given
a dime this quarter.

59
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,371
Yeah, but not giving isn't the
same as giving to the Republicans.

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,283
His casino's accounts.
Ernst & Young.

61
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,411
$18 million for
donations,

62
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,478
and they're
not going to us.

63
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,888
 How did you get
your hands on those?

64
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,258
I got friends. That's
why you solicit my services.

65
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,422
 The estimate for the
ad buys was $25 million.

66
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,466
 Those accounts are
up to date as of June 30th.

67
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,661
They could have made
more donations since then.

68
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,906
Tusk.

69
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,106
Lanagin's casino is in Missouri.
 Raymond Tusk?

70
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,309
And he's got an ax to grind
with me and with the President.

71
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,817
 I've never seen his
name on any FEC filings.

72
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,615
Well, he doesn't make
political contributions.

73
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,282
That's how
he remains flexible.

74
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,519
 You think he's
funneling the money somehow?

75
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,991
I don't know.

76
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,463
Get yourself to Kansas City.
I want you in that casino.

77
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,194
Yes, sir.
I'll keep digging.

78
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,971
Get me my wife.

79
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,438
<i>Where'd
you get the recipe?</i>

80
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,264
 My father
taught me.

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,468
You and your dad were close?

82
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,668
No.

83
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,110
Cooking ribs was the only thing
that motherfucker did right.

84
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,340

85
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,679
I guess you can't print that.
I have ways.

86
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,116
This really gonna be
in the paper?

87
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,381
Well, at least
in Boston, yeah.

88
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,387
Don't see
why anybody would care.

89
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,891
Well, it's
a personal interest story.

90
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,225
The Vice President of the United
States comes here, of all places.

91
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:53,962
You mean this shithole?

92
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,998
That's not what I said.

93
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,059
It's okay.

94
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,901
It's not the Taj Mahal.

95
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,804
How long has
he been coming?

96
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,638
About 20 years now.

97
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,673
He's a good man, Frank.

98
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,041
You still call him "Frank"?

99
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,705
Hey, in this joint
I'm the President,

100
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,681
the Vice President
and the Congress.

101
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:17,051
He's just another customer.
A loyal one.

102
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,554
You think that's why
he likes it here?

103
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,859
'Cause you treat him
like a regular person?

104
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,827
Maybe. Mostly it's the fucking
ribs, though.

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,491
Now, if unemployment
goes up more than two-tenths,

106
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,501
I want the Fed
to consider...

107
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,687

108
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,260
Get you
something, hon?

109
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,924
Club soda with lime, please.

110
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,358
That's it?
Yeah.

111
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,305
Nothing to eat?
No. That's it.

112
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,803
Tough spot to hang out
if you're in the program.

113
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,073
How'd you know?

114
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,942
Takes one to
know one, right?

115
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,072
How long?

116
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,277
Little over a year. You?

117
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,046
Going on 15.

118
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,982
Any luck with
the ponies?

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,783
None. Not yet.

120
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,126
Pick a number. One through 12.
Nine.

121
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,065
Hot Fuss.

122
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,427
Sounds about right.

123
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,430
Club soda coming up,
darling. With lime.

124
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,172
 Hasn't moved
the last two hours.

125
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,110
And he hasn't spoken
to anybody?

126
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:53,684
Just been betting on the races.
You want us to bring him in?

127
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:58,085
No. That's the Vice
President's Chief of Staff.

128
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,987
 Really?

129
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,324
We don't want to make a scene.
Just keep an eye on him.

130
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,991
Let me know what he does, where
he goes, and who he talks to.

131
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,591
You got it, Mr. Lanagin.

132
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,767
 You should've
seen their faces.

133
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,101
They didn't know
what to think.

134
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,936
Especially when
I made 'em hold the bag.

135
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,998
You tried it out?

136
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,099
I sure as hell did.

137
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,940

138
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,836

139
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,347
I'm sorry I lashed out
at you, Frank.

140
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,940
No. I was disrespectful,
and that was uncalled for.

141
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,681
My tempers gotten away
from me these days.

142
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,189
I need to be jolted back
into reality sometimes.

143
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,316
It was a kind gesture.

144
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,485
Oh, just some good old fun.

145
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,861
Tricia tells me we're having
dinner later this week.

146
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,661
 Yes.
Claire tells me the same.

147
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,864
Well, it'll be good to get out
of this place for a few hours.

148
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,976
It's been here
since Kennedy.

149
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,746
It was painted the
same year he was born.

150
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,309
It depicts, I think,
a World War I parade.

151
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,388
I should know
every painting.

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,653
Well, you seem to know quite a
lot, at least about this one.

153
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:14,995
Oh, I try to soak it all in while I can.
All the history.

154
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,001
Presidents who obsess
over history

155
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,163
obsess about their place in
it, instead of forging it.

156
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,232
Who said that?

157
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,331
I did. Just now.

158
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,177
Ah, the White House.

159
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:36,084
All day long, it's buzzing, and
at this hour, it's so desolate.

160
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,519
 The Presidency
is a great and precious thing.

161
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,354
Loneliness is the price.

162
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,361
Let's assume

163
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,729
in one of these chairs,
staring at this wall,

164
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,101
is where Truman
decided to drop the bomb.

165
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,970
And see
if we feel anything.

166
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,545

167
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,388
Nothing. You?

168
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,050
No.

169
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,301
Sorry, it's a mess.

170
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,839
You don't have to clean up for me.
Yes, I do.

171
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,011
Wouldn't want you
seeing these.

172
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,809
I wore 'em last night.

173
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,024
You like these or you want
the ones I'm wearing now?

174
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,504
How long you been
working in the casino?

175
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,200
Too long.

176
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,279
Bet you've seen a lot. Oh, yeah.
I've seen everything.

177
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,689

178
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,632
I should get going.
Got an early meeting.

179
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,791
Okay.

180
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,868
Do you want me to stay?

181
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,909
I wasn't planning
on sleeping here.

182
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,672
So, another
one night stand then?

183
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,548
Is that okay?

184
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,480
Not really my thing.

185
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,320
Come on. You must play the field.
No, I don't.

186
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,061
But you are such a flirt.

187
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,562
I flirt, yes.

188
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,730
But I only sleep with
someone if I'm into them.

189
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,325
And I prefer
to stick around.

190
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,502
Remy Danton,
serial monogamist.

191
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,402
This a joke?

192
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,847
I'm sorry. l didn't, uh...
Sorry.

193
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,451
This doesn't happen again
unless it's leading somewhere.

194
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,253
I'm upfront about
what I want in all things.

195
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,919
Not just politics.

196
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,296
 Three or four times a year, they
fly in about a dozen Chinese guys.

197
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,202
Money to burn.

198
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,572
They got a whole floor of the
casino reserved just for them.

199
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,939
<i>Word is,
they throw away millions.</i>

200
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,602
 Well, that doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

201
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,271
The Chinese love to gamble.
Especially the rich ones.

202
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,283
<i>Yeah, in Vegas. This is Missouri.
It's a much longer flight.</i>

203
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,614
I want to find out...

204
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,921
I want to find out where these
planes are coming from.

205
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,322
Who do we know
in the FAA?

206
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,054
<i>I don't know anyone, but Doyle does.
I already got him on it.</i>

207
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,790
<i>I'll text you
when I hear back from Doyle.</i>

208
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,057
I gotta go.

209
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,331
You leaving?

210
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,133
Yeah. Thanks for
last night. I had fun.

211
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,942
No, you didn't. You were
thinking of somebody else.

212
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,918
I got that one
after 10 years.

213
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,595
Hope it brings
you some luck.

214
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,766

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,432
Elaine Brooks
will be sponsoring.

216
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,502
And the First Lady has
approved the early draft.

217
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,671
Jackie, take a look
at the board.

218
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,340
Get a sense of who might
co-sponsor, besides yourself.

219
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,283
Absolutely. I'm sure we can lock
down a lot of heavyweights.

220
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,953
Lorrie and I'll
get right on it.

221
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,014
We should talk about a media plan.
It's premature for that.

222
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,684
Don't we want to get this out, start
building support as soon <i>as</i> possible?

223
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,056
Events, interviews...

224
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,527
I want what's
most effective.

225
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,120
A media blitz
is the wrong way to go.

226
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,632
You want a single,
long lead

227
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,326
that coincides with the
introduction of the bill.

228
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,528
Something classy. But you want
broad support, to hit as many...

229
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,866
A blanket strategy will galvanize
as many detractors as supporters.

230
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,702
Not if the message is framed
in such a way that...

231
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,037
We want a key demographic
to get on board, and then...

232
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,668
Let me finish, please.
Then we let it percolate.

233
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,340
I suggest Matt Bai. <i>The
New York Times Magazine.</i>

234
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,314
I like that idea.
I like that very much.

235
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,374
So do I. Can you speak to Matt?

236
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,545
No promises. Just test the waters.
I'm happy to do that.

237
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,985
I've got a good
relationship with Matt.

238
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,421
I'll call him.
 Great.

239
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,152
Seth, you keep me posted, and let's
all get together later this week.

240
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,556
Thanks, Jackie.

241
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,231
I want you to read the bill
and write me a summary.

242
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,833
Do not under any circumstances
share it with anyone

243
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,173
until we've spoken.

244
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,542
You don't want to go
over the board first...

245
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,172
No. Not yet.

246
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,083
 Anything
on the abortion?

247
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,524
 Nothing.
It all checks out.

248
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,084
100%?

249
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,560
I turned over
every stone.

250
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,962
Mrs. Underwood
was telling the truth.

251
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,430
We need something.
This is taking too long.

252
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,625
The Underwoods are careful.

253
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,762
If they have skeletons,
they're buried deep.

254
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,069
It's not a question of "if." Somebody
like Frank is gonna have skeletons.

255
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,610
Then I'll find them.

256
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,610
If you don't deliver,
that means I don't deliver.

257
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,578
And I always deliver.

258
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,981
You gave me an assignment
with high expectations.

259
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,053
I'll meet them, but it's not
gonna happen overnight.

260
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,782
So, don't fuck with me.

261
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,881
I'm a hired gun.
Not one that you own.

262
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,956
As long as you
hit the target.

263
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,793
Then I need a favor.
Connor Ellis?

264
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,725
What about him?

265
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,736
I'll have more access
if he isn't around.

266
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,636
Arrange a cushy job offer
for him somewhere?

267
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,230
Private or public sector?

268
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,842
Private.

269
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,744
Lots of money. Something
he can't turn down.

270
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,839
I'll see what I can do.

271
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,480
Here, this is half.

272
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,082
You can pay me when I've
gotten you what you want.

273
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,924
I don't take half pay
for a job half done.

274
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,204
It's an interesting proposal.

275
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,368
What we're missing
is a unified theme.

276
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,675
If we coordinate on national ad
buys, organize crossover events,

277
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,181
develop fundraising apps, I think,
it would go a long way in raising...

278
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,445
Maybe, but I doubt the
leadership will go for it.

279
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,715
Which is why I'd like your support.
I set up a meeting.

280
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,448
If you came and you
supported my position...

281
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,991
Well, I just think that
they're gonna end up saying

282
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,856
we can't be thinning out our
funds on a national strategy.

283
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,156
This is about field work,
getting out the vote.

284
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,698
Right, but it isn't it worth at least
some consideration?

285
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,064
Well, you know me, Linda. I
mean, I'm all for bold ideas.

286
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,969
But Birch and Womack, why,
they're set in their ways.

287
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,735
I doubt very
seriously that...

288
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,008
Listen, Frank, all I'm asking is
that you play devil's advocate...

289
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,549
I'm sorry, Linda, excuse me for
just a moment. This is important.

290
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,879
I don't want to
short-shrift this.

291
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,077
No, I know. But I just
have to send this text.

292
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,175
And I am busy, too.

293
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,648

294
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,861
Make sure that's an aisle seat.
Of course.

295
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,368
I don't feel as if you're
taking this very seriously.

296
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,704
Linda, I apologize. I am sorry.
You are absolutely right.

297
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,675
I did not mean
to sound curt.

298
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,440
And you are right.
This is important.

299
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,105
So, you and I should go
through your proposal

300
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,240
and discuss it right
down to the last detail.

301
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,252
I'm not asking you to go
through it page by page.

302
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,413
Just to help me initiate
some meaningful dialog.

303
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,513
Well, you can count
on my help, Linda.

304
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,895
Thank you. I will have my
scheduler reach out to yours.

305
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,090
Thank you, Linda.

306
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,132
Give me a secure line,
please.

307
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,735
 The Vice President
is on the line.

308
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,241
Mr. Vice President,

309
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,142
normally I would
ignore your call,

310
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,236
but I am in
a good mood today.

311
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,743
<i>Not even you
could ruin it.</i>

312
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,716
Are you funneling money
to the Republicans?

313
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,244
What on earth
are you talking about?

314
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,585
<i>About 20 million
in GOP Super PA Cs.</i>

315
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,387
Now, you know I never make
political contributions.

316
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,485
That's the fastest way
to upset my investors.

317
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,890
I know the money is coming
from a casino in Missouri

318
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,158
and I know
it's coming from Feng.

319
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,132
<i>Mr. Fang and I have one
co-venture together,</i>

320
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,497
<i>and it has nothing
to do with gambling.</i>

321
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,471
A plane that he owns flies to
Lanagin's casino on a regular basis.

322
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,902
What he does on his own time
is no business of mine.

323
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,309
Are you trying to create
chaos in the ranks?

324
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,811

325
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,815
The Republicans appear to be doing a
fine job of that without my help.

326
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,179
Well, it's not gonna
work, Raymond.

327
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,947
It'll bind the Democrats
together, not pull us apart.

328
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,513
What has bound them
together the past decade

329
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,456
has been the means
to achieve a majority.

330
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,585
<i>If I had to guess...</i>

331
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,928
He stacked Congress.
The majority I whipped.

332
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,970
So it's been you, Raymond,
all along.

333
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:24,798
<i>Even when Lanagin's
money was coming to us.</i>

334
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,470
You keep making assumptions
that I have denied.

335
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,841
Well, once the quarterly
filings come out,

336
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,880
anybody with a laptop
is gonna see what's going on.

337
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,108
The end of September.

338
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,516
<i>And that's a long way off.</i>

339
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,111
<i>But I look forward
to seeing the reports.</i>

340
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,714
<i>Should make for some
very interesting reading,</i>

341
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,384
two weeks before
the midterms.

342
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,224
You cannot bully your way
back to the table, Raymond,

343
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,696
just as you cannot buy
the keys to Congress.

344
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,827
Best of luck keeping your
majority in the House.

345
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,133
I know how much
it means to you.

346
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,535
When the money's coming your way,
you don't ask any questions.

347
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,908
But now, it's clear.

348
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,573
Lanagin's never been
anything but a front.

349
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:09,084
Do I tell the President? No.

350
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,245
He'll wonder
why I didn't know,

351
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,548
which makes me look
uninformed.

352
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,749
Or he'll blame the messenger
for involving him,

353
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,019
which makes me look careless.

354
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:19,086
No, it's a trap.
I must keep this to myself.

355
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,729
He wants to know who you're
buying on behalf of.

356
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,564
It's a hedge fund named Mercury Capital.
It's unlisted.

357
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,001

358
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,041
They need the names
of the principal investors.

359
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,378
Tell him I have
to protect identities.

360
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:45,011
The broker needs more. He
wants a full investor list.

361
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,683
Say, um...

362
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,748
Say that
the principal investor

363
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,850
has strong ties
to the White House.

364
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,236
They want to know if you
represent Clayton West.

365
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,237
Clayton West?

366
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,811
He's waiting.
One second.

367
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,142
<i>What does it say?</i>

368
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,619
It's about
a refinery in China

369
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,453
for rare earth elements.

370
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,720
Tell him yes.

371
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,730
Tell him the principal
investor is Raymond Tusk.

372
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,407

373
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,404
<i>This is Doug Stamper.
I'm not...</i>

374
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,473
What should we serve
the Walkers?

375
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,017
Cyanide?

376
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,644
Saving that for dessert.
What about a main course?

377
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,781
Meat of some sort.
A vegetable.

378
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,690
I mean, this isn't really
my area of expertise.

379
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,330
I was thinking,
what about Freddy?

380
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,192
Ribs.

381
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,668
Or is that gauche?

382
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:10,605
No. I like the idea.

383
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,602
Well, we can do the nice
china and gourmet sides,

384
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,548
but I think the ribs
make it more personal.

385
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,346
I'll make the call.

386
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,546
Any word on the call
you're expecting?

387
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,886
Not yet. I don't
think he's landed.

388
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,352
This is really coming
along, isn't it?

389
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,863
You think it's childish.

390
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,525
I think it's better
than video games.

391
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,469

392
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,208

393
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,552
Do you have my check for $51100?

394
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,486
Next time I get a raise.

395
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,219
Bad luck
at the casino?

396
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,816
So, Tusk
knows I'm here?

397
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,920
Daniel Lanagin
knows you're here.

398
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,691
Is Tusk involved?

399
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,357
Why would
I admit that?

400
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,094
Tusk is in
business with you.

401
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,430
You're sending money
to Lanagin.

402
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,367
Lanagin's casino
is in Tusk's backyard.

403
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,865
You didn't fly halfway around the
world just to confirm suspicions.

404
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,171
Tell me what you want.

405
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,508
We want the money to stop
flowing to the Republicans.

406
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,911
And what do I receive?

407
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,847
I've told you what we want.
Now it's your turn.

408
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,182
So you can
mislead me again.

409
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,914
Things have changed.

410
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,718
We have nothing to gain
by misleading you.

411
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,518
What do you think
of my garden?

412
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,795
It's very beautiful.

413
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:45,792
When you only talk business,
you stop appreciating beauty.

414
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,394
I don't have much time
for beauty.

415
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,939
That's a shame.

416
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,474
People like you
lo smell a flower,

417
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,373
some of us
have to pull the weeds.

418
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,440
When do you
plan on leaving?

419
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,276
I haven't bought
my return ticket yet.

420
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,407
Good.

421
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,713
I'd like to think
on this for a night.

422
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,118
And I'm sure
you must be exhausted.

423
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,211
Would you do me the honor
of being my guest?

424
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,757
I'd be very grateful.

425
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,987
Excellent.
You can get some rest.

426
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,495
And if you like, there are many
beautiful things to enjoy here.

427
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,398

428
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,794
Please.

429
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,263

430
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,575

431
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,755

432
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,870
Sir, Mr. Grayson is here.

433
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,268
Seth.

434
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,266
You and I haven't
really properly

435
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,004
had the chance to sit and have a
chat since you came on board.

436
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,278
Is there anything I can
be doing better sir?

437
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,872
No. No. I'm impressed.

438
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,509
You're very smart.
Excellent work ethic.

439
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,112
But more importantly,
you're very observant.

440
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,486
Information is power.

441
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,951
It was right here in this room
that my wife revealed

442
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,192
a great deal of information
to a great number of people.

443
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:23,527
Millions of them.

444
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,193
Sir, if your concern is my
knowledge of any discrepancies,

445
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,361
then let me assure you...

446
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,803
Claire and I are
very private people.

447
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,138
I can understand
why you might mistrust me.

448
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,210
I'm also observant,
like you, Seth.

449
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,475
But I still have
my blind spots.

450
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,486
It would have never occurred to
me to reach out to Mrs. Marbury.

451
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:49,189
Her husband was dead.
He kept no records.

452
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,394
And yet, there it was,
in black and white.

453
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,398
I respect the fact
that you brought it to us.

454
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,333
That's what
got you in the door.

455
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:04,836
But if you want to stay,
I need more.

456
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,837
What exactly are you up to?

457
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,276
I was hired by Remy Danton.

458
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,357
He wants anything damaging
that I can find.

459
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,783
Does he have a copy
of the journal?

460
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,759
No copies. I gave the
original to Mrs. Underwood

461
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,694
and I told him
that her story checks out.

462
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,563
Did you give him
anything else?

463
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:32,192
I don't have anything else. I
wouldn't give it to him if I did.

464
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,032
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

465
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:36,134
You're the Vice President
of the United States.

466
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,230
Remy works
for Raymond Tusk.

467
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,937
That puts me between two
extremely powerful people.

468
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,205
I had to be careful.

469
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,779
Oh, I'm sure that Remy is offering
you a great deal of money.

470
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:47,043
But that's
all he offers.

471
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,244
But when I saw you push entitlement
reform through the Senate,

472
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,722
it was clear to me where the real
power in the White House is.

473
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:58,153
I want to work for a man like you.
Not sail a yacht.

474
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,154
Money doesn't interest me.

475
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,067
Do you want me to
cease contact with Remy?

476
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,332
 No.

477
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,337
I want you to
find the blind spots.

478
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,137
Is he free?

479
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,407
For a few minutes.
Thank you.

480
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,782
Mexico City, where
you'll meet President Soto.

481
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,442
We can practice your
Spanish on the plane.

482
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,584
Hi.

483
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,447
What is that?
Frank gave it to me.

484
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,817
You have a minute?

485
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,122
Is it important? I have a
meeting with, uh... When is it?

486
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,421
He's already
in the waiting room.

487
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,158
The Archbishop
of New York.

488
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:38,030
I'm just wondering if we should
bring a gift to dinner tonight.

489
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,831
Yeah. Well, it's casual.
Maybe a bottle of wine.

490
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,839
You know them well. Any idea
what sort of wine they like?

491
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,170
Not extremely well, but I'm
friendly with their staff. I can...

492
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,040
I'll figure it out.
I can make a call.

493
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,840
I'm having a conversation with
my husband, but thank you.

494
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,539
Okay. I apologize.

495
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:55,312
I'll see you
at the residence. 7:30?

496
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,655

497
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,257
No. Not now.

498
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,693
No, just... Please go.

499
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,233
Get out. Please.

500
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,555

501
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,493
Rachel.

502
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,330
It's me. I, uh...

503
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:58,067
You should answer when I call.
I don't like leaving messages.

504
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,136
Seth?

505
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,646
Ayla, I get 15 minutes
to eat on a good day.

506
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,806
Xander Feng.

507
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,007
Means nothing to me.

508
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,812
Connor told me about a
back channel with China.

509
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:11,148
There was speculation it was
a guy named Xander Feng.

510
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,120
Fourteen minutes, 52 seconds. He's
in business with Raymond Tusk.

511
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,817
They're working
on a refinery in China.

512
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:17,621
Tusk has ties
to the White House.

513
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,854
Fourteen minutes, 37... One of
the wealthiest men in America

514
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,192
in business with an
off-the-books Chinese diplomat?

515
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,267
Influence in Washington
that's never been reported?

516
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,825
Then the White House pushes
rare earth subsidies

517
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,096
when the energy
crisis spiked...

518
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,662
Do you have a specific
question for me?

519
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,297
I'd like to ask the Vice
President about this.

520
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:34,276
A specific question for me,
not an interview request.

521
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,480
Does the Vice President
know Raymond Tusk?

522
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,481
Not to my knowledge. You're
hiding something, Seth.

523
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:44,009
I'm not hiding anything. I'm
just a guy with low blood sugar.

524
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,621
Garrett?
Mmm.

525
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,886
What is it?

526
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,295
Christina.

527
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,561
She won't leave me alone.

528
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,194
It's like she's trying
too hard to be helpful.

529
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,034
I'll have Linda
talk to her.

530
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:06,575
It's not just that.
I feel like it's a mask.

531
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,872
I feel like there's something
else going on there.

532
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,173
Like what?

533
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:14,978
Sometimes when I walk into your
office and see her talking to you...

534
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,044
And you've been traveling
together so much.

535
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,487
Jesus, Tricia.

536
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,258
Not you. Her.

537
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,562
I think she's
attracted to you.

538
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,096
And she does have a history
of getting involved...

539
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:31,895
I can't even believe we're
having this conversation.

540
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,333
I want you to
relocate her.

541
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,269
Just find her another position...
No, absolutely not.

542
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,430
I know
it seems overboard...

543
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,562
She's a good aide.

544
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,370
She's valuable to Linda, which makes
her valuable to the administration.

545
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,571
I'm your wife. I should be more
valuable than either of them.

546
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,702
Tricia...
I don't understand

547
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,715
why you're fighting me on
this when she bothers me...

548
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,115
We're pulling up to Frank's
in two minutes.

549
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,120

550
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,025
Really superb, Freddy.

551
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,529
I can honestly say I have never
had better ribs in my life.

552
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,032
Well, I'm glad
you liked 'em.

553
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,298
You know, I read the article in The
Sun, about how you go to Freddy's.

554
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,304
 Oh, I hope you don't mind me
speaking to that reporter, Frank.

555
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,430
Not at all.

556
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,100
Oh, shit, I forgot I'm not
supposed to call you that

557
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,940
I wouldn't let you call me "Vice
President" even if you tried.

558
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,378
And I didn't mind at all. I
thought the article was great.

559
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,815
Well, there's been a big bump
in business since it came out.

560
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,943
I'm talking
lines around the block.

561
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,385
You're not the only white
person to show up there now.

562
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,649
Well, I'm gonna
call it a night.

563
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,386
I got an early start
in the morning.

564
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,555
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. President

565
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,722
Mrs. Walker.

566
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,890
 A pleasure. Truly.

567
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,490
Thanks, Freddy.
Always.

568
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,336
Oh, no. None
for me, thanks.

569
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,168
 Oh, Mr. President, a slice
of pie is good for the soul.

570
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,742
I'm stuffed. You can
have a slice of pie.

571
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,270
 I'm fine, really.
But thank you, Frank.

572
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,574
I'll have some.

573
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,015
 For the two
of us as well.

574
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,315
Oh, now, she's gonna make me run another
five miles to work off this puppy.

575
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,982
Are you crazy? I can
barely keep up with you.

576
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,788
You're so much faster than me.
You two run together?

577
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,330
 Yes, it's hard to find
the time, but somehow we find it.

578
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,127
 We do. And it's something
that's just ours, you know?

579
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,599
 Yes. Just ours.

580
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,829
And about eight Secret
Service agents.

581
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,995

582
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,596
That's so nice
that you have that together.

583
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,040
I wish Garrett and I had more
time for things like that.

584
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,270
Oh, we did take a spinning
class together once.

585
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:24,107
You should've seen Garrett
hunched over the handlebar...

586
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,614
Please.

587
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:31,013
Would you like some more wine?
I would, thank you.

588
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,554
I saw the punching bag
you gave him.

589
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,454
You know what?
I will have a slice of pie.

590
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,788
 Pie, please.
For the President.

591
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,189
Thank you.

592
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,463
I read it front to back.
I think it's good.

593
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,631
It'll cause a shit-storm, but
maybe that's what we need.

594
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,173
Not during the midterms.

595
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:52,798
I don't see
how we take flak.

596
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,037
We're trying to curtail
rape for god sakes.

597
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,545
Sure, some right-wingers will do
their usual song and dance...

598
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,309
Let's hold off. I want
to read it myself first.

599
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,014
We promised the Vice President we
would have co-sponsors lined up...

600
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,075
I know what we promised,
and we're gonna stall.

601
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,381
Don't disseminate
the draft.

602
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,184
You know the gist of the bill.
I don't see why we can't...

603
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,054
Lorrie.

604
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,321
All right.
I'll leave it with you.

605
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,488
Anything else?

606
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,665
No. I think we're good.

607
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,597
All right. Then I'm off.

608
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,593
Date night with the husband.

609
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,568
Slit my wrists, please.

610
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,541
Hey, go home
at some point, okay?

611
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,577
The Capitol will still
be here in the morning.

612
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,667

613
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,041

614
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,604

615
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,769

616
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,390

This is really something.

617
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,899
 Ways to go yet.

618
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,435
Now, who won this battle?
The North or the South?

619
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,836
Massive casualties on both sides.
No clear winner.

620
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,772
How do you find the time?

621
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,742
I carve out a half-hour
here and there.

622
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,834
Helps me relax.

623
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,938
I've forgotten
the meaning of that word.

624
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,078
Well, that's what
the punching bag is for.

625
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,149
That's very true.

626
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,324
Just a little. Tricia and I
should get going soon.

627
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,864
You're never gonna make it through
this first term, Mr. President.

628
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:56,955
How do you mean?

629
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:58,194
Well, not like this.

630
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,825
Letting the stress
creep in.

631
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:03,167
You need to run the
marathon, not the sprint.

632
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,537
You need to enjoy these
little moments of escape.

633
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,605
You can pour more than that.

634
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:10,839

635
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,312
Thank you.

636
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,188
That's Union or Rebel?

637
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,789
Union, sir.

638
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,984
No, enough "Sirs"
and "Mr. Presidents."

639
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,118
Call me by my name.

640
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,293
I respect the office
too much for that.

641
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,660
When we're in private,
it's okay.

642
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,864
Tonight, I don't
have to be President.

643
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,197
 I don't mean to get
involved in your personal life.

644
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,637
Oh, no. I brought it up.

645
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,168
Is this really
about Christina?

646
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:46,511
Or maybe it's just a symptom
of something else.

647
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,845
Like what?

648
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,584
I don't know.

649
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,988
I barely see him
at all.

650
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,328
He's so wound up in everything
that's going on overseas,

651
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,991
the elections,
the economy.

652
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,927
When he was governor,
it wasn't a cake walk,

653
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,334
but it was
nothing like this.

654
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:13,942
How do you and Frank do it?
You both seem so close.

655
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,512
We're honest
with each other.

656
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,913
We don't sweep anything
under the rug.

657
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:23,281
Tricia, if ifs eating at
you, make him talk about it.

658
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:29,515
The White House is finite.
Your marriage is for life.

659
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,072
Good morning.
Morning.

660
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,035
You don't like your soup?

661
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,872
I'm not good
with chopsticks.

662
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,773

663
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,246
I think you'll like
this soup more

664
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,478
than you liked the two companions
I sent you last night.

665
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,110
I was tired.

666
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,223
Have you had a chance to think
about what we discussed yesterday?

667
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,388
In China, it's polite to
refuse a gift the first time.

668
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,056
Maybe I should
refuse yours.

669
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,262
We can't offer you a gift if
I don't know what you want.

670
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,632
The Port Jefferson Bridge.

671
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,740
You pulled it
during the back channel.

672
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,105
Changed my mind.

673
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,574
Why?

674
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,237
I have allies
who want the bridge.

675
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,275
Without it, they become my enemies.
I've been put on trial twice.

676
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,649
Corruption charges.

677
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,757
Everyone in China who works on this
level pays who they need to pay.

678
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,188
And they kill
who they need to kill.

679
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,855
People disappear
all the time, Mr. Stamper.

680
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,433
I could disappear.
You could disappear.

681
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,171
Stop the junkets, and
we'll get you the bridge.

682
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,764
The bridge comes first.

683
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,970
The Vice President
has lied to me before.

684
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:58,446
I need proof of his commitment.
Then the money will stop.

685
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:07,449
Please, Mr. Stamper. Eat. You
have a long flight ahead of you.

686
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,324
If it's what you feel
you need to do.

687
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,525
I've had a great experience
here, Mrs. Underwood.

688
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:21,866
But this is an opportunity
I can't pass up.

689
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,735
I imagine the pay is substantial.
It is.

690
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:27,633
But it's not just that. There's
room to grow at SpaceX.

691
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,212
Well, if your mind's made up, I
won't try and convince you to stay.

692
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,477
The truth is, when I
first came on board,

693
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,883
I thought it was to work for
both you and your husband.

694
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,519
Don't get me wrong, it's been
an honor working for you.

695
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,184
But I didn't foresee
having to work with Seth.

696
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,657
You're not very fond
of each other.

697
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,828
No. Which is fine.
We're professionals.

698
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,026
But I think
this is for the best.

699
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:55,401
The problem with hiring great people
is everyone wants to steal them away.

700
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,734
I appreciate you being
so understanding.

701
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,831
You'll be missed, Connor.
Thank you.

702
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,081
Seth, it's me.
He just left.

703
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,584
Talk to him and
put out a press release.

704
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,848
Let's make this
as smooth as possible.

705
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,586
There's two opportunities
I'm interested in.

706
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,127
Family-oriented
restaurant chain

707
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:22,460
and a retail
barbecue sauce.

708
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,725
What would
that look like?

709
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,235
We give you an upfront payment
for the right to use your brand.

710
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,294
Either venture fails,
or they both do,

711
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:32,238
you still get to
keep that money.

712
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,036
How much money
we talking?

713
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,409
$95,000 as soon
as you sign.

714
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,540
And then you'd have a share of
the profits if we're successful.

715
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,213
What would the shares be?

716
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,449
I'll tell you what.
Let me draw up papers.

717
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,923
You look them over.
You show them to your lawyer.

718
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,654
I don't have a lawyer.

719
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,490
Well, you should get one.

720
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,825
I don't want you to feel
like you're being cheated.

721
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,757
You're skeptical.

722
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,566
Look“.

723
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,272

724
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,276
...money usually
don't come through that door

725
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:10,313
unless ifs looking
for a plate of ribs.

726
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,437
And we want to sell
thousands of those plates.

727
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,746
Millions,
if the franchise builds.

728
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,754
The Sun article
put you on the map.

729
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,849
Let's fill up that map with
Freddy's Barbecue Joints.

730
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,689
What are you looking at?

731
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,324
 Excuse me?

732
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,993
The knives are
in the kitchen.

733
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,663
You have a pistol.
You can stop staring.

734
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,469

735
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,275
Is he in here? Dan!

736
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,114
How are you?
Good.

737
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,113
Care for a drink?
I'm good.

738
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,445
Well, let's go into the living room.
It's more cozy.

739
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,953
I'm just fine where I am.

740
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,113
Well, all right.
Thank you.

741
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,347
 Yes, sir.

742
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,330
I'm sure you've told Raymond
that I've asked you here.

743
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,023
Raymond who? Oh, you don't
have to pretend, Dan.

744
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,068
Feng confirmed what you're up to.
Name doesn't ring a bell.

745
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:08,330
I have flight records.

746
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,703
One of his planes to Kansas
City on multiple occasions.

747
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:13,036
Do we really have to
play this game?

748
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:16,544
I came here because I thought you
might have something to offer.

749
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,238
Why don't we just
skip to that part.

750
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:25,181
You've been a loyal contributor, Dan.
You've thrown us fundraisers.

751
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,554
There are pictures
of you and I shaking hands.

752
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,923
So, whatever you've done this
quarter can be forgotten.

753
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,889
But I need the money to stop
flowing in the wrong direction.

754
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,566
I'm still waiting
for the offer.

755
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,899
You're a businessman, Dan, so I know
your primary concern is profits.

756
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,165
Well, that's right.

757
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,107
But I'm offering you something
that's far more valuable than money,

758
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,769
a direct line
to the White House.

759
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,369
That sounds vague to me.

760
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,507
I have influence
over the BIA.

761
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,107
Over federal gambling
legislation.

762
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,710
The sort of influence that my
contributions have already bought.

763
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:03,748
Not with my direct involvement
and the President's ear.

764
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,452
You know
what I like about money?

765
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:09,623
I can stack it on a table,
like this one.

766
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,629
I can measure it
with a yardstick.

767
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:17,229
I can see it, smell it,
buy things with it.

768
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:22,438
Houses, cars, clothes.
Things that are real.

769
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,446
You're gonna have to show up
with more than beads.

770
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,143
Dan, I invited you to my
home because I thought...

771
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,878
Through the backdoor.

772
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,579
Excuse me?

773
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,583
Through the backdoor,
like a servant.

774
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,556
The Secret Service makes
everyone come in that way.

775
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,820
It's a precautionary
measure...

776
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,122
Unless you're gonna offer
me more money than Tusk,

777
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,959
and I don't think
that you can,

778
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,794
there's little left
for us to talk about.

779
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,399
I am offering you
an alliance with a man

780
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:52,737
who goes to work every day
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

781
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,142
I don't place my faith
in any white man.

782
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,942
Especially one that works
for the federal government

783
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:01,945
lam just like you, Dan.

784
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,954
I know what it means to start from
nothing, to have to fight your way...

785
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,923
You know nothing about
what it means to be me.

786
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,190
Your version of nothing was light
years ahead of where I started.

787
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,161
I respect you, Dan.
I take you seriously...

788
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:18,097
I'll let you know when I give
a fuck about your respect.

789
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,198
Holiday? Show Lanagin out.

790
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,605
I know where
the back door is.

791
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,044

792
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,115
Francis?

793
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:47,325
It's not broken.
I can fix it.

794
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,536
Leave it. I'll
clean up later.

795
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,009
Let's go for a run. Burn
off some of this steam.

796
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:07,883

797
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,484
Sir?

798
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:16,992
I'll be out in a moment.

799
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,559
I'll go ahead.
You catch up.

800
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,890
Why didn't you reach out
before you got on a plane?

801
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,397
I was afraid our communication
might be monitored.

802
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,727
Where are we
with Lanagin?

803
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,699
Nowhere.
Where are we with Feng?

804
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,500
We might have an option,
but it's gonna be tricky.
