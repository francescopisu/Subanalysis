2
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,284
The Vice President just
entered the Department of Justice.

3
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,658
We're here with Ayla Sayyad,

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,826
whose Wall Street Telegraph article
catalyzed the investigation. Ayla.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,700
The issue at stake is whether the
White House was in any way involved.

6
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,863
Was foreign money
traded for political favors?

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,134
Did it influence
diplomatic relations?

8
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,235
Just the act of laundering Chinese
contributions is illegal.

9
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,574
If it had a significant impact
on White House policy,

10
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,239
that's a far more
serious crime.

11
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:41,079
You've met with Daniel Lanagin
on multiple occasions.

12
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,850
We were in the same room, yes,
on 11 occasions since 2003.

13
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:49,087
But we only spoke
on three of those occasions.

14
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,162
Those instances
are highlighted.

15
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,822
What did you discuss?

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,991
Well, these were fundraisers.

17
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,832
I speak to dozens of people,
usually about nothing at all.

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,064
I'm southern, Ms. Dunbar.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,835
My mother taught me that conversation
during mealtime is not only polite,

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,207
it aids the digestive process.

21
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,509
So you didn't speak to him about
the Adohi tribe's contributions

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,605
to any of these super PACs?

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,772
Absolutely not.

24
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,708
I never discuss super PACs
with any supporters.

25
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,448
We both know the law.

26
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,716
During one of these
polite conversations,

27
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,589
do you recall Mr. Lanagin
ever mentioning Xander Feng?

28
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,450
I do not.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,052
Does that name
mean anything to you?

30
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,893
Other than being plastered
all over the news?

31
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,767
In that regard, it means
as much as Kim Kardashian.

32
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,924

33
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,734

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,632
Then let me be more specific.

35
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:39,540
What knowledge do you have of
Mr. Feng's political activities?

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,570
Is this coming
from your husband, or is it...

37
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,810
From me.

38
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,250
And it's not that I don't
support the bill anymore.

39
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,447
It's just the article.

40
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,649
We've promised Matt
an interview.

41
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,284
Maybe in a few weeks, once the
investigation has died down.

42
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,624
<i>The New York Times
isn't going to wait for us.</i>

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,995
They've already scheduled the cover
for October based on our timing...

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,829
Then I can't be a part of it.

45
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,130
It's the Galloway nonsense,
isn't it?

46
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,396
Claire, come on.

47
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:11,910
It's okay. You can say so.
We're friends.

48
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,069
It doesn't help.

49
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,314
You don't actually believe I...
No.

50
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,111
But enough of the country
still does.

51
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:22,676
And Garrett needs every bit of
support he can get right now.

52
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,617
So there's no convincing you?

53
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,185
I'll help <i>as</i> much as I can.
Quietly.

54
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,863
<i>There are rumors
that you and Mr, Feng</i>

55
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,494
served as back channels
to the trade summit last May.

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,537
Exactly. Rumors.

57
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,165
 We have Feng in the U.S.
during the summit.

58
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,268
Well, if he was back-channeling,
and even if I were aware,

59
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,940
any form of diplomatic communication
is usually classified.

60
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,944
Have you ever discussed Feng
with the President?

61
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,679
Any major player in Beijing
is worthy of discussion.

62
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,118
 So that's a yes.

63
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,620
It's a general comment.

64
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,622
Did you discuss him
during the energy crisis?

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,489
I assume you're alluding to the
refinery co-venture with...

66
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,720
Yes. With Raymond Tusk.

67
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,796
The refinery was never
part of our conversation.

68
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,160
We needed
an immediate solution.

69
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,325
A refinery would have solved
nothing in the short term.

70
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,130
And ifs my understanding
that deal fell through.

71
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,330
Correct. But Tusk did
receive a subsidy.

72
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,135
As did every other
nuclear energy provider.

73
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,335
 But his connection with
Feng, then a subsidy on samarium...

74
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,503
Nobody made any profits
off these subsidies.

75
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,910
At best,
they were breaking even.

76
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,346
In fact, Raymond fought us
on the issue.

77
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:28,648
 Then let's back up
to the Port Jefferson Bridge.

78
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,578
I don't blame her.
It's a valid concern.

79
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,285
Tell him I won't engage on Galloway,
so there's no point in asking.

80
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,348
Well, this is Matt Bai.

81
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,621
We can't dictate what he'll ask.
And he will ask.

82
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,857
Then I'll just say I won't
answer tabloid questions.

83
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,523
It's a legitimate question.

84
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,259
How the scandal
could affect the vote.

85
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,430
Look, I say you pullout, too.
We scrap the whole piece.

86
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,805
Jackie is fighting us. The
leadership is noncommittal.

87
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,470
We need this article
to refocus attention.

88
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,206
But it'll hurt you.

89
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,215
Both your personal image
and the bill.

90
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,979
But if we cut the cord, we schedule
two interviews, then we cancel,

91
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,045
won't Matt be furious? The story
will be about pulling out.

92
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,646
We're talking about
the lesser of two evils.

93
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,623
I don't want you to become the
target, to undo all the work...

94
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,661
Then what if
it's not me at all?

95
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:53,321
You said the First Lady wasn't...
Not her. Someone else.

96
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,027
Was the bridge a trade-off to
prevent additional GOP funding?

97
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,501
As far as I know,
the bridge was a delivery

98
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,403
on a promise the President
had made to the voters.

99
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,997
Are we finished here?

100
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,632
Almost.

101
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,906
How many members of Congress have
you interviewed, Ms. Dunbar?

102
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,036
About 200?

103
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,204
194.

104
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,338
Well, I want to be of help,

105
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,681
but I doubt I can offer any more
than the 194 that preceded me.

106
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,086
I have gotten some
useful testimony.

107
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,987
From who?
A high-ranking House member.

108
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,855
In the leadership?
I'm not at liberty to say.

109
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,019
Bob Birch? Jackie Sharp?

110
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,088
This individual says he attended a
meeting July 14th in the Oval Office.

111
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,258
She said "He,"
so it must have been Birch.

112
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,267
I'm sure Raymond had no
trouble buying him off.

113
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,768
You attended
that meeting also.

114
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,532
It appears so.

115
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,100
Do you recall
the subject of that meeting?

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,942
A wave of conservative attack ads.
We were being outspent.

117
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,208
It must have
been quite a shock

118
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,945
when Lanagin's tribe shifted
contributions to the other party,

119
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,550
when they hadn't given a single dime
to the Republicans before that.

120
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,587
Well,
it would have been a shock,

121
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,623
but we didn't know where the money
was coming from at the time.

122
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,214
According to my source...
Bob Birch.

123
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,061
My source says
the estimate was 25 million.

124
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,394
You said, and I quote,

125
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,898
"With this kind of influx,

126
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,561
"you can be sure somebody
isn't playing by the rules."

127
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:08,037
Sounds like something I might say.
Bob has a better memory than me.

128
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,234
The money stopped just after the
Port Jefferson Bridge was approved.

129
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,403
Is there a theory here, or are
you just grasping at straws?

130
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,073
The bridge leads to Feng. Feng
gives me Lanagin and Tusk.

131
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,207
Tusk and the President...

132
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,582
Ms. Dunbar, you want to play
six degrees of separation,

133
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,416
you could throw in
Jimmy Hoffa and the pope.

134
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,151
Then how about
one degree of separation?

135
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,920
Douglas Stamper,
your chief of staff.

136
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,426
This is him at Lanagin's
casino July 14th.

137
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,830
I used these to get a
warrant for flight records.

138
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,167
The next day, Mr. Stamper
was on a flight to Beijing.

139
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,934
Why was he at the casino?
And why was he in Beijing?

140
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,842
I would like to speak to my client.
Please.

141
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,274
I work hard.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,014
I keep things simple.
I know what my priorities are.

143
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,350
There's this person.

144
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,661
She's not even in my life, except on
the edges, making things blurrier.

145
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,202
It doesn't tempt me to drink.
It's more like she...

146
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,369
It's more like she feels what it
was like when I was drinking.

147
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,301
When I couldn't get enough.

148
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:24,508
No matter how many drinks
I had, I wanted another.

149
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,518
I don't want to be with her.

150
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,689
I mean, I do.

151
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:43,199
But it's more like she's
my daughter or my mother.

152
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,728
I don't know. This is fucked up.
 Take your time.

153
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,236
I should cut her off.
The way I did with booze.

154
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,477
That's all. I'm done.

155
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,575
Thanks for sharing.

156
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,743
 Thanks for sharing.

157
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,717
We'll need some time before
responding to your questions.

158
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,256
I could wait as long as necessary.
It could take a while.

159
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,984
There are national
security matters at stake.

160
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,756
The Vice President needs to
consult with his advisers.

161
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,420
National security? Are you really
gonna play that card' Oliver?

162
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,761
His answers could entail
classified material.

163
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,357
When can we expect a response?

164
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,428
I'll let you know. May we
hold onto the screen cap?

165
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,597
Be my guest.

166
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,902
We'll be in touch soon, Ms. Dunbar.
Mr. Vice President?

167
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,374
If you think
you're insulated, don't.

168
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,572
Our investigation is much
bigger than Douglas Stamper.

169
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,579
That's enough, Ms. Dunbar.

170
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,115
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Vice President.

171
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,779
Happy to cooperate.

172
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,727
From the lion's den
to a pack of wolves.

173
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,731
When you're fresh meat, kill, and
throw them something fresher.

174
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,095
Hey, I'm Fitz.

175
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,265
Doug.

176
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,736
Yeah, you know, you can isolate,
white-knuckle this shit if you want.

177
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:06,950
Or you can ask for help.
Got a sponsor?

178
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,147
No. It's been 14 years.
I'm good.

179
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,123
Numbers on the back,
if you change your mind.

180
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,266
I thought you had a driver.

181
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:30,434
I do. I didn't want him
overhearing anything.

182
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,307
You shouldn't even
be near this state.

183
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,245
I'm not really here. Long layover
on my way to California.

184
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,577
I've got auditors,
federal agents in my office,

185
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,483
going through every file,
every document.

186
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,446
They're going
through my goddamn trash.

187
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,252
Just stick to the Fifth
if she subpoenas you.

188
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,984
How do they know
to look for Stamper?

189
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,186
To search the tapes
on that exact day?

190
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,626
Don't jump to conclusions.

191
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,124
You're throwing
me under the bus.

192
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,996
Underwood's the road kill.
Not you.

193
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:00,094
They're going to fuck me.
They'll find a way.

194
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,161
And you know that.

195
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,468
And if that's the case, you and
your family will be taken care of.

196
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,835
They're already
offering me a plea.

197
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,211
You haven't even been charged yet.
If I cooperate.

198
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,611
You'll do less time, but your
family will have nothing.

199
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,312
They'll still have nothing
when you get out.

200
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,377
You testify against Raymond,

201
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,684
and he'll still walk because
all they'll have is your word.

202
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,960
And that doesn't count
for much right now.

203
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,020
You wouldn't be here
if he wasn't afraid.

204
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,392
I'm not here
because he's afraid.

205
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,332
I'm here because you are.

206
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,497
And I want to make sure
you don't do anything stupid.

207
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,871
After repeated conversations
with Beijing,

208
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,000
they remain intractable
in their position.

209
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,204
This morning, I gave
orders for a carrier group

210
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,679
to reposition near Okinawa.

211
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,714
This won't put our ships

212
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,875
in direct confrontation
with the Chinese vessels,

213
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,214
but it will put them
within reach of airstrikes.

214
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,313
I'll be informing the Chinese
ambassador later today.

215
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,484
We'll release a statement in
coordination with the Pentagon.

216
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,019
Sir, our stockpiles of samarium will
only last another two months at most.

217
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,429
If we go this route... I've
heard everyone's concerns.

218
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,503
And this is the decision I've made.
Any questions?

219
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,663
Okay. Thank you.

220
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,062
Frank.

221
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,589
How'd it go?

222
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,056
We have a few follow-up questions
that we have to address.

223
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,718
Like what?
Nothing major.

224
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,921
Just odds and ends.
A few details.

225
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,191
I was under the impression
this would be short and sweet.

226
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,235
So was I, but shes very deliberate.
We need this over, Frank.

227
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,802
At least as far as the
White House is concerned.

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,463
We can't be distracted.
Not with warships on the move.

229
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,634
I'm confident
we're in the home stretch.

230
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,211
Well, you seem more concerned
than you're letting on.

231
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,905
No, not at all.
You're fidgeting.

232
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,137

233
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,579
It's my class ring.
I forget I...

234
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,588
I buried it.
You what?

235
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,420
It's a long story.

236
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,488
I've never seen you
this stressed before, Frank.

237
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,258
Well, I've never seen you
this tired before, sir.

238
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,630
You've got rings of your own.
Dark ones.

239
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,099
They're getting worse,
aren't they?

240
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,569
You should take more naps
on those sofas in the Oval.

241
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,766
Naps don't cut it these days, Frank.
Not even a dent.

242
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,636
Lie after lie.

243
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,251
First to a prosecutor,
then to a President.

244
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,518
I feel exposed.

245
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,680
Like the skin
where my ring used to be.

246
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,786
Even Achilles was only
as strong as his heel.

247
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,434
Where's Doug?
He's not answering his phone.

248
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,597
He went to a meeting, sir.

249
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:49,799
In the middle of the day?

250
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,364
I think he's on
his way back now.

251
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,104
I want him back here
as soon as possible.

252
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,286
Sir, this arrived for you.

253
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,887
The watch you gave Remy
when he left for Glendon Hill.

254
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,819
I recognized it
from the quote on the back.

255
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,623
Was there a message?

256
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,493
No. Just the watch.

257
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,725
Let's find Doug.

258
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,060
Right away, sir.

259
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,164
Forgive the plastic.

260
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,404
Luc Tuymans.
He's the real thing.

261
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,971
Well, I'll take your word.
It's not mine. None of it.

262
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,349
California,
you want to sell your house,

263
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,081
your realtor decorates it.

264
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,986
Well, one room at least.

265
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,154
Where you moving?

266
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:46,390
I have a little
ranch in Sonoma.

267
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:50,901
My wife's gone.
My kids won't talk to me.

268
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,333
But at least I'll
have my painting.

269
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,003
You paint?

270
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,504
No. And there's no ranch.

271
00:14:55,728 --> 00:15:00,040
But the rest of it...
The rest of it's true. Cheers.

272
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,947
I'm here about
Jacqueline Sharp.

273
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,280
We're thinking of hiring her.

274
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,716
A lobbyist?

275
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,224
She could lose her re-elect. Not
a great time to be an incumbent.

276
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,227
I know you two are close.

277
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,231
So, you're looking for what?
A recommendation?

278
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,893
We have the lowest turnover
of any shop on K Street.

279
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,060
There's a reason.

280
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,468
What are you looking for
at Glendon Hill?

281
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,103
A killer instinct.

282
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,141
Well, she certainly has that.

283
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,480
Forgive me if I'm prying,

284
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,143
but did she have anything
to do with your...

285
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
Departure?

286
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,954
Jackie did what she had to do.
I'll never forgive her.

287
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,997
But I understand
why she did it.

288
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,826
Did what exactly?

289
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,265
I paid cash for my ticket.
I was careful.

290
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,831
Clearly not enough.

291
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,944
Sir, the casino
had cameras everywhere.

292
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,447
There was no
way to avoid them.

293
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,506
But there had to have been
thousands of hours of footage.

294
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,610
Now how they found that... I have
to ask you a question, Doug.

295
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,625
And I'm sorry,
but I need you to be honest.

296
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,092
Are you drinking again?

297
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,627
God, no.

298
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,857
Truly?
It's not an option.

299
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,489
Because it
would explain a lot.

300
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,160
You have every right to be upset.
This was my fault.

301
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:35,762
I'm more concerned than I'm upset. I
need you now, Doug. More than ever.

302
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,637
I know.

303
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,310
We're not young men. If we
fail, we'll die in a cage.

304
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,544
I haven't been myself lately.

305
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,061
That's what you said to me
14 years ago.

306
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,068
When I gave you a second chance,
it paid off. You got clean, Doug.

307
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,468
Nothing means more to me
than this job, sir.

308
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,230
Nothing.

309
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,468
Whatever's going on, I need to
know that it can be managed.

310
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,140
And if you need my help,
I'm here to help you.

311
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,047
I'm good, sir.
I can handle myself.

312
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,550
Things will be different.

313
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,495
I've never given someone
a third chance.

314
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,402
Until this very moment.

315
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,603
And I'm grateful.

316
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,005
You won't regret it.
Please believe that, sir.

317
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,243
It was Remy who alerted
them to the footage.

318
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,448
His going-away gift.
Read the back.

319
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,756
What do you think
he's trying to say?

320
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,195
I don't know, but track him
down and set up a meeting.

321
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,629
What about Dunbar?

322
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,532
We can't run from the facts.

323
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,970
I'll say whatever
you want me to say.

324
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,101
I'll take responsibility
for all of it.

325
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,436
She could indict you.

326
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,467
That's what
having a staff is for.

327
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,242
I have a better solution.

328
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,749
We'll both take responsibility.
How?

329
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,979
Set up an interview with Dunbar.
Day after tomorrow.

330
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,986
You and I need time
to do our homework.

331
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,215
Yes, sir.

332
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,430
When did this happen?

333
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,000
Meechum helped me fix it.

334
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,243
If they're not gonna let me run,
I have to work out some way.

335
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,780
You carried it
all the way up here?

336
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,907
For privacy. I had help.

337
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,016
Meechum.

338
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,118
That's right.

339
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:08,690
Well, he's a jack of all trades.
Handyman. Furniture mover.

340
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,193
Human shield.

341
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,527
How bad is it?

342
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,267
Bad.

343
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,712
They have evidence of Doug being
where he shouldn't have been.

344
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,175
What are you gonna do?

345
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,985
Tell the truth.

346
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,459
You're not actually gonna...

347
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,892
Selectively.

348
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,488
Don't worry.
It's a stumble, not a fall.

349
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,630
You aren't like this
when it's just a stumble.

350
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,333
Like how?

351
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,835
You're scared.
I can tell.

352
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,975
500 meters at 1:39. That was my best.
Shoot for that.

353
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,361
How have you been?

354
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,531
Okay. The meds are helping.

355
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,801
That's good to hear.

356
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,942
Let's have a seat.

357
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,208
Those people at the end
of the street... It's intense.

358
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,481
They're there 2417.
Twice as many on the weekends.

359
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,646
We're so used to it by now.

360
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,494
Can Hake off my shoes?

361
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,591
I thought I should dress up,
but I am not good with heels.

362
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,760
Yes, of course.

363
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,164
My mom said they
went with the dress.

364
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,007
Much better.

365
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:46,407
Look, Megan, I know the last six
months have been difficult.

366
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:47,951
But I need your help.

367
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,284
We just don't have the support that
we expected in the leadership.

368
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,846
Yeah, I figured this wasn't
just about checking up on me.

369
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,790
You changed your mind before,
and I understand why.

370
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:01,628
But now it seems as though
things are more stable with you.

371
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,795
Are you willing?

372
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,666
It's hard to say no
when I'm in your house.

373
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,341
Well, you hear
those people out there.

374
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,879
They're loud, but I think
we need to be louder.

375
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:21,611
And it can't be my voice, because
I'm the baby-killer, the cheater.

376
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,020
It needs to be your voice.
A clear voice.

377
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:27,886
I'm already testifying
at the court martial.

378
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:32,357
But that's closed to the media.
It's not enough.

379
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,625
There are so many people
this has happened to.

380
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,894
Why does it have to be me?

381
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,794
Because you're
the one who called.

382
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,406
Are you gonna try to put it out
before McGinnis gets sentenced?

383
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,841
Seth? You have a minute?

384
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,846
Matt, I have to call you back.

385
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,915
Close the door.

386
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,087
When the Vice President brought you
on board, I advised against it.

387
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,529
But I can't deny
you've done a good job.

388
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,533
I appreciate you saying that.

389
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,432
I'm very protective
of the Vice President.

390
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,595
I find it hard to share
that duty with anyone else,

391
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:18,197
which leaves me open to error.
It's one of my faults.

392
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,402
As I told the Vice President,

393
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,944
I understand that trust is
something that I need to earn.

394
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,172
And given how I got the job...

395
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,771
If the Vice President trusts
you, then I trust you.

396
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,275
We're a team now.

397
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,877
And the truth is,
I can't do this alone.

398
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,446
Anything and everything
you ask of me.

399
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,792
It might have nothing
to do with the media.

400
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,121
Press Secretary
is just a title.

401
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,260
Good.

402
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:45,963
We have two tasks.

403
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,071
First, find me Remy Danton,
but be discreet.

404
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,197
I'll track him down.

405
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,366
Second, I need you to go through
the Vice President's travel logs.

406
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,069
Everything in the past 10 years.
What are we looking for?

407
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:57,410
Anything that could hurl us. I'll
work forward. You work backward.

408
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,939
I'm on it.
And Doug? Thanks.

409
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:51,600
Nancy, I need you
to order me a new phone.

410
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,835
You said, "Odds and ends.
The home stretch..."

411
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,303
I was presented with this
information just hours ago.

412
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,737
We're talking
about impeachable offenses...

413
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,705
Not at all, sir...
Your chief of staff was...

414
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,799
I had a gut feeling
that the casino was involved.

415
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,345
I sent Doug down there
to get to the bottom of it.

416
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,176
You should've taken this to the
DOJ the first inkling you...

417
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,738
That's exactly
what I didn't want.

418
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,714
To create some ruckus
if nothing was going on?

419
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:43,844
You can't go on conducting your
own investigations, Frank.

420
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,856
Fact-finding, due diligence,
whatever you want to call it.

421
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,358
If any laws were being broken,
I wanted to know.

422
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,416
That's what you
want to tell Dunbar?

423
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,860
That I didn't want to disclose
our diplomatic protocols.

424
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,864
That I was concerned
about the midterms.

425
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,366
And that I wanted to protect the
President of the United States.

426
00:25:57,423 --> 00:26:00,700
Now, maybe what I did was wrong,
but I didn't do anything illegal.

427
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,897
You certain of that?

428
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,905
I've discussed this at length
with my lawyers.

429
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,704
Dunbar does not strike me as the sort
of person who will put on the brakes,

430
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,870
even if we admit all of this.

431
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,438
In fact, it might encourage
her to dig deeper.

432
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:14,940
You're right.

433
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,620
Which is why I want to hand
over all of my travel logs.

434
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,950
And I think you should, too.

435
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,454
Volunteer them? Yeah. As a
gesture of cooperation.

436
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,222
Haven't we made
enough gestures?

437
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:27,628
That'll take the wind
outta her sails.

438
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,132
No. I don't want her

439
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,295
poring over even' one of
my comings and goings.

440
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,068
He's worried about his marriage
counseling, <i>as</i> he should be.

441
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,441
If you're worried about your marriage
counseling, you shouldn't be.

442
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,410
Imagine the fallout if the
public were to find out that...

443
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,211
A needle in a haystack, and not a
needle that Dunbar is looking for.

444
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,615
She's interviewed half of Congress.
That woman's after blood.

445
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:49,708
But not for gossip.

446
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,413
And even if
she does raise an eyebrow,

447
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:54,321
you were visiting a sick
friend, weren't you?

448
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:55,585
Yeah, ostensibly.

449
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,254
Well, she couldn't possibly
find any fault with that.

450
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,996
I'd like Galich in here.

451
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,161
I'll let you two talk privately.
When are you seeing Dunbar?

452
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,329
Tomorrow,
so you have some time.

453
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,771
I'll speak to Bill
and get back to you.

454
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,605
He'll advise you against it,
which is his job.

455
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,670
But I would just encourage you to
think politics and not legalese.

456
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,009
Thank you, sir.

457
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,824
Congresswoman?
Why should I vote for you?

458
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,860
It's okay, Mark. Goodnight.

459
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,302
You look tired.

460
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:43,271
Long day on
the campaign trail?

461
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,500
What are you doing here?

462
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,936
You never told me
about Havemeyer's daughter.

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,004
Everyone knows that.
The whole world knows.

464
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:54,812
But not that you visited her.
That you leaked it.

465
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,786
You came all the way to
California to ask me about that?

466
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,881
I came to California
to find out about that.

467
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,220
I offered to buy Havemeyer's
house, but he told me for nothing.

468
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,891
You were right. It has been
a long day on the trail.

469
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,167
It's still a close race.

470
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,001
But not if the voters know
how you became whip.

471
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,501
Are you honestly
threatening me?

472
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,746
Set up a meeting with Frank.

473
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,680
I don't care
what you talk about,

474
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,686
long <i>as</i> you're alone and the
meeting is on the books.

475
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,914
Then you're gonna sit down
with Dunbar.

476
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,518
I've already
clone my interview.

477
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,354
Tell her Frank grilled
you on your testimony.

478
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,651
Perjure myself?

479
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,852
Save your seat.

480
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,159
You know what? Tell everyone.

481
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,927
Think how that'd play out.

482
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,728
I don't care.

483
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,695
You'd really toss yourself
off a cliff for Frank?

484
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,706
I have zero allegiance
to Frank Underwood.

485
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,366
I won't be manipulated by him.

486
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,570
And I sure as fuck
won't be manipulated by you.

487
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,838
I'm not bluffing.

488
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,044
Then I was right.
About what?

489
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,208
How little I meant.

490
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,381
That has nothing
to do with this.

491
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,788
It has everything
to do with this.

492
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,093
I should feel disgusted,
but I don't.

493
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,031
Just supremely disappointed.

494
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:34,083
We got the call 10 minutes ago.
Direct from the White House counsel.

495
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,415
The President's
turning over everything?

496
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,647
From the day he took office.

497
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,415
And we're sure this includes
the visits to his friend?

498
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,959
It has to.
It was full security detail.

499
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:47,554
Phenomenal. We have
something we can work with.

500
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,620
Now, as for my logs...

501
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:49,755
They're clean.

502
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,123
You'd bet your life on that?

503
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,257
I would.

504
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,496
Me, too, sir.

505
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,070
We've been through 'em twice,
backward and forward.

506
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,162
My statement?

507
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,332
In your inbox.

508
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:01,510
I looked it over.
Seth did a nice job.

509
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,142
We need to go wide with this the
moment the interview's over,

510
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,448
so that we beat
Dunbar to the punch

511
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,989
in case she decides
to release something.

512
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,250
I'll be at my computer,
ready to press "Send"

513
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,587
the moment I hear from Doug.

514
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,457
Have either of you slept? We're awake.
Fully operational.

515
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,428
You take a shower
and put on a fresh suit.

516
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,759
Yes, sir.
I'll see you over there.

517
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,103
You have at least three hours.

518
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,534
Take a nap.
You can use my office.

519
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,873
 General McGinnis was in
the courtroom when you testified.

520
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,377
Yes.

521
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:40,041
Had you seen him in person?
I mean, since he assaulted you?

522
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,173
No.

523
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,311
So what was that like?

524
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,046
Not fun.

525
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,354
Not fun how?

526
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,985
It was hard. Really hard.

527
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:57,158
Look, Megan, I agreed to change the
focus of my piece to focus on you,

528
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,998
and I know this
has gotta be hard.

529
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,129
I need you
to help me out a little bit.

530
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:05,641
I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.
I'm nervous.

531
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,235
You seemed fine when you called
into Mrs. Underwood's interview.

532
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,473
She <i>was</i> there
with me on the phone.

533
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:16,417
Your nerves. I know that's been
an issue since the assault.

534
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,545
The defense brought up
what they called

535
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,180
emotional and
mental instability.

536
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,522
That's what always happens.

537
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,153
The person who was attacked
gets attacked allover again.

538
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,822
How did that make you feel?

539
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,523
It made me angry.

540
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:33,263
The lawyer kept coming after me about
my panic attacks, my antidepressants.

541
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,368
But I just kept staring at McGinnis.
I wanted him to see I could take it.

542
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,242
That I was strong. I wanted
to make him look away first.

543
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,779
And did he?

544
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,347
Yes.

545
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,076
When I said he did more
than violate my body.

546
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:54,221
He betrayed his country.
He robbed it of a good Marine.

547
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,690
Let's talk
about the sexual assault bill

548
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,725
that's in front
of Congress right now.

549
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,023
You know, it's taken
some significant opposition,

550
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,622
most notably from another
veteran, Jacqueline Sharp.

551
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,301
If you ask me, she's
betraying our country, too.

552
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,306
Ms. Dunbar.

553
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,807
Mr. Vice President.

554
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,900
Thank you for giving us
a few extra days.

555
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,809
I have no
problem being patient,

556
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,882
as long as it leads to
forthright answers.

557
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,110
Well, I won't make you wait
a moment longer.

558
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:27,485
Shall we?

559
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,561
You found it. Have a seat.
We're just finishing up here.

560
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,429
What do you think, Mr. Tusk? Keep
growing it or have it shaved?

561
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:37,626
I guess I'll keep growing it.

562
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,969
No problem. Let me just
clean up the back here.

563
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,732
 No, Mack, if you'd
give me a couple of minutes.

564
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,902
Appreciate it.

565
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,675
I had this place built down
here about 10 years ago.

566
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,849
I got tired of driving all the
way across town every two weeks.

567
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,350
Now it's just an elevator ride.
Convenient.

568
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,082
You know what
isn't convenient?

569
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,989
Cramming eight attorneys
into my office.

570
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:07,962
It was not designed for the entire
partnership of my law firm.

571
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,090
They're worried about Lanagin.

572
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,463
He's a little shaky,
but he'll hold up.

573
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,360
Underwood?

574
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:14,629
Birch delivered.

575
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,441
And did Dunbar
bring up Stamper?

576
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,200
The sessions are closed-door,
but I can't imagine she didn't.

577
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,847
And what about poor Havemeyer?

578
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,314
Was he any help to us
on Jackie Sharp?

579
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:37,617
I do not take your hesitation
as a promising sign.

580
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:40,720
I never like
disappointing you.

581
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,526
He had nothing?

582
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,361
No.

583
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,868
Now, do you think that's
because there's nothing there,

584
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,494
or because he's
protecting her?

585
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,166
There's nothing there. I can
go to another congressman...

586
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:55,507
No, no, no. It has to be
somebody high-profile,

587
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,138
someone in the leadership
who will make waves.

588
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,409
Let me get back to Birch.

589
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,744
Too obvious.

590
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,853
Now that he's shown
no sympathy for Frank.

591
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:08,016
This can't look orchestrated.
Multiple fronts, Remy.

592
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,856
Has to be Jackie Sharp. Mack?

593
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,022
Let's finish up here.
I gotta get back to work.

594
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,531
You got it, boss. You need
to get back to work, too.

595
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:23,933
And what we discussed.
Make it happen.

596
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,103
You denied being a back channel.
I did not deny.

597
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,940
I chose not to confirm
because it was classified.

598
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,378
But your office
has consistently denied...

599
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,781
I instructed Doug to do so, along
with my communications department.

600
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,112
When a back channel becomes
public, it defeats its purpose.

601
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,279
An orchestrated deception...

602
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,754
If we had refused to comment,

603
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,381
it would have suggested
that it was true,

604
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,051
which would have
endangered the process.

605
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,116
I really had no choice.

606
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,230
Mr. Feng is currently in Dubai.
I know.

607
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:51,392
He's fleeing corruption charges. Not
the first time he's been accused.

608
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,958
And your question?

609
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,561
I know he laundered the money,
Mr. Vice President.

610
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,268
It's just a matter of time before I
have the proof to substantiate that.

611
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,868
So my question, which I am asking
again, is whether you knew.

612
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,780
And I will repeat my answer.
I did not.

613
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:11,081
I did sense that something was awry,
and Doug was aware of my concerns.

614
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,213
And I took it upon myself
to find out.

615
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,621
The Vice President
didn't know.

616
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,784
You had no knowledge
he was going to the casino?

617
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,224
None. But that doesn't mean

618
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,264
I don't take full responsibility
for my staff's behavior.

619
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,588
The buck stops with me.

620
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,395
And what did you find?

621
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,264
Nothing. No illegal activity.

622
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,800
I don't have the same
resources that you do.

623
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:34,576
If you suspected, why didn't you go
immediately to the NIGC, the BIA,

624
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,941
the Department...
You have to understand.

625
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,010
We're facing very
difficult midterms.

626
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,242
I didn't want to bring attention
to a series of allegations

627
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,114
that may have
no basis infect.

628
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:46,246
That may have been misguided logic,
but that's how I chose to act.

629
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,518
The mistake is
mine and mine alone.

630
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,615
Not Doug's. And certainly
not the President's.

631
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,491
It shouldn't
surprise you if I say

632
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,929
it feels like lam not
getting the full picture.

633
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,332
Which is why I'm prepared to give
you the full picture. Oliver?

634
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,461
The White House
believes in transparency.

635
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,439
All of the Vice President's
personal travel logs.

636
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,875
And the last 10 years
since I became whip.

637
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,773
 As well as the President's
since inauguration.

638
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,875
 There should be no doubt
as to whom we met with and when.

639
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,787
I am skeptical
about what this contains.

640
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,346
Which is what we anticipated

641
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:24,825
and why Oliver will walk you through
anything you might need to know.

642
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:25,987
It's all there.

643
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,826
But if you have
any questions or requests,

644
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:29,729
we'll be happy to facilitate.

645
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,663
I mean,
at first I was really nervous.

646
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,032
But then as soon as I
started getting into it,

647
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,737
started speaking from my heart,
all these things poured out.

648
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,238
Everything I wanted to say.
That I've been wanting to say.

649
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,573
Seth told me
that Matt was very impressed.

650
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,853
I want to do more.
More interviews?

651
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:55,187
Articles. TV. Whatever it takes.
I want to help.

652
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,320
That's great, Megan.

653
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,055
Thank you for
making me do this.

654
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,261
It was a big step for me.

655
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,068
You have a plane to catch.

656
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,234
I can stay longer,
if you need me to do another.

657
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,041
Why don't you
head back to Chicago,

658
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,604
and as soon as we put a plan
together, we can give you a buzz.

659
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,272
Can I get a glass of water?

660
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,784
Tap is fine, or you want bottled?
I can get it.

661
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,878
We've got Ms. Hennessey's
car ready, ma'am.

662
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:26,945
Edward?

663
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,559
Did she seem all right when you
picked her up from the airport?

664
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,597
How do you mean?
I don't know. Normal.

665
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,030
Yes. I'd say so.

666
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,069
She's very up and down.
Very skittish and manic.

667
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,265
I guess she did seem nervous.
We didn't talk much.

668
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,737
I'll get her.

669
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,476
I'll be outside.

670
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,576
Megan?

671
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,445
I've got it.

672
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,389
Really. I'm okay.

673
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,497
The car is ready
whenever you are.

674
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,601
Thank you for everything.

675
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,905
Have a safe flight.
I'll be in touch.

676
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,718
I just had a very productive
interview with Ms. Dunbar.

677
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,955
Send out the press release.

678
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,725
Thank you very much.

679
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:24,229

680
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,371
You okay, ma'am?

681
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,071
I'm fine. I just dropped...

682
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,375
Please, let me.

683
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,676
It's fine. I'm fine.

684
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,150
No, I've got it.
You're barefoot.

685
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,084
Edward, you don't have to.
Really.

686
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,086
Ah!
Oh, no. What happened?

687
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,179
Damn it.

688
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,589
Let me get some bandages.

689
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,022
You don't have to.

690
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,688
No, I want to. Stay here.

691
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:49,857
The coverage has been
mostly positive so far.

692
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,366
Dunbar's office?

693
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,767
Ali they've said is they look
forward to reviewing the logs.

694
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,929
Any heat on Doug?

695
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,095
Some.

696
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,368
I'm getting a lot of requests
for comments.

697
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,773
I acted on my own.

698
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,402
And I will fully cooperate
with the Justice Department.

699
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,844
We can put that out?

700
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,279
Sir?

701
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,214
It might generate
more interest.

702
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:10,753
On me.
Not the Vice President.

703
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,350
I can handle whatever comes my way.
Put it out.

704
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,025
I'll print you out the most
recent clips, too, sir.

705
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,226
Should I find a way
to tip off Dunbar?

706
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,429
Let nature take its course.

707
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,402
We got a hold of Remy.
He just got back to town.

708
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,564
Where is he?

709
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,232
I've arranged everything
with your detail.

710
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,042
You've done good work, Doug.

711
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,477
Thank you, sir.

712
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,434
There. That's much better.

713
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,843
Thanks, ma'am.

714
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,276
I'm gonna get going.

715
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,980
I'm sorry I'm a little drunk.

716
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,954
It's your house.
You can do whatever you want.

717
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,225
You should have
a glass of wine.

718
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,887
I appreciate that,
ma'am, but...

719
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,521
You're off your shift, right?

720
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,489
I am. That's true.

721
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,967
Then I won't take
no for an answer.

722
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:11,199
You shouldn't waste
any of your good stuff on me.

723
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,867
I don't really know
anything about wine.

724
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,345
Then how about bourbon? I bet
you like a little of that.

725
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,081
I definitely don't mind a
bourbon from time to time.

726
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,743
Then bourbon it is.

727
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:44,365
You're a tough man
to track down these days.

728
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,705
You got the watch.

729
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,040
"To improve is to change."

730
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,171
"To perfect is
to change often."

731
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,112
What son of change
are you looking for?

732
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,380
Whichever leaves me options.

733
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:59,047
Trouble at Glendon Hill?

734
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,590
Paid leave till
the investigation is over.

735
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,625
Well,
at least you're being paid.

736
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,752
First step in terminating
my partnership.

737
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,762
You know how things go.

738
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:12,426
No matter what happens, there's
a stain I can't wash out.

739
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,299
So you're looking
for career opportunities.

740
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,397
I'm not offering myself
to you wholesale.

741
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:21,603
I keep fighting you,
but I can fight you less.

742
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,474
And by "less" you mean...

743
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,913
Enough to hurt,
but not finish you.

744
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,110
And in return I have a
future beyond Glendon Hill,

745
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,584
whatever that might look like.

746
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,088
So you offer neutrality,
but you'll go with the victor.

747
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,421
I figure let the best man win.

748
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:39,462
And if you go down,
it won't be because of me.

749
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,791
That's worth something.

750
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,092
Where is this coming from?

751
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,067
Insurance. That's all.

752
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,104
Does it have anything
to do with Jackie?

753
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,678
That's over.

754
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,075
I know you've got
Birch in your pocket

755
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,780
Womack's not an option.
We're too close.

756
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,583
But Jacqueline...

757
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,923
This is about my future,
pure and simple.

758
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,254
She's not a part of it.

759
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,096
Keep the watch
as a token of good faith.

760
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:28,370
He might deny it,
but he's protecting her.

761
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,774
What he doesn't realize is

762
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:34,146
that I have even less regard
for Jackie than Raymond does.

763
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:37,048
Poor Remy.
The heart can choke the mind

764
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,815
when all its blood
ﬂows back unto itself.

765
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:35,433

766
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,604
He said,
"I don't like brunettes."

767
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,854
Looks like I
almost missed the party.

768
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,287
I'm off the clock, sir.

769
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,756
Relax.

770
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,389
Francis, I broke a glass, and Edward
cut his hand on a piece of it.

771
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,797
Jesus.

772
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:02,030
Oh, wow. I need to change that. Take
that off, and I'll get fresh...

773
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,078
I hope you don't mind, sir.
I was off-duty...

774
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,914
Is she...

775
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,951
Drunk? A little.

776
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:21,483
How many of these have you had?
A few.

777
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:25,252
More than a few.

778
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,924
May I?

779
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,090
Please.

780
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,143
Let me see.

781
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,141
It's not too bad.

782
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,245
There's a lot of blood.

783
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,650
Looks worse than it is.

784
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,012
Ow...

785
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,753
Is it painful?

786
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,121
The bourbon helps.

787
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,183

788
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,152
Ah.

789
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,159
Now you let me
know if this hurts.

790
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:09,699
Not one bit, sir.

791
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,575

792
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,887

793
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,526
How's your head?

794
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:55,934
Fine. Took a couple of aspirin
before I went to sleep.

795
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,267
You?

796
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,801
I slept like a baby.

797
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:04,972
Good. You needed that.

798
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,052
What is it?

799
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,153
Something weird.

800
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,392
This one address
keeps popping up.

801
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,399
Underwood?
The President.

802
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:42,248
Morning, Meechum.

803
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,681
Morning, Mr. Vice President.

804
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:46,819
It's a beautiful day.
