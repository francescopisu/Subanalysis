1
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:52,140
We could jump
in the car if...

2
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,616
We'll wait.

3
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,785
Did you get the Congressman
anything for his birthday?

4
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,050
No.

5
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,456
I got him cuff links.
Silver with his...

6
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,224
We don't talk about birthdays.
We don't do gifts.

7
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,195
Why not?

8
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,563
You should return
the cuff links.

9
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,465
Doug?

10
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,129
I tried calling you.

11
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,570
I left my phone in the...

12
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,140
We need to talk.

13
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,067
What's going on?

14
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,238
Christina.
I just spoke to her.

15
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,973
Did Zoe?
Yeah.

16
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,345
And that's not all.

17
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,316
They tracked down
Rachel, too.

18
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,047
Francis?

19
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,185
Tell me about Rachel.

20
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,245
Where is she?

21
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,585
I have her
under control.

22
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,715
That's not what I asked.

23
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,089
I drove her home. We don't
have to worry about her.

24
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,687
You said the same
about Ms. Skorsky.

25
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,326
Anyone else involved?

26
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,733
Just Janine and Zoe.

27
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,929
They asked about
Russo's arrest,

28
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,869
and they know
he went to see Kapeniak.

29
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,601
I assume that's as far
as they've gotten.

30
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,766
Assume nothing.

31
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,271
I'll alert Barney Hull.

32
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,239
What do you want me
to do about Zoe?

33
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,109
I'll handle Zoe.

34
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,773
Get to work.
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,724
I emptied it.

36
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,232
You're another year older
on Tuesday.

37
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,360
And we can't have
a Vice President who smokes.

38
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,564


39
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,113
Can you finish?
What?

40
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,479
I'm good.

41
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,482
What's wrong?

42
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,385
Nothing. I just
said finish.

43
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,449
I don't want to just...
If you're not...

44
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,789
Okay, fine.
Whatever.

45
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,089
Zoe, did I do something
that made you...

46
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,226
No.

47
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,502
Zoe, you can't say something
like, "Just finish,"

48
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,266
and then shut down.

49
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,242
This is safe, Zoe.
I'm not him.

50
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,786
Good morning, Jackie.

51
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,786
Good morning.

52
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,792
Richard Russell?

53
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,666
Civil Rights Act, 1963.

54
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,636
Not everyone can be on
the right side of history.

55
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,196
Not even Lyndon
for a time.

56
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,368
But he would've never become
Majority Leader without him.

57
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,376
Well, there's no
Johnson Senate Building.

58
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,710
No. He had to settle
for a presidential library.

59
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,442
It's been sometime
since you and I

60
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,678
have had a chance
to catch up.

61
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,549
You've been an outstanding
deputy, Jackie.

62
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,316
Far more effective than your
more seasoned colleagues.

63
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,825
You're a coalition builder.
Fighter when you have to be.

64
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,987
Tell me, where do you
see yourself headed?

65
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,732
I'd like to aim for
the Chair of Armed Services

66
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,960
or Homeland Security.

67
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,331
Have you ever considered
sewing in the Leadership?

68
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,735
I figure that might be possible
eight, ten years from now.

69
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:08,240
What if I suggested that you could
serve in Leadership this term?

70
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,542
To replace me as Whip.

71
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,079
You're being tapped for VP?

72
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,586
Let's assume that's true.

73
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,316
That makes sense,
but me as Whip?

74
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,653
Yes.

75
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,886
A third term Congresswoman?

76
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,518
A universally
admired incumbent

77
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,530
who also happens
to be a war veteran.

78
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,060
Webb is next in line
or Buchwalter.

79
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,324
Mmm-hmm.

80
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,436
So just consider that
for a moment.

81
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,068
They'll draw votes
from one another.

82
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,405
I'm not saying you wouldn't
have to fight for it,

83
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,541
but I'd be willing to give you
the ammunition.

84
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,444
Come over here.

85
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,879


86
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,249
What is this?

87
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,925
My files on Webb
and Buchwalter.

88
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,399
Why don't you take a look?
We'll speak in a few days.

89
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,899
And there's one on you.

90
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,236
You might want to begin
by reading that one first

91
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,233


92
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,428


93
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,927
What'd Janine say?

94
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,090
Strip club's
not open yet.

95
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,724
You'll look
into Kapeniak?

96
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,268
If he's on the grid,
I'll find him.

97
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,102
Drop me at
Metro Center.

98
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,004
Not the office?

99
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:44,302
I'm going to
talk to Rachel.

100
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:47,969
She'll deny everything
like she did last night.

101
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,413
She can't deny getting into
Stamper's car. You saw her.

102
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,014
Maybe you send a version
of the story about her dad.

103
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,418
No one would print it.

104
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,320
Rachel doesn't
know that.

105
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,187
She said,
"Go to town, bitch!"

106
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,160
It won't work. I have
to get in her face.

107
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,930
Congratulations.

108
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,161
We're thrilled for you.
Thank you.

109
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,501
I wanted to fill in
Bob and Terry personally.

110
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,802
Let's get to it.

111
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,138
I have to leave
for Pittsburgh in what?

112
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,200
Twenty minutes.

113
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,973
Home stretch with Jim,
whistle-stop tour.

114
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,207
Looking good
out there.

115
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,180
Very good. But we don't
want to take any chances.

116
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,944
Now, your replacement
as Whip, Frank.

117
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,713
Bob has already
shared some thoughts.

118
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,786
I like Howard Webb.

119
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,220
Webb is a solid choice.

120
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,517
Have you thought
about Wes Buchwalter?

121
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,182
Buchwalter's a hothead.

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,157
Could you live
with Webb, Frank?

123
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,958
Webb is a good tactician,
but he lacks follow-through.

124
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,363
The problem with Buchwalter
is he's too abrasive.

125
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,865
No charm.
Lots of enemies.

126
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,162

ls there a third option?

127
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,395
They're the two most senior members
in the caucus. It's their turn.

128
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,530
Mr. President, what if
we let the caucus pick?

129
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,365
Let it be a wide open race?
Both men are qualified.

130
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,068
The Leadership
should be united in this.

131
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,975
We don't want to be backing
different candidates, Frank.

132
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,174
So we stay out of it, and
neither of us backs anyone.

133
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,910
I like it. The caucus
will respect someone

134
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,313
who did it
the old-fashioned way.

135
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,085
 Gentlemen,
it's your call to make.

136
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,348
Figure it out
amongst yourselves

137
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,515
and let me know
what you decide.

138
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,558
Thank you,
Mr. President.

139
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,822
Put me through
to Secretary Lewis.

140
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,561
Frank, I don't want to go
to battle with you on this.

141
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,688
We've been
down that road.

142
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,856
I couldn't
agree more.

143
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,196
An open race
makes me nervous.

144
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,931
Well, look, it was
just a suggestion.

145
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,198
I'll put some thought
into it.

146
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,934
Thank you.

147
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,935
You know,
let me go work on him.

148
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,876
Good luck.

149
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,553
What are you
doing here?

150
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,925
Ask me what
I want to order.

151
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,761
Have you decided, sir?

152
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:53,963
I need you to quit your job.

153
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,131
Tell Leon
it's your last day.

154
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,367
Why?

155
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,807
Act normal.

156
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,570
Would you want
a side with that?

157
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,637
They found you once.

158
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,580
We can't take the chance
they'll find you again.

159
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,982
What am I supposed to...

160
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,451
Do as I say.

161
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,283
Go home and
pack your things.

162
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,617
I'll come by
around 10:00.

163
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,420
But I don't get a say in...
Stop it!

164
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,599
One suitcase. That's it.

165
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,166
Can you at least tell me...

166
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,668
I'll take the shepherd's pie

167
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,999
with a side
of Brussels sprouts.

168
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,095
To go.

169
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,142
We don't want a trial, her
lawyers don't want a trial,

170
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,271
but Ms. Cole
won't listen to reason.

171
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,781
That said, if you give me
a little more time...

172
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,908
If she wants to go to court,
then let's give her that.

173
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,577
Just because
she's being unreasonable now,

174
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,416
doesn't mean she...
I'm done!

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,819
That's a kneejerk reaction.

176
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,447
I've never known
you to be a person

177
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,992
who was irrational
or impatient.

178
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,526
Let me check back with her
lawyers, and maybe we can...

179
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,357
What is the soonest
we can set a trial date?

180
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,590
Claire...
Give me a time frame.

181
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,826
Six months,
at the earliest.

182
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,029
Inform her people.
Then no more communication.

183
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,532
As your counsel,
it is my duty

184
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,838
to strongly advise you
against this.

185
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,607
I understand,
and I thank you, Oliver.

186
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,776
Thank you.

187
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,809
So?

188
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,288
They wouldn't give me
individual contact info,

189
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,189
but here's every doctor
who served in East Africa

190
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,454
during the last
three years.

191
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,722
And what about
the HMO?

192
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,798
You need a consent form.
It's in the packet.

193
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,568
Can I help you?

194
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,341
Yeah. I'm looking
for Rachel Posner.

195
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,973
She's not here.

196
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,073
Is she coming
in later?

197
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,173
Why?

198
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,752
I know her.

199
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,844
Well, your friend
really screwed me over.

200
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,049
What happened?

201
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,990
She took off,
middle of her shift.

202
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,586
I had to put my hostess
on waitstaff duty.

203
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,598
Look, I'm concerned.
Rachel's in real trouble.

204
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,759
I don't care what her
personal issues are.

205
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,857
I just need to know
where she lives.

206
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,096
I thought
you knew her.

207
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,433
I do. It's just
been a while.

208
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,401
And she sent me
a text message

209
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,668
saying she wants
to hurt herself,

210
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,211
and now, she won't
answer her phone.

211
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,239
She has a history
of mental illness.

212
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,383
You got to help me out.

213
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,282
Look, I can't.

214
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,119
Her W-2,
the address was a PO Box.

215
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,697
I'll take whatever
I can get.

216
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,123
Let me see what I got in the office.
Thank you.

217
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,295
If you find her, you tell
her not to come back.

218
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,431
I don't need some nutcase
creating chaos in here.

219
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,206
Nancy?
Yes, sir!

220
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,543
Is Doug back yet?
In his office.

221
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,138
And, sir,

222
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,649
birthday cards have started
to arrive, a few presents.

223
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,980
Thank you notes.
Inventory the presents.

224
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,747
Anything valuable...
Goes in the conference room.

225
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,447
Anything cheap...
Goes to the interns.

226
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,887
You know what to do
with the cards.

227
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,323
Yes, sir.

228
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,457
I'm picking
her up tonight.

229
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,467
I've got everything
set up for her in Joppa.

230
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,162
Where is that?
Maryland.

231
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,933
About 30 minutes
north of Baltimore.

232
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,235
That's close
to home.

233
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,176
We want her to disappear,
but not on us.

234
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,472
Fine. Do you
have the burner?

235
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,841
Yeah.

236
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,147
Happy birthday.

237
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,284
It's pre-paid. All you need
to do is turn it on and dial.

238
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,693
We still have
the phone history.

239
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,026
All the more reason
to be safe going forward.

240
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,134
Where are we with Christina?
I'm on it.

241
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,796
Linda's office. I called
her this morning.

242
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,804
Are you Gillian Cole?

243
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,867
Yeah. Have we met?

244
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,204
No, we haven't met.
You know my husband.

245
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,807
Your husband?
David Applebaum.

246
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,045
So it's true.

247
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,486
It was a mistake...

248
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,358
You want to see our kids?
I can show you pictures.

249
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,792
Mrs. Applebaum... Who the
fuck do you think you are?

250
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:12,886
Look, I'm sorry.

251
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,987
You're sorry? I don't
think you're sorry.

252
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,362
And don't think
for a second

253
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,197
you're going to use that
baby to get money out of us.

254
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,861
He doesn't even know
I'm pregnant.

255
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,563
But you knew
he was married.

256
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,164
How could you?
Did he talk about us?

257
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,834
No...
Lying bitch.

258
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,075
Am I embarrassing you?

259
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:32,013
Did you think about how you
would humiliate me and my kids?

260
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,680
Use a condom the next time
you fuck somebody's husband.

261
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,943
 <i>It's been less
than 24 hours.</i>

262
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,880
<i>She quits her job
in the middle of a shift?</i>

263
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,010
 <i>She's</i> scared.
I'd take off too.

264
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,249
 <i>It's Underwood. He's
moving faster than we are.</i>

265
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:15,359
 <i>What about the stripper?
</i><i>Refuses to talk.</i>

266
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,450
<i> Kapeniak?</i>

267
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,393
 <i>No current address,
no siblings. Parents are dead.</i>

268
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,125
 <i>Rachel's
the last loose end.</i>

269
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,133
<i>She must know something
else, bigger than the DUI.</i>

270
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,725
Any idea
where she <i>went?</i>

271
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,795
I got a PO Box in Dupont,

272
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,271
but none of the clerks
have seen her.

273
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,102
I could go
stake it out, but...

274
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,642
Have you talked
to your guy yet?

275
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,211
In the next
clay or two.

276
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,804
He's bringing me the police
report on Russo's suicide.

277
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,280
I'll press him
for more.

278
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,941
What's your
next move?

279
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,313
I'm trying to figure out
how to respond to this.

280
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,783
I got it a couple hours ago.

281
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,454
I think he's setting her up.

282
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,755
I know how
to handle him.

283
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,288
The less he knows the better.

284
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,489
We might
learn something.

285
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,621
Not with him
calling the shots.

286
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,824
I'm choosing
the place.

287
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:56,992
As if that makes
a difference.

288
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,002
I'm not going to fuck him.
Just talk to him.

289
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,441
I'm going to go
to the bathroom.

290
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,774
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
It's okay.

291
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,315
No, it's not.

292
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,175
I just don't want
you to be careless.

293
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,945
I won't be.

294
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,281
You want no life?

295
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:22,317
You want more work than
three people can handle?

296
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,359
You want a decent chance

297
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,521
that you could be fired
within the first month?

298
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,532
If that tempts you,
we can keep talking.

299
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,033
None of that
intimidates me.

300
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,602
I've been running
a Congressional district

301
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,639
for the past nine weeks
with zero assistance.

302
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,266
Nobody elected me.
Nobody taught me.

303
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,277
I've done it because
somebody had to.

304
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,372
What happened was tragic, but
you won't get sympathy from me.

305
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,040
I don't have time for it.

306
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,948
I wouldn't be sitting here if
I wanted a shoulder to cry on.

307
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,444

308
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,821
Rachel?

309
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,127

310
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:02,989

311
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,006
 Leave.

312
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,512
I said leave.

313
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,349
Are you packed?

314
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,089
I'm not going anywhere.

315
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,723
So you didn't
quit today.

316
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,357
I did, but I
changed my mind.

317
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,761
This isn't your
decision to make.

318
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,205
I'm keeping my job, and I'm
keeping this apartment.

319
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,607
 No, you're not.

320
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,178
You promised you'd make
this all go away.

321
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,736
 And you starting over
is the first step in that.

322
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,544
No, I already started over. I
don't want to start over again.

323
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,051
I wish you didn't have to.

324
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,010
Get out.

325
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,883
Get out!

326
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,688
Lower your voice.

327
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,255
I'll fucking kill you.

328
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:08,627
Go ahead.

329
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:11,724

330
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,577
I am the only one who can protect you.
Don't you see that?

331
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,211
You have no idea
how much danger you're in.

332
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,240

333
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,894
<i>Hey.</i>

334
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,262
Start packing.

335
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,905
You know,
I ask every year...

336
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,642
Nothing, as usual.

337
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,912
I thought
we could have dinner.

338
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,251
Only if it's someplace where
nobody will recognize us.

339
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,324
I don't want anyone walking up...
I mean at home.

340
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,188
I'll cook something.

341
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,618
No cake.
No cake.

342
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,029
No gifts.
No gifts.

343
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,258
I could do that.

344
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,766
How's the lawsuit coming?

345
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,199
We'll be fine.

346
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,863
We'd like to increase
the size of your detail

347
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,270
to full Head-of-State status
starting tomorrow.

348
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,673
Well, that won't
be happening.

349
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,142
It's good to
get a head start,

350
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,303
so that by the time
the announcement...

351
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,211
These are my last few days before
I never have privacy again.

352
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,840
I intend to savor these
moments for as long as I can.

353
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,316
But sir, in terms of safety,
I think...

354
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,183
Until I am confirmed
as the Vice President,

355
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,552
security is at my discretion,
is that correct?

356
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,488
Technically, yes...
Then that's settled.

357
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,688
All right, we'll wait
until the announcement.

358
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,388
Now, assuming
the confirmation goes through,

359
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,964
we'll need to work out
the logistics

360
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,227
of moving you into
the Naval Observatory.

361
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,630
That won't be
happening either.

362
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,228
The Congressman will be
remaining in his townhouse.

363
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,567
But it doesn't have the necessary
security infrastructure.

364
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,009
Then you'll need
to build it.

365
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,481
We're talking blast-proofing,
hard-wired communications networks,

366
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,812
24 hour office space
for the...

367
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,546
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

368
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,519
I'll contact you directly about
setting a plan in motion.

369
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,859
Oh, and one last thing
before you go.

370
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,923
I'd like to have Edward
Meechum serve on my detail.

371
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,729
He's Capitol Police.
For now.

372
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,531
You're about to appoint
him to the Secret Service.

373
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,868
That would require an
accelerated training program.

374
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,771
Sir, we have plenty
of qualified agents,

375
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,433
men and women with
years of experience.

376
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,067
And I look forward
to working with all of them

377
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,873
<i>as</i> long as Edward Meechum
is on the detail.

378
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,108
Thank you very much
for your time.

379
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,842
Thank you, sir.

380
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,566
Nancy, have Meechum
bring the car around.

381
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,576
You know, last time
was the last time.

382
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,808
I know, but this
is important.

383
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:15,078
You keep selling me that swampland.
I'm done buying.

384
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,246
No more.

385
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,653
The cover-up, you said it
went as high as Barney Hull.

386
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:20,780
That's not
what I said.

387
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,824
When you gave me
Rachel Posner's...

388
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:24,155
What I said is that
arrests don't disappear

389
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,786
without a big-ass wand.

390
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,125
That ain't
the same as proof.

391
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,062
We think Congressional
Leadership took part.

392
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,998
I don't care. Yes, you do.
I know you do.

393
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,433
No, I really don't.

394
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,799
When you helped me
expose the drug...

395
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,271
They were dirty street cops stuffing
a few grams in their pockets.

396
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,808
This is different.
Powerful fucking people.

397
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,935
Dirty cops are dirty cops.
You want to protect them?

398
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,943
I have a pension and a family.
I understand, but...

399
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,107
Don't contact me again.

400
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,264

401
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,834
Where <i>is</i> your cell?

402
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,893
Here. It's not recording.

403
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,573
I need to ask you to delete
all of our phone history.

404
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,641
Why would I do that?

405
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,575
I'm trying to protect
both you and I.

406
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,543
I'm not facing prison.

407
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,078
You didn't cover up
the arrest?

408
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,552
Was it because you wanted
him to be Governor?

409
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:00,249
No. He was in trouble,
so I helped.

410
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:03,088
And later he expressed a desire
to run, and I offered guidance.

411
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,692
To an alcoholic?

412
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,094
To a sober,
recovering alcoholic.

413
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,689
Did you want him
to self-sabotage?

414
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,325
Absolutely not.

415
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,836
It got Matthews
in the race.

416
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,772
I like to back people
who want to succeed.

417
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,603
Take yourself
as an example.

418
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,404
You just took advantage
of the situation.

419
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:24,037
Matthews took advantage.
I didn't seek the nomination.

420
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,284
Russo was in the passenger
seat when he died.

421
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,684
That's not
entirely accurate.

422
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,248
I saw the police report.

423
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,122
And I spoke to
the Commissioner directly,

424
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,426
because I cared about Peter, and
I wanted to know the full story.

425
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,898
He wasn't in
the passenger seat?

426
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,535
The passenger door was open,
and he was halfway out.

427
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,268
They think that...

428
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,301
He might have had
second thoughts.

429
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:59,239
If I speak to Barney Hull,
he'll confirm that?

430
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:02,085
What are you
suggesting, Zoe?

431
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,484
Maybe there
was foul play.

432
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,781
If there was a hint
of foul play,

433
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,652
don't you think the police
would have investigated?

434
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,622
The same police
that buried his DUI?

435
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:10,921
And you think
I was involved.

436
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,821
There's a connection
between you.

437
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,626
Listen,
you sound ludicrous.

438
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:17,223
I'm just asking questions.

439
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,496
No, you're connecting dots
that don't exist.

440
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,661
You want me to
just walk away?

441
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,670
Act as if I don't
know anything?

442
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,798
Yes, I got Peter
out of a jam.

443
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,934
Yes, I sent him
to speak to Kapeniak.

444
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,001
But beyond that,
there's nothing to know.

445
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,638
Can you blame me if I find it
difficult to trust you right now?

446
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,341
Trust me or not.

447
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,010
But I'm about to be confirmed
as the Vice President.

448
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,112
And our relationship extends
to the Oval Office now.

449
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:42,284
Don't step out of the
sunlight for no reason.

450
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,926
Let's start this new chapter
with a clean slate.

451
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:52,298
Now you sleep on that,
and I'll be in touch.

452
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,937
 <i>We'll start with
blood and hormone tests.</i>

453
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,878
<i>Those results should be back
within a few days.</i>

454
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,006
If they're good, we'll move
onto genetic testing

455
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,812
for both you
and your husband.

456
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,375
Have you spoken
to him yet?

457
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:12,513
Not yet. I want to
do the tests first.

458
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,557
We can do those
anytime this week.

459
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,785
 I'll have
my office call yours.

460
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,953
I almost forgot.

461
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,861
I've been doing some
research on the Internet...

462
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,830
Be careful of
the Internet.

463
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,961
Well, I was looking
into common issues

464
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,834
associated with
post 40-pregnancies.

465
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,998
And this drug came up,
but there wasn't much on it.

466
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,201
It's Cruvenae...

467
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,174
Cruvenae-tenuestrin.

468
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,678
You probably
haven't found much,

469
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,044
because it's still
in the beta stage.

470
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,241
And what does it do?

471
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,251
It helps maximize
blood ﬂow to the placenta.

472
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,879
Until CBT, there hasn't
been any viable drug for that.

473
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,089
The jury's still out.

474
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,593
But placental insufficiency
affects women of all ages.

475
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,993
I wouldn't worry
about it for now.

476
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,057
That's putting the cart
way before the horse.

477
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,454
<i>Now, as to who is going
to replace Matthews when he wins...</i>

478
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,756
Can I at least
turn off the overhead?

479
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,262
Of course.

480
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,561
You want me to go
work downstairs?

481
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,399
No. That's fine.
Just make some room.

482
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,103
You haven't
said a word.

483
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,548
No.

484
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,641
Where does that
leave us?

485
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,552
I'm fully prepared.

486
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,920
And I have been
for some time.

487
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,335
I know you'll do
whatever you think is best.

488
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,805
 <i>But Underwood
confirmed it.</i>

489
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,604
He's going to be
tapped for VP.

490
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:14,905
That doesn't get us
any closer to...

491
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,106
We know that Russo
cleared the way for Matthews.

492
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,240
It reinforces the theory.
It doesn't give us proof.

493
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,341
We can't go after the guy
for playing dirty.

494
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,852
That's not news. Half the
fuckers in Congress play dirty.

495
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,855
He propped up a sham candidate
just to take him down.

496
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,288
Nobody forced Russo
to drink that night.

497
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,417
The guy was
an alcoholic.

498
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,687
Okay, we don't know
what happened that night

499
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,820
other than three days later,
he killed himself.

500
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,960
Are you gonna
contact him again?

501
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,323
I don't know.

502
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,369
 We need to slow down, take
a step back and re-evaluate...

503
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,029
We already let
Rachel slip away.

504
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,435
There's no point
until we have more!

505
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,373
We should keep him guessing, not...
Have more from where?

506
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,670
From who?
 I don't know.

507
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,937
But we should
exhaust all options

508
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,445
before Zoe reaches
back out to Underwood.

509
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,639
We don't have
any other options.

510
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,046
We are up against
a brick wall, and unless...

511
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,276
 Zoe?

512
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,714
Hey. Hey.

513
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,878
<i>Hey.</i>

514
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,348
I just need to think.

515
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:03,949
Well, let's think
about it together.

516
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,326
I'll call
you tomorrow.

517
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,158
Freddy.

518
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,325
Yeah, Frank?

519
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,166
Was there something different
about these ribs this morning?

520
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,798
Better or worse?

521
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,570
I didn't think that they
could get any better,

522
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,077
but these were
something special.

523
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,645
Well, tried a new butcher.

524
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,419
He slow bleeds his hogs.
It ain't legal, but...

525
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,250
Well, I won't tell anyone.

526
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,915
I don't know if I'm going
to go back to him.

527
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,549
Went out to his shop.

528
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,924
He's got a room in the back
where he does it.

529
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,826
Sound proof,
the whole setup.

530
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,728
Why soundproof?

531
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,000
'Cause of how they scream.
They can smell it coming.

532
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,065
You stick that pipe in their
throat, next 10 minutes is hell.

533
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,771
Bust your fucking eardrums.

534
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,176
Now, the humane way to do it
is to make it quick.

535
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,945
Bring out a bucket of slop
like ifs feeding time,

536
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,010
and then, bam, shovel right
to the base of the head.

537
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,619
No screaming.

538
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,118
Now, he's willing
to open up the race,

539
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,287
but Birch was very clear.

540
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:14,921
If he can't endorse anyone,
you can't either.

541
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,465
That's fair.

542
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,091
You really want
Buchwalter to win?

543
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,534
I want the best
man to win.

544
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,729
That sounds like a cagey,
bullshit non-answer lo me.

545
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,140
I'm on the sidelines
for this one, Terry.

546
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,145
You're never on
the sidelines, Frank.

547
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,215
I'll see you around.

548
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:36,408

549
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,997
Claire...

550
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,332
You wouldn't
return my calls.

551
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,732
I'll be back.

552
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,676
My attorney said that I shouldn't
be in contact with you.

553
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,281
Blue Cross said
my insurance was canceled.

554
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,405
 Oh!

555
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,245
The severance package gave me
health coverage for up to a year.

556
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,249
That sounds right.

557
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,123
So there must be
some kind of mistake.

558
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,687
Well, you'll have to talk
to the insurance company.

559
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,824
I did. They said
it was terminated.

560
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,362
They can't reinstate it without
the employer's approval.

561
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,995
And you want me
to get involved?

562
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,868
There's medication
that I need

563
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,204
that I can't get unless
it goes through my HMO.

564
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,837
Oh, I'm well aware.
I reviewed your records.

565
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,780
What?
You signed a consent form.

566
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,547
No, I didn't.

567
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,952
You forged my signature?

568
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,722
Did a Mrs. Applebaum
pay you a visit?

569
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,733
You realize what
you're doing is...

570
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,895
Civil, not criminal.

571
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,063
Have you thought this out?
Because when we go to court...

572
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,538
You mean six months
from now?

573
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,370
You're expecting
in four, no?

574
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,339
That's four months without
the medicine you need.

575
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,382
I'm willing to let your child
wither and die inside you

576
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,216
if that's what's required.

577
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,586
But neither of
us wants that.

578
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:25,486
Now tell me, am I really the
sort of enemy you want to make?

579
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,059
But here's the alternative.

580
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:35,270
This office, this staff, 22
million a year could be yours.

581
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,101
The CWI could be yours.

582
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,540
And you and me, we wash
our hands of each other.

583
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,601
You're trying to buy me?
No.

584
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,272
When we first met,
I promised to empower you.

585
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,678
I'm fulfilling that promise.

586
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,183
How do I get screwed?
You don't.

587
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,516
I resign.
You take my place.

588
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,616
No strings?
None.

589
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,386
<i>Exit polls
have Jim Matthews winning</i>

590
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,621
<i>by anywhere from
a 9 to 12% margin of victory.</i>

591
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,526
Swofford is expected to...

592
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,292
Hello.
Mrs. Underwood?

593
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,388
Yes?

594
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,526
<i>Hi. I'm calling
from Dr. Larson's office</i>

595
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,732
<i>to confirm your 10:00 a.m. tomorrow
for the blood and urine test.</i>

596
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,138
I can't come.

597
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,905
<i>Well, if tomorrow
doesn't work,</i>

598
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,641
<i>we can reschedule for
Thursday or even Monday.</i>

599
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,978
No. I won't
be rescheduling.

600
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,144
Please tell Dr. Larson I
appreciate all her consultation,

601
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,223
but I've put a great deal
of thought into this,

602
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,055
and I won't be pursuing
any further tests.

603
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,491
Thank you.

604
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,998

605
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,417
Have you thought
about what we discussed?

606
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,015
I think you're right. We should
start with a clean slate.

607
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,519
What about
our text messages?

608
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,400
And the contact?

609
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:33,675
Are we good?

610
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:34,876
Yeah.

611
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,420
We can put all this other
nonsense behind us,

612
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:40,353
and trust one another and
continue to help one another?

613
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,413
I'd like that.

614
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,116
Consider the slate clean.

615
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,196
 Answer me one thing.

616
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:50,756
The passenger seat. You said
Russo was trying to get out.

617
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:51,925
But there was nothing...

618
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,024
I thought we just agreed.

619
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,264
I want to believe you,
but I need details.

620
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,306
More than what
you're sharing.

621
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,635
What's your question?

622
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,973
The night Russo fell off the
wagon, he was at a fundraiser.

623
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,411
The McNeely Cancer Institute...
All in the police report.

624
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,618
Rachel Posner was at
the hotel that night.

625
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:11,710
Who's that?

626
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:15,156
The call girl who was with
Russo when he was arrested.

627
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,589
I didn't know her name.

628
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,762
She disappeared, Francis.

629
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,490
When?

630
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:23,930
Don't act surprised.

631
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,991
I showed the bellmen a photo.

632
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,002
One of them
remembers seeing her.

633
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:31,631
The girl is a prostitute. I'm
sure she frequents many hotels.

634
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,903
But that hotel
on that night?

635
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,571
Now, you sound like
Ms. Skorsky talking.

636
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,779
I haven't discussed
this with anyone.

637
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,811
I wanted to
ask you first.

638
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,011
I have no idea what
happened that night

639
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,020
except that Peter
started drinking again.

640
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,022
I don't know who was
or wasn't there.

641
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:51,492
I wish I was. Maybe I
could have stopped him.

642
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,256
Do you know where Rachel is?

643
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,854
Listen to what I am saying.

644
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,364
I'm trying to protect us both.

645
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,365
But these are questions
anyone could ask.

646
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,993
But no one
is except you.

647
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,663
I can't imagine
what you're after.

648
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,708
I took a chance,

649
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:09,210
showed up at your house and
placed myself at your feet.

650
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,377
Crosses ethical lines,
professionally, physically.

651
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,313
And I hold myself
accountable for that.

652
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:20,356
Those are my choices,
and I can live with them.

653
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,718
I'd like to move forward,

654
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:26,523
but I need to know exactly
what I was a part of that...

655
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,389
That I wasn't
a part of someone's...

656
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,834
Finish your thought.

657
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,830
Part of someone's murder.

658
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,004
Jesus!

659
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,745
I want to believe you,
Francis.

660
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,406

661
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,026

662
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,031

663
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,424

664
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,735

665
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,565
Janine!

666
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,661

667
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,471
Come in.

668
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,880
I've been calling you.

669
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,178
Come here.

670
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:41,688
Come in. Sit down.

671
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,847
Um...

672
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,524
You want something?
Some water or...

673
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,058
Juice?

674
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,069
You going somewhere?

675
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,034
Hey! You going somewhere?

676
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,044
To my Mom's
in Ithaca.

677
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,604
What?
I'm leaving.

678
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,013
No. No, no, no.

679
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,551
No way!
We have nothing.

680
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,109
Are you giving up on this?

681
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,950
There are only
three people in the world

682
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,422
that know what he has done,
and one of them is gone.

683
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,619
If we had anything, Lucas,
any hard evidence,

684
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,354
or even a fucking
quote from a source

685
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,795
that would go
on record for us,

686
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,024
that would be one thing.

687
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,534
But we are grasping,
and he's not fucking around.

688
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,697
You were the one
who told Zoe to pursue this.

689
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,762
She told me
what you said.

690
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,307
The only stories
that mattered were

691
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,774
the ones that
scared you to death!

692
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:37,403
Okay, this isn't just death threats!
This is real!

693
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,713
He doesn't know about you,
but he knows about me.

694
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,048
These were in my mailbox.
No return address.

695
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,951
 He took these of her?

696
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,419
Who else?

697
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,785
You can keep them.

698
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:48,823
But I don't think
they're going to help you.

699
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,416
We need to stop him.
Sick fucking shit.

700
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,657
Janine, you cannot
run away from this.

701
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,460
My entire career,

702
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,502
I have always chosen
the tough stories.

703
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,002
I have been fearless.

704
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:08,468
But you know what? I'm really
fucking scared this time.

705
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,842
He's got power,
he's got a lot to lose,

706
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,074
and right now,
he is winning.

707
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,275
Please, I need your help.
Please, don't do this.

708
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,683
Just wake
the fuck up, Lucas!

709
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,481

710
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,254

711
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,103
<i>at approximately 8:00 p.m.

717

723
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,566

726
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,508

727
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,215
What'd you think
of the files?

728
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,849
There's plenty
to work with.

729
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,326
Did you look at your own?

730
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,363
There was nothing there.

731
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,432
Should there be?

732
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,865
No.

733
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,263
Even if you're lying, the fact that I
haven't been able to find anything

734
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,772
tells me you're very good
at covering your tracks.

735
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,500
That's valuable to me.

736
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,872
Here's our battleground.

737
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,242
One hundred
and thirteen votes.

738
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,211
You have the skeletons.

739
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,551
If I lose,
they'll come after me.

740
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,215
 That's a risk
you have to take.

741
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,589
How do I know
you're not just using me?

742
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,592
Throwing a wrench
into someone else's bid?

743
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:06,957
That's another risk.

744
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,361
The alternative is
you wait 10 years.

745
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:13,229
You chose me
for a reason.

746
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,599
I'd like to
know what it is.

747
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,304
All right.

748
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:21,104
How many missile strikes
did you launch?

749
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,576
Enough to keep me
awake at night.

750
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,441
But you did it anyway.
Yes, I did.

751
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:26,108
How many women and children?

752
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:27,477
Too many.

753
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:28,642
And you launched
those missiles

754
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,446
knowing all those
innocent people would die?

755
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,487
I had orders to
eliminate the enemy.

756
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,558
Which you carried out
expertly and efficiently.

757
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,448
Have you ever
killed anyone?

758
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,654
No.

759
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,494
I watched apartment buildings,
entire villages gone

760
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,330
like they were never there.

761
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,965
I prefer not to talk about it
if that's all right.

762
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,166
You did what
needed to be done,

763
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,504
and that's why
I chose you' Jackie.

764
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,603
Service background,
clean history,

765
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,643
photogenic,
the whole package.

766
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,480
But more importantly,

767
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,012
ruthless pragmatism.

768
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,923
Are we working together
or not?

769
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,258
<i> Any public or private
endorsements for Buchwalter,</i>

770
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,593
I come out for Webb.

771
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,759
 I'll stay out of
the fray. I give you my word.

772
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,860
Same goes for you, Terry.

773
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,768
Thank you, Christina.

774
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:31,371
Gentlemen.

775
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,642
Mr. President,
how was Pennsylvania?

776
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,988


777
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:45,116

778
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,465
You like Indian?

779
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:04,669


780
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,053
Sir, I've seen the news.

781
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,357
I know she was
close to you.

782
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,562
Terrible tragedy.

783
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,075
I spoke to Special Agent
Rockland today, sir.

784
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,407
I begin my training
next week.

785
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,844
Very good.

786
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,585
I know it's a day late.

787
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,747
I hope it isn't
inappropriate,

788
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:48,915
but I wanted
to give you this.

789
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,096
Thank you, Meechum.

790
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,539
That was very
nice of Edward.

791
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,579
He shouldn't have spent
this sort of money on me.

792
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,239
I've opened
some wine downstairs.

793
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,305
I'll be down
in a minute.

794
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,753
Did you think
I'd forgotten you?

795
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,987
Perhaps you
hoped I had.

796
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,425
Don't waste a breath
mourning Ms. Barnes.

797
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,657
Every kitten
grows up to be a cat.

798
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:30,733
They seem
so harmless at first.

799
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,235
Small, quiet, lapping up
their saucer of milk.

800
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:38,240
But once their claws get long
enough, they draw blood.

801
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,902
Sometimes from
the hand that feeds them.

802
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,844
For those of us climbing
to the top of the food chain,

803
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,003
there can be no mercy.

804
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,083
There is but one rule.

805
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,846
Hunt or be hunted.

806
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,756
Welcome back.
