Evelyn.

Mr, Danton.

Remy.

I'm okay. I'm good.

6
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,804
Been a while.

7
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,073
Yeah, it has.

8
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,750
Good morning.

9
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,412
Mr. Vice President.

10
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,080
Chief Whitehall.

11
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,955
Is Andrew Jackson
going to be joining us?

12
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,120
No, I'm sorry.
That's a terrible oversight.

13
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,185
Doug, will you remove that?

14
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,959
Why don't we take
the photograph first?

15
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,474
Thank you.
Please, have a seat.

16
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,308
Let's talk
federal recognition.

17
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,214
Your tribe has
waited long enough.

18
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,394

19
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,233

00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,402

21
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,847
Who is it?

22
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,080
It's me. It's Lisa.

23
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,828
Can I come in?

24
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,759
Temp jobs, mostly.
Clerical work.

25
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,860
Right now, I'm doing part-time at
a dentist's office, reception.

26
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,667
You deserve better.

27
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,004
It is what it is.

28
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,906
This is the first time
I've had Starbucks

29
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,568
since I can remember.

30
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,738
It's a luxury
for me these days.

31
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,874
Maybe there's something
for you at Glendon Hill.

32
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,917
That's nice of you to say,

33
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,748
but I'm not the right fit
for a place like...

34
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,722
Sure you are. 20 years' experience
in the non-profit sphere.

35
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,850
We coordinate all
the time with NGOs.

36
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,085
You'd be
a valuable asset to us.

37
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,026
Claire should have
never let you go.

38
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,861
Yeah.

39
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,798
Well, I'll hold my tongue.

40
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,532
She and I don't talk.
We had a falling out.

41
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,534
Loyalty isn't her thing.

42
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,768
No, it is not.

43
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,540
I don't think
she's loyal to anyone.

44
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,910
Except maybe her husband.

45
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,379
Maybe.

46
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,274
Maybe not.

47
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,748
What do you mean?

48
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,552
Nothing I know for certain,

49
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,787
but spend a decade working
for someone and...

50
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,432
 She threaten you
or anything?

51
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,434
No. She just wouldn't leave.

52
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,971
It's not like I wanted
to call the cops.

53
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,061
She's not a bad person.

54
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,172
No, no, but...

55
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,936
I tried to talk to her.

56
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,638
Then she lit up a pipe.

57
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,910
Meth?
Yeah.

58
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,971
When we were roommates,
that's all it was.

59
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,416
I used to be
really deep into that.

60
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,580
Heroin, too.

61
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,581
And then I found
the fellowship...

62
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:13,781
What can I do?

63
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,253
I'm sorry. I shouldn't...

64
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,486
No, I'm glad
you came here.

65
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,585
I know
you're late for work.

66
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,753
I'll call in sick.

67
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,026
Don't do that.
It's fine. I'll go.

68
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,762
Stay here. I mean,
don't go back there.

69
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,496
Are you sure?

70
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,630
Keys.

71
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,337
In case you need
to come and go.

72
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,174
I'll be back around 7:30.

73
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,269
Thank you.

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,009
You don't have to thank me.

75
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,152

76
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,557

77
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,137

78
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,375
All the President has to do
is pick up the phone,

79
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,670
and the bridge is approved.

80
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,177
 If the President had
wanted to be involved,

81
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,235
he would have
already made that call.

82
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,370
It's his initiative, Linda.

83
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,244
Was his initiative.
We're in a trade war now.

84
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,375
But that doesn't mean we
have to abandon good policy.

85
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,713
It's inconsistent
with his current stance.

86
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,812
The Committee on Foreign Investment
has 30 clays to approve.

87
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,552
There's only six days left. They
won't act without a directive

88
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,887
from the President
of the United States.

89
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,052
 I'm confused.

90
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,651
You've been
the biggest proponent

91
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,263
of a strong position
against China.

92
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,425
That is not true. I advocated
the opposite early on.

93
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,933
You seem fixated
on this bridge.

94
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,502
Is something
else going on here?

95
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,199
Unemployment is at 9.2.
Inflation is skyrocketing.

96
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,435
We're on the verge
of losing our majority.

97
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,532
The President needs to offer
a piece of good news.

98
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,772
A bridge? That's
a drop in the bucket.

99
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,576
Jobs, infrastructure, deficit reduction.
You think...

100
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,912
You're still not being
straight with me.

101
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,112
I have no
ulterior motive here.

102
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,052
But if you feel
that strongly,

103
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,454
and the President
feels that strongly,

104
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,584
then I'll back off.
I won't mention it again.

105
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,390
I think that's
a wise decision.

106
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,930
We should be
a united front.

107
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,226
I couldn't agree more.

108
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,560
Thank you.

109
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,768
Why does everything have
to be a struggle?

110
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,237
Can't some people
just say yes for once'?

111
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,603
 Sir?

112
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,767
I need the President's schedule
for the next two days.

113
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:12,969
She change her mind?

114
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,203
What do you think?

115
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,405
So what's
our next move?

116
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,880
I'll focus on the bridge. You
talk to the Indian Affairs.

117
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,441
The sooner that Whitehall's
tribe gets recognized,

118
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,486
the sooner they can break
ground on that casino.

119
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,918
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:29,091
Maybe it'll help me, you know, if I
talk about it more, in the open.

121
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,294
I mean, that's what
your interview did.

122
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,956
When I called, when I could
say those things out loud...

123
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,831
Well, we don't want you
lo feel obligated.

124
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,098
I know the press
hasn't left you alone.

125
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,663
If they're gonna keep
taking pictures of me,

126
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,969
I should at least
say something.

127
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,635
Well, it's only gonna
become more intense

128
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,644
as McGinnis gets closer
to his court-martial.

129
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,305
Yeah, I know.

130
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,347
I'm prepared.

131
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,850
If you come and speak to the
Armed Services Committee,

132
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,078
tell your story,

133
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,348
I feel confident we
can get it to a vote.

134
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,980
There'll be too much
coverage to ignore it.

135
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,285
And you think
it will pass?

136
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,417
We need to get it
through committee first.

137
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,121
But let's be clear, Megan.
It's not just the testimony.

138
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,630
We'll need you lo do
a media avail after.

139
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,790
Photo ops,
a statement.

140
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:08,991
Okay.

141
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,093
You won't be alone. I'll be
standing right next to you.

142
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,432
And so will I.

143
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,601
Okay.

144
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,805
Do you think we're
doing the right thing,

145
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,176
hauling her in
front of the cameras?

146
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,545
We have to trust her when
she says she wants to.

147
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,108
But it's very important that the
White House backs us up on this,

148
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,382
not just you.

149
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,721
I'm not sure if Garrett
will gel involved publicly.

150
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,953
Well, can you
talk to him?

151
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,555
We haven't been doing much
talking about anything lately.

152
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,334
Things haven't
gotten any better?

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,840
We haven't said a word to
each other in almost a week.

154
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:50,998

155
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,576
I've been there.
It's awful.

156
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,167
With Frank?
Sure.

157
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,304
What did you do?

158
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,711
We saw someone.

159
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,648
You mean a therapist?

160
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,512
Weren't you
worried about exposure?

161
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,217
He was a minister. He
wasn't exactly a therapist.

162
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,658
It was more like a spiritual
guidance type thing.

163
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,424
The only difference was
he had a degree.

164
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,599
I could put you
in touch'

165
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,998
It's too risky.

166
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,404
Just a suggestion.

167
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,065
Let me know if you
change your mind.

168
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,341
Thanks.

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
In the meantime, can you
try to talk to Garrett?

170
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,239
We really need his
support with this.

171
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,578
I will.

172
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,120

173
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,920
Yes?

174
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,032
Show him in, please.

175
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,705

176
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,205
Remy.

177
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,645
So formal.

178
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,750
Would you have a seat?

179
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,152
You shouldn't keep
your interns so late.

180
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,622
You and I might not have
lives, but they do.

181
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,624
When there's work to be done, we work.
They know that.

182
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,922
Why am I here at
10:00 at night?

183
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,761
Where is the GOP
getting their money?

184
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,131
That is a 25-million-dollar
question, isn't it?

185
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,294
You must have an idea.

186
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,893
What makes you think that?

187
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,596
Because you know things.

188
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,403
That's why Glendon Hill
made you partner.

189
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,809
Most of our clients
are Democrats.

190
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,109
I'm just as much
in the dark as you are.

191
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,275
I'm losing in
my district, Remy.

192
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,914
And I wish I could help you.

193
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,080
Even if I pull off a win,
it doesn't matter.

194
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,950
The GOP takes the House,

195
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,789
I lose my spot in the
leadership, this office,

196
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,987
everything I've worked for.

197
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,686
I feel for you.

198
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,595
But you want information
I don't have.

199
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:04,102
Are you upset about the last
time we saw each other?

200
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,300
Not at all.

201
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,811
I made myself clear.

202
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,115
Can we talk?
No work, no politics.

203
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,116
We can talk about
whatever you want.

204
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,192
I've never been with anyone
for more than six months.

205
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,631
When I was in the Army,
I was always on the move,

206
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,797
and since I've been in Congress,
I just haven't had time.

207
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,636
I wasn't asking to
marry you.

208
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,698
Just to be more than
company for a night.

209
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,510
Do you still want that?

210
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,205
I'm here, aren't I?

211
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,411
There would have to be
clear boundaries.

212
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,579
Whatever we have
privately couldn't

213
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,815
affect our professional
relationship.

214
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:02,223
Then we shouldn't be having this
conversation in your office.

215
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm glad we
had this meeting.

216
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,731
If you'd like to have
another, just call me.

217
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,868
We can leave the
secretaries out of it.

218
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,547

219
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,121
I'll review this and
have Linda get in touch.

220
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,091
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.

221
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,233
 Good morning,
Mr. President.

222
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,736
Hi, Frank.

223
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,865
I left my bourbon
at home,

224
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,409
but you have some
time for coffee?

225
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,411
I'm fine. You go ahead.

226
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,278
I wanted to talk to you about
the Port Jefferson Bridge.

227
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,979
Linda told me
you two spoke.

228
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,782
Have you reconsidered?

229
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,288
No, it's not
the right time, Frank.

230
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,789
We'll find some other project
to showcase our program

231
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,988
once tensions subside.

232
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,257
During the campaign,

233
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,790
you repeatedly promised to
address critical infrastructure.

234
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,166
We're well into
your second year.

235
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,260
This project
is ready to go.

236
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,432
You don't want to have to
start from square one.

237
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,999
Well, I'm
thinking midterms.

238
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,476
We have to
project consistency.

239
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,478
Except people don't vote
for consistency.

240
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,243
They vote for
concrete progress.

241
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,317
Linda mentioned that you seemed
obsessed with this bridge.

242
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,946
I'm beginning to
think she was right.

243
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,453
The back-stabbing,
vomit-inducing bitch.

244
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,156
Is she right, Frank?

245
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,827
Tell me why this bridge
is so important to you.

246
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,630
I wanted to insulate
you from this.

247
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,499
From what'?

248
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,312
You asked me to backchannel
with the Chinese,

249
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,505
and I have continued
to do so.

250
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,514
No. I told you
to stop backchanneling,

251
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,709
and you did anyway, without
informing me? Frank...

252
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,809
I needed to
distance you.

253
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,987
There are issues that a
president cannot be aware of.

254
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,888
What issues?

255
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,857
But what
I can tell you

256
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,657
is that the building of this
bridge directly affects

257
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,222
our ability to combat the
Republicans in the midterms.

258
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,561
Are the Chinese...
Mr. President,

259
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,331
you are asking questions you
do not want the answers to.

260
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,973
How much danger
are we in, Frank?

261
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:26,542
None, if we end this
conversation right now.

262
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,539
Sometimes I feel like

263
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,014
I'm losing control of my own
goddamn administration.

264
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,053
You're under pressure, sir, but
you're not losing control.

265
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,213
You have people who are
looking out for you.

266
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,086
Me, Linda, your wife.

267
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,889
Might be losing
control of her, too.

268
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,523
I shouldn't have said that.

269
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,158
Of course she
wants the best for me.

270
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,497
Has Claire said anything?
I mean, I know they talk.

271
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,198
Not much.

272
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,936
Just that things
have been a little rocky.

273
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,746
That's an understatement.

274
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,380
You have the most
difficult job on Earth.

275
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,578
It would take
a toll on any marriage.

276
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,119
Which is why
I'm urging you

277
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,450
to reconsider your
decision on the bridge.

278
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,856
And I'd say that
not as your Vice President,

279
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,223
but as your friend,

280
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,088
because I care
about you.

281
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,238
All right, I'll have
another look at it.

282
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,440
Thank you, Mr...

283
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,716
Thank you, Garrett.

284
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,811
Mr. Frost.

285
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,046
Morning.

286
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,757
<i>We filed all of
our paperwork back in 2006.</i>

287
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,624
We dotted all of our I's and
crossed all of our T's.

288
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,957
There's over
317 applications.

289
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,328
Each one requires at least
a year to review.

290
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,491
You need more researchers.

291
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,623
It's not just personnel.

292
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,499
There's travel, filing,
administration.

293
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,266
 Name the figure.

294
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,103
Twelve, 13 million.
That requires

295
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,972
an appropriation
from Congress.

296
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,636
The Vice President can
make that happen.

297
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,142
But first we need you to
recognize the Ugaya tribe.

298
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,149
Our policy is first
come, first serve.

299
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,742
There are applications
which we have to...

300
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,448
Daniel Lanagin
dis-enrolled us.

301
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,151
We lost our right
to BIA benefits.

302
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,624
Is this more about
starting a casino?

303
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,320
It's about correcting
an injustice.

304
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,658
I can't be getting involved
in inter-tribal conflicts.

305
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,958
Yes, you can.

306
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,522
If you want
that appropriation.

307
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,970
Two months. Maybe less if
all the ancestry holds up.

308
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,768
Lanagin knows.

309
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,934
And what did he say'?
He wants to meet.

310
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,137
But on his turf
this time.

311
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,005
I need a way to
get to Missouri

312
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,706
without attracting
any attention.

313
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,843
Womack's district's in Kansas City.
it's not far from the casino.

314
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,821
See if he has any events coming up.
Rallies, fundraisers.

315
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,494
How's it coming with
co-sponsors for Claire's bill?

316
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,193
Terrific. We're making
great progress.

317
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,659

318
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,470
One speech. It'll send
a message to Congress that...

319
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,534
And a message to the Joint
Chiefs that I'm trampling on...

320
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,045
Twenty four thousand
assaults last year.

321
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,307
Only 3,000 reported,
because they're...

322
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,371
I know the figures.

323
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,382
Do you know how many suicides
result from the trauma that...

324
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,850
It's not a question
of statistics.

325
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,080
This bill will save lives.

326
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,518
Can we discuss
this later?

327
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,147
I had to schedule this
meeting, Garrett.

328
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,192
It's the middle of the day, Patricia.
You know very well how my...

329
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,419
Don't make me lobby you when I go home.

330
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,688
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mr. President.

331
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,560
The Secretary-General
is here.

332
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,859
 Two more minutes.

333
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,094
It's 12:30. He was
scheduled for 12:15.

334
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,166
I'll go.

335
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,008
You were supposed
to tell me to stay,

336
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,840
but it's nice to know I'm
worth at least two minutes.

337
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,781

338
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,453
Hi, Tricia.

339
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,090
No, please,
don't worry about it.

340
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,023
Oh, that's awful.

341
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,127
Yes, of course. Let me
grab his number for you.

342
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,399
Mmm-hmm.

343
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,971
Right.

344
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,781
His name is
Dr. Thomas Larkin

345
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:32,049
at 202-251-6258.

346
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,453
And if you'd like, I can
give him a call beforehand

347
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,290
and let him know
you'll be reaching out.

348
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,964
Okay. Well you let me know
if I can be of any help.

349
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,331
Good night, Tricia.

350
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,061
What do you think?

351
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,570
We'll see.

352
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,580
The idea is to take color
theory and turn it on its head.

353
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,579
Break all the rules.

354
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,084
They're gorgeous.

355
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,113
Who'd you say
your client is?

356
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,658
I didn't.

357
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,352
I was just wondering
if maybe I knew him.

358
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,019
You don't.

359
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,998
Let's say he's a collector always
on the lookout for new talent.

360
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,632
I understand you work
for Adam Galloway.

361
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,865
Yeah.

362
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,298
It's a way to
pay the bills.

363
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,001
I mean, Adam's
a good photographer

364
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,441
if you like
that kind of thing.

365
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,973
I'm much more
interested in form.

366
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,277
How much for
all of them?

367
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,611
What?

368
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,113
I'd like to buy them all.

369
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,116
<i>Missouri is the
Show Me State for a reason,</i>

370
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,627
<i>and we need to show
the rest of America</i>

371
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,187
<i>that we can keep
our leadership intact.</i>

372
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:51,132
It is a pleasure to look out and
see a room full of smiling faces.

373
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,194
That's not something you see every day
in Washington, D.C.

374
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,465
What did your editors say?

375
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,698
<i>Five thousand words.</i>

376
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:57,831
This should be twice that.

377
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,376
I can probably
get them to eight,

378
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,035
but I'm gonna need
the First Lady, too.

379
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,134
Separate interviews.

380
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,145
Let me talk
to Mrs. Underwood.

381
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,376
 <i>Hey, how come you're coming
to me with this instead of Connor?</i>

382
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,214
Between you and me, he's out.
Got a job at SpaceX.

383
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,219
<i>His choice,
or was he pushed out?</i>

384
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,984
People don't like working with me, Matt.
You may be the only one.

385
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,252
<i>No, I don't
like you, either.</i>

386
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,849
I might if you get me
the First Lady.

387
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,589
They'll both be speaking
to Armed Services tomorrow

388
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,754
<i>along with Megan Hennessey.</i>

389
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,489
She's the one who the general was...
That's right.

390
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,534
I'll set up a one-on-one,
texture for your piece.

391
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,491
All right.
Let me know, man.

392
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,037
Anything for
the Times, Matt.

393
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:29,164
Anything for
the Times, huh?

394
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,435
And we get shut out
of donor meetings.

395
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,407
The magazine. And yes.

396
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,503
Raymond Tusk. Your boss went
to see him last October.

397
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,944
It's in his congressional
travel report.

398
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,039
Before my time.

399
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,176
You said they
didn't communicate.

400
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,274
I said not to
my knowledge.

401
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,375
We're in Missouri.

402
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,682
He's not
one of the donors.

403
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,280
I can quote you on that?

404
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,550
If you spell my name right.

405
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,354
Now, normally, I don't
quote northern writers.

406
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,452
But every now and then,

407
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,792
one of them says something that makes
a lot of sense.

408
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,130
And this Emerson fellow
you've probably heard of

409
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:02,570
once wrote that, "The only way
to have a friend is to be one."

410
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,699
And I think you all know
what kind of a friend

411
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,074
that Terry has
been to this district.

412
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,774
So I'm proud to introduce him
today and to call him my friend.

413
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,781
Would you please welcome
the Majority Leader,

414
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,715
Representative Terry Womack.

415
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,619
Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

416
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,384
And I would like
lo thank all of you.

417
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,325
We all set'?

418
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,827
I told the press
you're having some

419
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,294
private meetings
with contributors.

420
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,797
Thank you.

421
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:29,889
AW protests?

422
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,492
Oh, we're good,
except for Ayla Sayyad.

423
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,626

424
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,000
Thank you.
Thank you.

425
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,129
What's going on?

426
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,229
Potential blind spot.

427
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,331
Tell me on
the way to the car.

428
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,636
Mr. Vice President.

429
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,005
Thank you.

430
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,008

431
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:20,445

432
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,383
Calm down. Now.

433
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,285
Welcome.

434
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,854
What a pleasant
surprise, Raymond.

435
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,623
Mr. Vice President.

436
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,632
I was expecting to see you
privately today, Daniel.

437
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,031
When it's
a serious matter,

438
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,625
I invite all the chiefs
lo the circle.

439
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,201
Nice pool.

440
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,505
I've never swum in it.
The chlorine hurts my eyes.

441
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,914
You're welcome to take a
dip in it if you'd like.

442
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,004
Another time.

443
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,646
Well, Raymond tells me
you're a ribs man.

444
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,052
Well, I've got three of the
choicest pieces of meat

445
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,884
you'll ever see in
your life coming out.

446
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,152
You do not want
to pass on this.

447
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,494
I won't be here long.

448
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,087
So, the Ugaya band.

449
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,562
Tip of the iceberg.
Mmm.

450
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,733
They're not
a real tribe.

451
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,235
They're
about to be.

452
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,499
No, they're a bunch
of troublemakers

453
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,734
with too much
hope on their hands.

454
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:22,005
Once they get recognized, they're
gonna have their own casino.

455
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,377
In two years?
At best?

456
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,245
Well, you better enjoy
this pool while you can.

457
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,182
I don't think your casino can
stand that sort of competition.

458
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,223
Who do you think Whitehall called
as soon <i>as</i> he left the BIA?

459
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,527
You offered them a casino
two years from now.

460
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,860
We offered what
they really want.

461
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,059
Re-enrollment
in my tribe.

462
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,694
The tip of your iceberg
is melting, Frank.

463
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,040
And you do not have time
on your side.

464
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,939
So, how about this?

465
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:57,037
You help me repair my
relationship with Garrett.

466
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,209
Dan and I here get the money flowing
back in the right direction.

467
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,554
How about this?

468
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,320
I get the BIA to
investigate both of you.

469
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,723
Connection to
Feng, launder...

470
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,123
You could.

471
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,630
But you won't.
You don't dare.

472
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,759
My money has been going
to the Democrats for nine years.

473
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,303
You were the Whip
for all of them.

474
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,565
You implicate us,
you implicate yourself

475
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,902
and everyone in
the leadership.

476
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,410
Ah, here comes the steak.
Oh.

477
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,811
Now, you are going
to enjoy this, Frank.

478
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:31,938
There you go.

479
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,074
Thank you.

480
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,019
Now, dig in, Frank,
before the flies get to it.

481
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,316
I'll pass. Thanks.
 Are you sure?

482
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,824
This is soy-fed
Matsusaka beef.

483
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,452
 You know, my ancestors
would have prayed to this heifer

484
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,326
to honor her spirit.

485
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,457
But at 200 bucks a pound,
I figure, fuck tradition.

486
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,590

487
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:53,794
Come on. Live
a little, Frank.

488
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,500
Mr. Vice President.

489
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,701
Not my
vice president.

490
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,942
You're on sovereign land.

491
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,720
Dogs are so predictable,
aren't they?

492
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,029
Setup a meeting with Walker.
Tonight, if possible.

493
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,296
I should be
back by 6:00.

494
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:27,564
<i>Lanagin didn't budge?</i>

495
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,299
He re-enrolled them. We have to
get the bridge approved now.

496
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,705
I'll call Linda.
Bypass her.

497
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,073
<i>I don't want her
in the meeting</i>

498
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,907
I'm on it.
Thanks.

499
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,875
Meechum, get in touch
with the plane.

500
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,917
Have them make ribs
for the flight back.

501
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,314
Yes, sir.

502
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,654

503
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,499

504
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,203

505
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,328

506
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,476
Mr. Vice President,
do you have a moment?

507
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,909
I'm sorry. The President
asked to see me.

508
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,345
No, he didn't.
You requested the meeting,

509
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,813
and I took it
off the schedule.

510
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,178
You did what?

511
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,613
Let's go
in your office.

512
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,922
You lied, Frank.

513
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,116
You said you would
let the bridge go,

514
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,418
and then you
went behind my back,

515
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,652
just like you're
trying to do now.

516
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,953
I do not require
your permission.

517
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,825
No, but you
should involve me.

518
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,158
The President and
the Vice President

519
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,096
have issues they must
discuss privately.

520
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,190
When you are secretive,

521
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,996
it prevents me from being
able to do my job.

522
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,195
And when you
cancel meetings,

523
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,203
it prevents me from
being able to do mine.

524
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,137
Which is why I wanted to talk,
so we can work things out.

525
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,936
We should be working together.
I will not waste my time

526
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,500
inflating your sense
of self-importance!

527
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,010
Excuse me'?

528
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,613
How many elections
have you won?

529
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,013
How many congressional
committees have you chaired?

530
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,516
Would you even be working
in the White House

531
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,347
if I hadn't recommended you
during the campaign?

532
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,478
I returned that
favor and then some.

533
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,046
Look where
your desk is now.

534
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,488
And I'd say we're even.

535
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,356
And if you want
to maintain my respect,

536
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,893
you're going
about it all wrong.

537
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,656
I asked you in here
to work out a solution...

538
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,129
You didn't ask.
You demanded.

539
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,791
I will not be
left out of the loop.

540
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,525
I'm the President's
Chief of Staff.

541
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,696
Oh, you call this being Chief of Staff?
Micromanaging his datebook?

542
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,138
I'd say that's more
of a glorified scheduler.

543
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,870
The White House
would fall off its rails

544
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,137
without me doing my job.

545
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,873
Are you certain about that?
Yes, lam.

546
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,380
I look out for
the President 24/17.

547
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,314
I keep him informed. I keep
his priorities straight.

548
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,751
We did just fine before you
became Vice President, Frank.

549
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,378
All right. Let's go over to
the Oval Office right now

550
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,547
and ask the President
to choose.

551
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,921
His Chief of Staff
or his Vice President.

552
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,654
I know what the answer would be.
You want to go?

553
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,524
I didn't think so.

554
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:46,195
Now I will see the President
tomorrow morning, schedule or no.

555
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,399
And please, turn out the
lights before you leave.

556
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,406
I thought you went home.

557
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,540
No, not yet.
Do you have a moment?

558
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,912
Is there something wrong?

559
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,580
I know you are reconsidering the
bridge project, and I wanted...

560
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,851
I'm reviewing it.
I'll make my decision soon.

561
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,087
But you already
made a decision, sir.

562
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,390
I'm concerned that you
are over thinking this one.

563
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,556
If we backtrack...

564
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,790
Did I not make
myself clear?

565
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,197
I'm just trying
to offer my advice, sir.

566
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,134
Which I have heard, and which
I don't need to hear again.

567
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,431
But thank you.

568
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,430
I know the Vice
President spoke

569
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,065
to you yesterday,
and in fairness...

570
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,769
You know I value
your input, Linda.

571
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,642
When I say I've heard it, you
need to know I mean that.

572
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,374
Of course, sir.

573
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,439
Is there anything else?

574
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,575
No, sir. Good night.

575
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,554
Good night.

576
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,461
You disappointed me.

577
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,228
I told you
it would take time.

578
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,964
Any leads?

579
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,096
I've been going over
his state senate days.

580
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,801
It's a slow process.
I have to be thorough.

581
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,638
So how is it that I've
found more in two days

582
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,405
than you have
in two months?

583
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,605
What do you mean?

584
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,149
I've had to do
your job for you.

585
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:07,478
You found something?

586
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,485
I'm the one who's supposed
to ask that question.

587
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,317
What'd you find?
Maybe I can help.

588
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,984
Are you working for Frank?

589
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,688
Yeah, as his
communications director.

590
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:22,595
No, are you working for him?

591
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,826
Come on.

592
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,833
He couldn't pay me a fraction
of what you're offering.

593
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:26,994
Don't lie to me.

594
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,163
Look, if you've lost
confidence in my ability...

595
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,172
Stop fucking around.

596
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,610
You made
the wrong choice, Seth.

597
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,108
I don't think so.

598
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,181
You're nothing.
You're a parasite.

599
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,486
So are you, Danton.
Justin a nicer suit.

600
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,526
Do you know
what it might be?

601
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,632
Keep your ear
to the ground.

602
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,970
That was Seth.

603
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,045

604
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,075
He thinks Remy
may have something on us.

605
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,746
What?

606
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,015
He doesn't know.

607
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,217
Do you think
it could be...

608
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,486
No.

609
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,993
If it's anything,
I'm sure it's innocuous.

610
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,431
Nothing we can't weather.

611
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:34,402
But my bet is they're bluffing,
just to make us paranoid.

612
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,873
But he's a dangerous man,
isn't he, Raymond?

613
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:46,441
We can be dangerous, too,
when we need to be.

614
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:56,182
<i>♪ Lord, I just can't keep
from crying sometimes</i>

615
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:04,934
<i>♪ Lord, I just can't keep
from crying sometimes</i>

616
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,569
<i>♪ When the world's

617
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:17,046

00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:25,245
<i>♪ Lord, I just can't

619
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,120
<i>♪ Sometimes I</i>

620
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,728
Don't stop.

621
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:39,825
I used to be a call girl.

622
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:47,169
I had to get away from it,
and that's why I came here.

623
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,411
There's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me.

624
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,648
You don't have to say
anything you don't want to.

625
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,528
When you tapped on my
shoulder on the bus,

626
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,530
there was something...

627
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,335

628
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,604
Your eyes.

629
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,476
That sounds really, really dumb.

630
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,101
No.

631
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,211
I don't know. I felt like I
wanted to tell you everything.

632
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,190
That I could trust you, even
though I didn't know you.

633
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,554
You can.

634
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,123
I've never
trusted anyone.

635
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,629
Have you ever loved anyone?

636
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,904
No.

637
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,382
I've never expected much
from the world.

638
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,475
It's ugly.
It's not a fair place.

639
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,653
I'm happy to
have what I have.

640
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,589
I'm glad I have this.

641
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,093
I've thought it
all out.

642
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:49,757
And there's a way to do it so
we don't risk any exposure.

643
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,702
Do we have to
talk about this now?

644
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,368
I'm beat.

645
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,363
My brain is...

646
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,140

647
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,909
Yes, we do.

648
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,109
Because it's our marriage.

649
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:10,118
If we're gonna survive
the next two years or six,

650
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,411
we need to do something.

651
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,552
We should be each
other's support system,

652
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,788
not cause
each other stress.

653
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,725
The foundation of this White
House is not brick or mortar.

654
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,062
It's us, Garrett.

655
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,434
This is important to me.

656
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,499
And I want it to
be important to you.

657
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,143
 I have to trust that
whatever you're managing,

658
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,517
to whatever extent
you choose not to inform me,

659
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,816
that I'm neither at risk

660
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,482
nor passively condoning
something blatantly illegal.

661
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,527
Any risk falls
solely on me.

662
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,460
And you can't be accused of
condoning what you're not aware of.

663
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,328
Being not aware is
just as egregious.

664
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,661
Not in this case.

665
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,669
I'm steering the ship away from
the rocks, not toward them.

666
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,466
Then I'll call the Committee
for Foreign Investments.

667
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,529
You're making
the right decision, sir.

668
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,943
I have another difficult
decision to make.

669
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,512
Linda submitted
her resignation.

670
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,647
I was furious with her.

671
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,449
It was a very
manipulative move.

672
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,854
I can speculate
as to why she made it.

673
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,482
Well, are her
complaints valid?

674
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,028
I have a very biased view
on that subject.

675
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,654
Well, I've heard hers.
Give me yours.

676
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,368
Well, Linda and I
don't always agree.

677
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,027
But she's been
very loyal to you

678
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,571
and a more than competent
Chief of Staff.

679
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,971
So you think
I should keep her'?

680
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,376
Do I think she oversteps sometimes?
Yes.

681
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,745
Does she wrongly equate her
advice with mine? Often.

682
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,252
But the question that occurs
to me is not about Linda.

683
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,322
Let's say you
refuse her resignation.

684
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,018
If this gets out,
and it could,

685
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:59,153
won't you be sending a signal
10 anybody who works for you

686
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,754
that you can be leveraged?

687
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,668
She offered her
resignation.

688
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,671
Shes already gone,
even if she stays.

689
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,672

690
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,213
Megan? They're ready.

691
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,915
I don't know.
My hands are shaking.

692
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,514
You can do this, Megan.
I'll be there.

693
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,460
I get panic attacks
sometimes.

694
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,585
You afraid
you'll get one?

695
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:34,719
Yeah.

696
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,426
Okay. Well, why don't we ask
for a couple of more minutes?

697
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,264
It's not about that.
They just come.

698
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,133
I can't control them.

699
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,698
I don't want to do this.

700
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,975
Okay, Megan,
there's some

701
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:53,413
of the most senior Congressmen
and women in the room,

702
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,747
and the press, they've shown
up just to hear from you.

703
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,047
I know.

704
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,280
Okay, I don't want
to pressure you'

705
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,220
but a lot of planning
has gone into this.

706
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,921
Please don't
make me do this.

707
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,260
We're not making
you do anything.

708
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,230
Then can I just go back
home? Back to Chicago?

709
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,393
Listen, you have nerves.
That's understandable.

710
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,765
I don't want to
fucking do it, okay?

711
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,930
I understand. It's okay. But
if you back out now, Megan...

712
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,903
This isn't about me at all, is it?
This is not good for us.

713
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,669
It hurts us. It makes
us look unorganized.

714
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,072
This is about your
fucking moment to shine.

715
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,634
You don't fucking
care if I do...

716
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,180
I do care. I do care.

717
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,945
It is about me
and about you.

718
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:36,753
For whatever reason, we both decided
to share what happened to us,

719
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,158
and it mattered,
and people listened.

720
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,853
So let's go in and
finish what we started.

721
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,463
I can't. I'm not the right person.
Come on, Megan.

722
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:42,997
Do you know what I did last night?
Let's go.

723
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,829
I picked up some guy in
a bar. Total stranger.

724
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,097
I let him fuck my brains
out at the hotel.

725
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,264
Night before, same thing.
I can't stop.

726
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,932
It's my only way
to fucking...

727
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,203
Jesus, I fucking hate this
when my hands shake like this,

728
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:55,710
and I can't...

729
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,884
It's okay.
It's okay.

730
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,147
I'm not who you want
to be your poster girl.

731
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,850
You don't have to be.
You don't have to be.

732
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,391
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.
It's okay.

733
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,620
You're not letting me down.
It's okay. It's okay.

734
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,361
When will it
become official?

735
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,398
<i>The President will
make his can this afternoon.</i>

736
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,866
<i>Official approval will be
announced in the morning.</i>

737
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,232
No revisions
to the agreement?

738
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,702
<i>None.</i>

739
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,003
<i>Everything is as spelled out
in the proposal.</i>

740
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,044
Then I will uphold
my end of the bargain.

741
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,043
<i>The money will
be cut oft.</i>

742
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:33,206
You required proof.
Now, we want some.

743
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,715
<i>What sort?</i>

744
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:37,878
Of your commitment. You kill
your co-venture with Tusk.

745
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,182
That was never
part of the deal.

746
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,516
<i>It is now.</i>

747
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,050
<i>The refinery can't proceed
while we're in a trade war.</i>

748
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,991
We want you to
kill it for good,

749
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,891
and we want you
to kill it today.

750
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,863
Make the call to Tusk.

751
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,830

752
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,910
<i>It's business hours.
Is this a business call?</i>

753
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,678
No.

754
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,547
<i>I was hoping it wasn't.</i>

755
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,087
What are you
doing tonight?

756
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,689
Just about to
get on a plane.

757
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,247
<i>Where to?</i>

758
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,882
Boundaries, remember?

759
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,222
Work-related.

760
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,692
<i>I don't take vacation.</i>

761
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,131
Can you tell me
when you'll be back?

762
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,926
Tomorrow.
It's a quick trip.

763
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:28,470
<i>Do you want to
have dinner?</i>

764
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,867
I'd like that.

765
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,274
Bring your carry-on.
You could stay over after.

766
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,479

767
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,248
Yes?

768
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,615
Do you
have a moment?

769
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,053
Absolutely.

770
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:51,125
The President accepted my
resignation an hour ago.

771
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,285
Yes, I know.

772
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,294
I almost told him
that I'd changed my mind,

773
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,921
but I realized it wouldn't
make any difference.

774
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,227
For whatever it's worth,

775
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,768
I did bring up your loyalty and
how good you are at your job,

776
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,667
not that he needed
me to remind him.

777
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,330
And I will always be
grateful you recommended me.

778
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,965
It has been quite a ride.

779
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,236
Shorter than
I would have hoped,

780
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,470
but I have
a long career ahead.

781
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,136
No doubt.

782
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,941
And just so you know,
I don't plan

783
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,777
on making any fuss
in the press.

784
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,648
You'll hear nothing but
my praises if I'm asked.

785
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,186
I have something for you.

786
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,583
A few weeks ago,
the President told me

787
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,352
about a dinner
he had at your house.

788
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:25,155
He went on and on about
your Civil War models.

789
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,752
How much fun he had painting
the toy soldiers with you.

790
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,596
This was given to me by the
Director of the Smithsonian.

791
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,830
It's the first Medal of Honor
awarded to a Hispanic-American,

792
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:38,271
Corporal Joseph De Castro.
He fought for the Union.

793
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,276
Linda, I don't know
what to say.

794
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,046
It's clear the President
sees you as a friend.

795
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,343
I've never been
that to him.

796
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,851
But his job is bigger
than friendship.

797
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:53,479
It's bigger than
you and me.

798
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,889
I just hope you'll look out for
him the way I've tried to do.

799
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,621
I will.
And I'll treasure this.

800
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,629
Goodbye,
Mr. Vice President.

801
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:14,535
I've never thought higher of
her than I do at this moment.

802
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,579
She lost,
but she played to win.

803
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,374
Underwood got to Feng.
The refinery's dead.

804
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,817
Grayson played us.

805
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,152
We're running
out of options.

806
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,082
What do you
think, Jean?

807
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,025
Fuck him.

808
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,992
Do it.

809
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,620
Thank you.

810
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,766
Thank you for
doing this, Sandra.

811
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,204
Richard.

812
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,610
 How are you,
Richard?

813
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:31,050
He has his good days and his bad.
This is a good day.

814
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,419
He would love to spend a few minutes
with you after your meeting.

815
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:34,821
Of course.

816
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,289
The reverend's
in here.

817
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,963
Mrs. Walker.
Hello.

818
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,957
Mr. President.

819
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,225
Reverend.

820
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,565
How can I help?

821
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,607
We should really get a
fan in here, Francis.

822
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,010
Well, the AC is all
the way up to full blast.

823
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,742
I mean from the
fumes, the glue.

824
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,751
Oh, that's half the fun.

825
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,248
Megan Hennessey
bailed on us today.

826
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,084
Why?

827
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,686
Her nerves got to her.

828
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,631
And she decided she didn't
want to be in the public eye.

829
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,600
Well, we can sympathize with that.

830
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,703
It's Doug.

831
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,667
Yes?

832
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:29,972
Seth.

833
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,174
I'll call you back.

834
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,642
 When?
