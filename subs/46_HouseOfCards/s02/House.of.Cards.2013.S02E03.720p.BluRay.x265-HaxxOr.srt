1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,974
Raising the age of retirement

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:06,108
is an unacceptable erosion
of the American Dream.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,347
If the Republicans fail to pass
a reasonable Omnibus package

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,683
by demanding
entitlement reform,

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,622
they will force the federal
government into a spending freeze.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:19,130
The frostbite will be on their hands.
Not ours.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,188
Do you think that's a bit much?
The frostbite bit?

8
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,699
Well, it's the State
of the Union, sir.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,291
We want to appeal to
the flyover states.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,462
They'll like
that line.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,199
I want something
more forceful.

12
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,499
 "Blood on their hands"?
 No.

13
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,871
"Throw us back
into the ice age."

14
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,535
Oh, I like that, Christina.
Let's Kw that. Linda.

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,180
Christina,
you come up here, too.

16
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,244

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,159
There are two types
of Vice Presidents.

18
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,161
Doormats and matadors.

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,697
Which do you think
I intend to be?

20
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,229
Raymond.

21
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:01,606
He's hung up on
the domestic agenda.

22
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,333
Not a single word
about China.

23
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,501
His instincts are right.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,670
If the government shuts down
one day after the speech,

25
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,337
not a single word
in the speech matters.

26
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,178
We have to address the freeze now.
China comes later.

27
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,242
Both parties have been wrangling
over entitlements for months.

28
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:19,085
What makes you think a miracle is
gonna happen in the next three days?

29
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,927
We give the Republicans
exactly what they want.

30
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,690
Retirement age'?
Yes.

31
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,856

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,526
That's a line in the sand
we cannot cross.

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,764
We will cross it eventually,
<i>so</i> why keep fighting it?

34
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,736
I can push this
through the Senate.

35
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,968
And once I do, the
President will announce

36
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,568
a major bipartisan agreement
in the State of the Union.

37
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,104
We avoid a government shutdown,
and the White House gets credit.

38
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,877
It's a huge risk.

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,378
And if it fails,
a huge embarrassment.

40
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,388
The embarrassment will
be entirely my own.

41
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,889
This is on
my shoulders.

42
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,253
Even so,

43
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,954
the President is gonna require
some serious persuasion.

44
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,087
I'm happy
to talk to him.

45
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,489
No. No.

46
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,228
I'll do it.

47
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,932
He'll be more amenable if
it comes from a friend.

48
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,305
You're right.
A trusted confidant.

49
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,936
Let me test the waters.

50
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,246
The Cult of Tusk.
Membership, one.

51
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,684
But that one disciple
just so happens to be

52
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,688
the most powerful man
in the free world.

53
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,314
For now.

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,519

The entitlements.

55
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,526
Raising the age
of eligibility to 67.

56
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,890
Your people will
never go for it.

57
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,429
They will if
the leadership does.

58
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,030
And the leadership will.

59
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,066
They fought us on this
since I was in diapers.

60
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,227
Assuming that I can
get this past my people

61
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,395
and convince them,
can you convince yours?

62
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,538
It's a tough sell.

63
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,097
You're the senate
majority leader, Hector.

64
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,767
You don't have to sell.
You can dictate.

65
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,038
What do you want
in return?

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,046
A working government.
We stave off the freeze.

67
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,978
You won on education. We
confirmed you as Vice President.

68
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,210
The Republicans
need a win, Frank.

69
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,150
And that's what
I'm offering.

70
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,653
You get a win
on entitlements.

71
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,882
We avoid a shutdown.

72
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,152
Everyone gets points
for bipartisanship.

73
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,817
You know who
I'm worried about.

74
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,088
Curtis Haas.

75
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,221
He's a troublemaker,
Frank.

76
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,390
Who controls a third
of your caucus.

77
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,831
And he'll never
go for this.

78
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,595
He wants to see
the Democrats suffer.

79
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,568
Just bring him
to the table.

80
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,969
That's all I'm asking.

81
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,613
Miss Gallagher? My
name is Lucas Goodwin.

82
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,481
<i>I'm</i> a deputy <i>editor at
The Washington Herald.</i>

83
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,575
Mr. Goodwin, please.

84
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,950
Just a few moments.
That's all I'm asking.

85
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,183
If I wanted to talk to you, I
would have returned your calls.

86
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,020
Did you read my e-mails? Yes.

87
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,616
Which is why
I didn't call.

88
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,093
Give me a chance to
walk you through it.

89
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,458
I have to get back to the White House.
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,928
Peter Russo was killed. Let go.

91
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,294
So was Zoe Barnes.
I was working with her.

92
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,424
Stop and listen...

93
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,661
Frank Underwood is the
one who did this.

94
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,169
Listen! This is nuts.

95
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,034
The DUI. The BRAC hearings.
All of it was part of...

96
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,539
This has to stop.
Okay?

97
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,506
Did Underwood talk to you? Tell
you not to speak with anybody?

98
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,633
No. 7
Doug Stamper-

99
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,939
Whatever you
think happened,

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,877
whatever compelled you
to stalk me like this...

101
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,778
You're the only person who
might know something.

102
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,842
Who could understand. I've got
no one else I can talk...

103
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,184
I don't understand. And
I don't want to. Okay?

104
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,449
There's no story here.

105
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,616
Please, just
five minutes.

106
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,784
Just think about
what you're doing.

107
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,952
Waiting outside
of a building...

108
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,120
Peter would still be alive if
it wasn't for Frank Underwood.

109
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,731
I've worked really hard
to put Peter behind me.

110
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,366
So, if I see you again,
if I hear from you again,

111
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,802
I'll not only
contact the police.

112
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,704
I'll let the Vice President know
what you're saying about him,

113
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,572
and then you can deal with
the Secret Service, too.

114
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,347
It's the usual
overseas chatter.

115
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,815
Bit of a bump in China, but we chalk
that up to the trade tensions.

116
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,874
Secret Service.

117
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,387
Average number of death threats
to both POTUS and the VP.

118
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,185
We passed them along to our
dear friends at the FBI.

119
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,523
FBI?

120
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,755
The FBI confirms
the level of activity

121
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,491
of our dear friends
at the Secret Service.

122
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,862
We followed up
on everything.

123
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,560
No high-level
threats.

124
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,159
So nothing we need
to report directly

125
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,670
to the President
or Vice President?

126
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,764
No.
Thank you, gentlemen.

127
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,936
The e-mail you sent.
Has anyone else seen it?

128
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,105
Except for the agent
that alerted me, no.

129
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,741
Other agencies might
have stumbled upon this.

130
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,285
Even so, they
probably ignored it.

131
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,546
Any idea who's
making the posts?

132
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,021
Deep Web forums. Almost
impossible to trace.

133
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,250
Lone wolf,
most likely.

134
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,518
I want you
to find him.

135
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,221
We need a direct
threat to life.

136
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,560
The Vice President
just assumed office.

137
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,361
I can't have this conspiracy
stuff going mainstream.

138
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,924
This sort of thing
usually fizzles out...

139
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,469
I can't take the chance.

140
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,970
I want you to find him
and put him away.

141
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,768
He hasn't
committed a crime.

142
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,639
But he wants to.
So help him.

143
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,746
That requires manpower.

144
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,872
You've got men.

145
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,280
It exposes me, Doug.

146
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,782
I've always kept
you informed

147
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,149
because you're an old
pal and I trust you.

148
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,585
But...

149
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,122

150
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,156
We're talking
about an operation.

151
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,957
I'm an old pal who now
works at the White House.

152
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,925
Between old pals,

153
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,669
I've been stuck as the executive
liaison for way too long.

154
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,408
<i>How worried are you that</i>

155
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,410
a mass shooting could happen
in a school in your community?

156
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,937
Great deal, somewhat, not so
much, not at all, unsure?

157
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,848
 <i>You sound hot.
Are you hot?</i>

158
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,010
Sir...

159
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,179
<i>Somewhat hot?
A great deal hot?</i>

160
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,281

161
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,514

162
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,693
 <i>Lynchburg Children's,
Pediatric Division.</i>

163
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,701
Can I talk to Cheryl Posner?

164
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,134
<i>Sorry.
She's on duty right now.</i>

165
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,694
It's her daughter.

166
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,535
<i>Hold on one moment.</i>

167
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,573
Rachel?

168
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,048
<i>Rachel? Sweetheart,
are you there? Please,“...</i>

169
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,887

170
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,157
 <i>Hello?</i>

171
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,753
Hello, Mr. Jay.
My name is Rachel

172
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,922
and I'm calling on behalf

173
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,556
of the National Firearm
Education Center.

174
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,998
Would you be able
to speak with me briefly

175
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,400
regarding firearm legislation

176
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,767
and Second
Amendment protection?

177
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,272
So, you're Willa's
top choice.

178
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,174
Why should you be my
husbands and my top choice?

179
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,907
Over the past 10 years the two
of you combined have gotten

180
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,847
less coverage than the average
junior congressman from Nebraska.

181
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,283
Well, we don't seek
the spotlight

182
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,217
I'm not suggesting
you should.

183
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,017
But am I correct
in assuming

184
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,287
that your husband will be
an active Vice President?

185
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,861
It's harder to keep an active
VP out of the press than in it,

186
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,863
but it's possible
if we give the media

187
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,523
just enough to
keep them from starving.

188
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,029
Where'd you grow up,
Connor?

189
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,297
Texas.
Just like you.

190
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,394
Dallas?
Lubbock.

191
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:57,442
I had a much thicker accent
to get rid of than y'all.

192
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,634
How do you
know I had one?

193
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,074
Your first joint
interview,

194
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,204
when your husband was running
for state assembly in '86.

195
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,276

196
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,141
That's on the Internet?
No. No.

197
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,742
I contacted the local
affiliate in Greenville.

198
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,049
They wouldn't send me
the tapes via mail,

199
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,920
so I went down there
and watched in their vault.

200
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:13,980
To South Carolina?

201
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,284
When I want a job,
I do my homework.

202
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,297
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

203
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,833
Thank you,
Mrs. Underwood.

204
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,468
Thursday.

205
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,252
I don't see how this
is a victory for us.

206
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,754
Our choices
are the freeze,

207
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,586
which the Democrats
get blamed for, or...

208
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,091
Not necessarily.
The Republican...

209
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,025
No, which we definitely
get blamed for.

210
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,322
Or we offer them...

211
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,760
Entitlements, Frank?

212
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,594
We took a stand.
We can't turn back now.

213
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,429
I'd rather see the
government grind to a halt.

214
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,797
Think of the headline,

215
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,201
"Democratic Leadership
Enacts Entitlement Reform,

216
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,036
"Staves Off Freeze.“ We show unity.
We offer progress.

217
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,542
Let's convert some
lifelong conservatives.

218
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,477
You have Mendoza's assurance
he'll work with us?

219
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,846
I do.

220
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,614
I don't want to put
our necks out there

221
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,120
just to have
the guillotine fall.

222
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,451
You won't.

223
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,684
My neck will be right
out there with you.

224
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,056
Oh, Francis faints at
the sight of blood.

225
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,857
He'd never let
them break the skin.

226
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,354
To unity.

227
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,310

228
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,718
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

229
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,918

230
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,553
Larry, can you come by?

231
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,156
Something weird's going
on with my computer.

232
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,224
Thanks.

233
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,578

234
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:19,906
Come on!

235
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,949
Hey, what's
the problem?

236
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,390
Nothing.
It's fine. I fixed it.

237
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,424
Okay. Cool.

238
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,478
It's not <i>as</i> progressive
as I'd like.

239
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,880
You mean radical.

240
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,218
Raising retirement age to 67 makes
entitlements solvent until 2055.

241
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,417
And it saves us
over a trillion dollars

242
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,461
without a single penny
of taxpayer income.

243
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,551
Sixty-eight would give us
another 300 billion.

244
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,926
And I'd like to eliminate
early retirement.

245
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,897
Entirely?
Forget it.

246
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,129
What about 68 and 64'?

247
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,262
I have a responsibility
to my constituents.

248
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,670
I promised l wouldn't
waver when...

249
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,072
Are we really going to
allow the Tea Party

250
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,439
to determine
fiscal legislation?

251
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,944
I've never been beholden
to the Tea Party.

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,741
Oh, come on, Curtis. You
wouldn't have won reelection

253
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,907
if their PACs hadn't dumped
10 million into your campaign.

254
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,349
If their definition of
budgetary conservatism happens

255
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,976
to overlap with mine,
that's a function...

256
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,316
Curtis. Curtis. Let's
show some goodwill.

257
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,413
Can you stomach
68 and 64?

258
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,480
Effective immediately?

259
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,321
Five years from now.
Not interested.

260
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,329
Well, you know we can't throw this
on people without any warning.

261
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,955
They need some
time to digest.

262
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,829
I'm sorry.
I just can't do it.

263
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,267
Okay. Meet with your staff.
Consult with your colleagues.

264
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,308
I'll consult with mine.
And let's talk tomorrow.

265
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,842
All right.
I can agree to that

266
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,002
But this is a
good first step.

267
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,482
How do we make sure
Curtis can't filibuster

268
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,718
when we get
the amendment passed?

269
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:08,792
Assuming we do.

270
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,657
Between you and me, I'm sure
we can turn him around.

271
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,162
I just want to be
on the safe side.

272
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,129
We make sure the passage
of the amendment

273
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,632
constitutes the
passage of the bill.

274
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,167
By previous agreement.
Yeah, that's right.

275
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,294
We pass the amendment, and
then we're done. Wham, ham.

276
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,736
Can we put
that in writing?

277
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:21,965
Have Erikson
reach out to me.

278
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,336
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

279
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:37,913

280
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,387

281
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,891
Lucas Goodwin?

282
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,942
<i>Good evening, Lucas.</i>

283
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,047
<i>Speak into the microphone.</i>

284
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,282
Who are you?

285
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,152
<i>Go to the home screen.
Open the other app.</i>

286
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,218
Tell me who you are.

287
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,325
<i>You've done your research.
You know who I am.</i>

288
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,119
Well, I know
who you claim to be.

289
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:55,296
<i>And if you're not convinced
by now, goodbye,.</i>

290
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,456
Wait.

291
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,397
All right,
I'm on the home screen.

292
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,907
<i>Open the notary app.</i>

293
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,974

294
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,271
What is this?

295
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,644
<i>To ensure you
aren't law enforcement.</i>

296
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,976
I'm... I'm not.

297
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,448
<i>Then sign.</i>

298
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,275
How?

299
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,287
<i>Hold your thumb to the camera
and press "capture?</i>

300
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,350
How do I know you're
not law enforcement?

301
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,088
<i>Sign the document
or walk away.</i>

302
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,126

303
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,798
All right. I did it.

304
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,003
<i>Press “send.”</i>

305
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,000
Where is this going?

306
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,375
<i>I'm VPNing through Iran
and 12 other countries.</i>

307
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,342
<i>Don't worry. It's secure.</i>

308
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,979
<i>Now, one last thing.</i>

309
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,451
<i>I need the hive-step
verification code</i>

310
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,853
<i>for the Heralds
internal servers.</i>

311
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,724
I don't even
know how to do that.

312
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,797
<i>Yes, you do.
Check your e-mail.</i>

313
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,195


314
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,139
<i>Destroy the iPad,
especially the serial number,</i>

315
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,075
<i>and delete the e-mail

316
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,542
<i>Good luck.</i>

317
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,251
Hello?

318
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,486
Raymond, are you there?

319
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,149

320
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,854
Yeah. Uh... Sorry, Frank.

321
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,053
I thought I saw an Inca dove.

322
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,393
<i>Must have ﬂown the wrong
direction for winter.</i>

323
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,399
It sounds windy.
Where are you?

324
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,595
<i>Top of my building-
Got a bird feeder up here.</i>

325
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,066
Nice work with the President.
I hear we have a green light.

326
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,667
He pushed back in the
beginning, but yeah.

327
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,839
His writers are reworking
the speech now.

328
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,510
I'm very close to a deal.
68164 in five years.

329
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,212
Spending cuts as discussed.

330
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,583
Is that rock solid?

331
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,715
<i>Soon as we shake hands.</i>

332
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,020
What's the hold-up?

333
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,220
Curtis Haas,
which isn't a surprise.

334
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,059
I'm meeting with him soon.
He's the final hurdle.

335
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,462
<i>Cutting it
pretty close, Frank.</i>

336
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,228
Well, this is historic.

337
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,897
The Republicans have wanted
entitlement reform since Johnson.

338
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,634
Curtis will come around.

339
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:20,074
<i>In the meantime, we should get the
new retirement ages into the speech,</i>

340
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,373
I would stay away from
the specifics, Frank.

341
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,711
I mean, even if it passes,
the House might...

342
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,376
I know the House better than
you know birds, Raymond.

343
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,250
Believe me when I say they'll
pass the Senate version.

344
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,891
I'll talk 10
the President.

345
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,425
Just make sure
this is airtight.

346
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,653
Thank you.

347
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,921
What is it'?

348
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,486
Lucas Goodwin.

349
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,257
<i>From the Herald.</i>

350
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,890
He must have been
working with Zoe.

351
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,956
How much does he know?

352
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,728
No more than she did.

353
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,236
She knew enough.

354
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,136
I'm on it, sir.
Proof?

355
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,072
Not yet.
Jesus, Doug.

356
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,475
It's under control. I just
thought you should be aware.

357
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,843
I'm juggling the President, the
Republicans, Tusk. I can't...

358
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,143
And you should
stay focused on that

359
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,582
Goodwin's on my plate.
Not yours.

360
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,681
It wasn't until
the 20th century

361
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,589
that the notion of noble objectivism
came into the forefront.

362
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,822
Whoa! But facts
are facts.

363
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,098
1992. Fact,

364
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,033
George Bush, Sr. is shown asking
how a grocery scanner works,

365
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,000
and he gets
nailed for it.

366
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,039
Fact? They were showing
him a new model.

367
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,667
He was asking how the new one
was different than the old one.

368
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,336
Curiosity, not ignorance.

369
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,474
But the lack of context told
a more powerful narrative.

370
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,615
There is no arrangement of facts
that is purely objective.

371
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,216
We can finally do something.
We have the means to act.

372
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,884
Some teenage
pimple-faced hacker...

373
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,792
This was a sophisticated
infiltration.

374
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,855
It's not the work of a child.
Look. Here's the e-mail.

375
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,859
Heronymous Bot. The FBl's
been hunting him for years.

376
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,360
Lucas, listen to me...

377
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,804
If we get these records, I'll need
your help tracking timelines,

378
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,398
piecing together the chronology...
No.

379
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,703
You want somebody
to hold your hand

380
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,144
and say it's okay to go on
this fucking goose chase.

381
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,308
You shouldn't be teaching in Ithaca.
You're better than that.

382
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,009
You should be back home...
I belong here.

383
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,985
Droning on to a bunch of
hungover English majors?

384
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,215
Exactly. You're wrong
about the truth.

385
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,053
There is objective truth.
He killed her.

386
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,926
You know it's a fact.

387
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,988
Here's a fact. My mom has
10, 15 years left, at best.

388
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,263
I've seen her more in the past month
than since I left for school.

389
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,201
It's simpler here.
It's quiet.

390
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,672
I need that.
She needs me.

391
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:41,015
I'm sorry, Lucas. I'm sorry
that night howl reacted.

392
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,910
I'm sorry you
lost your girlfriend.

393
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,720
I'm sorry the world is this fucked up.
I really am.

394
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,454
But I can't help you.

395
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,969
Where's everyone else?

396
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,911
I did you a
disservice yesterday.

397
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,246
We shouldn't have put you on the
spot in front of all the leadership.

398
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,443
Have a seat, Curtis.

399
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,757
We know that you have an
obligation to take a firm stance.

400
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,320
But entitlement reform
is something you ran on.

401
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,763
And now it's
within your grasp.

402
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,628
So tell us your fears.

403
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,232
That the Democrats get another win.
We suffer in the midterms.

404
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,071
And the next Congress
dismantles the agreement.

405
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,008
You think we're
being disingenuous.

406
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,512
My constituents don't trust
the administration.

407
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,014
I can't have them thinking the
wool's been pulled over our eyes.

408
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,641
As I suspected.

409
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,984
Hector?

410
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,486
Frank and I
propose this,

411
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,853
we include a super
majority point of order

412
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,948
against revisiting
the issue for 10 years.

413
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,085
You have it in
black and white.

414
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,288
A serious,
long-term commitment

415
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,694
with no opportunity
to dismantle.

416
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,323
And that's on top of
everything else we asked for.

417
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,459
VA services and FEMA
stay at current levels.

418
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,971
Everything else at 80 to 100%
of the cuts you propose.

419
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:13,306
You get your win, Curtis.
We just avoid disaster.

420
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,809
Maybe the country needs to see
what disaster looks like.

421
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:21,173
The Tea Party has a strong
voice, and you're its bullhorn.

422
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,787
Show your people that voice
can translate into law

423
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,983
and not just
add to the noise.

424
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,190
Fifteen years before revisitation.
Not 10.

425
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,855
Okay.

426
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,127
And if the House fails to
pass the bill after we do,

427
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,171
you go on record blaming your
own party for the gridlock.

428
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,040
I believe we have a deal.

429
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,912

430
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,725
What are you
listening to?

431
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:05,818
I'm sorry. I'll turn...

432
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,388
No, it's nice.
Can I listen?

433
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,066
My ears are clean.
I promise.

434
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,768

435
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,031
Thanks.

436
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,547
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

437
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,381
It's so sad.

438
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,114
It helps me relax.

439
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,255
Long day?

440
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:40,586
I work at a call center. So, yeah.
200 strangers an hour.

441
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,291
I'll leave you alone. You probably
don't want lo talk lo another one.

442
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,963
Ifs all right. As long as
you don't hang up on me.

443
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,642
Do you ever just talk to them?
The strangers?

444
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,910
We're not allowed to.

445
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,311
All I would want to do is ask
them about who they are.

446
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,912
What about you?
What do you do?

447
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,747
I, um...

448
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,453
I work at the bookstore
and the daycare center.

449
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,256
I had that same
look on my face

450
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:12,227
the first time somebody
handed me one of those.

451
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,128
Yeah, I'm... I'm just...
I'm not religious.

452
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,723
Just keep it. Check it out.
Or don't.

453
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,938
We've got really
good music there.

454
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,299
Thank you.

455
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,256
We sent a bill
to the Senate.

456
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,588
What Frank wants to send back
bears zero resemblance.

457
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,753
Because it's bipartisan.
Unlike ours.

458
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,160
That sounds like something
Frank would say.

459
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,286
I'm not Frank.

460
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,696
He has a desk
in your office.

461
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,759
If this bill
passes in the Senate...

462
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,859
It won't.

463
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,268
We should be
prepared, Bob.

464
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,675
Well, I'm prepared
to wait and see.

465
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,346
Have a good
afternoon, ladies.

466
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,274

467
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,476
"Ladies"?

468
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,109
He's threatened.
He's a pig.

469
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,619
Give him time.
He used to have two

470
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,019
white middle-aged
guys at his side.

471
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:13,181
Now he's got a black guy...

472
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,814
And a woman
20 years his junior.

473
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,860
Who knows how
to shoot a rifle.

474
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,394
We just need
to keep at him.

475
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:20,788
Yes?

476
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,390
 <i>Catalina Rodriguez
is on line four.</i>

477
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,531
Give me a moment.

478
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,871
Catalina.

479
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,878
Ted <i>told</i> me <i>it</i> was you.

480
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,816
<i>You there?</i>

481
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,216
Yes, I'm here.

482
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,412
<i>The press won't
leave us alone.</i>

483
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,319
<i>For weeks they're showing up,</i>

484
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,483
<i>trying to get pictures
of me and Emily.</i>

485
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,821
It wasn't me.

486
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,555
<i>You're the
only one who knew.</i>

487
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,498
I don't know how
the story got out.

488
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,226
<i>Why would Ted
lie about that?</i>

489
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,564
I don't know.
Maybe he's ashamed.

490
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,865
So <i>what do I do? When
will they leave us alone?</i>

491
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,669
I don't know, Catalina.

492
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,607
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

493
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,207
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

494
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,341

495
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,449
How is Emily doing?

496
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,890
Catalina?

497
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,367
He's very confident.

498
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,928
Yeah, but does he
have what it takes?

499
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,440
We'll see when I
get his media plan.

500
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,634
What about
his personality?

501
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,769
Charming. Direct.

502
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,404
Very thorough.

503
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,813
He found our first interview
together, in '86.

504
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,944
I would love to see that.
Does he have a copy?

505
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,751
I don't think so. The TV station
made him watch it there.

506
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,452
We should screen that for the
President and the First Lady.

507
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,925
Show 'em
how it's done.

508
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,224
Christina...
What about her?

509
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,892
Have you noticed anything strange
between her and the President?

510
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,230
How do you mean?

511
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,004
I passed them
in the hall yesterday.

512
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:12,837
And they seem... I don't know...
Very intimate.

513
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,946
They did seem cozy
at the prep session.

514
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:17,905
Do you think...

515
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,247
No. Not necessarily.

516
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,582
An interesting
thought, though.

517
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,815
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
We're having lunch.

518
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:26,981
The Republicans
are backing out.

519
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,081
Mendoza's chief of staff
just gave me the heads-up.

520
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,355
Get Mendoza on the phone.
It's Curtis Haas.

521
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,259
He got cold feet.

522
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,364
LARRY: Keep them in cages.

523
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,992
It's really kinda like marine,
but people look at them.

524
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,934
It's kind of fun.

525
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,666
I got your e-mail.
Now good for you?

526
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,434
Yeah, sure. Can I
call you right back?

527
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,635

528
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,507
What exactly did
you need to know?

529
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,012
We're doing some follow-up pieces
on the cyber warfare thing.

530
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,174
I just wanted to get
a layman's understanding

531
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,546
of how the Chinese might
get through a firewall.

532
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,018
It's a bit complicated, but I
could show you the basics.

533
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,350
That's all I need.

534
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,460

535
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,157

536
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,865
We use a standard
N-tier architecture.

537
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,535
Think of it like a big
sandwich with layers of bread.

538
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:25,410
Between each is the lettuce, the
tomato, the roast beef, whatever.

539
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,747
What I'm pulling up here
is the org code,

540
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,012
which separates
the database...

541
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,316
Shit. I forgot there's a meeting
with sales in a couple minutes.

542
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,481
You want to do this later?

543
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,718
No. I'll just run over and let them
know I'll be a few minutes late.

544
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,054
Be right back.

545
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,355
Cool. I'll be here.

546
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,535
Okay.

547
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,438
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

548
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,009

549
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,178
There.

550
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,725
Come on.

551
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,596
Okay.

552
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,768

553
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,478
Delete.

554
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,413
Go.

555
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,545
Something wrong?

556
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,453
Can't find my phone. It's weird.
I had it just a minute ago.

557
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,786
Oh!

558
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,497
Here it is.
Sorry about that

559
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,931
No problem.

560
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,832
So the N-tier architecture.

561
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,132
The high-tech sandwich
I was talking about.

562
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,502
 I thought Mendoza
was willing to work with us.

563
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,577
He is. The problem is Curtis Haas.
Mmm-mmm.

564
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,135
And have you
spoken with him?

565
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:05,841
His office isn't returning our calls.
Neither is Mendoza's.4.

566
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,178
I should've
stuck to my guns.

567
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,480
The vote isn't until
tomorrow afternoon.

568
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,350
I'll reach out to Mendoza
first thing in the...

569
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,479
This is the State of
the Union, Frank.

570
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,581
I won't be
left in limbo.

571
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,253
If we need to start
rewriting that speech now,

572
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,956
I don't want to
waste a minute.

573
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,159
I can turn this around, sir.

574
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,962
You know, Raymond told
me this was your idea.

575
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,697
To pursue
this compromise.

576
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,430
I suggested it
as an option.

577
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,201
He said you
bullied him into it.

578
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,367
That he thought
it was a mistake.

579
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,607
If he felt so strongly, he should
have advised you otherwise.

580
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,115
Raymond is
not a politician.

581
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,049
He relies on our
political expertise

582
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,120
as much as we rely
on his business acumen.

583
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,713
Maybe we shouldn't point fingers
until there's a problem.

584
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,553
You wouldn't
call this a problem?

585
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:51,491
Not if it's solved
before it becomes one.

586
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,626
You see, I wanted a vice president
who can manage Congress.

587
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,998
Not one who bites off
more than he can chew.

588
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:01,229
Then have faith you made
the right choice, sir.

589
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:04,637
Whatever faith I have
is quickly evaporating.

590
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,405
Don't humiliate
the administration, Frank.

591
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,706
You're part of it now.

592
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,678
Yes, sir.

593
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,641
We're done.

594
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,049
Thank you,
Mr. President.

595
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,421

596
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,685

597
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,159
Give me the
private line, please.

598
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,686
Tusk is blocking my way.
Goodwin at my heels.

599
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,664
There can be no
false steps now.

600
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,396
The higher up the mountain,
the more treacherous the path.

601
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,270
 Lucas Goodwin
went up to visit her.

602
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,272
They may be
looking for you.

603
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,071
Nobody's contacted me. I don't
think anyone knows I'm here.

604
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,339
Then we need to make
sure it stays that way.

605
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,211
Don't speak to anyone
you don't have to.

606
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,409
Don't go anywhere
you don't need to be.

607
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,609

608
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,745
Tell me you heard what I said.
I heard you. I get it.

609
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,381

610
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,697
I'm fine.

611
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,438
Put some ice on it.
I said it's okay.

612
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,405
What is this?

613
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,634
What, are you going
through my garbage now?

614
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,810
Someone gave it
to me on the bus.

615
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,483
You let me know
if anyone contacts you.

616
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,185
Hey- Hey-

617
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,694
Sorry I'm late.
No worries.

618
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,646
How much more
you want to do right now?

619
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,737
Fill in this area?

620
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,976
Yeah. And one more
poppy down here.

621
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,485
That's a lot for one sitting.
I know.

622
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,044
Okay.

623
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,923

624
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,392

625
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,047
Francis?

626
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,227
You're heading in?

627
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,925
Mendoza's
an early riser.

628
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,736
You'll figure this out.

629
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,602
I need to prove what the Vice
President is capable of.

630
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:00,135
Don't prove it to them.
Prove it to me.

631
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,745
Curtis has me by the
tea bags, Frank.

632
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,250
I don't have a working
majority without him.

633
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,649
He wasn't elected leader.

634
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,879
True. But I have
to pick my battles.

635
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,889
If you can't control him
on budgetary issues...

636
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,789
It's not just him. It's the 15
senators he has under his thumb.

637
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,622
I won't be the leader next
year if they turn on me.

638
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,321
So he wants to be courted.
Sit him down...

639
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,455
I already tried talking to him.
He wouldn't budge.

640
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:23,555
Then we'll both
talk to him.

641
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,726
He's made his
position clear.

642
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,632
We all shook hands
at this table.

643
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,328
The most I can do is put
the substitute amendment

644
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,666
on the floor
with limited debate.

645
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:33,072
Now, your people can say whatever
they want for the record.

646
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,439
But we're gonna vote
the amendment down.

647
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,605
I am not interested
in symbolic gestures.

648
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,144
Well, that's
all I can offer.

649
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,980
Where's your courage?

650
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,421
My power has limits, Frank.

651
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,754
Five Republicans makes you
the deciding vote.

652
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,087
Now, it's highly doubtful

653
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,253
we can get them to vote
against their own party.

654
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,263
But they might abstain.
You'd need 10.

655
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,265
 Entitlement is the
Republicans' white whale.

656
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,595
I can get at least
two of 'em to flip.

657
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,499
And you'd only
need six abstaining.

658
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,434
 Erikson's already making calls.
 Donner?

659
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,528
 And Pulaski.
All right.

660
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,265
Get me a call list so I
can tag-team with him.

661
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,002
 Got it right here.

662
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,633
We have
to get medieval.

663
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,110
When it comes to
parliamentary procedure,

664
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,475
there's not a rule
I don't know, sir.

665
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,515
Find me the ones
we can bend.

666
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,278
 Mark,
you're a sensible man.

667
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:20,719
Yes, I know...
I understand.

668
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,656
What if... Tell you what.

669
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,696
What if both VA hospitals in
your district...

670
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,789
Yes, both of them.
Hold on. Who?

671
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,299
Moriarty. I promised
him an amendment

672
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,733
for his bovine
research center.

673
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:33,825
That makes six.

674
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,169
Mark, if I can get you funding
for both, are you with us?

675
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,973
Excellent.

676
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,237
Well, you come by
the White House

677
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,334
and have lunch with me sometime soon.
Bye-bye.

678
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,641
We have the numbers.

679
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,206
Once you break the quorum call,
it's gonna be a little tricky.

680
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,476
Tell me on the way.

681
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,682
ISAACS: Sir. Sir.
We might not have a majority.

682
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:53,984
What?

683
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,515
The Dems are poaching people.
Donner, Pulaski. Maybe more.

684
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,686
Voting for
the amendment?

685
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,058
Some.
Others abstaining.

686
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,152
I'm still trying
to figure out who.

687
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,324
Well, we need to delay and figure
out what the fuck's going on.

688
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,026
Quorum call.

689
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,933
There's 49 hours
until the recess.

690
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,264
We call a name an hour. Yeah.

691
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,212
 Mr. Avendale?
AVENDALE: Here.

692
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,594
Excuse me. I do believe
you're sitting in my chair.

693
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,701
Mr. Drewry, what is
the order of business?

694
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,398
We are in a
quorum call, sir.

695
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,442
Then why aren't
you calling the roll?

696
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,034
We are, sir.
In a deliberate manner.

697
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,135
Let's speed it up.

698
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,746
Mr. Brown?
Here.

699
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,714
More expeditious
than that.

700
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,776
Mr. Burr?
Here.

701
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:58,877
Ms. Cantwell?
Here.

702
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,921
Mr. Cerini?

703
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,049

704
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,224
Cornwall?
Here.

705
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,821
Mr. Colson?
Here.

706
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,991
Ms. Dauster.
Here.

707
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,896
They have a quorum.
We don't have the numbers.

708
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,938
Out. Let's get
all our people out.

709
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,065
Mr. Dammeral. Mr. Darling.
DARLING: Here.

710
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,473
Mr. Daswani. Mr. Donner.
 Here.

711
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,102
Faster.
Mr. Dobbins, Mr. Dwyer.

712
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,006
Engel, Erikson.
Here.

713
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,482
Felp.

714
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:29,574
Ferrison.

715
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:30,909
Gentry.

716
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,145
Mr. Haas.

717
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,952
Whitehouse.
Here.

718
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,087
Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wyden.

719
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,963
Mr. President,
a quorum is not present

720
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,465
The chair recognizes the
minority leader, Mr. Erikson.

721
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,103
Mr. President, "I move to
direct the Sergeant-at-Arms

722
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,875
"to compel the attendance
of absent Senators,

723
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,816
"that warrants for the arrests of
all senators not sick nor excused

724
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,549
"be issued under the signature
of the presiding officer."

725
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,817
The question is on the motion.
All those in favor say "Aye."

726
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,053
 Aye.  All
those opposed, "Nay."

727
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,219
 Nay.

728
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,625
The ayes have it, and the
motion is agreed to.

729
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,131
The Sergeant-of-Arms is hereby
instructed to compel the attendance

730
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,723
of absent senators.

731
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,700

732
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,472
It feels good to
be back in Congress.

733
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,913
<i>The Democrats have
now empowered the Capitol Police</i>

734
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,211
<i>to arrest absent members
if necessary,.</i>

735
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,752
<i>According to Republican
Senator Curtis Haas,</i>

736
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,846
<i>one of the staunchest opponents
of the entitlement amendment,</i>

737
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:44,086
<i>the vice president is, quote,
"Replacing democracy with tyranny.</i>

738
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,425
<i>"He's transformed the Senate into a
police state within the Capitol.“</i>

739
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,020
But...

740
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:52,227
Well, it'll be even harder
to stay out of the news now.

741
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,667
Then why the
joint interview?

742
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,933
I watched the South
Carolina one again.

743
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,407
Convinced them to make me a copy.
It's powerful.

744
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,603
Here you go. I thought
you might want it.

745
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,678
There's a moment where you ran
your fingers through his hair.

746
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,684
It's intimate and human.

747
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,016
That moment alone would've made
me want to vote for your husband.

748
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,587
Something like
that will buy you

749
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,522
months of flying
beneath the radar.

750
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,357
And who do you have in mind
to conduct the interview?

751
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,358
Does this mean
I have the job?

752
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,131
It means you still
haven't been ruled out.

753
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,599
Well, I'll consider
that progress.

754
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,137

755
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,424
This is the Democratic
cloak room, Hector.

756
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,830
Yours is on
the other side.

757
00:40:57,922 --> 00:40:59,094
What you're
doing won't work.

758
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,630
It might. Which is why you
made the long walk over here.

759
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,831
Ice water?

760
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,672
I have my people in planes,
trains, and automobiles.

761
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,939
All I need is six
to make my quorum.

762
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:14,677
Think what I can do with 26 votes.
And I've got 45.

763
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,753
You won't be able to get your planes
and trains back here fast enough.

764
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,947
I'll roll those dice.

765
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,023
The Sergeant-at-Arms
is very good at his job.

766
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:27,028
And this is a perfect way to
show Curtis who's in charge.

767
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,097
I'm doing you
a favor, Hector.

768
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,860
Tell me what you want.

769
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,492
What I've always wanted. The
package we shook hands on.

770
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,764
Then I'll give you
your Senate back.

771
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,364
They can't come
back voluntarily.

772
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,340
Pick your six best actors.

773
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,975
We can't give in,
Hector.

774
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,380
We wouldn't be in this situation
had you toed the party line.

775
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,453
 Mr. Mendoza
is present.

776
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,114
 Under protest.

777
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,623
 Ms. Cornwall
is present.

778
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,125
Under protest.

779
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,219
 Mr. Ullman is present.
Mr. Walsh is present.

780
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,855
Ms. Dauster is present.
And Mr. Haas is present

781
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,560
Mr. President,
a quorum is now present.

782
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,170
You can pass the amendment. I'll
just filibuster the main bill.

783
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,569
No, you won't.

784
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,798
Watch me.

785
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,741
As much as I'd like to see you
hold your piss for two days,

786
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,208
we struck a
deal with Hector.

787
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,074
ERIKSON: The passage
of the substitute amendment

788
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:20,149
constitutes passage
of the main bill.

789
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,342
I wasn't informed of that.

790
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,317
Pay attention to
the fine print, Curtis.

791
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,876
It's far more important
than the selling price.

792
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:28,321
Let's go. I want an
immediate call of the roll.

793
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,881
Don't let half a second pass.
Yes, sir.

794
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,858
A quorum is present.

795
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,486
The question is
on the adoption

796
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,553
of the substitute
amendment to HR 934.

797
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,098
The yeas and nays
have been ordered,

798
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,565
and the clerk
will call the roll.

799
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,397
 Mr. Abner?
Aye.

800
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,061
Mr. Avendale?
Aye.

801
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:43,228
 Mr. Brown?

802
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,204
I'd like to propose
an amendment to HR 93...

803
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:47,675
Mr. Haas, you are out of order.
The roll call has begun.

804
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,439
The clerk will continue
to call the roll.

805
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,740
 Mr. Brown? Mr. Burr?
 Aye.

806
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,406
Ms. Cantwell?
Aye.

807
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:54,744
Mr. Cerini?
Aye.

808
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,079
Mr. Chess?
Aye.

809
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,586
Ms. Cornwall?
Nay.

810
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,710
Mr. Colson?

811
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:04,124

Hey.

826
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,410
I'm glad you came.

827
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,953
Yeah. Me, too.

828
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,249
What'd you think?

829
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,816
The music was
really beautiful.

830
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,588
Not what you expected?

831
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,495
I wasn't sure
what to expect.

832
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:17,991
I'm Lisa.

833
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:21,335
Rachel. Sorry.
No.

834
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,095
We've got cookies
and cake inside, if you...

835
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,540
Oh, I think I'm gonna...

836
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,269
If you want to meet
some of my friends...

837
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,170
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah?

838
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,146
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

839
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:41,450
We should add "miracle worker"
to your resume, Frank.

840
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,321
Lazarus makes
for a good magic act,

841
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,621
but life would
have been a lot easier

842
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,628
if the bastard hadn't died
in the first place.

843
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,357

844
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,228
Well, the President wanted lo go
ballistic, but I calmed him down.

845
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,665
<i>I said, "Don't worry.
Frank'll pull this out."</i>

846
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:54,725
Did you?

847
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,335
<i>I don't blame you for being
two-faced, Raymond.</i>

848
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,204
It's good politics, <i>as</i> long as
you don't get caught at it.

849
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,533
Now, Frank,
if you think that I...

850
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:05,170
It's okay, Raymond. Jesus forgives you.
Good night.

851
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,401

852
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,732
Hello?

853
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:35,402
Hello?

854
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,675
Care for some wine?

855
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,242
No.

856
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,855
Step in the room.

857
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,529
Closer. Closer.

858
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,228
State your name and the date.
Wait, why? I...

859
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,932
State your name
and the date, please.

860
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,773
Lucas Goodwin.
February 13th.

861
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,469
Year.

862
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,047
2014.

863
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,944
Are you currently or have you
ever been a member of...

864
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,039
What is this?

865
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,141
Are you currently
or have you ever been

866
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,049
a member of any law
enforcement agency?

867
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,383
I already told
you I wasn't.

868
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,047
Two-step verification.

869
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,917
No, I'm not.
And I haven't.

870
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,551
Are you currently
or have you ever been

871
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,754
an informant for
law enforcement?

872
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:27,887
No.

873
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,056
You think you might
have been followed?

874
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,394
Anything strange
the past few weeks?

875
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,229
You know what? This is making
me feel uncomfortable.

876
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,394
We're not fucking
around here.

877
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:36,967
If you think the FBI hasn't
been tracking your posts,

878
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,631
then you're naive.

879
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,333
You think they
know who I am?

880
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,312
No. You hid yourself well.

881
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,812
What are you going to
do with the Herald?

882
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,077
Nothing. Then why did
you want access?

883
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,346
I already had access.

884
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:51,818
It's how I contacted you
in the first place.

885
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,113
Just needed to know
if you were serious.

886
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,190
That's Cashew.

887
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,995

888
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:06,493
Why did you
contact me?

889
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:10,938
Because you're desperate.

890
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,769
And I'm not
fond of authority.

891
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,437
<i> Just today, under the
leadership of Vice President Underwood,</i>

892
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,777
<i>the Senate passed HR 934,</i>

893
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,185
<i>along with an historic
entitlement reform amendment.</i>

894
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,648
<i>By raising the retirement
age to 68 and 64,</i>

895
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:33,355
<i>for normal and early
retirement, respectively,</i>

896
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:38,127
<i>we will ensure entitlements
for generations to come,.</i>

897
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,559

898
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,144
<i>And when the House passes
that bill in</i> a <i>few weeks,</i>

899
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,147
<i>as I fully expect it to do,</i>

900
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,979
<i>we will put the
government freeze to rest.</i>

901
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,153
<i>We will continue the business
of sewing our country,</i>

902
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,417
<i>rather than paralyzing it.</i>

903
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:04,152
<i>The American people
deserve no less.</i>

904
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,220
<i>We stand at the altar
of democracy,</i>

905
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:11,356
<i>Let us stand together.</i>

906
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,060

907
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,237
I spoke to Jackie. You have
my support in the House.

908
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,609
But it hasn't
passed the House yet.

909
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:28,343
There's along march before it
arrives on the President's desk.

910
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:32,377
As for me, I used to be
on the edge of the frame.

911
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:35,720
Now I'm only
three feet away.
