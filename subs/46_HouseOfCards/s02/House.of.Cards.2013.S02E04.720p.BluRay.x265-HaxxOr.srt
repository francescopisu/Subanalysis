3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,616
Strange not seeing
your name up there.

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,553
"To improve is to change."

5
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,062
"To perfect is
to change often."

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,161
You know your Churchill.

7
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,700
It's inscribed on the watch you gave
me when I left for Glendon Hill.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,031
Was it? Nancy arranges
all the gifts.

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,127
She knows you well.

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,332
As much as I am
enjoying this little...

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,467
I got you two more votes.
Partridge and Krauss.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,576
Is this Raymond's way of
extending an olive branch?

13
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:36,714
It's a start.

14
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,716
Two votes is a twig.
It's not a branch.

15
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,808
Which is why I'm here.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,354
Well, the vote's at 5:00.

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,718
We have less
than three hours.

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,189
Two hours and 49 minutes. We
have made more happen in less.

19
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:49,983
Is that the watch'?

20
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,318
No. Ifs nicer.

21
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,328
So, why did Raymond
have a change of heart'?

22
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,494
If the government grinds to a
halt, that benefits no one.

23
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,394
We want the President
focused on China,

24
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,666
not distracted by
furloughs and protests.

25
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,339
You take direction
from Jacqueline.

26
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,908
She's not gonna
like that very much.

27
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,842
Bossing you around?
Having me around.

28
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,114
Oh, I don't blame her.

29
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,181
Ashleigh will start the
interview with questions about

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,720
how you and your husband
met, your early marriage.

31
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,754
Fine.

32
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,584
Then she'll move on to
more specific questions

33
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,386
about your recent transition.

34
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,556
All right.

35
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,764
She's gonna ask about
you having no children.

36
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,594
I thought we'd agreed
to take that off the table.

37
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,724
We did.
But they insisted.

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,701
Now I can speak to Ashleigh
directly and fight for...

39
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,704
No. It's fine. I've been
asked the question before.

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,761
I know how
to answer it.

41
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,862
It'll be quick
and painless.

42
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,876
And I'll confirm that with
Ashleigh when she gets here.

43
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,933
I like it.

44
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,706
Maybe something
less neutral.

45
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,870
I'm sure you'll look good
in whatever you choose.

46
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,610
I'll be downstairs.

47
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,080
Disori owes you for
the overpass funding you secured.

48
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,317
 Yes, he does.

49
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll call him.
Where's Doug?

50
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,594
He's doing the rounds, making
sure our hard-won stay hard.

51
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,326
Birch and Womack are doing the same.
But we're still 15 short.

52
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,568
 Got relationships
with most of these folks.

53
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,601
Money's not enough. I already
tried the D-trip route.

54
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,801
Retirement age is the main
sticking point, correct?

55
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,238
Old people vote.

56
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,443
I'll target the AARP. That'll
take most of the heat off.

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,241
We're wasting time.
I gotta get to work.

58
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,940
Take Remy with you.

59
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,347
Shouldn't we
divide and conquer?

60
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,013
It's harder to say no
twice than once.

61
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,143
 I'll stay
out of your way.

62
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,619
Like you did on
the Watershed Act?

63
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,179
We're on the same side
of the fence this time.

64
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,780
You're late to the party.

65
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,292
Well, think of Remy
as the guy

66
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,329
who shows up with a six-pack after
the liquor store is closed.

67
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,692
Who's on your plate?

68
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,026
Donald Blythe.

69
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,367
Do you really think that's
the best use of your time?

70
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,493
 lf l can get him
to turn his people.

71
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,003
That's a lot of eggs
to put in one basket

72
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,536
We only have one basket.

73
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,343
Jacqueline, may I use your
office, for old times' sake?

74
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,010
I serve at the pleasure
of the Vice President.

75
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,973

76
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,485
Two hours and 17 minutes.

77
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:00,685
Normally, all I need to sway Donald
Blythe is patience and time,

78
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,852
neither of which
I have right now.

79
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,225
Tick took.

80
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,453
Donald.

81
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,164
Good to see you.
Mr. Vice President.

82
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,395
Please, it's always
"Frank" to you.

83
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,630
I came because
you asked me,

84
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,603
but don't mistake
that for false hope.

85
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,299
If you have other people
to lobby, you should.

86
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,397
Ten minutes.

87
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,738
It won't change anything.

88
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,109
Well, at the very least,
enjoy the free coffee.

89
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,306
I don't drink caffeine.

90
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,279
Then decaf.
Still has caffeine.

91
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,975
Well, enjoy
the free oxygen.

92
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,313
It's gets stuffy over there
in the Longworth Building.

93
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,785
Coffee for me, and...

94
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,117
Seltzer water,
if you have it.

95
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,953
I'm sure we do.

96
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:21,593
Now I can understand
if you might hold a grudge.

97
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,163
I don't hold
grudges, Frank.

98
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,430
I just don't negotiate with people
who are fundamentally deceptive.

99
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,166
I never lied
to you, Donald.

100
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,867
You promised to seek my counsel,
which you never once did.

101
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,342
We had to move the Education
Bill in a direction

102
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,537
I knew would
make you unhappy.

103
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,806
I saw no reason
to frustrate...

104
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,507
You eviscerated
the unions.

105
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,277
You federalized
performance standards.

106
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,340
If we hadn't done that,

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,612
the bill would've
been dead in the water.

108
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,621
And now you want to cut the
pathetic level of funding

109
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,849
you did manage to pass.

110
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,156
Isn't some funding
better than none?

111
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,394
A flat line will send a louder
message than life support.

112
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,523
Look, I'm impressed with the little
coalition that you've cobbled together.

113
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,364
But we...
Not so little.

114
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,732
Twenty-eight votes.

115
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,564
And you need them all.

116
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,236
Well, really only half.

117
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,402
Half of zero
is still zero.

118
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,308
I had to pull every
trick in the book

119
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,540
to get Entitlement
through the Senate.

120
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,843
If it fails in the House,
we don't get a round two.

121
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,213
This is a one-time deal.

122
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,308
It should never have passed
the Senate to begin with.

123
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,581
Can we start over?

124
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,818
May I offer you an apology?

125
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,251
Deaf ears, Frank.

126
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,593
I withdrew myself from
the Education fight,

127
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,393
and that is
my cross to bear.

128
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,025
But I will be damned if I will
make the same mistake twice.

129
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,503
This sort of stubbornness makes
you no better than the Tea Party.

130
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,341
Except for the fact that we
happen to be right.

131
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,844
Just a few
more minutes, Donald.

132
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,110
You haven't even had
your seltzer yet.

133
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,179
They have seven other data centers
spread across the Northeast.

134
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,581
 Those aren't
good odds.

135
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,620
Well, if we
can access one,

136
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,018
I should be able to
talk to the other seven.

137
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,250
And they all
look like that,

138
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,916
Fort Knox wrapped
in a nuclear bunker.

139
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,085
How do we get in?

140
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,593
Well, we don't.

141
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:58,685
You do.

142
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,422
What?

143
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,899
How'? What's my reason?

144
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,097
You're writing a story
on cyberterrorism.

145
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,226
It's free publicity.

146
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,271
But if they're
so secure, I'm...

147
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,102
They give tours all the time,
mostly to prospective clients.

148
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,368
Then why haven't you
done it yourself?

149
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,572
Because I run
a white hat firm.

150
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,443
And if I were to show up in the
tour logs before a breach,

151
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,537
it would raise alarms.

152
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,319
Okay, once I'm in?

153
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,922
These are what
the servers look like.

154
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,823
You're gonna get inside
one of these cages.

155
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,223
You will have this.

156
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,160
You slide it
into the server.

157
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,063
Voilà.

158
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,288
It's that simple?

159
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,560
Yeah. Well, your part,
not mine.

160
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,261
The codes
extremely complex.

161
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,633
How do I do it without
them noticing?

162
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,296
How you get good
at anything?

163
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,900
Practice makes perfect.

164
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,857
We've got a problem.

165
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,824
Everyone,
stop what you're doing,

166
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,595
head into the nearest
office and shut the door.

167
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,864
You, stay exactly
where you are.

168
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,503
Retirement age
is a done deal,

169
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,707
but I might be able to redistribute
some appropriations...

170
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,181
That's not
what I'm after.

171
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,014
You can't fix a
wrecked car with new hubcaps.

172
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,144
How about a sister bill,

173
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,121
one that focuses
entirely on education?

174
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,988
My coalition is fighting for
the integrity of the party.

175
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,822
We're not just focused on education.
I'm sorry, Donald.

176
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,624
Excuse me for a moment.

177
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,725
Nancy, I said
no interrup...

178
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,525
When?

179
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,468
But the vote is
in less than an hour.

180
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,830
I don't care
what protocol it...

181
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,376
Quarantine. There's white
powder in the mail.

182
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,466
We're locked in?

183
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,244
<i>Sir! Close the door now!</i>

184
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,873
<i>Look,</i> I <i>have</i> to...
<i>Now, sir! Please!</i>

185
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,678
I should call my wife.

186
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,153
And I should call Claire.

187
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,650
Should I tell Connor?

188
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,659
<i> No. It's better
the press doesn't know.</i>

189
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,217
The field tests should
come in before the vote.

190
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,091
And as soon as the Kelly's
in, I'll come home.

191
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,357
<i>How's it looking?</i>

192
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,491
Shaky. We may lose this one.

193
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,425
That could make for
a tough interview.

194
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,334
<i>Well, I didn't want to
do it in the first place.</i>

195
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,066
Well, we're committed now.

196
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,904
<i>I better get back
to the Holy Crusader.</i>

197
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,239
Let me know as soon <i>as</i>
the tests have cleared.

198
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,710
If we're lucky,
it'll be anthrax,

199
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,543
and I won't live long enough
to see the bill fail.

200
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,776
Don't say that.

201
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,873
<i>We're gonna be fine.</i>

202
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,079
<i>How many of these quarantines
we've been through?</i>

203
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,416
I've lost count.

204
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,580
<i>Wish me luck with Donald.</i>

205
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,086
Heels crossed.

206
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,456
 It's ripping the caucus apart.
Of course.

207
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,724
We take a united
stand on our version of the bill.

208
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,424
Some of us have to
stay on our feet.

209
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,864
This is about party unity.

210
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,029
It's about
abandoning our base.

211
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,571
No, that's what
the freeze is.

212
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,435
Our base doesn't benefit
from sword-rattling.

213
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,269
It gets left
bleeding on the field.

214
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,469
My district has the third largest
number of seniors in the country.

215
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:04,105
If we raise the age of retirement,
the AARP will raise hell.

216
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,707
I spoke with the President
of the AARP this morning.

217
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,447
He'll be receiving a $45
million endowment next week.

218
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,578
Voters will
still revolt.

219
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,748
The midterms are gonna be ugly.

220
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,759
Many of us, and I can
certainly speak for myself...

221
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,989
The choice is between immediate
discontinuation of services

222
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,429
and an age bump
five years from now.

223
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:25,459
You're comparing theoretical
discomfort to imminent pain.

224
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,095
I just feel like we're losing
touch with our core values.

225
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,441
The Education Bill
is a good example.

226
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,737
We all followed
Frank's lead,

227
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,005
hoping it would buy us
traction with the Republicans.

228
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,410
Would you excuse me?
Just one moment.

229
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,975
Does the press know?

230
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,145
Not yet.

231
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,987
Can you keep in
touch with him?

232
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,581
I need to pummel our lunch
guests into submission.

233
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,528
You've got 'em close.
But relax. Listen more.

234
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,691
They want their hands held,
not someone in their face.

235
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,098
I know how to whip votes.

236
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,335
 Best caviar in D.C.,
ladies and gentlemen.

237
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,463
We can't let you pay for that.
 Then don't eat it.

238
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,842
But if you do,
I won't tell anyone.

239
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,444
You were saying about
the Education Bill?

240
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,443

241
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,694
No, Marjory, honey.

242
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,129
Remember, we just talked about it.
I was telling you...

243
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,494
Right. Nothing
to worry about

244
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,335
If you have any questions, ask Molly.
She knows what's going on.

245
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,067

246
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,306
I will call as soon
as I know anything.

247
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,175
I love you.

248
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,985
How's Marjory?

249
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,155
She's okay.

250
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,490
Long call.

251
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,266
You know,
she gets emotional.

252
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,565
Molly took a semester
off to be at home.

253
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,572
I told her she needs to
head back in the spring.

254
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,870
I don't want her mother
dragging her down.

255
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,504
Must be hard on you.

256
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,678
Harder on the girls, I think.

257
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,211
Is she lucid'?

258
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,513
About half the time.

259
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,352
Just enough to be aware
of how quickly she's going.

260
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,855
Awful.

261
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,192
I feel terrible saying it,

262
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,700
but part of me is looking
forward to her not being lucid.

263
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,437
At least then she won't
realize what's happening.

264
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,437
I should have thought
of this before.

265
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,034
Appeal to the heart,
not the brain.

266
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,047
Forgive my ignorance,

267
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,876
but has there been any
progress with research?

268
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,943
Some.

269
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,216
Genetic testing,
vascular manipulation,

270
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,919
but it's slow.

271
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,718
They won't come up with
anything in time for Marjory.

272
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,286
We're focusing on
quality of life.

273
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,832
Look, I know you have
work to do, so...

274
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,992
I'm no longer the Whip.
That's Jacqueline's job.

275
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,730
I just agreed to meet with you
because we have a history.

276
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,962
She would be tougher
to say no to.

277
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,905
But it still would've
been a "No."

278
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,965
Yes.

279
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,474
I admire your
convictions, Donald.

280
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,979
You're a rare
breed nowadays.

281
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,105
It didn't sound that way

282
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,809
when you were comparing
us to the Tea Party.

283
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,817
I was being unfair.

284
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,445
You're not a reactionary.
You're a progressive.

285
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,683
I see where this is going.

286
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,654
How do you mean?

287
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,786
When you've been in the
wasteland as long as I have,

288
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,962
you become immune to flattery.
Oh.

289
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,932
I know you think I'm
fundamentally deceptive,

290
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,699
but I am capable of
a genuine compliment.

291
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,165
Then I will take it as one,

292
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,105
but it won't
soften my resolve.

293
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,338
If it did, you wouldn't
deserve the compliment

294
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,878
in the first place.

295
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,674
If you vote "No," I won't
hold it against you.

296
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,614
We're all in this together
through the midterms.

297
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,519
But if you stick with me,

298
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,648
we can show both the Republicans
and the American people

299
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,354
that we're capable
of more than stagnation.

300
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,226
And that's worth something,
even it if hurts.

301
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,793
Who can I count on?

302
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,568

303
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,183
Copy that.

304
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,494

305
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,431
The fact that there is
still a door between us,

306
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,866
I take, is a bad sign.

307
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,331
<i>One tested negative,
one inconclusive, sir.</i>

308
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,440
<i>That means we have to take
the samples to the lab.</i>

309
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,701
So, how much longer?

310
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,334
<i>Another three
or four hours,.</i>

311
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,538
We have an important
vote going to the ﬂoor.

312
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,274
I have to be talking
to my people.

313
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,914
<i>The vote is delayed, sir.</i>

314
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,041
<i>We're evacuating this
side of the capitol.</i>

315
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,208
So no vote?

316
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,083
<i>No! until we get
the all-clear.</i>

317
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,746
Good things happen
to good people.

318
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,050
<i>Another thing, sir.</i>

319
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,888
<i>Ali cell phone service,
Wi-Fi, land lines...</i>

320
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,052
<i>We'll be blocking them,</i>

321
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,959
<i>in case there's a
legitimate security threat.</i>

322
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,190
I need to be able
to call my wife.

323
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,098
<i>I apologize, sir. We can
have someone notify her.</i>

324
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,701
No. It needs to be me.

325
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,238
She gets very anxious if she
doesn't recognize the voice.

326
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,365
<i>Congressman, I have strict
instructions not to...</i>

327
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,036
Figure it out, unless you want me
to get the White House involved.

328
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,709
<i>PH find a way, sir.</i>

329
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,711
There are advantages
to being Vice President.

330
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:48,916
Ma'am? We'll have to ask you lo
remain up here for a little while.

331
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,085
Is it the quarantine?

332
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,560
The Capitol is
being evacuated.

333
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,054
We expect everything
to be fine.

334
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,599
It's just
standard procedure.

335
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,133
You won't be able
to get through.

336
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,567
Communications
are being jammed.

337
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,636
You mean I can't even
speak to Francis?

338
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,762
Not until the all-clear.

339
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,807
 How long?

340
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,307
 Four hours
is the estimate right now.

341
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,104
We're supposed to
tape in 25 minutes.

342
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,676
 Nothing we can do.

343
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,169
You okay?

344
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,905
Yes.

345
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,246
I'll go talk to Emma.

346
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,789
You know, I'm fine.
Thank you.

347
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,118
 Em.

348
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,990
So, we might
have a problem.

349
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,190
It's all over the news.

350
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,288
It could be a while.

351
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,925
Can we get audio
from the Vice President?

352
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,596
Communications are being jammed
until the evacuation is over.

353
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,660
Have you spoken
to Ashleigh?

354
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,933
She thinks we should get a sat
truck down here. Wait and go live.

355
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,969
I can't guarantee
when that will be.

356
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,769
The Vice President is
quarantined in the Capitol,

357
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,834
and we have an exclusive.

358
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,210
The network will broadcast
whenever the hell we tell them to.

359
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,446
<i>They're holding off until you get here.</i>

360
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,009
You should do
the interview solo.

361
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,052
<i>I'd rather wait.</i>

362
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,019
Who knows whether
we'll win the vote?

363
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,614
If we lose, I don't want my
face on national television.

364
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,489
This could be
a silver lining.

365
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,028
<i>I don't know, Francis.</i>

366
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,028
I'm sure you'll
be terrific.

367
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,393
<i>Let me run it past Connor.</i>

368
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,728
 Okay.
Thank you. We're done.

369
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,030
<i>Sir, we were able to get
   Mrs. Blythe.</i>

370
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,468
Oh, Donald...

371
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,034
Marjory?

372
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,164
<i>Hello?</i>

373
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,800
Yes, it's me,
sweetheart.

374
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,401
<i>It's hard to hear you.</i>

375
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,912
We're still stuck
inside the office.

376
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,243
<i>What office?</i>

377
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,407
At the Capitol.

378
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,678
It's going to be
a little while longer.

379
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,982
<i>But why are you there?
It's Sunday.</i>

380
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,681
No, it's Friday,
sweetheart.

381
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,048
<i>Donald?
I'm</i> here.

382
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,354
<i>Who is this man with me?</i>

383
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,724
He's a police officer.

384
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,560
They're using walkie-talkies
so we can speak.

385
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:36,929
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

386
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,263
It's your
husband, ma'am.

387
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,495
 I'm not married.

388
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,539
It's me. It's Donald.

389
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,504
<i>Turn it off.
I don't know that man.</i>

390
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:44,869
Marjory...

391
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,740
<i> She went into
the other room, sir.</i>

392
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,441
Okay. Thank you.

393
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,242
If you could stay
with her, please.

394
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,375
<i> Yes, sir.</i>

395
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,604
Drink?

396
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,978
Sure. Why not?

397
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,617
 For all we know, it could
be midnight before he's out.

398
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,052
And then he still needs
to manage the vote.

399
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,145
We're fine
if it's 2:00 a.m.

400
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,279
 When
everyone's asleep?

401
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:34,380
 People would
stay up for this.

402
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,055
The whole point
was primetime.

403
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,219
Then we
do it tomorrow.

404
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,762
We've already set aside
half a day for this.

405
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,990
The Vice President
can't rearrange

406
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,326
his entire schedule
for an interview.

407
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,161
I don't see
any other options.

408
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,132
I spoke to Francis
over the radio.

409
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,726
We think I should
do it alone.

410
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,327
Just you?

411
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,175
Mrs. Underwood and
Ashleigh, one-on-one.

412
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,834
Maybe we can broadcast his
voice from the Capitol.

413
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,403
Francis doesn't want the entire
interview to be about the quarantine.

414
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,313
Neither do I.
That's just spectacle.

415
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,440
The quarantine is news.

416
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,077
We have a unique opportunity.
Fine. We're done.

417
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,017
What? Cancel the interview.
No reschedule.

418
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,146
Come on, Connor.

419
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,316
Please pack up
everything and leave.

420
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,327
Okay. Let me
call Ashleigh.

421
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,496
I thought I'd get
used to it, but no.

422
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,662
Hurts every time.

423
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,034
You spend 30 years
with someone,

424
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,836
and then they don't have
a damn clue who you are.

425
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,670
Ugh. I really shouldn't...

426
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,681
If we never did anything
we shouldn't do,

427
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,184
we'd never feel good about
doing the things we should.

428
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,951
Excellent point.

429
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,989
And if these are our
last moments on Earth,

430
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:42,026
I don't know about you, but I'd
rather go out with a buzz on.

431
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,115

432
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,283
To Marjory.

433
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,793
You love her dearly.

434
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,365
More than anything.

435
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,197
I can't imagine what
I'd do without Claire,

436
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,072
or if she didn't
remember who I was.

437
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,572
Hopefully,
you'll never have to.

438
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,375
Well, it makes me angry that
you do, that anybody does.

439
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,347
No sense being angry over
what you can't change.

440
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,254
How much funding does
Alzheimer's research get?

441
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,222
Just under $500 million.

442
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,588
Well, I'm no expert, but that
sounds inadequate to me.

443
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,855
It is.

444
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,364
For every $100 we
allocate to research,

445
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,333
we spend nearly
$30,000 on care.

446
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,562
We ought to change that.

447
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,161
I tried. My bill didn't
even leave committee.

448
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,763
Who opposed it?

449
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,332
Howard Webb.
Ugh...

450
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,200
Appropriations.

451
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,103
He didn't even
put it to a vote.

452
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,011
I've never been
fond of Howard.

453
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,175
That makes two of us.

454
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,546
What was his argument?

455
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,246
He didn't feel
he owed me one.

456
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,017
"Fiscally irresponsible,"
is all he said.

457
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,961
Walk me through
the specifics of your bill.

458
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,256

459
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,435
I see what you're doing.

460
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,065
Doing what?

461
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,540
You're disgusting, Frank.

462
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:05,934
Excuse me?

463
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,305
Using my wife.

464
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,742
Donald, what are
you saying?

465
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,371
You think I'll
give in on Entitlement

466
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,382
if you slap some extra Alzheimer's
funding on the table?

467
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,384
I was not suggesting
that at all.

468
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,612
Bullshit, Frank.

469
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,449
You think as little
of me as you want,

470
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,216
but I do not barter
with people's health.

471
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,552
Then why are you trying to
raise the age of retirement?

472
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:24,886
Medical research we can afford.
Medicare, we can't.

473
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,452
There are realities,
Donald.

474
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,630
Don't talk down to me
about realities.

475
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,668
My wife is dying.
That's a reality.

476
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,966
Other people will die, too,
if your package succeeds.

477
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,630
That's a reality!

478
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,938
God damn it! I wish I wasn't stuck
in this fucking room with you.

479
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:40,977
Donald?

480
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,170
I'm done talking.

481
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:45,941
One more time.

482
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,641
I've got it. I want it
to sound more natural.

483
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:52,253
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

484
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,689
And we didn't feel that
we could both do that

485
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,488
and be the parents
we wanted to be.

486
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,618
And by making
that choice,

487
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,994
it allows more time for us to
be in the service of others.

488
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,360
Good. That sounds good.

489
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,263
We need you,
Mrs. Underwood.

490
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,797
 Keep Derek
at the Capitol.

491
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,310
I want quotes from evacuees
and Homeland Security.

492
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,973
And Sarah should be finishing
that history of biohazard scares.

493
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,209
I'll be there soon.

494
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,050
I have to go.

495
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,518
No. We're not done yet.

496
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,055
This is a major story.
I'll come back tomorrow.

497
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,385
You've come here
two days in a row,

498
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,152
and this is how
patterns emerge.

499
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,319
The FBI likes patterns,

500
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,794
and we do not give the FBI
what the FBI likes.

501
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,688
I can't disappear all day
in the middle of...

502
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,323
I have eight reporters
out in the field, okay?

503
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,662
Stop.

504
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,961
Tell me why
I purchased Cashew.

505
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,308
I don't know.

506
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,143
Companionship?

507
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,312
Yes.

508
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,081
More importantly,
a reminder that

509
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,643
lam never more than one wrong
move away from life in a cage.

510
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,721
You stay.

511
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,054
I'll walk you through every
line of code I intend to write,

512
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,821
every attempt I make
to breach the wall.

513
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,387
If we get caught, you don't
get to plead ignorance.

514
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,658
We go down together.

515
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,893
No, I didn't sign up
for Bonnie and Clyde.

516
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,833
You need me for this one thing.
Just like I need you.

517
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,496
But whatever you've done
before me, that...

518
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,673
You know where I live.
And you know who I am.

519
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,579
Sit down.

520
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,847
The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

521
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,725
 <i>The Capitol
is still on lockdown,</i>

522
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,094
<i>as HazMat crews continue a
thorough sweep of the building.</i>

523
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,130
<i>Earlier this morning,</i>

524
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,133
a <i>white powder-like substance was
found in a package...

525
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:48,262
<i>...mailed to the office of
Majority Whip Jacqueline Sharp.</i>

526
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,805
Are we free to go?

527
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:53,433
HAZMAT CHEF:<i>Almost, sir. Less than an
hour. I've got a message from your wife.</i>

528
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:54,567
What is it'?

529
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,203
<i>She's doing the interview
live right now.</i>

530
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,443
<i> Congressman Donald
Blythe and 14 of Miss Sharp's staff.</i>

531
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,483
The secrets...

532
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,712
<i>Mrs. Underwood,
I so appreciate</i>

533
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,416
<i>you taking the time to speak
with us today in what,</i>

534
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,221
<i>I am certain, is a very
stressful situation.</i>

535
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,625
<i>Thank you, Ashleigh.</i>

536
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,458
<i>Have you spoken with
your husband today?</i>

537
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,999
<i>Yes, I did. And he's
in very good spirits,</i>

538
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,000
<i>and in good hands with
the Secret Service.</i>

539
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,503
<i>Of course, he's very disappointed
he couldn't be here.</i>

540
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,134
<i> Well, our thoughts
are with him and everyone else</i>

541
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,333
<i>quarantined at
the Capitol today.</i>

542
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,466
 Thank you.

543
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,470
I'd like to begin
with Claire Underwood

544
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,777
before you met
your husband, in Texas.

545
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,979
And I have
a couple of pictures.

546
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,075
Oh, no.

547
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,142
Yes.

548
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,914
Oh, my goodness.
That was Red.

549
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,520

An accomplished rider?

550
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,355
An enthusiast.

551
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,662
This one's from
a couple of years later.

552
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,255
Oh, my goodness.

553
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,763
You like those penny loafers?

554
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,825
Those are...

555
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:55,269
Those are two
very different girls.

556
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,170
Which one are you
more comfortable being?

557
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,880
My family's ranch.
That was home for me.

558
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,607
You didn't like
the prep school?

559
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:09,010
No. I think I
preferred the dirt.

560
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,712

561
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,548
You grew up in Dallas, though.
Um, Highland Park.

562
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,019
Yes. My father, well,
he was a businessman.

563
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,689
So' we lived in the city,
but we're ranchers.

564
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,563
I mean, we go back three
generations, our family.

565
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,697
Your parents
were very wealthy.

566
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,569
We were comfortable, yes.

567
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,199
They made sure
I wanted for nothing.

568
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,037
It was a very
happy childhood.

569
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,206
What is your most vivid
memory from that time?

570
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,510
My most vivid memory.
Wow. Um...

571
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,258
Probably when I was
about nine or 10,

572
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,490
my father took me to Dealey
Plaza, where Kennedy was shot.

573
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:59,193
And he said, "Claire,
a great man died here."

574
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,329
And I remember

575
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,506
not fully comprehending
the meaning of death yet.

576
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,539
And I asked him how he
died, and he told me.

577
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,517
And I remember feeling
so sad, so angry.

578
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,520
It seemed so unfair.

579
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:21,923
I started to cry, and
my daddy picked me up.

580
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,392
And he wrapped his arms
around me, and he said,

581
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,123
"Don't be sad,
sweetheart.

582
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,794
"He made the world
a better place,

583
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,198
"but sometimes that
comes at a price."

584
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,702
I guess that was
the most vivid memory.

585
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,789
 We are
only eight votes away.

586
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,417
I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

587
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,894
Me, too. I've gotta stick
to my guns on this one.

588
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,428
You would rather let
the government shut down...

589
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,557
Hey, don't put
that on us

590
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,396
just because we're on the
ass-end of the whip list.

591
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:07,294
Don't get us wrong. We have a
lot of respect for you, Jackie.

592
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,235
You're doing a fine job
since Frank's gone.

593
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,637
Different styles,
but a fine job.

594
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,766
Excuse us just a moment.

595
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,306
They're not
taking me seriously.

596
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,903
'Cause you're not Frank.

597
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,144
You mean because
I'm not a man.

598
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,741
No. I mean Frank.

599
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,650
They're used to being
offered something.

600
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,517
Ask them what they want.

601
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,522
I know Paul needs help with
a waste-treatment facility.

602
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,957
You're being just as
condescending as they are.

603
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,016

604
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,323
Take some good advice
when you get it.

605
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,261
I was right earlier,
wasn't I?

606
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:45,098
Paul, Remy tells me you need
a waste treatment plant.

607
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,771
We've had some trouble getting
matching federal funds.

608
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,543
Ben, you mentioned once a
winery museum in your district?

609
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,845
We are making some great wines
in Long Island these days.

610
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,886
I've tried some.
It tastes like piss,

611
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,613
compared to what
we have in Napa,

612
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,385
the sort of piss that belongs in
Paul's waste treatment plant.

613
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,517
Jackie. We have a
possible terror attack,

614
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,061
and you're holding out
your plates for more pork.

615
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,858
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

616
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,400
In my caucus, people are
rewarded for good behavior,

617
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,164
not trading their
votes for ransom.

618
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,227
When we walk in there,

619
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,240
I expect the both of you
to vote "Yes,“

620
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,332
without a moment's
hesitation.

621
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,077
Thank you for your
change of heart.

622
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,212
Six more to go.

623
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:34,381
<i>You left Texas and spent the
last two years of high school</i>

624
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,390
<i>at the prestigious
Phillips Academy.</i>

625
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,558
And then,
on to Radcliffe.

626
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,729
Yes.

627
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,163
Where you would meet
the future Vice President.

628
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,102
Back then, just a
dashing law student.

629
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,366
I never dreamed he would become
Vice President, of course.

630
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,407
Some people think that

631
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,375
your marriage may be a bit more
calculated than you let on,

632
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,241
that perhaps he needed
your family's money.

633
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,680
No. That's just not true.

634
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,184
Your father did contribute
an awful lotto his campaign.

635
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,847
Yes, he did. Because he
believed in Francis.

636
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,082
Would he have won
that campaign

637
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,387
had it not been for your
father's contributions?

638
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,359
I don't know. I mean,
it certainly helped.

639
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,295
But I like to think that it was
Francis' ideas and leadership

640
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,390
that convinced voters,
not just TV commercials.

641
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,627
You've been
married 27 years.

642
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:20,931
That's right.

643
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,235
You were just in school.
I mean, you married so young.

644
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,603
We did.

645
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,041
But when you've
found the one...

646
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,270
Well, Francis was the one.

647
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,638
You call him Francis.

648
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,910
Well, back home,
they call him Frank, still.

649
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,550
But he likes that
I call him Francis.

650
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,387
<i>He said that it makes him
sound more sophisticated.</i>

651
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,221
 Is it hard being
a politician's wife?

652
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,058
It's thrilling.

653
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,998
Not without
its challenges.

654
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,292
Always in the background,

655
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,497
subsuming your goals
for his goals.

656
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,902
No, I don't see it that way.

657
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,569
We're two very
independent people

658
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,112
who have chosen to
live our lives together.

659
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,280
I support him.
He supports me.

660
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,681
Which, you know, goes back
to the political partnership.

661
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,687
Well, my husband happens
to be a politician,

662
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,418
and I happen to do
political work.

663
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,624
But our partnership
extends far beyond that.

664
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,365
Children.

665
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,432
Was that a sacrifice?

666
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,796
Because you haven't had any.

667
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:31,336
Francis and I wanted to devote
our lives to public service.

668
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,465
And we didn't feel that

669
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,102
we could both do that and be
the parents we wanted to be.

670
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,703
So, we made the choice.

671
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,606
We've heard that
answer before.

672
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,048
Sorry?

673
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,711
You have given the exact same
answer in previous interviews.

674
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,017
Because it's the truth.

675
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:50,685
Forgive me,
but career and timing,

676
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:54,025
uh, those are often
very convenient answers.

677
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,325
It is true that
whatever it takes

678
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,196
for people to get
from "maybe" to "yes"

679
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,166
never arrived for me.

680
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,531
Never felt the pressure?
No maternal instinct?

681
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,673
No.

682
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:07,904
And it was a choice?

683
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,172
It wasn't because you
couldn't have any?

684
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:12,714
Well, Francis and I did
what was right for us.

685
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,543
Because it is unusual,

686
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,850
I mean, even now, for politicians
at the executive level

687
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,255
not to have children.

688
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,519
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

689
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,364
<i>In your husband's
second congressional campaign,</i>

690
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,827
<i>there was a Republican,
a pro-family candidate,</i>

691
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,598
<i>who made some pretty
unsettling accusations.</i>

692
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:40,069
<i>Well, Francis is a Southern
Democrat, and we have thick skins.</i>

693
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,701
<i> He suggested,</i>

694
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:46,113
<i>in order to keep your husband's
political career on track...</i>

695
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,708
<i>Children are the center
of many people's lives.</i>

696
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,448
<i>And I think they just
want to make sure that</i>

697
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:54,387
<i>their representatives will fight
for their children's dreams.</i>

698
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:58,053
<i>And Francis has, again and
again, proven that he will.</i>

699
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,596
<i>And he will continue Io
do so as Vice President.</i>

700
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:07,034
He claimed that you may have been
pregnant during the campaign.

701
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,269
Was there a pregnancy?

702
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,437
Have you ever been pregnant?

703
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,115
Break. Now.

704
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,980
That's not gonna happen.

705
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:27,913
Yes.

706
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:30,783
During the campaign?

707
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,423
Before.

708
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,760
Was it a miscarriage?

709
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,096
No.

710
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,598
Did you...

711
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,835
<i>Did you terminate
the pregnancy?</i>

712
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,106
If I said "yes,"

713
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,342
my husband's political career
would be in jeopardy.

714
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,782
My faith would
be questioned.

715
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,253
Likely, my life
would be threatened.

716
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,021
But I won't feel ashamed.

717
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,093
Yes, I was pregnant. And,
yes, I had an abortion.

718
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,161
Can you excuse me
for one moment?

719
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,458
Of course.

720
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,765
<i>We'll have more of
our live interview</i>

721
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,306
<i>with Claire Underwood
in a moment.</i>

722
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,365

723
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,043
That took a lot of guts.

724
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,613
Yes, it did.

725
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:35,022
No. It'll look like I am ashamed.
I'm not. And I won't.

726
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,649
Nothing you can say
will make this any better.

727
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,785
I'd rather deal
with the damage...

728
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,987
I'm not going
to run from this.

729
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,358
She's gonna ask why
you had the abortion.

730
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,122
I haven't had one.
I've had three.

731
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,392
Three? No.
You need to stick to one.

732
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,871
Okay, fine.
Tell me what you'll say.

733
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,633
Well, I can't use
the real reason.

734
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,732
The first two, I was a
teenager, and I was reckless.

735
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,401
What about the third?

736
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,909
Well, the article that
she showed, it's right.

737
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,209
I was on the pill.
It didn't work.

738
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,476
We talked about
having a baby,

739
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,711
and then we
decided against it.

740
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,807
Why?

741
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,581
Because we were focused
on the campaign.

742
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,519
How many weeks in'?
Sixteen.

743
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,019
You can't say any of this.

744
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,385
Go upstairs.
I'll deal with Ashleigh.

745
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:15,192
If we're going to continue,
we've got about 20 seconds.

746
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,391
Connor, I...
Please, trust me.

747
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,991
You'll be making
a big mistake.

748
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:30,212
Are you willing to discuss
the circumstances?

749
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,613
I became pregnant as a
result of a sexual assault.

750
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,177
Are you saying
that you were...

751
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,379
Raped.

752
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,724
<i>You've never spoken
publicly about this before.</i>

753
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,717
<i>No one ever asked.</i>

754
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:48,932
 <i>Can you
tell us what happened?</i>

755
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,761
 <i>It</i> was college.

756
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,235
<i>A classmate,
we were dating.</i>

757
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,964
And it happened on a...

758
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,530
We had a fight, and he
forced himself on me.

759
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,542
Did you tell anybody
about it? Did he...

760
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,602
Was he charged?

761
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,703
No.

762
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,113
Because at the time, I felt
that I was somehow at fault.

763
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:11,449
I knew I wasn't, but I just
didn't want to be stared at.

764
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,490
I didn't want to be known as
"the girl who got raped".

765
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,388
And when I became pregnant,

766
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,961
I wasn't going to
drop out of school.

767
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,061
I wasn't going to let
this man ruin my life.

768
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,232
So' I made a choice.
I ended it.

769
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,769
But if you never
told anybody about it,

770
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,172
the assailant could
still be out there.

771
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,641
Can you tell us
anything about him?

772
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,604
I saw him for the first
time in almost 30 years,

773
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,616
<i>just a few months ago.
Where?</i>

774
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,185
<i>At a commissioning ceremony
that Francis and I attended.</i>

775
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,319
Did you speak to him?

776
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,327
Briefly. Francis
pinned stars on him.

777
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,429
He was being commissioned?

778
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,787

779
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,761
General Dalton McGinnis.

780
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,027
And for the record,

781
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:04,471
Francis has always known
about the assault.

782
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,667
He just didn't
know the name.

783
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:10,179
And he's been nothing but
supportive all these years.

784
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,179
We're gonna have to
reach out to the General, um,

785
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,720
for a response to
what you just said.

786
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,315
Would you mind if
we took a quick break?

787
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,485
Absolutely.

788
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,290
We'll be right back with
Mrs. Claire Underwood.

789
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,059
Take all the time
you need.

790
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,534
The lab tests all came
back negative, sir.

791
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:38,699
What was it?

792
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,968
Talcum powder
laced with ﬂour.

793
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,743
It was pesticide from the wheat
that gave us the false positive.

794
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,412
So, are we free to go?
Yes, sir.

795
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,345
Nancy, tell 'em
I'm on my way down.

796
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,382
I already did.

797
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,542
Mind if
I use your phone?

798
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,641
Of course.

799
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,550
And, Donald? I'm gonna get
you that research funding,

800
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,214
no matter how
the vote goes.

801
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,519
It's your call, because I'm
still voting against it.

802
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,093
I understand.

803
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,329
You have a brave wife, Frank.

804
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,225
So do you, Donald.

805
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,899
 Frank!

806
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:09,571
How'd you do?

807
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,072
We're down to four.
How about Blythe?

808
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,698
He won't budge.
What did you offer him?

809
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,835
Alzheimer's research.
He was insulted.

810
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,534
The vote's in 45 minutes.

811
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,740
I need to get to Claire. Who
should I call from the car?

812
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:19,781
We've exhausted
our options.

813
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,578
It's either Blythe's people,
or it won't pass.

814
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:22,674
They're too loyal to him.

815
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:24,746
Okay. Go.
I'll figure it out.

816
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:25,947
I can stay if
you need me.

817
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,046
No, get to your wife.
I know where to find you.

818
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,594
Nancy, I need every
ream of paper you have.

819
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,028
And get me dollies.

820
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:53,874
Almost done.
Twenty more minutes.

821
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,776
I hate lying.

822
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,115
Did he do it?
Yes.

823
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,780
Then don't feel bad.

824
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,222
What if he denies it?

825
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,919
Then we'll
cross that bridge.

826
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,294
 Connor?
Give us one more minute.

827
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,559
We have a young woman on
the phone, a private.

828
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,568
She says she was also
assaulted by the General.

829
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,169
Two years ago.

830
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,470
She wants to share her story,
but she won't give her name.

831
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,967
We can't put her on
if she's anonymous.

832
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,176
You want me to
convince her?

833
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,645
 She's frightened.

834
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,572
Is she still on the phone?

835
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,916
WOMAN OVER PHONE:
I've never told <i>anyone.</i>

836
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:37,651
It took me almost half my life
before I could say anything.

837
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,453
But you can say
something now.

838
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,359
<i>I don'! know.</i>

839
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,330
Just think of how many
others there must have been.

840
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,301
<i>But you want me to talk.</i>

841
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,272
Well, would you have called
if you didn't want to?

842
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,003
<i>I didn't think
I'd have to use my name.</i>

843
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,511
Listen, I understand you're
afraid of the consequence.

844
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:00,105
<i>I'm a private.
He's a general.</i>

845
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,313
And my husband is the Vice
President of the United States.

846
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,946
We will protect you.
I promise you that.

847
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,452
What's your name?

848
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,666
<i>Private Megan Hennessey.</i>

849
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,666
 What is this?

850
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,336
The names of every
person in America

851
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,879
who will lose home care
when the freeze sets in,

852
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:33,882
who will lose half
their welfare benefits,

853
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:35,883
who will go on furlough,

854
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,681
who will lose
their student loans,

855
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,814
transportation services,
post-combat counseling.

856
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,324
Shall I go on?

857
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,189
This is about the big
picture, Jacqueline.

858
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,090
This picture looks
pretty big to me.

859
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:52,333
I can't vote
for the package.

860
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,900
Then don't.

861
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,736
Just get four of
your people to do it.

862
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,574
And then work with me
after we avoid the freeze.

863
00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,340
I'm not Frank Underwood.

864
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:10,019
At least two other girls
that same <i>year.</i>

865
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,216
<i>If that was true for all
the years he's served...</i>

866
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,419
It's just staggering.

867
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,955
<i>And I felt so helpless.</i>

868
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:24,032
<i>And he keeps rising in the ranks.
The system protects him.</i>

869
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,196
 Why do you think
no one has ever reported him'?

870
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,704
Do you wanna
join her?

871
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,897
 <i>We know
it won't do anything. No.</i>

872
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,473
<i>Chain of command.</i>

873
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,477
It's inexcusable that you're willing
to put your life on the line

874
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,773
to defend our freedom,

875
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,748
and yet you don't feel the
freedom to come forward.

876
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:44,911
<i>I love my country. And I
love sewing in the Marines.</i>

877
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,281
<i>But not like this.</i>

878
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,086
<i>Private Hennessey,
thank you for your courage</i>

879
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,821
<i>in joining us tonight.</i>

880
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,627
<i>It was Mrs-
Underwood who gave me the courage.</i>

881
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,131
<i> And Mrs. Underwood,
thank you for your honesty.</i>

882
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,268
Sir, your wife
is on the phone.

883
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:03,806
<i> You've given us
a great deal to think about.</i>

884
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,340

<i>Thank</i> you, Ashleigh.

885
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,740
<i> And that concludes
our live one-on-one</i>

886
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,972
exclusive interview
with Claire Underwood.

887
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,446
You can watch the entire
interview on our website.

888
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,278
And as always,
we invite you to give us

889
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,081
your thoughts and your comments
on Facebook and on Twitter.

890
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,951
But for now, thanks for
watching, and good night.

891
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,186
And we're out.

892
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:29,421
This is going to make waves
like you never imagined.

893
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,000
Thank you.

894
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,826
Where's Carter?

895
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,560
You'll be
reporting to me now.

896
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,158
And who are you?

897
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,363
Carter's boss.

898
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,571
You're doing
good work, Gavin.

899
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,471
But you can't be
assaulting the target.

900
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,169
That could compromise us.

901
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,370
I don't even know why you're
going after this guy.

902
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,503
He's small-time.

903
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,547
That's not your concern.

904
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,378
He couldn't write a line
of code to save his life.

905
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,180
He intends to commit
an act of cyberterrorism.

906
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,013
Well, that's intention,
not capability.

907
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,147
He's not a real threat.

908
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,655
Maybe Carter talked
things outwith you.

909
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:31,582
I won't.

910
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,532
How much longer?

911
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,498
Until what?
Until I can stop.

912
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,369
Do you prefer prison?

913
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,101
I've given you eight
child pornographers,

914
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,436
three botnet masters...

915
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,670
But you still haven't
given us AV unit.

916
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:52,112
Well, Hold Carter
I don't know where he is.

917
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,944
Yes, you do.
I don't.

918
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,176
Nobody does.

919
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:58,678
Then what about your
friends in DecSec?

920
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,395
I'm not giving
you my friends.

921
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,592
Then you can
keep doing this.

922
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,723
You're a productive
asset, Gavin,

923
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,599
but the moment you stop
being productive,

924
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,694
no lawyer can help you.

925
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,223
Wish we had the real
thing right now.

926
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,911
Always prepared.

927
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,575
Francis.

928
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,195
I've missed this.

929
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,095
So have I.

930
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:19,862
Shouldn't you be on the phone
getting your accolades?

931
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:23,269
That can wait
till tomorrow.

932
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,941
Sing me something.

933
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,335
What do you
want to hear?

934
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,469
Anything.

935
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:41,350
<i>♪ Polly, pretty Polly

936
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:47,521
