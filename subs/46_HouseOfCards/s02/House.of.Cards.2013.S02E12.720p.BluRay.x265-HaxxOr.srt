1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,003
You're parsing the law.

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,179
And I'm talking about
a spiritual code.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,049
Confidentiality is a covenant.

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,849
Not only between myself
and those I counsel,

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,321
but also between
myself and the Lord.

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,360
Dr. Larkin, my chief focus
here is the money laundering.

7
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,128
If the President brought up
Xander Feng,

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,290
Raymond Tusk,
the Adohi Casino...

9
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,992
It doesn't matter
what the focus is.

10
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,864
I can't share anything
we discussed privately.

11
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,899
Religious guidance
is protected.

12
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:28,405
But you were also conducting
professional therapy.

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,507
I never claimed that.

14
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,201
Mr. and Mrs. Keith
confirmed as much.

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,243
We were at their house.

16
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,048
But they didn't participate
in any of our conversations.

17
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,138
So how would they know?

18
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,414
So you're saying you only
gave religious counsel?

19
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,546
That's how
I choose to interpret it.

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,492
The President and his wife have
never once attended your church.

21
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,724
They're not even
the same denomination.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,866
Irrelevant.
Not legally speaking.

23
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,765
I'm certain I can convince a judge
to issue a subpoena on the grounds

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,430
that you weren't their
legitimate spiritual advisor.

25
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,602
Which is your prerogative.

26
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,836
But I can appeal. And I would.

27
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,372
You'd lose.

28
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,843
The only circumstance
by which I would talk

29
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,682
is if someone personally
waived their privilege.

30
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,621
Otherwise I'd rather face
contempt of court.

31
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,089
It's a matter of ethics.

32
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,591
Mr. President.

33
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:32,362
Ah.

34
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,099
You brought it back in.

35
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,196
Floyd Mayweather visited
the White House this morning.

36
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,367
I thought he'd get
a kick out of it.

37
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,774
Did he have a go at it?

38
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,607
He threw a combination I thought
would bust the stitching loose.

39
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,739
Well, that must have been
a treat to watch.

40
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,216
He was telling me
it's not just about the power.

41
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,378
Plenty of boxers
are more powerful than he is.

42
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,548
No, ifs his tactics,
his precision, his speed.

43
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,149
Most important?
His counter punch.

44
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,091
He dances and dodges

45
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,994
and then picks
the perfect moment to strike.

46
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,226
Does that sound familiar?

47
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,228
How do you mean, sir?

48
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,102
You gave this to me
as a gesture of friendship.

49
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,806
When I look at this now,

50
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,906
I don't see friendship.

51
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,274
I see calculation.

52
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,148
You set me up, Frank.

53
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,743
What?

54
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,311
Your back channeling.

55
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,023
The special prosecutor.

56
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:30,693
When I think about Raymond, about
Linda, about Jim Matthews...

57
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,492
You are wrong, sir.

58
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,770
Questions from Dunbar
about the marriage counseling.

59
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,136
"It's a needle in the haystack
she's not trying to find."

60
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,469
That's what you said.

61
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,267
Well, she found the needle.

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,878
I am shocked, sir. I never...
Like hell you are.

63
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,007
You want to diminish me.

64
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,479
Diminish you?

65
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,645
Laying the groundwork
for a challenge in 2016.

66
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,782
I am sorry to have to say this,
sir, but you are being ludicrous.

67
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,292
Do you really think
I'm so blind?

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,319
A vice president has never
challenged a sitting president.

69
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,299
You've climbed the ladder doing
things other men would never do.

70
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,235
Always in service
to you and the party.

71
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,327
It was your idea
to hand over those logs.

72
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,874
You connected the White House
to China, the casino...

73
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,876
Raymond Tusk entangled us
with China and the casino.

74
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,070
And if I hadn't intervened...

75
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,706
You can't dodge and duck like Floyd.
I've learned your moves now.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,852
This office breeds paranoia.
Don't give into it' sir.

77
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,523
I'd ask for your resignation if
it wouldn't make things worse.

78
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,492
But from this moment forward,

79
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,390
I don't want
to hear your voice,

80
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,226
I don't want
to see your face.

81
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,994
And if I do, I will put
you on your goddamn back.

82
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,736
Exile.

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,581
I've managed to isolate
the President from everyone.

84
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,442
Including myself.

85
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,347
"Congresswoman Sharp
is a perfect example

86
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,547
"of how the military
brainwashes us

87
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,851
"into never questioning
the party line.

88
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,354
"Her opposition to the bill
is disgraceful.

89
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,622
"It will cost thousands
of men and women

90
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,062
"the justice they deserve,

91
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,791
"and some of them
their lives."

92
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,835
Those are Megan Hennessey's words.
They're biased.

93
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,699
They're Claire's words.

94
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,066
Hennessey's just
the mouthpiece.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,833
Why does it say here
that I declined to comment?

96
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,205
You said you didn't want to kick
up dust if we could avoid it.

97
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,642
<i>It's The New York-fucking-Times.
You should've let</i> me <i>know.</i>

98
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,041
That was my call.
I'll take the blame.

99
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,413
Find out when Hennessey's
next appearance is.

100
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,212
I'm gonna
beat this bitch down.

101
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,652
I know she went after you,
but going after her is...

102
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,713
Not her. Claire Underwood.

103
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,255
I understand how Garrett
might misconstrue things,

104
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,488
given the pressure he's under.

105
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,157
But you can't
honestly believe it yourself.

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
<i>I don't know
what to believe anymore.</i>

107
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,096
Francis is devastated.

108
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,499
All he wants to do is help,

109
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,165
but he feels like he's
being unfairly accused.

110
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,675
<i>I don't want to believe it,
Claire, but Garrett is convinced.</i>

111
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,177
Will you talk to him?

112
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,771
I have to concentrate on keeping
my family together right now.

113
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,372
Not getting
into arguments over...

114
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,349
<i>If Francis were really
up to something,</i>

115
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,187
don't you think he would have
told Dunbar about the therapy?

116
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,883
He basically did by forcing
us to hand over the logs.

117
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,289
Your husband chose
to hand them over.

118
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,795
If he'd said no, Francis
wouldn't have pressed the issue.

119
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,694
I don't want to
debate this with you, Claire.

120
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,600
<i>Al! I'm asking is that you realty
think this through, Tricia.</i>

121
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,862
Is he with you right now?

122
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,031
Who?

123
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,266
<i>Frank.</i>

124
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,698
No. It's just you and me.

125
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,037
I want to get
off the phone.

126
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,774
<i>Will you please
talk to Garrett?</i>

127
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,474
Goodbye, Claire.

128
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,544
What do you think?

129
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,921
I don't think she's going to side
with me instead of her husband.

130
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,256
Did Tricia tell anyone else
about the Xanax besides you?

131
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,566
I doubt she would.
She's very sensitive about it.

132
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,829
If she'd only told someone else,
then we could just leak it.

133
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,232
But it'll be too obvious.

134
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,293
The doctor.

135
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,803
He's protecting them.
He won't say anything.

136
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,808
Unless they waive
the privilege.

137
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,976
They have absolutely
nothing to gain by that

138
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,783
But we do.

139
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,486

You have to meet with Tusk.

140
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,148
Why would he talk to me
after I backstabbed him?

141
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,782
That's precisely
why he'll talk to you.

142
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,191
Well, I can't go to St. Louis.
You know...

143
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,261
Tusk will come east.

144
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,591
Your job is to
get in the same room with him.

145
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,427
What's the play?
Remy Danton.

146
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,990
Go. Get me Durant, in person.

147
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,195
I'll set it up.
And Doug?

148
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,704
Let's make sure we're airtight
on everything else.

149
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,467
No Achilles' heel.

150
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,837
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,139
"Cry, 'Havoc,"' said he
who fought chaos with chaos,

152
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,773
"And let slip
the dogs of war."

153
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,612

154
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,883
Missed appointments.

155
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,825
No contact in weeks.

156
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,885
You know the rules.

157
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,965
I'd like to speak
to Agent Green, please.

158
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,056
What are you up to?

159
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,793
Put Green on the fucking line,
please.

160
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,894
Anything you have to say,
you can discuss it with me.

161
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,302
What I have to say
is way above your pay grade.

162
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,363
Where do I turn off this shit?

163
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,411
Look at the other screen,
to the left.

164
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,246
What is this?

165
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,386
That is the access grid to all
eight of AT&T's data centers.

166
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,058
So what do you say
you uncuff me

167
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,188
and tell Agent Green
I'll be waiting for his call?

168
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,329
I'm trying to repair
relations with China.

169
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,031
Giving Feng asylum
would be a slap in the face.

170
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,334
 Garrett's in trouble.

171
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,432
He needs to appear resolute.

172
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,034
We're only <i>as</i> strong
as the president we serve.

173
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,340
We have to rescue him.

174
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,041
How can you be sure his testimony
won't implicate the White House?

175
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,175
He knows where
his bread is buttered.

176
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,015
This isn't about
you saving the President.

177
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,054
Of course it is.

178
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,090
We've been down
this road before, Frank.

179
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,090
Michael Kern, Adam Galloway.

180
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,418
I wanted to become
secretary of state

181
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,258
in order to engage
in productive diplomacy,

182
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,354
not full-time damage control.

183
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,628
Which is why we have to
put Garrett back on his feet.

184
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,637
You want him on his <i>ass,</i>
Frank.

185
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,101
Is this what the President
told you?

186
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,138
He's paranoid, Cathy.

187
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,045
He's trying to
turn people against me.

188
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,775
You're turning them
against yourself.

189
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,213
You're asking me
to undermine the President.

190
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,649
All right.

191
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,428
Let's say that what the
President has accused me of

192
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,929
is true.

193
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,727
Would that be so bad?

194
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,732
If taken to its conclusion?

195
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,972
Wouldn't you stand to benefit?

196
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,944
Wouldn't the country?

197
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,740
I don't want
anything to do with this.

198
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,611
Just one more time, Cathy.

199
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,583
Let's unshackle ourselves.

200
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,115
This is a one-time offer,
Mr. Feng.

201
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,918
<i>I would need it in writing.</i>

202
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,760
<i>Open-ended, no restrictions. The
same goes for legal immunity.</i>

203
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,959
First I need to know whether
or not you funneled money

204
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,296
through Lanagin's casino.

205
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,358
No, no.

206
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,165
I will speak freely
once I've arrived safely

207
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,261
in the United States.

208
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,364
<i>Unless you provide
valuable evidence now,</i>

209
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:07,172
the Attorney General will not
grant immunity on any level.

210
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:10,105
<i>I've denied these allegations
in China.</i>

211
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,308
<i>My enemies want me dead.</i>

212
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,476
<i>You're asking me
to give them confirmation.</i>

213
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,020
And we're giving you
safe haven in return.

214
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,952
<i>I already have safe haven
in Dubai.</i>

215
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,517
Your asylum there is only temporary.
We're offering you permanent status.

216
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,686
<i>I'm confident that they will
grant me permanent status.</i>

217
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,028
Did you hear that directly from
the Minister of Foreign Affairs?

218
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,999
<i>Because I just spoke to him.</i>

219
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,997
Right now you are a man
without a passport.

220
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,406
Whatever assets Beijing hasn't
seized are frozen in every country

221
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,206
with close ties to
the United States or China,

222
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:44,373
which is just about
every country in the world.

223
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,144
You want
your freedom and fortune.

224
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,346
<i>We want information.</i>

225
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,084
Mr. <i>Feng?</i>

226
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,394
What do you need to know?

227
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,225
<i>Confirm for me the existence
of a money-laundering scheme.</i>

228
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,392
Yes.

229
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,994
<i>We used the casino
to mask foreign contributions.</i>

230
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,268
All right.

231
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,571
One of you want to tell me
what this is all about?

232
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,709
You have to comply.

233
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,373
You mean I have to show up.

234
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:19,906
Unless we appeal.

235
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,416
We'd lose.

236
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,018
She wouldn't have issued the subpoena
unless she had something substantial.

237
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,116
I agree. Which is why I think you
should go and plead the Fifth.

238
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,788
What do you think she has?

239
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,259
I don't want to speculate.

240
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,897
God damn it, I pay the six
of you more in one day

241
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,456
than it costs
to put a kid through college.

242
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,864
And I pay you to know
more than I do.

243
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,131
Her line of questioning
will tell us a lot.

244
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,603
We can use that
to prepare our defense

245
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,071
in case there's an indictment.

246
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,074
When do I have to go?

247
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,304
Your interview
is the day after next.

248
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,642
Forty-eight hours?

249
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,316
Having trouble starting it?

250
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,581
Yeah. I think the
battery might be dead.

251
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,350
I have some cables if you
want to try and jump it.

252
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,152
You sure you don't mind?

253
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,487
Not at all.

254
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,459
All right.
It's really nice of you.

255
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,089
Pop your hood.
I'll bring my car around.

256
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,462
Sure.

257
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,631
Hey.
Hey.

258
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,668
This is Peter. He's the
guy who drove me back.

259
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,501
Where do you want these?

260
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,473
Oh. I'll take 'em. Thanks.

261
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,969
Rachel, right?

262
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,470
Yeah.

263
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,039
Lisa said
you two were roommates.

264
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,015
Can I get you something?
A glass of water?

265
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,984
No, thanks.
I should really get going.

266
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,350
All right.
I can't thank you enough.

267
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,151
My pleasure.
Good luck with the car.

268
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,282
Thanks.

269
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,224
I hope it's only a dead battery.
Have a good night.

270
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,387
We should give him some money.

271
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,155
Peter.

272
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,736
She needs to be gone.

273
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,139
You told me she could stay.

274
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,506
I changed my mind.

275
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,307
But you said you didn't
care if she was here...

276
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,473
I don't need
to explain myself.

277
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,544
You can't stand it, can you?

278
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,349
The idea that I might
actually love somebody.

279
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,821
That I might have somebody
in my life who isn't you.

280
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,916
If you care about her,
make it happen, Rachel.

281
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,651
Hey. Is everything okay?

282
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,990
Yeah. You need to tell your friend
that I won't take any money.

283
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,191
I was happy to do it.

284
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,393
We all need a Good Samaritan
every now and again.

285
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,340
Did you feel justice
was served

286
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,775
when General McGinnis
got sentenced to 40 years?

287
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,536
Yes, as far as his crimes go.

288
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,444
But not for thousands of
servicemen and...

289
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,776
I'm sorry to interrupt.

290
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,785
My producer is telling me that
Jacqueline Sharp has called in,

291
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,684
the house majority whip.

292
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,188
Congresswoman, are you there?

293
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,192
<i>Yes, I'm here, Chris. And
thank you for taking my call.</i>

294
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,283
Thank you.

295
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,383
<i>Hello, Megan.</i>

296
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,060
<i>Congresswoman.</i>

297
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,722
First of all,
as a veteran like yourself,

298
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,358
I want to thank you for your
service to our country.

299
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,198
<i>Duly doesn't require thanks.</i>

300
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,862
I'm glad you brought up duty,

301
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,430
because you recently
equated it with brainwashing.

302
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,038
That's not what I meant.

303
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,237
<i>You said,
“Toeing the party line."</i>

304
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,946
What I meant was that the culture
and the system is one that...

305
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,414
I didn't call to argue
with you, Megan. The opposite.

306
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,385
We can't fix this problem until
we find some common ground.

307
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,420
Wouldn't you agree?

308
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,547
There is no middle ground
as far <i>as</i> I'm concerned.

309
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,056
The military
needs to change...

310
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,788
Can't we agree that you and I served
so that we could protect open debate,

311
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,124
which is the very bedrock
of democracy?

312
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,290
Yes, in theory, but that's
not what I'm talking about.

313
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,163
<i>Not in theory. In reality.</i>

314
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,397
Brave men and women
die fighting for that freedom.

315
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,771
The meaning of bravery
is fighting for the freedom

316
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,468
of those with whom
you disagree.

317
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,402
Sure, but let's get back
to the issue here.

318
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,946
<i>What I don't think is brave</i>

319
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,743
is Claire Underwood
dodging this debate

320
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,148
and having you fight this
battle for her instead.

321
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,412
<i>That's not true.</i>

322
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,251
<i>Then why am I talking to you
instead of her?</i>

323
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,346
<i>It's her bill.</i>

324
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,083
It's not just hers.
It's all of ours.

325
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,753
 <i>Except one of you
is brave enough to say it,</i>

326
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,853
<i>and the other is a coward.</i>

327
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,521
<i>Mrs. Underwood
was brave enough</i>

328
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,655
<i>to go on national television
and admit that she...</i>

329
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,200
<i>Yeah, and where
has she been since then?</i>

330
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,169
<i>Deflecting scandal
and hiding from the press.</i>

331
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,473
<i>You called</i> me <i>disgraceful
in The New</i> York <i>Times, Megan,</i>

332
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,100
<i>and you have every right.</i>

333
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,942
But I also have the right to say
that Mrs. Underwood is disgraceful,

334
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,778
because there is nothing
more disgraceful

335
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,010
than running from a battle.

336
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,615
Megan?
That is...

337
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,717
<i>We're not even...</i>

338
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,521
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

339
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,790
Where are you going?

340
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,390
To the Capitol.

341
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,566
Did Feng mention
either me or the President?

342
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,798
Dunbar wouldn't say.

343
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,239
But the fact that Feng
confirmed the money laundering

344
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,968
increases focus
on the White House.

345
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
Well, as long as we're
innocent, which we are.

346
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,573
Raymond Tusk
has been subpoenaed.

347
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,876
Why did you ask for this meeting, Bill?
Just keeping us in the loop?

348
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,585
Did you encourage Secretary
Durant to offer Feng asylum?

349
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,420
Bill, for God's sakes.

350
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,259
The President could have asked
me that question himself.

351
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,829
As the White House counsel,
it is my responsibility...

352
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,387
No, I did not.

353
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,828
So you're saying Durant
acted of her own accord.

354
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,870
I have no idea
what her motivations were.

355
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,405
I'm just as shocked
as the President

356
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,872
that she would have gone through with
this without his direct approval.

357
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,841
There's another matter
I'd like to discuss.

358
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,411
Privately, if we could.

359
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,573
Just give us a few moments.

360
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,885
The therapy.
Yes.

361
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,459
To be specific,
the confidentiality waiver.

362
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,394
Feng's testimony puts us
in a very awkward position.

363
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,626
We're under a great deal of
pressure to waive the privilege.

364
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,134
If we don't,
it implies that the President

365
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,794
may have confessed
to things he didn't.

366
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,533
Dunbar is just grasping.
Don't give in.

367
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,041
I don't want to.

368
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,938
But Larkin's argument
for spiritual confidentiality

369
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,478
is shaky at best.

370
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,879
We want to control
how this thing plays out.

371
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,076
How can I help?

372
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,116
We need to know if anyone else
might pop out of the woodwork.

373
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,711
Well, I haven't
mentioned it to anyone,

374
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,778
and neither has Claire.

375
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,324
I would never betray the
President's trust like that.

376
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,293
Thank you for your time.

377
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,225
Tell the President
it saddens me

378
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,633
that we now have to
communicate through lawyers.

379
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,897
I will make myself available

380
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,235
if he wants to discuss
any of this in person.

381
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,433
Yes, sir.

382
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,839
What Megan said
was offensive.

383
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,002
She shouldn't have
questioned your character.

384
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,843
Those were talking points.
Carefully crafted, and not by her.

385
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:01,180
I'm not here to pick a fight, Jackie.
I'm here to end one.

386
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,651
Oh, it'll end soon enough when
the bill goes to the floor.

387
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,320
It won't go to the floor.

388
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,156
I've spoken to Elaine Brooks
and I'm withdrawing the bill.

389
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,428
What you said had some truth.

390
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,762
And early on you offered
to sit down with me

391
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,323
and find a middle ground.

392
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,699
I decided to draw
a line in the sand.

393
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,098
And the braver thing would've
been for me to swallow my pride

394
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,334
and sit down with you.

395
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,538
If you're still open to that,
I'd love to start over.

396
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,272
Are you and Frank
up to something?

397
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,307
A passable bill.

398
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,045
He had Nancy spy on me.

399
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,283
He brought
my personal life into...

400
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,721
Francis is used
to getting his way.

401
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,155
And he'll do anything
to make sure he does,

402
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,660
especially if it's something
important to me.

403
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,989
I don't know, Claire.

404
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,861
I'm skeptical.

405
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,293
We're deeply sorry
for the way we've treated you,

406
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,304
and we want to rebuild
the trust we've lost.

407
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,204
Do you think that's possible?

408
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,581
I'm sorry to ambush you.
I tried calling.

409
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,155
You can't do this to me,
Claire.

410
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,555
I was very clear that I have
to respect Garrett's wishes...

411
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:18,424
Not that. The sexual assault bill.
It's not going to a vote.

412
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,198
Did the speaker
remove it from the docket?

413
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,158
No. I did.

414
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,566
I just spoke to Jackie.

415
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,703
This is because of
what she said about you?

416
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,604
My main concern is that she
doesn't come after you next.

417
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:34,166
Not while you and Garrett are
going through the investigation.

418
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,337
I thought you should be aware

419
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,405
because I know how much
this bill meant to you.

420
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,778
All the work
you've put in.

421
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,213
That we've put in.

422
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:45,755
But we'll pass Jackie! version, lake
this baby step and build on it.

423
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,519
I'm disappointed about the bill,
but I have to say, I'm relieved.

424
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,460
How are you
holding up?

425
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,691
Did you hear what Catherine did?
Giving Feng asylum?

426
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,063
Inexcusable.

427
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,534
Garrett's beside himself.

428
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,569
He feels cornered,

429
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,969
like we have no choice but
to waive the privileges now.

430
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,199
But what about the medication?
I know.

431
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,942
I shouldn't
be sharing this.

432
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,201
We don't have
to talk about it.

433
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,441
You should go. I know you
have a packed schedule.

434
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,054
FRANK:
<i>Thank you for doing this.</i>

435
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,556
 <i>All I had to do was
get her alone in a hallway.</i>

436
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,422
 <i>I meant with Jackie.</i>

437
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,886

We have our priorities.

438
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,761
 Well, I know it isn't easy
to let go of something like that.

439
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,796
 Promise me something.

440
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,329
 Anything.

441
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,003
I can't live
in this house alone.

442
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,104
I'm not going anywhere.

443
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,110
You say that,
but this could all backfire.

444
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:41,777
Raymond will plead the Fifth.

445
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:45,441
If he names me, it's an admission
of his own wrongdoing.

446
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:49,283
I'm more worried about Garrett.
You've made a powerful enemy.

447
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,945
We're stronger than they are.

448
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,286
And he's still the President.

449
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,853
I promise you,

450
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,428
of all of the sacrifices
that you've had to make,

451
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,363
divorcing a convict
will not be one of them.

452
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,827
We can't waive the privilege,
Garrett.

453
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,834
We don't have a choice anymore.
Feng confirmed the money.

454
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,962
Over the phone.
Not in a formal interview.

455
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,165
Rescind the asylum.
Send him back...

456
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,706
Obstruction of justice.

457
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:11,997
Is that what Galich said?

458
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,542
Definitely how it would
be perceived.

459
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,703
And anything we do that looks
like a failure to cooperate

460
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,144
amplifies that perception.

461
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,782
I just don't want
our marriage put on display.

462
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,978
Look, Dunbar'll ask
if I brought up China.

463
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,284
I didn't. So Larkin can
only help to exonerate me.

464
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,517
And if the marriage counseling
ends up in the report, so be it.

465
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,614
We can survive that.

466
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,126
But he prescribed us
medication.

467
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,793
Technically not us.

468
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,989
You took mine, Garrett.

469
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,332
Larkin wrote the prescription
to me knowing you would.

470
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,833
Wait, wait, have you mentioned it?
The medication?

471
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,532
Claire?
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,664
But she's the only person
I can talk to

473
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,970
who really understands
what it's like...

474
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,840
All the more reason we have
to waive the privilege.

475
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,642
If they leak this, we can't
control the information.

476
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,080
Claire wouldn't do that.

477
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,650
Don't underestimate her.

478
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,880
If they were going to, don't you think
they would have done it by now?

479
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,980
She dropped the sexual assault
bill lo reduce pressure on us.

480
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,991
That may have been
what she told you.

481
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,716
They're not going
to say anything.

482
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,063
I'm begging you, Garrett.
Don't waive the privilege.

483
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,028
The things we talked about
were so intimate.

484
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,333
Imagine if the kids...

485
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,237
I know. But Tricia...

486
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,436
When we ran, I knew every aspect of
our lives would be under scrutiny.

487
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,411
But I thought we could
protect at least this.

488
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,613
What happens in here.

489
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,908
I'll protect us.

490
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,888
Whatever I have to do.

491
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,782
You have to believe that.

492
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,110
We checked the USB dongle.

493
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,123
The code you're claiming infected
the data center isn't there.

494
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,784
I programmed the code to self-erase
as soon as it hit the server.

495
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,487
It was gone before Lucas was in cuffs.

496
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:14,921
You don't believe me?

497
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,397
This is one of the most sophisticated
firewalls in the world.

498
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,062
Even if your code did get in
there, you couldn't break it down.

499
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,105
Your wife uses AT&T.

500
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,398
So does her lover.

501
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,498
What?

502
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,338
She's over there right now.

503
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,844
Jonathan Kemp.

504
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,141
It's her chiropractor, right?

505
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,115
Want to see their texts
to each other?

506
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,477
No.

507
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,919
Oh, I see you already know.

508
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,593
I don't blame you
for not making a fuss,

509
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,788
what with the kids
still at home.

510
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,490
But you walked my code
right through that door.

511
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,000
Into 32 million
people's phones.

512
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,170
And that's on you.

513
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,201
And it's on the FBI.

514
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,173
And it is a shit-storm
that will bring the Bureau

515
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,299
right in front of Congress.

516
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,970
So you tell me.

517
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,877
How much is making
that disappear worth?

518
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,780
You have 100 years
hanging over your head.

519
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,147
Extorting the FBI
won't help you.

520
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,188
Did Douglas Stamper tell you
to set up Lucas Goodwin?

521
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,787
Counter-Terrorism Director.

522
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,884
That's a big step up
from White House Liaison.

523
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,552
I think you had a helping hand.
Not true.

524
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,686
Keep lying.
Meanwhile, here's what I want.

525
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,856
One,

526
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,059
I'm no longer your bitch.

527
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,296
Two, all of my charges
are dropped.

528
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,305
Three, all of Barrett Brown's
charges are dropped.

529
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,898
That's up to the U.S. Attorney.
Figure it out.

530
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,309
If I'm hearing you correctly,

531
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,316
you'd like to keep Larkin's testimony
focused on the money laundering.

532
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,251
Which I never brought up, because
I knew nothing about it.

533
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,254
But your concern is other matters.
Private matters.

534
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,053
Which are irrelevant
to the investigation.

535
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,322
I can't prevent Dunbar from
asking what she's gonna ask.

536
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,658
Of course not.

537
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,165
The most I can do
is ask Dr. Larkin

538
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,997
how he would respond
to certain questions.

539
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,669
But he's a smart man. He'll
understand what I'm getting at.

540
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,435
And this approach
keeps us within the law?

541
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,407
We're not tampering
with testimony?

542
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,371
It's a fine line.

543
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,944
But I'll stay
on the right side of it.

544
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,036
Thanks.

545
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,583
He shut me out, Frank.
Just like he did with you.

546
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,887
My undersecretary has been assigned
full diplomatic authority.

547
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,080
A temporary setback, Cathy.
Where I go, you go.

548
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:23,592
At this very moment, the President
is in the Situation Room.

549
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,289
China responded to Feng's asylum
exactly the way I predicted.

550
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,127
They're doubling their naval
presence off the coast of Yonaguni.

551
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,963
And you know who isn't
in the Situation Room?

552
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,730
You and I, Frank.

553
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,304
You're thinking about where we are
instead of where we're headed.

554
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,579
Now that isn't
the Catherine Durant

555
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,410
that I waltzed with
at the Jefferson Ball.

556
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,919
She understood potential.

557
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,248
She had her eyes
toward the future.

558
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,618
I told that Catherine Durant

559
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,989
that we needed her
in the State Department.

560
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,122
We still need her.

561
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,428
I wish I knew where she was,

562
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,591
because she is not

563
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,658
the Catherine Durant sitting
in front of me right now.

564
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,896
But I'll tell you something.

565
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,399
If she doesn't show up soon,

566
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,501
well, I'm just gonna
have to keep waltzing alone.

567
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,140
Because I am done trying to
convince this woman in front of me

568
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,748
to take my arm.

569
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,521
Oh. Don't let me keep you.

570
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,356

571
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,992
I'm here.

572
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,161
I'm not going anywhere, Frank.

573
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,294
You still have access
to the presidential briefing?

574
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,202
Yes, I have it right here.

575
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,336
Walk me through everything
that's going on with China.

576
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:50,177
Feng is in play now.
We might be able to use him.

577
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,641
How?
I don't know yet.

578
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,382
But he's clearly valuable to Beijing,
which makes him valuable to us.

579
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,145
Nothing about Xander Feng?

580
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,350
Never
Daniel Lanagin?

581
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,988
Raymond Tusk?

582
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,528
We only discussed
their marriage.

583
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,028
Nothing about the business
of the White House.

584
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,067
Any oblique reference to work-related
pressures he was feeling?

585
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,527
He said he wasn't getting
as much sleep <i>as</i> he'd like.

586
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,295
Did you ever prescribe him
any medication?

587
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,904
As I've always stated,
I provided religious counsel.

588
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,740
I understand. But I'm
asking about medication.

589
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:24,836
How is this relevant?

590
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,743
I'm trying to assess whether his
judgment may have been impaired.

591
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,645
In my opinion, he and his wife

592
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,349
were dealing with
standard marital issues.

593
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,980
That's not what I asked,
Dr. Larkin.

594
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,390
So I will ask
for a third time.

595
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,495
And let me be more specific.

596
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,655
Was any medication
prescribed or taken

597
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,528
as a result of
your counseling session

598
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,330
by the President of
the United States?

599
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,705
His faculties were operating at
100%, if that's what you're asking.

600
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,676
Has anyone from the
administration spoken to you?

601
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,837
How do you mean?

602
00:28:58,904 --> 00:28:59,882
About this deposition.

603
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,043
Has anyone approached you,
coached you?

604
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:08,355
If you tell me now, I will qualify
that as a timely declaration.

605
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,417
I'd like to leave. The President
waived his privilege.

606
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,287
But I'm here voluntarily.

607
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,592
Dr. Larkin, at first you
wouldn't talk to me

608
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,031
because it violated
your ethical code.

609
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,433
I respect that.

610
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:23,236
But let me ask you,
as a man of faith,

611
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,771
is deliberately lying to me
an exception to that code?

612
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,070
Because that is what you're doing
by refusing to share the truth.

613
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:33,615
I don't understand.

614
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,716
It wasn't going to pass.

615
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,776
But you said
we almost had the votes.

616
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,880
We needed to be 100% solid,
and we weren't.

617
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,153
If the bill failed,
that would set us back.

618
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,127
We need to accept
incremental reform.

619
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,959
You sound
just like Jackie Sharp.

620
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,393
I'm actually
working with her now.

621
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,399
She's a powerful ally
for us to have.

622
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,767
After what she did to me?

623
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,339
After what she said about you?

624
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,743
If I let the things people say
about me get under my skin,

625
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,144
I wouldn't be able to
leave my own home.

626
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,977
You know how this will go.

627
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,751
Everyone will say,
"Great, we did something,"

628
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,480
which is really nothing.

629
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,782
They'll pat themselves on the
back and they'll forget about it.

630
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,821
We helped put this
on the radar.

631
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,149
I thought
we were doing something real.

632
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,189
Changing people's lives.

633
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,929
How naive, right?

634
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,091
But at least
I didn't want to give up.

635
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,657
Maybe Jackie Sharp is right.

636
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,331
You are a fucking coward.

637
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,428
I'm the one that pulled you
out from under the covers.

638
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,440
You were hiding.
You and your pills.

639
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,100
So you tell yourself
whatever you need to.

640
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,680
I'm sorry.

641
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,447
There were political realities
we couldn't ignore.

642
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,290
Do you ever wonder why so
many people hate Washington?

643
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,852
It's because of people like
you using phrases like that.

644
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,697

645
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,470
Raymond?

646
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,638

I'd turn the lights on,

647
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,975
but when you're paying for
the room with the best view,

648
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,174
you might as well
make the most of it.

649
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,376
I've never been
in the penthouse here.

650
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,045
Have you?

651
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,014
What's going on?

652
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,717
Do you know why I'm in D.C.?

653
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:23,682
Oh, it's okay, Remy.

654
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,590
There's nothing you can say
that I don't already know.

655
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,221
Feng is on his way to testify.

656
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,766
Whatever Seth has told you,
don't believe a word of it.

657
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,898
What might he have told me
that I shouldn't believe?

658
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,735
You met
with the Vice President.

659
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,173
In a church.
Don't pretend you didn't.

660
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,212
Playing both sides?
Raymond, look...

661
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,338
I want to hear you say it.

662
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,576
That you met with Frank.

663
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,880
I'll talk to you, Raymond,
but not with him here.

664
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,249
Leave us.

665
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,389
Should I hold
the elevator for you?

666
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,927
Go fuck yourself.

667
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,220
Okay. You can take the stairs.

668
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,763
They're toying with you,
Raymond.

669
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,133

670
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,600
No doubt.

671
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,031
But so are you, Remy.

672
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,544
I wanted to lead Frank on, give
him a false sense of security.

673
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,705
If you're gonna lie,
lie better than that

674
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,908
They want to tear us apart.

675
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:23,650
I don't blame you for wanting
to keep your options open.

676
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:27,417
But clearly you have bought
the wrong insurance policy.

677
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,592
Don't shoot yourself
in the foot like this.

678
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,786
Your foot.

679
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,895
And you're holding the gun.

680
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,489
Now go someplace else
to bleed.

681
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,793
You want to talk about blood?

682
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,390
How much have you spilt
in this war with Frank?

683
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,562
All I've tried to do
is keep the peace.

684
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,968
You could've let him
have the upper hand.

685
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,937
What would that have really cost
you, other than your pride?

686
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,172
 Such a shame.

687
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:59,085
You have just made
42 billion enemies, Remy.

688
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,521
And some change.

689
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,353
39 billion, Raymond.

690
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,321
Your market cap is shrinking.

691
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,858
White House counsel
Bill Galich

692
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,368
was called into
questioning this morning

693
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,098
by Special Prosecutor
Heather Dunbar.

694
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,606
<i>According to Dunbar's office,</i>

695
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,608
<i>there are suspicions
that Galich</i>

696
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,974
<i>may have tampered
with witness testimony.</i>

697
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,707
<i>The witness in question
is Dr. Thomas Larkin,</i>

698
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,180
<i>a reverend and therapist</i>

699
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,047
<i>who allegedly conducted secret
marriage counseling sessions</i>

700
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,381
<i>for the President
and First Lady.</i>

701
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,952
The White House counsel wouldn't
be manipulating testimony

702
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,117
without explicit direction
from the Oval Office.

703
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,819
And just as disconcerting
is the fact

704
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,863
that our President is seeking
psychological treatment

705
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,022
and chose to hide this
from the American people.

706
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,791
If we can't trust him about
that, then how do we know

707
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,131
he wasn't involved
in a money-laundering scheme?

708
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,501
How do we know
he's mentally fit to lead?

709
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,732
And most important,

710
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,865
how can he enforce the law
when he's breaking it?

711
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,204
I believe our colleagues
in the House

712
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,540
certainly have enough to consider
Articles of Impeachment.

713
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:59,241
Both trust and laws
have been broken.

714
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,177
Whatever the House
decides to do,

715
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,914
we must hold
this President accountable.

716
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,522
Fully support the President

717
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,353
and will stand by him
no matter what comes his way.

718
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,551
Put that in, put it out.

719
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:11,150
Then get me Ayla Sayyad.

720
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,655
And as for Remy,

721
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,594
let's let him wither on
the vine a little longer.

722
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,496
In the meantime, have his better
half come by the house tomorrow.

723
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,728
Raymond?

724
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,530
No. Jackie.

725
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,706
Mr. Tusk.

726
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,023
Well, Ms. Dunbar,

727
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,550
in 67 years on this planet,

728
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,357
I have never once
been issued a subpoena.

729
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,265
I can now
cross that off my bucket list.

730
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,465
This interview is being
recorded and sealed.

731
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:58,235
As the subpoena mentioned, Mr. Tusk,
I spoke with Xander Feng.

732
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,441
He verified that you were his
partner in laundering Chinese money

733
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,412
to political Super PACs
since 2005.

734
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,083
How would you respond
to his allegations?

735
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,947
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

736
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,280
Did you ever use these contributions
to bargain for political favors?

737
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,552
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

738
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,722
What was your relationship
with Daniel Lanagin?

739
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,494
My client exercises his right
to plead the Fifth Amendment.

740
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,585
I don't even remember
why I came over here.

741
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,417
 You mean
when you first showed up?

742
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,252
No. To the kitchen.

743
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,657
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,423
Please don't think
that I don't love you...

745
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,486
Then why? I don't get it.

746
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,165
Everything's been so fast.

747
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,357
And...

748
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,204
I don't know. It's hard to explain,
but I'm not ready for this. And...

749
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,468
That's bullshit.
No, it's not.

750
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,508
I'm still trying
to figure out this new life.

751
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,103
And this is too confusing.

752
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,979
This is the only thing that's
clear, and you know it.

753
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,519
You're afraid, but it's good
to be afraid when you're...

754
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,485
I need you to leave, okay?

755
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,147
For your own good.

756
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,952
I am just gonna hurt you.

757
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,959
I have thicker skin
than you can even imagine.

758
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,393
Please don't make this harder
than it has to be.

759
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,464
Everything was fine yesterday.

760
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,227
It's so sudden. It's like
it's coming out of nowhere.

761
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,732
Well, it's not.

762
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,131
I've been thinking about it
for a while.

763
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,534
No, you haven't.
I would have sensed it.

764
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,698
Would you please,
please, please just go?

765
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,698
Just tell me what's going on.

766
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,903
I don't expect you
to understand.

767
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,174
Well, maybe if you try...
I don't want you here. Okay?

768
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:47,146
I don't love you
the way that you love me.

769
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,049
I was using you because it
felt good to have you around,

770
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,552
but it was selfish.

771
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,816
I said the words because
I knew you wanted to hear 'em,

772
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,859
but I didn't mean 'em. And I
don't want to keep saying 'em.

773
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:59,155
I'm gonna go for a walk
while you pack your stuff.

774
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,164
No. I don't want anything
that's been here.

775
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,027
Lisa...

776
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,188
<i>There was a steaming mist
in all the hollows,</i>

777
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,421
<i>and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill,</i>

778
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:37,626
<i>like an evil spirit,
seeking rest and finding none.</i>

779
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,192
<i>A clammy and intensely
cold mist,</i>

780
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,263
<i>it made its slow way
through the air in ripples</i>

781
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,935
<i>that visibly followed
and overspread one another,</i>

782
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:52,208
<i>as the waves of
an unwholesome sea might do.</i>

783
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,045
<i>It was dense enough
to shut out</i>

784
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,779
<i>everything from the light of
the coach lamps.</i>

785
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,750
I'm surprised
you wanted to speak to me.

786
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,717
I haven't been the biggest
friend of the administration.

787
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,659
Isn't that the very best
reason to speak with you?

788
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,786
I'd like to begin recording.
By all means.

789
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,896
A number of
political analysts predict

790
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,333
that the House Judiciary Committee
will commence with hearings

791
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,630
on Articles of Impeachment.

792
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:15,965
Let's just stop right there.

793
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,773
So these analysts
you speak of,

794
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,907
they're making predictions prior to
Dunbar's report even being released.

795
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,139
That could take months.

796
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,511
There's no way the Judiciary
will sit on this for that long.

797
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,517
And isn't that the fundamental
flaw with these hearings?

798
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,918
The committee feels compelled
to act because of hypotheses

799
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,856
advanced by those in the
media, such as yourself.

800
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,755
I can't speak
for all of my colleagues,

801
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,023
but I'm just reporting facts.

802
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,498
Well, you may call them facts,

803
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,625
but if we're being honest,
aren't they just...

804
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,933
in every article and interview,
I report alleged activities.

805
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:54,102
And if you repeat allegations enough,
again and over and over and over,

806
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,167
people start to believe
that they're true.

807
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,439
That's human nature.

808
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,503
I've done my research.

809
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,310
Xander Feng admitted
to the money laundering.

810
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,614
But you're no longer writing
about Xander Feng. Are you?

811
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,518
You're writing
about the administration.

812
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,716
The truth is, these hearings have
been initiated by the press.

813
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,851
And my fear is that the President
will be tried by the press.

814
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,962
Do you believe he's innocent?
Absolutely.

815
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,158
I said so in my written statement
and I say so again now.

816
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,668
The White House counsel has
denied coaching Dr. Larkin,

817
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,328
but according to Ms...
Whatever comes to light,

818
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,838
it will only prove
the President's innocence.

819
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,873
And I'll tell you why.

820
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,672
I have never known anyone

821
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,704
more honest, ethical and
patriotic than Garrett Walker.

822
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,649
His reverence for the Constitution
and the laws of this country

823
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,312
are surpassed by none.

824
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:43,156
Tricia and I have been blessed
with a strong and loving marriage.

825
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,324
But even strong marriages
face challenges.

826
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,227
Like millions of Americans,

827
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,925
we sought counseling
from a spiritual adviser,

828
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,730
one who happened also to be
a professional therapist.

829
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:58,097
Over the years we have often turned
to our faith in times of adversity.

830
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,731
Many have criticized us.

831
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,346
<i>But would you rather have a president
that doesn't ask for help?</i>

832
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,675
<i>I ask for help
from my wife every day.</i>

833
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,516
<i>We've relied on one another
for 23 years.</i>

834
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,749
<i>We've raised two beautiful
children together.</i>

835
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,690
<i>Endured the campaign trails
together.</i>

836
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:21,386
From the state capital in
Denver to the nation's capital,

837
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,529
we've always been
at each others side.

838
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,761
I married this man

839
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,805
for the same reason that so
many of you voted for him.

840
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:34,070
Because he's a man of God.
Because he believes in family.

841
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,543

842
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,705
<i>Because he is compassionate
and loving.</i>

843
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,943
<i>Now, none of us are perfect.
I'm not. Tricia's not.</i>

844
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,814
<i>Although she certainly
comes close.</i>

845
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,113
Good morning, Mr. Feng.

846
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,787
I won't ignore
what makes me human.

847
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,622
That's a form of blindness.

848
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:54,659
Good leadership means tackling
my imperfections head on.

849
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,426
Not bad for a man on the run.

850
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,762
You mean a man with immunity.

851
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:03,601
Wherever you're most comfortable.
We have a lotto discuss.

852
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,938
<i>I do so with open eyes.</i>

853
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:10,413
Just as I love,
with open eyes,

854
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,638
my wife,

855
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,477
my maker

856
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,009
and my country.

857
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,980

858
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,252
 Come in.

859
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,695
Thank you, Meechum.

860
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:32,495
Jackie, in these circumstances,
normally I would come to you,

861
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,867
but we need to keep a public
distance for the time being.

862
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,669
I thought I was here to discuss
the sexual assault bill.

863
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,305
You are.
Among other things.

864
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,139
I see.

865
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,308
There's a price.

866
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,345
 Well, we don't
think of it that way.

867
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,144
I'm going to support your bill,
no matter what you say today.

868
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,285
Regarding?

869
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,790
 Impeachment.

870
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,285
Well, if it goes
to the Judiciary...

871
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,329
It most definitely will.

872
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,364
I'm not sure about that. Did you
see the President's address?

873
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,364
We did.
I think it will help.

874
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,663
Stop the bleeding.
Impeachment can be defeated.

875
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,965
But that's what
we need to avoid.

876
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:13,976
You want impeachment...

877
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:15,873
Why fight a losing battle?

878
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,911
We have a majority in the House.
We do now.

879
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,484
But if this party
fails to distance itself

880
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,383
from a toxic president...

881
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,651
We're thinking ahead here.

882
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,816
It's why I came to you
about the bill.

883
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,253
Because it wasn't
worth burning a bridge over.

884
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:35,353
 In the long run, we have a
lot more to gain by working together.

885
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:36,888
I don't understand.

886
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,695
You said in the Telegraph
article that you would...

887
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,757
 I had to.

888
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,269
My office is three doors down
from the President's.

889
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,567
I can't publicly deride him.

890
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,741
You want me to do it?

891
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,575
We want you to do
what you do so well,

892
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:53,943
whip the votes.

893
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,356
I can't abandon the President.

894
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,294
If the party rescues him,

895
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:11,458
we'll lose 50 seats
in the House in the midterms.

896
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,934
You will lose your position
in the leadership.

897
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:18,268
And it will take us a decade to
regain the trust of the electorate.

898
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,104
All we're asking
is that you have an open mind.

899
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:22,571
Claire kept an open mind,

900
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:26,046
and you'll pass sexual
assault reform as a result.

901
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,243
You can't possibly
compare impeachment to...

902
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,810
It's an illustration, Jackie.
Of what the future looks like.

903
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,648
What we offer is progress.

904
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,285
With a promise
of more to come.

905
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,297
It's only the beginning,
Jackie.

906
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,793
Ruthless pragmatism,
remember?

907
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,003
That's why I wanted
you to be the whip.

908
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,166
The three of us,
we're cut from the same cloth.

909
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,779
Mr. Vice President,

910
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:02,978
what you're asking
is just shy of treason.

911
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,622
Just shy.

912
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,647
Which is politics.

913
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,288
Oh, be careful.
It's delicate.

914
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,292
What is it?

915
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,497
Something I've been working on
for a very long time.

916
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,200
And ifs nearly finished.

917
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,507
Jackie?

918
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:30,874
Help us finish it.
