2
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,779
Kentucky,
you have 53 votes.

3
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,280
How do you cast them?

4
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,115
Madam Secretary,

5
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,743
as a senator for the great
Commonwealth of Kentucky,

6
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,038
I'm proud to speak
on behalf of the delegation's chair.

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,915
The Commonwealth of Kentucky,

8
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,917
home of the Derby,
the Wildcats,

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,295
and the birthplace of bourbon,
for Vice President of the United States,

10
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,965
<i>casts 13 votes
for Secretary of State Catherine Durant...</i>

11
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,260
<i>11 for Senator Joseph Baker of Nevada,</i>

12
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,680
nine for Governor Randall Smith
of West Virginia,

13
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,307
seven apiece for
Governor Jill Haley of Florida

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,018
and Congresswoman Sharon Pierce
of California,

15
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,898
five for one of our own,
the Mayor of Louisville, Jill Carson...

16
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,277
and one vote for
the First Lady of these United States,

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,947
Mrs. Claire Underwood.

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,577
Louisiana,
you have 61 votes.

19
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,495
How do you cast them?

20
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,290
Isn't this exciting?
You can feel the electricity.

21
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,960
Been a very long time
since an open convention.

22
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,878
I'm surprised you didn't get
a few votes yourself, Senator.

23
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>I'm not running
for vice president.</i>

24
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,257
<i>Neither is Claire Underwood
and she got one.</i>

25
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,383
<i>That was my vote.</i>

26
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,385
Trying to throw some levity
into the proceedings, sir?

27
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,513
Hell, no! I think she'd make
a terrific vice president.

28
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,529
- Mrs. Underwood!
- Mrs. Underwood!

29
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,491
A couple of questions,
Mrs. Underwood, if you have a moment?

30
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,575
Yes, I only have time for a few.

31
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,119
Welcome to Atlanta,
Mrs. Underwood.

32
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,328
Thank you.

33
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,747
Can you comment
on Senator Sheer's vote?

34
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,707
Well, I am flattered.
But it's all in good fun, I'm sure.

35
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,085
Mrs. Underwood,
he says he'll vote for you again.

36
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,255
Well, I am encouraging everyone,
including Senator Sheer,

37
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,382
to vote for Cathy Durant.

38
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,675
Both the president and I think
she is the best choice in the field.

39
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,262
You changed everything we wrote.

40
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,848
There was no imagination to it.
No rhythm.

41
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,058
We've been writing their speeches
since they took office.

42
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,977
We know what we're doing.

43
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,605
Well, do you want it to be good,
or do you want it to be yours?

44
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,982
The vote I'm most excited about

45
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,278
is the victory our background check
legislation got in the House yesterday.

46
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,072
So I'm hoping that the Senate
will follow their lead soon,

47
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,533
and that the president
can sign it into law.

48
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,451
I have to go.
Thank you so much.

49
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,790
Thank you... for inviting us.

50
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:08,874
No.

51
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,920
It's me who has to thank you and your son.

52
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,129
He saved my life.

53
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,507
No matter how tragic
the circumstances.

54
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,554
I want you to meet
some of the other recipients.

55
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,308
This is James...
who received one of your son's kidneys.

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,434
Oh.

57
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,188
And this is Luisa...

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,523
who received your son's heart.

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,534
Luisa was at the top of the list.
She was hours away from dying.

60
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,288
Uh, if we could,
let's all get together for a photo.

61
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,332
James? Right here.

62
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,542
- You come right here.
- Okay.

63
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,378
This way.
Great.

64
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,217
<i>The president isn't shying away
from, uh, his transplant.</i>

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,343
<i>Well, I think it's a smart move.</i>

66
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,678
<i>You can't deny it,
so why try to hide it?</i>

67
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,223
<i>Plus, I think it underscores
the importance</i>

68
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,515
<i>of the vice presidential situation.</i>

69
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,185
<i>Wait, rolling out the donor's mom?
That feels a bit exploitative.</i>

70
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>I... Look, hold on.</i>

71
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,605
<i>A little bit of compassion,
the kid just shot himself.</i>

72
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,066
<i>And with a handgun, no less.</i>

73
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,026
<i>Legally purchased.
Let's not put this on the gun.</i>

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,446
<i>Look, I am sorry, all of this, the whole
thing, the convention... It's theatrics.</i>

75
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,031
<i>Hey, look, I...
Bring on the circus.</i>

76
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,075
<i>It's a lot more fun
than some four-day infomercial.</i>

77
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,077
<i>Let's talk about
the contenders themselves.</i>

78
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,912
<i>There's almost a dozen of 'em.</i>

79
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,206
- Can you, uh, lower that, please?
<i>- ...really have a chance.</i>

80
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,416
<i>Durant, first among 'em.</i>

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,668
It's 11:00 in the morning, day one,
and they're beating <i>Ellen.</i>

82
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,754
Less traffic on the website, too.

83
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,506
People aren't watching
the videos as much.

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,759
This sold over a million copies.

85
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,261
Five times that many read it online.

86
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,304
Yeah, well, that was last month.
This is this month.

87
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,099
We announce a stellar running mate.

88
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,768
He eviscerates Underwood on ICO.

89
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,772
We have not one, but two <i>Vanity Fair</i>
covers that Pollyhop's pushing,

90
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,025
and all you give me is excuses.

91
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,903
The point was for us
to drown out their convention,

92
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,239
not the other way around.
We need to steal the thunder back.

93
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,033
So go where the thunder is.

94
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,664
I've been one heartbeat away
for almost two years.

95
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,375
My heart's not in it anymore.

96
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,921
I'm going to head back
to Vermont after November.

97
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,505
Maybe start teaching again.

98
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,216
Who are you supporting, then?

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,177
On the record, Cathy Durant.

100
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,761
And off the record?

101
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,516
I'm not the biggest fan.

102
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,393
Why?

103
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,188
She wasn't much help
during the Russia crisis.

104
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:40,233
- She closed the deal with Petrov.
- She took credit for it, sure.

105
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,569
But she fought the deal
every step of the way.

106
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,989
Nothing would've happened
if it weren't for Claire.

107
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,615
The First Lady?

108
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,410
The former ambassador.

109
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,705
We're closer in Kansas,
but still not close enough.

110
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,624
Did you speak to Jefferies
when you were there for the House vote?

111
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,335
He's leaning on Fred Simms.

112
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,503
If Simms could deliver
two or three delegates--

113
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,588
That could push Kansas over the edge.

114
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,797
I can call Womack.

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,091
He's got some friends
over the border.

116
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,176
- What about Pawley?
- Pawley?

117
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,428
Sheriff Pawley in Fort Worth,
old family friend of my dad's.

118
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,847
He's close with some superdelegates
from Dallas.

119
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:11,974
Yes, he's on board.

120
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,100
Gotta love those sheriffs.

121
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,352
- That's how we do in Louisiana.
- What about Enright?

122
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,062
I'm meeting him for coffee
at the Hyatt.

123
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,896
In fact, I better get going.
I don't wanna be late.

124
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,815
Now, if we could lock up Virginia--

125
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,192
It would send a very big message.

126
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,111
And then Kentucky next.

127
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,071
He's got a big old crush on you.

128
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,780
We better get you on a move.

129
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,408
Enright is a stickler for punctuality.

130
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,411
You know, I'm having fun.
I forgot how much I miss being whip.

131
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,830
You whip 'em.
I'll sweet talk 'em.

132
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,332
Nothing like leather
and sugar.

133
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,876
Sir?

134
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,170
Senator Sheer.

135
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,881
Senator, you did a fine job.

136
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,260
Yeah, I better get prime time,
not one of these midmorning speeches.

137
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,014
Eight o'clock, Wednesday night.
I called Patti myself.

138
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:57,144
Do you know the main thing that separates
a politician from the rest of the species?

139
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,854
A politician is the one
who would drown a litter of kittens

140
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,399
for ten minutes of prime time.

141
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,943
Secretary Durant.
Editor in chief, <i>Politico.</i>

142
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,445
It's all right.

143
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,864
Adam, are you covering this yourself?

144
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,866
First open one since '68.

145
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,202
It's humid as hell, though.
I just got here and I'm already soaked.

146
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,453
On the plus side,

147
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,830
I hear they have
the best strip clubs in the country.

148
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,707
Can I ask you a couple questions?

149
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,002
- Well, I'm in a hurry.
- Just a couple.

150
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,170
Nothing on the record.

151
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,381
Tell me about the rumors

152
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,675
regarding the deal you struck
with Petrov in Brandenburg.

153
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,093
What rumors?

154
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,720
That it was the First Lady
who brokered the deal, not you.

155
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,391
It was a team effort.
Who is your source?

156
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,435
I can't.
You know that.

157
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,312
Well, I'm afraid
that's all the time I've got.

158
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,438
Have a good trip, Adam.

159
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,695
<i>The president was on site
this morning for a press briefing</i>

160
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,448
<i>at the Truxton Marquis
with Karen Williams,</i>

161
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
<i>the mother of Daniel Williams,</i>

162
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,410
<i>the organ donor
who provided his liver.</i>

163
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,122
<i>Alongside him were all
of the donor organs' recipients.</i>

164
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,958
<i>Ms. Williams took time
to speak with each recipient</i>

165
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,711
<i>whose life was saved
in the wake of her son's passing.</i>

166
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,421
<i>The president used this solemn event</i>

167
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,507
<i>to express his gratitude
for those who share their lives</i>

168
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>for the health and welfare of others,</i>

169
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,387
<i>whether through organ donation
or through their work.</i>

170
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,723
<i>The president's condition
has improved dramatically</i>

171
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,391
<i>since his organ donation.</i>

172
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,229
<i>The entire country was on edge
throughout his time in the hospital.</i>

173
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,605
<i>Sixteen-year-old Daniel,</i>

174
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,857
<i>who saved President Underwood
from his health crisis,</i>

175
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,319
<i>left this world by giving back
to so many others</i>

176
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,571
<i>he never expected to touch.</i>

177
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,075
<i>Lasting tributes like this
will not be forgotten.</i>

178
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:40,037
<i>Currently, there are more
than 122,000 men, women and children</i>

179
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,290
<i>seeking an organ transplant each year,</i>

180
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,294
<i>most common needs being
the kidney, liver, and heart.</i>

181
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>And while the number of donors
has increased over the years,</i>

182
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,968
<i>recipients are still in for a long,
potentially fatal waiting period</i>

183
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,139
<i>before a healthy, matching organ
becomes available.</i>

184
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,392
<i>Waiting lists for these types
of transplants</i>

185
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,644
<i>can last from days
to months on end.</i>

186
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,979
<i>Although President Underwood's
critical condition</i>

187
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,023
<i>pushed him to the top of the donor list,</i>

188
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,235
<i>he was fortunate to have received
a donation in time.</i>

189
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,446
<i>Many status one,
or most in-need patients</i>

190
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>do not receive a transplant
in time to save their lives.</i>

191
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,289
Tennessee!
You have 77 votes.

192
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,873
How do you cast them?

193
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,708
From the Volunteer State...

194
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,794
<i>The president will be
with you in a moment.</i>

195
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,673
<i>...we cast 73 votes for vice president
to Secretary Catherine Durant,</i>

196
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,634
<i>and four votes
to Senator Joseph Baker.</i>

197
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,512
- <i>Cathy!</i>
- The meeting with Enright went well.

198
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:41,057
I put a call into him afterwards.
He said you charmed him.

199
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,185
- That puts us where?
- Nine-forty-nine.

200
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,978
We won't make this ballot,
but we're getting close.

201
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,730
Next one.
I'm sure of it.

202
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,357
Let's talk once
we get the final numbers.

203
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,067
Will do. Bye.

204
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,196
<i>- Texas, you have 237 votes.</i>
- Do you have my call list for tonight?

205
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,822
<i>How do you cast them?</i>

206
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,032
<i>Madam Secretary,
my name is Ruiz Trejo.</i>

207
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,411
I see.
Uh, I ran into Giovanni in the elevator.

208
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,120
You can cross him off.

209
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,373
And cross off Milford.

210
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,084
She said she's gonna
back Baker till the bitter end.

211
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,338
<i>We cast all of our votes
to our native daughter,</i>

212
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,422
<i>the First Lady,</i>

213
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,467
<i>and the future Vice President
of the United States of America,</i>

214
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,594
<i>Claire Underwood.</i>

215
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,095
<i>Thank you, Texas.
And thank--</i>

216
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,521
All 237? Nice.

217
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,316
My mother brought
the hammer down on the holdouts.

218
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,611
I just emailed you
my donor lists for Austin and Houston.

219
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,488
Should be at least
two million in the bank.

220
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,655
- Ms. Jones.
- Oh, that's great.

221
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,366
Oh, I gotta go.
The cameras are here.

222
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,453
Ms. Jones, the entire state
for the First Lady. Will you comment?

223
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,331
I think our unanimous vote
is all the commentary you need.

224
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,666
Now, the president endorsed your race, uh,

225
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,668
your mother's vacant seat,
uh, during the State of the Union.

226
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,380
He sure did,
and I'm proud to be the front-runner.

227
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,964
Did that endorsement
have anything to do

228
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,091
with your support
of the First Lady?

229
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,136
<i>Look, I won't deny that
the Underwoods have been good to me.</i>

230
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,472
<i>But no. They asked me
to vote for Catherine Durant.</i>

231
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,892
<i>And while I think Secretary Durant
would be a wonderful woman for the job,</i>

232
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,437
<i>I think Claire is the best woman
for the job.</i>

233
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,652
Well, I really appreciate it, Diane,
and I know Cathy will as well.

234
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,780
All right, we'll speak soon.

235
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,198
New draft.

236
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,787
LeAnn wanted me
to work in some phrases...

237
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,830
and keyword amplifiers.

238
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,542
All I'm asking
is that you make the call.

239
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,294
He'll listen if it comes from you.

240
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,378
It seems very clunky.

241
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,712
I agree.

242
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,007
Is there a way to...

243
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,551
put in what she wants and make it...

244
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,718
- more elegant?
- He's still pissed

245
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,137
about that limp-dick defense bill
I killed when I was whip...

246
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,474
Maybe...
but I have my limitations.

247
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,852
Well, you don't have much faith
in her analytics, I don't think.

248
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,354
It's paint by numbers.

249
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,564
Yes, well, she also says

250
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,692
that you've been alienating
some of the other speechwriters.

251
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,611
Eh, well, their mediocrity
is what's alienating them.

252
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,572
I'm allergic to it.

253
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,408
- I work better alone.
- Let me speak to Bryce

254
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,410
and then see what I can do.

255
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,037
That's right.
WestCAM should do it.

256
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,123
Uh-huh. Well, tonight if you can.

257
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,667
The morning is fine if you can't...

258
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,670
I have to go.
Let's discuss the speech later.

259
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,879
Hmm.

260
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:21,133
Yeah, all I need is just three more
from your state and we've got it.

261
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,052
Yes, just a... just a few more.

262
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,346
Like, three.

263
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,640
Yes, and so do I.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

264
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,808
Good night.

265
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,936
- Tom.
- Hmm.

266
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,814
I feel like we haven't even
had a chance to say hello

267
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,399
since you came on board.

268
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,484
You're a busy man.

269
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,486
I don't know the opposite.

270
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,029
It has its upsides.
Like sleep.

271
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,574
And friends.

272
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,618
How's the, uh...

273
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,578
Oh...

274
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,288
You know,
if it weren't for the pills,

275
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,459
I could go through entire days
without even thinking about it.

276
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,379
I wonder what that kid would think...

277
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,465
if he knew that part of him
was inside of the president's body.

278
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,884
Tragic, huh?

279
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,594
But, then again,

280
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,597
one man's tragedy
is another man's treasure,

281
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,432
- isn't that right?
- Trash.

282
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,767
What?

283
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,478
"One man's trash."
That's how the saying goes.

284
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,104
Oh, right.

285
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,148
How's the speech coming?

286
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,776
Uh...

287
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,737
Well, this is for the introduction
to your acceptance speech, but...

288
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,448
shouldn't it be
for her own acceptance?

289
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,911
You want Claire to win,
not Durant.

290
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,705
A First Lady as the...
That's ludicrous.

291
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,542
I don't think so.

292
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,251
And I don't think you do either.

293
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,461
Oh...

294
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,755
Maybe I'm wrong.

295
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,801
But if I'm right...

296
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,182
she's gonna need the speech
to end all speeches.

297
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,600
And it would be good
for me to know that.

298
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,271
I have some more work to do.

299
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,860
Governor!
How are you?

300
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,862
Yeah, well,
I wish I was in Oregon, too,

301
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,030
but I'm here in Atlanta

302
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,450
where it's muggier
than a street hooker's twat.

303
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,663
<i>I am honored to be mentioned
with Secretary Durant and Senator Baker.</i>

304
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,665
<i>They're seasoned politicians.</i>

305
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,916
<i>But I already have a job,</i>

306
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,960
First Lady of the United States.

307
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,378
Well, Texas is over 5% of the vote.

308
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,757
And my home state,
so let's not make more of it than it is.

309
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,925
Claire!

310
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,053
Congratulations.
I think you're in fifth place now.

311
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,722
Yeah, with you in first,
where you should be.

312
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,477
Secretary Durant,
do you think the First Lady has a shot?

313
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,480
I think Texas just gave her one.

314
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,190
Kidding aside, do you think
she has the foreign policy experience?

315
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,485
It's beside the point.
And like I said this morning,

316
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,112
I encourage everyone, including Texas,

317
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,655
to vote for Secretary Durant.

318
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,740
Mrs. Underwood--

319
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,075
You know what, if you'll excuse me,
I want to get back to the phones,

320
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,243
make sure Cathy gets this nomination.

321
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,911
- Thank you.
- May I have a moment?

322
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,455
Oh, of course.

323
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,754
Did anyone ask you
about Brandenburg

324
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,172
or any of your people
and your involvement there?

325
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,382
- Brandenburg?
- Hmm.

326
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,509
No, we put that to bed.

327
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,843
That's what I thought,

328
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,220
which is why I was surprised
when Adam Gould told me

329
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,640
that he had sources saying
you deserved all the credit.

330
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,433
We all agreed to what
our version of the story is,

331
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,936
so somebody isn't toeing the line.

332
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,689
Well, I'm sure it's not White House staff.

333
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,191
I bet he's just fishing,
trying to start some rivalry.

334
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:27,153
Well, I'd be grateful,
if he asks you, or anyone else--

335
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,156
Of course.
And I've been sticking to our story...

336
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,825
which it was you that got
the Russians to back down,

337
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,326
and I was just there to support you.

338
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,037
That wouldn't look good
to the delegates,

339
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,541
the fact that you met
with Petrov without me.

340
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,208
It would look like
I wasn't in command of--

341
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,045
No one needs to know
what we discussed.

342
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,297
You have nothing to worry about, Cathy.
Honestly.

343
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,134
Well, yeah.
I can get you on the phone

344
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,596
with the Secretary of Agriculture,
but if you want drought relief,

345
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm gonna need more than
just Stevens and Lopez.

346
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,642
Has anything been set up with Baker yet?

347
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,018
Tomorrow morning, in his room.

348
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,436
Well, that's cutting it close.

349
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,980
He's at a big dinner with the Florida
congressional delegation tonight.

350
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,774
Well, all right, and call me back.

351
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,317
The rumors have gotten to Cathy.

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,362
Well, we did want them to spread.
That was the idea.

353
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,114
I think one of us needs to speak with her.

354
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,075
Yeah, but the plan was
to wait till it was inevitable.

355
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,036
If we don't involve her sooner than later,
Francis, she could turn on us.

356
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,539
All right, you take
your meeting with Baker.

357
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,541
- I'll talk to Cathy. You set that up.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,418
How much are you going to say?

359
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,421
Just enough to prepare her.

360
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,967
Yeah...

361
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,555
A lot of calls about
Mrs. Underwood in Russia.

362
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,639
Denying?

363
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,850
Ignoring, which is the same as confirming.

364
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,935
- Good.
- Claire in there?

365
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,687
She's speaking privately
with the president.

366
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,521
Oh, I'm sure she won't mind.

367
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,199
Where are we with LeAnn?

368
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,619
- She's clean.
- No.

369
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,621
I refuse to believe that.

370
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:03,916
Doug, if our campaign manager
bites the dust, that hurts us.

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,752
I gave you a task.

372
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,881
And I'll keep at it.

373
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,636
Nice coverage on the liver thing
this morning.

374
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,763
I emailed you some links.

375
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,978
Boys are older now,
both married.

376
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,313
Got a third grandkid on the way.

377
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,483
We don't get out
to the lake much these days.

378
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,318
Washington takes its toll.

379
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,737
It sure does.

380
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,531
I've made a lot of sacrifices
over the years, Mrs. Underwood.

381
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,449
Time with my boys,
that's a big one.

382
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,995
Who knows if I'll win,
but I'm in the mix.

383
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,999
And I can't sacrifice this opportunity
to pave the way for Cathy Durant.

384
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,334
You won't win, Senator.
We both know that.

385
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,045
But I can't help her.

386
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,005
Now, I realize you two don't get along.

387
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,089
She despises me.

388
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,883
And I have to say,
the feeling is mutual.

389
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,343
- Well, listen--
- The moment she became Secretary of State,

390
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,931
she got the Republicans to remove me
from the Foreign Relations Committee.

391
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,058
And Francis was very upset about that.

392
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,144
But that was the past.

393
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,563
Let's talk about the future.

394
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,483
This support for Claire,
it's caught us both off guard.

395
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,485
But you are my choice for vice president.

396
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,862
Nothing has changed on that front.

397
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,989
Well, my only concern are the rumors.

398
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,449
They could damage my chances.

399
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,118
Yes. And we'll do
what we can to combat those.

400
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,204
That's what Claire said, too,
and it's much appreciated.

401
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:29,043
But, if, and--
Oh, God, it's a big if.

402
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,419
But what if...

403
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,839
support for Claire picks up steam...

404
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,799
Well, you don't actually
think that will happen?

405
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,927
Oh, no.
I mean, a First Lady as VP?

406
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,053
No.

407
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,889
The party wants someone with experience,
and so does the country.

408
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,349
Absolutely.

409
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,936
But... it is an open convention,

410
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,522
and so we have to operate with the belief
that anything could happen.

411
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,025
I mean, the press
is certainly enjoying imagining it.

412
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,111
Well, sure.
It makes for a good story.

413
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,491
Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage
that we can't really control.

414
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,617
You know, I mean,

415
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,787
these things have a way
of taking on a life of their own.

416
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,290
Like the Zoe Barnes story did about
my nomination for Secretary of State.

417
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,751
Except that one we planted.

418
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,128
- And this one you didn't.
- No, absolutely not!

419
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,089
I mean, Claire was mortified
by those votes.

420
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,427
What you're saying is if the coverage
influences enough people...

421
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,764
Well, we have to be prepared for that.

422
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,390
I mean...

423
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,308
of course, politically,
it would be a disaster.

424
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,852
Maybe, maybe not.

425
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,939
You don't think so?

426
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:34,525
Well, personally,
I think Claire would do an excellent job.

427
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,863
Well, I am very surprised
to hear you say that.

428
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,031
You don't believe she would?

429
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,869
Well, I've just
never really considered it.

430
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,539
The First Lady?
As vice president?

431
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,167
Well, 251 delegates
think it's a good idea.

432
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,294
Well, most of those were from Texas,
which was a lark.

433
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,130
Was it?

434
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,802
I have as many delegates
as you do, Senator.

435
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,554
- But if you start pushing yours my way...
- You double.

436
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,847
And take the lead.

437
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,433
- And then Cathy puts you over the top.
- That's the idea.

438
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,310
So she's in on this?

439
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,270
She will be.

440
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:17,318
Well, let's say Claire does take the lead,
however unlikely that may be...

441
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,528
- Very unlikely, I would say.
- Well, let's say she does.

442
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,863
What do you propose?

443
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,577
I honestly don't know.

444
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,372
Well...

445
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,375
Well, you'd have to support her,
wouldn't you?

446
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,044
You... you can't abandon
your own wife.

447
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,588
Uh, true, but I can't abandon you either.

448
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,299
Well, if she took the lead,
I suppose I'd have to support her, too.

449
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,218
No, I would never ask you to do that.

450
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,179
But you don't have to ask.
We're on the same team here.

451
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,639
Well, to be perfectly blunt...

452
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,433
what's in it for me?

453
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,684
What would it take?

454
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,812
You're doing the selling.
Make me an offer.

455
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,022
Let's say Claire gets it.

456
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,191
I assume I stay on,
if you get the general.

457
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,275
Oh, absolutely.

458
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,612
I cannot imagine the next four years
without you being my Secretary of...

459
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,114
...State.

460
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,909
You'd give me Cathy's job?

461
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,411
We're prepared to.

462
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,672
- Doug.
- Madam Secretary.

463
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,761
We have an issue, sir.

464
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,473
<i>When I first warned
the president that ICO would grow,</i>

465
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,683
<i>and grow quickly, he did nothing.</i>

466
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,478
Yesterday, the leaders of ICO
sent out this tweet.

467
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:40,317
<i>"As Suwar is ours.
Soon heads will roll into the Euphrates."</i>

468
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,778
<i>That wasn't just in Arabic,
that was in English,</i>

469
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,739
and sent out in 16 other languages.

470
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,866
They're media savvy,
they're recruiting around the globe.

471
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,327
They have the money
and the manpower now.

472
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,954
Once they get to the Euphrates,

473
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,123
they'll have a choke hold
on northern Syria.

474
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,335
<i>We must act, Mr. President,
and we must act now.</i>

475
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,089
Normally, there's a tradition
of sportsmanship

476
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,715
when it comes to conventions.

477
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,259
One candidate lays low

478
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,387
so the other gets his or her
moment in the spotlight.

479
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,059
But not only is the president ignoring
a great threat to the world's security,

480
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,479
he's insulted the one man
who stood up and spoke out for us all.

481
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:23,235
When this profile came out about
everything the general just mentioned,

482
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,863
the White House said that
he was politicizing terrorism.

483
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,866
And when I announced
that General Brockhart

484
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,160
was going to be my running mate,

485
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,080
the president's campaign said,
and I quote,

486
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,792
"It's a shame the general
traded in patriotism for careerism."

487
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,964
<i>Now, I don't call that very sportsmanlike.</i>

488
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,715
<i>I call it disgraceful.</i>

489
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,843
<i>How many wars has the president
fought for his country?</i>

490
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,471
<i>I think we all know, none.</i>

491
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,558
And he questions the patriotism
of a man who has fought in many?

492
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,228
You hear me, Mr. President.

493
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,189
<i>I demand that you do
something about ICO.</i>

494
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,899
<i>And I demand that you make
an apology to the general.</i>

495
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,611
<i>And we're not leaving Atlanta
until you've done both.</i>

496
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,405
Live on every network right now.

497
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,033
I gotta hand it to him.

498
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,284
I wonder if this was his idea,

499
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,453
'cause it's almost something
like I would do.

500
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,415
We ignore him. It's 95 degrees.
Let him sweat it out.

501
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,460
I think the longer we ignore him,
the more attention they'll get.

502
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,544
I agree with LeAnn.

503
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:24,630
So apologize.

504
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,340
It's only pride.

505
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,926
I can do it if you want, sir.
I wrote the statement.

506
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,720
No, it only works
if it comes from Francis.

507
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,598
Claire's right.

508
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,059
And we can do more than just apologize.

509
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,645
I can meet with the bastard.

510
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,774
The issues the governor
and the general raise are important ones.

511
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:48,695
They transcend party affiliations
and, quite frankly, politics.

512
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,408
And so in that spirit,
I'm inviting the governor

513
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,576
to come here and join me,

514
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,788
so that we can have
a conversation privately because...

515
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,458
whoever becomes the president
is going to have to deal with ICO

516
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,045
and all of the other terrorist threats
that we face around the globe.

517
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:10,384
So I'm looking forward to hearing whatever
ideas and solutions that they may have...

518
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,845
because a smart president
will steal good ideas from anyone.

519
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,057
Let's kill them with kindness, shall we?

520
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,898
- Governor.
<i>- Mr. President.</i>

521
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,735
<i>Would you please
put the general on the line?</i>

522
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,199
Sir?

523
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,033
General...

524
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,036
your service to this country
is greatly valued

525
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,623
and your patriotism is without doubt.

526
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,960
And in the heat of the campaign,
well, we went too far.

527
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,421
We issued statements
that we shouldn't have,

528
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,716
and for that I want to apologize,
and I do hope that you will accept it.

529
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,761
Far more important to me than an apology
is eliminating ICO, Mr. President.

530
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,513
I couldn't agree with your more, General.

531
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,932
If you'd be so kind as to put
the governor back on the phone.

532
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,563
I received your invitation, Mr. President.

533
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,523
And will you join us, Governor?

534
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,235
Only if it leads to real action,
not just talk.

535
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,861
<i>I can promise you, Governor,</i>

536
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,780
and the rest of America
that it will not just be talk.

537
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,992
Then, yes. If it truly leads
to securing our freedom.

538
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,495
Thank you very much.
I look forward to seeing you.

539
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,247
Thank you all very much.

540
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,082
Right this way, Governor.

541
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,212
Do you think this a good idea?

542
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,964
What choice do I have?
He called my bluff.

543
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,065
Welcome, Governor.

544
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,817
Thank you, Mr. President.

545
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,659
I have a room set up for us.

546
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,416
Here.

547
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,252
Have some lunch.

548
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,505
We've got ham,
and I think some turkey.

549
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,632
I'm good, but thanks.

550
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,841
Really?

551
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,761
After the stunt you just pulled,
I would've thought you love ham.

552
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,228
You put this here on purpose.

553
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,272
Well, a little reading material,
you know.

554
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,316
Something to pass the time.

555
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,234
I just got a text from Ben Grant saying

556
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,362
searches for this issue is going
through the roof since we showed up here.

557
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,658
Ben Grant owns Pollyhop...

558
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,202
That's right.

559
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,621
And you own Ben Grant.

560
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,917
Isn't that what power is?
The people you collect?

561
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,962
You really screwed me
with that webcast.

562
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,465
I had everything all planned out.

563
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,718
The Federal Election Commission,
the Department of Justice.

564
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,054
I was looking forward to watching you
go down in flames...

565
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,223
maybe even behind bars.

566
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,975
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your fun.

567
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,269
It's a bit embarrassing,
though, isn't it?

568
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:11,273
I mean, sharing all your most
intimate moments?

569
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,733
Videos of your children?

570
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,819
I'm proud of my family.
Why would I be embarrassed?

571
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,030
Well, just that you have to stoop so low
to win everyone's love.

572
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,116
It feels a bit desperate, doesn't it?

573
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,620
You're 15 points
behind in every poll.

574
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,663
So, if anyone's desperate,
it should be you.

575
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,375
Well, the key to being president
is not only winning your battles,

576
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,667
it's winning them with dignity.

577
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,838
- Should we talk about ICO?
- Oh, God. Why would we want to do that?

578
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,760
It's why we're meeting.

579
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,637
Oh, right.

580
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,473
"Real talk, real action."

581
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,142
That's what you're all about, isn't it?

582
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,271
Well, I suppose we could
if you want to, but...

583
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:54,608
then again we could just take
a break from it all and relax a bit.

584
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,530
Oh... God.

585
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,114
This turkey tastes like rubber.

586
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,741
Well, it's better than eating a real one.

587
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,243
Hmm?

588
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,538
Oh, I always wear protection when I'm
getting my dick sucked by the Democrats.

589
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,084
You okay?

590
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,963
I'm fine. I'm fine.

591
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,553
Don't make me laugh when I'm eating.
I nearly choked to death.

592
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,471
Well, that is one way for me
to become president.

593
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,143
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

594
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,479
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

595
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,105
Hmm.

596
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,485
Do you mind if I take these off?

597
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,406
They're brand new
and I'm still breaking 'em in.

598
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,873
You like to play video games, right?

599
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,460
Now, how did you hear about that?

600
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,003
Tom Yates.

601
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,255
Oh, yes.

602
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,050
Tom Yates.

603
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,512
That's one person you weren't
able to collect, were you?

604
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,474
What did you do to get him back?

605
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:13,269
Oh, look, I'm sure he was tempted.
He is a fiction writer, after all.

606
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,188
You're a New York Republican.

607
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,773
That's an attractive fiction, isn't it?

608
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:20,402
And you're a Democrat from South Carolina,
that's even bigger fiction.

609
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,528
Well, there you go.

610
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,573
And I'm a New York Republican,
which is basically a Democrat.

611
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,076
If you were a Democrat,
you'd be unstoppable.

612
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,870
You'd be the new JFK.

613
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,331
And if you were a Republican,
who'd you be? Nixon?

614
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,792
Nixon was a far more effective president.

615
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,879
The only reason people glorify Kennedy
is because he got shot.

616
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,172
Well, you've got that going for you,
too, now, don't you?

617
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,676
And you've got your search engine
and all your little home videos.

618
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,178
See, if people want a piece of you...

619
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,765
you give it to them, right?

620
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,018
Oh, is that what people want?

621
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,227
A piece of you?

622
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,654
Do you play video games?

623
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,781
No. My kids do.

624
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:14,080
There's this one game that
my son Charlie, he loves to play.

625
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,874
It's called <i>Agar.io.</i>

626
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,545
I have to admit, I might have played it
a couple of times myself.

627
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,049
You start out as a little dot.

628
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,178
And then you go around eating
these other dots and you get bigger.

629
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,016
And the bigger you get, you gotta avoid
getting eaten by the bigger players.

630
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,268
Meanwhile, you're trying to eat
the smaller players.

631
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,813
Hmm. Sounds a little like
running for president.

632
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,609
So, are you playing with
real people right now?

633
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:43,819
Yeah. From all over the world.

634
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,573
- Here, you try it.
- Hmm.

635
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,242
- Oh, I got eaten.
- Press that.

636
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,829
Ah, oh, I see.
It makes you small again.

637
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,540
Yeah, you gotta start over
from square one every single time.

638
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:59,042
Oh, God.
I got eaten again.

639
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:02,838
I wonder what the other players
would think

640
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,631
if they knew who
they were playing against.

641
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,008
Oh, I'm rather enjoying the anonymity.

642
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,302
<i>This is unprecedented.</i>

643
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,054
<i>The president and Governor Conway</i>

644
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,098
<i>are meeting right now
at the convention hall.</i>

645
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,975
<i>Two candidates, face to face.</i>

646
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,935
<i>They've been in there
for about ten minutes,</i>

647
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,020
<i>supposedly discussing
the ICO situation.</i>

648
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,314
<i>Now, while the private meeting
between the two candidates</i>

649
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,399
<i>continues behind closed doors,</i>

650
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:26,737
<i>delegates on the floor are gearing up
for the next round of voting for...</i>

651
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,363
We should head down.
The next ballot is starting soon.

652
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,073
- I'll be down in a minute.
<i>- In the second round of voting</i>

653
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,742
<i>a quarter of the delegates
changed their votes,</i>

654
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:35,161
<i>support for First Lady Claire Underwood
is picking up steam,</i>

655
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,122
<i>thanks in part to today's breaking story</i>

656
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,751
<i>about Mrs. Underwood's involvement
in the Brandenburg negotiations.</i>

657
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,294
<i>A single vote from Senator Scott Sheer</i>

658
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,006
<i>expanded to support
from the entire Texas delegation.</i>

659
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,763
Oh. You've, uh, got a call.

660
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,891
Yeah, I better take that.
They only call if it's important.

661
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,269
Yeah, this is Will.

662
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,941
Yes, put it through.

663
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,318
- Um, excuse me.
- Sure.

664
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,867
Go ahead.

665
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,464
Damn!
Nothing.

666
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,926
The fog of war.

667
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,428
A back room within a back room.

668
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:37,223
Whatever's being plotted in there,
I can tell you it's no good for me.

669
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,685
You know, it's at times like these
I wish I was Nixon,

670
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,812
had every nook and cranny bugged.

671
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,940
- Mr. President?
<i>- Your colleague.</i>

672
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,775
How targeted can he get?

673
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,153
We really shouldn't be
discussing this over the phone.

674
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,781
Can he isolate a specific person?

675
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,201
Technically, yes, but--

676
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,368
A conversation?

677
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,706
There are catch mechanisms
in the program to prevent that.

678
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,084
He can override, but it leaves a trail.
He's still figuring out how to mask it.

679
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,378
Our friend from New York.
I want to know what he's saying right now.

680
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,134
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

681
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,803
I also advise that we hang up.

682
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,429
<i>All right, I'm hanging up.</i>

683
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,646
Governor, should we head out?

684
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,522
Just a moment,
Mr. President.

685
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,150
<i>There's a great deal
of anticipation in Atlanta...</i>

686
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,235
Who was that?

687
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,988
The president.
He just wanted the latest delegate count.

688
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,698
<i>...and we're minutes away
from the next ballot.</i>

689
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,450
<i>Here's a graphic
of the last round yesterday.</i>

690
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:40,536
<i>Secretary Catherine Durant
led the way with 22% of delegates.</i>

691
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,955
Doug hates it.

692
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,750
He hates what?

693
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,670
That you have direct access to
the president without going through him.

694
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,381
He wants you gone.

695
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,800
Doug told you that?

696
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,638
He wants me to dig something up on you.

697
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,307
I haven't found anything yet.

698
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,685
And you won't,
because there isn't anything.

699
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,229
I know.
Otherwise, I would've found it by now.

700
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:09,941
Why are you telling me this?

701
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:14,195
Because either you're gone or I am,
if I don't deliver.

702
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,990
Unless you give me something.

703
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,535
<i>...First Lady Claire Underwood,
a surprising fifth place show...</i>

704
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,954
It can be small.
Nothing too damaging.

705
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,666
Just so I have
something to show him.

706
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,292
<i>In my 30 years of covering
presidential politics,</i>

707
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,085
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

708
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,173
Sorry about that.

709
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,758
That's all right.

710
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,928
Shall we go out?
The next ballot is about to start.

711
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,137
You want to watch it together?

712
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,808
It might look better,
the longer we're in here.

713
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,560
Like we grappled
with the future of America.

714
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,230
Unless you'd rather be
out there with the masses.

715
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,274
Oh, Christ.
The masses.

716
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,234
- I feel the same way.
<i>- We will now commence</i>

717
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,610
<i>the third ballot</i>

718
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:58,782
<i>for the nomination of our party's
vice presidential candidate.</i>

719
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,284
We will start with Alabama.

720
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,036
Madam Secretary,

721
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,708
the great state of Alabama,
for Vice President of the United States,

722
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,336
casts 29 votes
for Secretary Catherine Durant,

723
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,798
<i>26 votes for the First Lady
Claire Underwood,</i>

724
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,884
<i>and our three remaining votes
for the Mayor of Mobile,</i>

725
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,261
<i>Alabama's own Jane Winthrop.</i>

726
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,013
Roll Tide!

727
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,224
Alaska, you're next.

728
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,852
Eight votes for Secretary of State Durant,

729
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:29,855
six votes for Senator Joseph Baker,

730
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,941
four votes for First Lady
Claire Underwood.

731
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,985
<i>California,</i>

732
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:39,114
you have 476 votes.

733
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,993
Two hundred and thirty-three
for Catherine Durant,

734
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:48,414
<i>152 for Joseph Baker,
91 for Claire Underwood.</i>

735
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,709
<i>That's huge for the First Lady.</i>

736
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,336
<i>That puts her in third,
and she's closing in on second.</i>

737
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,670
Delaware.

738
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,340
Twelve for Durant,

739
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,259
11 for Claire Underwood,

740
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,052
four for Baker.

741
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,638
Hawaii,
you're next.

742
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,266
Seventeen for the First Lady,

743
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,937
<i>and 14 for Secretary of State
Catherine Durant.</i>

744
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,856
She's got a real shot.

745
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,399
Unbelievable!

746
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,778
Well, not so unbelievable.

747
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,781
Forty-four votes for Catherine Durant,

748
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,909
35 votes for Claire Underwood.

749
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,660
Louisiana,

750
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,038
you have 61 votes.

751
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:29,998
How do you cast them?

752
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,082
Madam Secretary...

753
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:37,588
Louisiana casts its 61 votes
for President of the United States

754
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,176
to Secretary of State Catherine Durant.

755
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,764
<i>Louisiana,
I assume you mean vice president.</i>

756
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,390
<i>I mean president.</i>

757
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,852
<i>Madam Secretary,
the state of Louisiana</i>

758
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,229
believes this convention
should be open

759
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,942
for all parts of the ticket,
including president.

760
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,612
Louisiana!

761
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,033
Louisiana!

762
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,704
<i>As the convention agreed
to yesterday morning,</i>

763
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,792
<i>we are taking vice presidential
nominations first,</i>

764
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:18,713
<i>in order for that process
to take place over the full convention.</i>

765
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,592
<i>We have one candidate for president.</i>

766
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,848
<i>Any further discussion
on that balloting will be taken up</i>

767
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:32,727
<i>after the vice presidential
nomination process is complete.</i>

768
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:37,899
If you do not cast your votes,
you will forfeit them.

769
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,820
Madam Secretary, we, Louisiana,

770
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,365
<i>cast our 61 votes for vice president,</i>

771
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,826
also for Catherine Durant.

772
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,040
Louisiana.

773
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,167
<i>I work for the man.
I'm on his cabinet.</i>

774
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,295
Would you run against him
if his nomination were in play?

775
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,631
My goal is to run with the president,
not against him.

776
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,300
<i>Look, I love my home state
of Louisiana,</i>

777
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,052
<i>- but they're a live bunch...</i>
- She'd do a good job.

778
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,720
She's a much better
Secretary of State, though.

779
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,680
<i>I'm confident this will all
work itself out.</i>

780
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,432
I've considered keeping her on
after you lose.

781
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,977
<i>Have you spoken to
President Underwood about their defection?</i>

782
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,604
<i>Not yet, but I'll be speaking
with him shortly, I imagine.</i>

783
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,314
<i>Hey, this is part of what a...</i>

784
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,233
- Your call.
<i>- ...convention is all about.</i>

785
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:25,113
I wish I could take credit,
but... but she called me.

786
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,032
Then again,
when opportunity strikes...

787
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,283
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

788
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,120
Definitely not the way
to win with dignity.

789
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,455
<i>...Durant commenting
on her home state of Louisiana.</i>

790
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,999
If you win at all.

791
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,213
We should get back out there.
You've got a nomination to fight for.

792
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,887
The president and I, we had a great talk.

793
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,097
We, uh, even watched
the vote together.

794
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,391
But I'm sure you'd rather hear
from him on that than me.

795
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,600
Well, thank you, Governor.

796
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:59,272
Today has certainly been
full of surprises, hasn't it?

797
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,109
But, then again, Louisiana is the state
that gave us Huey Long after all.

798
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,528
As much as I would like to discuss this,

799
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,988
I have to get on with the business

800
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,698
that the governor and I
have just discussed,

801
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,660
because the business
of the presidency trumps running for it.

802
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,120
- Thank you, Governor.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

803
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,246
Thank you all very much.

804
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,373
I'm happy to answer...

805
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,167
I want Cathy in my room, now.

806
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,710
I already called her.
She refuses to meet.

807
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,295
- She what?
- That's what she said,

808
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,671
and then she hung up.

809
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,256
Her staff won't return my calls either.

810
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,850
For this to work,
you have to go back to Washington.

811
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,685
I can't leave
while you're dealing with this.

812
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,980
If you stay, it will look like
you're taking advantage

813
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,106
and campaigning for it.

814
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,649
And the key is to make it
look like you're not.

815
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,775
I'll speak with Cathy.

816
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,444
No, look, I've got that covered.

817
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,863
Question is,
how we justify your going.

818
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,202
It's not Washington.

819
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,704
It should be Texas.

820
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,251
- Your mother.
- It worked before.

821
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,628
I'll leave first thing in the morning.

822
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,339
Take Tom with you.

823
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,674
- Tom?
- Oh, he already knows.

824
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,011
- Did you tell him?
- He put it together.

825
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:14,597
He said,
if you win this thing...

826
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,892
you have to give the speech
of a lifetime, and he's right.

827
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,936
Whatever you say
in that convention hall

828
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,649
will lay the groundwork for how we
sell this to the rest of the country.

829
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,737
And that is why
we brought him back, right?

830
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,889
You can sleep like that?
Sitting up?

831
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,809
I can sleep anywhere.

832
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,269
I'm lucky like that.

833
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,690
We have work to do.

834
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,735
All right, let's work.

835
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,825
This could be better.

836
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:21,247
Read it for me.
Out loud.

837
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,794
"I've been my husband's partner
in marriage for 29 years."

838
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,920
No.

839
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,298
Slower.

840
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,592
Like you're going to say it
at the convention.

841
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,431
"I've been my husband's
partner in marriage

842
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,391
for 29 years.

843
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,768
Now, it's time for me to be..."

844
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,566
So I can see your face.

845
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,204
"I've been my husband's partner
in marriage for 29 years.

846
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:06,292
Now, it's time for me to be his partner
in the White House for the next four."

847
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:09,545
You're right.

848
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,881
