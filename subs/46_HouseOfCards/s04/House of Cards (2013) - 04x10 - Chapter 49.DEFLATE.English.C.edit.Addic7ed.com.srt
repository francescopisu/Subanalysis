00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,193
"She squared off
<i>mano-a-mano</i> with Petrov

3
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,487
to finalize the bailout deal.

4
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,657
Meanwhile, Secretary Durant
twiddled her thumbs,

5
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,117
waiting without a seat
at the bargaining table."

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,994
Pretty wild, huh?

7
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,748
- When was that posted?
- 3:00 a.m.

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,046
You should go.

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,343
- No breakfast, even?
- I have work to do.

10
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,595
Welcome back. It's a dramatic day.
Let's see where things stand.

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,056
And, Wolf, you can see the big change.

12
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,433
Catherine Durant now on
our presidential nominating wall.

13
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,811
She has shifted
from vice presidential hopeful

14
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,437
to potential presidential candidate.

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,190
And a Durant candidacy
might be appealing to Democrats

16
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,694
who aren't enthusiastic
about either Underwood or Dunbar.

17
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,571
And imagine this scenario if we
play this out through this convention.

18
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,825
Heather Dunbar came out of the primaries,
of course, with 46%.

19
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,326
It's not enough to win the nomination,

20
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,830
but for him to win, President Underwood,
he still needs these superdelegates.

21
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,123
He won the popular vote
when Dunbar withdrew,

22
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,960
but you're saying
he doesn't have a technical majority.

23
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,587
659 superdelegates yet to weigh in,

24
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,965
so you see Frank Underwood
drops down to 48%.

25
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,675
He's still in the lead,
but not enough to clinch the nomination.

26
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,386
And you want a little bit more intrigue,
like we need that?

27
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,223
Twenty-four states, Wolf,
these 24 states highlighted,

28
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,226
they do not have so-called
faithless delegate laws,

29
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,688
meaning in these 24 states,
the delegates don't have to,

30
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,066
they are not legally bound
to vote for the candidate

31
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,776
who won their state's primary or caucus.

32
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,570
- They can vote for whoever they want.
- They could vote for Heather Dunbar.

33
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,072
They could switch over
and vote for Catherine Durant.

34
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,282
Wolf, if they want,
they could vote for you.

35
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,617
They're not gonna vote for me.

36
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,245
But if Secretary Durant
siphons off enough votes

37
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,206
or Underwood doesn't get that majority
in the first ballot,

38
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,665
what, all bets are off?

39
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,626
I think about the only sure bet today is

40
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,130
President Underwood must be wishing
he hadn't agreed to this open convention.

41
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>Does Durant or Dunbar really
have a shot at winning this thing?</i>

42
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,844
<i>Sure. You've got a president
who wasn't elected to begin with.</i>

43
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,054
<i>His health is a giant
question mark right now.</i>

44
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>He's had a rocky tenure,
plus you've got an open convention.</i>

45
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,933
<i>Anything could happen.</i>

46
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,977
<i>Like giving,
uh, Durant a run for her money.</i>

47
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,355
<i>Uh,</i> Slugline, <i>by the way, picked up</i>
<i>the</i> Politico <i>story from yesterday.</i>

48
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,982
<i>It could get traction
out there on the floor.</i>

49
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,192
<i>That's true,
and, again, at an open convention,</i>

50
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:57,195
<i>Claire Underwood may
suddenly be the dark horse here.</i>

51
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,430
Mother.

52
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,768
Hello, Claire.

53
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,942
Why'd you move down here?

54
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:40,738
Hospice lady said I shouldn't be
going up and down stairs anymore.

55
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,868
Besides, I like it.
More light.

56
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,622
Who's that?

57
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,209
Uh, Tom, would you
give us a minute, please?

58
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,376
Sorry.

59
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,129
No, no. Come here, young man.

60
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,716
Hi, Mrs. Hale.

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,384
My name's Tom.

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,138
It's Thomas Yates, the novelist.
You've probably heard of him.

63
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:11,895
Mmm, I think everything since
John Cheever isn't worth readin'.

64
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,816
You're probably right.

65
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,447
Well, Claire... did you come to take stock

66
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,368
of everything you're gonna
inherit when I die?

67
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,081
Hmm. Well, it's convenient, isn't it,

68
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,252
having a dying mother when you need
an excuse to skip town?

69
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,716
We won't disturb you.

70
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,678
It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Hale.

71
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:50,350
- Elizabeth.
- All right. Well, then you call me Tom.

72
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,518
I hate "Thomas."

73
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,899
- Fair enough, Tom.
- We have a deal.

74
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,322
We want a unified party,
not a fractured one.

75
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,699
I can't play fast
and loose with the rules.

76
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,119
This is an open convention.
There are no rules.

77
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,788
I already gave Senator Sheer
that prime-time spot that you wanted.

78
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,873
But this, as chair of the convention--

79
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,253
And I made you chair of this convention
precisely for moments like this.

80
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,630
I have an obligation
to not play favorites.

81
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,883
Your obligation to the party is
an obligation to the leader of the party,

82
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,011
and as the president, that would be me.

83
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,095
- Correct?
- Yes, sir, but--

84
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,807
Then this isn't about favoritism.
It's about solidarity.

85
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,561
We've got a car waiting to take you
to the convention hall, Ms. Whittaker.

86
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,947
I call this convention to order.

87
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,618
Of the Democratic National Committee
and the convention chair, Patti Whittaker.

88
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,499
Good morning.

89
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,047
I was just informed that
the president will travel to Washington

90
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,341
to meet with his national security team.

91
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,220
Given that key contenders
for both slots on the ticket

92
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:14,892
aren't able to be on the floor today,
the Rules Committee has advised that

93
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:19,814
we should wait for their return
before any further votes are held.

94
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:27,280
There is a motion to postpone all votes

95
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,242
until the president's return.

96
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,287
ICO began its advance
from As Suwar late last night,

97
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,456
and by our calculations
and their current pace,

98
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,584
we expect them to reach the Euphrates
within 72 hours.

99
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,337
Now, this could disrupt
highway and river traffic,

100
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,713
but more importantly,

101
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,426
could give them the opportunity to destroy
vital dams in the region.

102
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,138
And as a result,
I am heading to Washington right now

103
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,557
so that we can decide exactly
how we should stop this ICO advance.

104
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,229
Is this sudden change of plans

105
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,189
a result of your meeting
with Governor Conway yesterday?

106
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:05,610
Well, it wouldn't surprise me
if ICO accelerated their plans,

107
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,279
uh, because of the governor's comments.

108
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,198
They certainly know
how to take advantage of media attention.

109
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,866
But whether that's the truth or not,

110
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,411
this is an imminent threat
which we must deal with immediately.

111
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,912
I'm glad the president heard me

112
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,706
and finally took
General Brockhart's advice to heart.

113
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,626
Now we'll just have to wait and see
if it actually results in anything.

114
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,796
I just hope it's not too little, too late.

115
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,923
What are your plans now, Governor?
Remain in Atlanta?

116
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,675
No, Hannah and I are
heading back on the trail.

117
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,428
We accomplished
what we needed to here in Georgia,

118
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,056
and we're heading off
to Arizona today and then Utah.

119
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,515
Mr. President. Mr. President.

120
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,017
Why Washington and not here?

121
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,312
This issue is too sensitive
for a mobile White House.

122
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,938
I need to be in the Situation Room

123
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,941
with my entire staff
and team of advisors around me.

124
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,403
Yes, Adam.

125
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,364
Mr. President, is this a way
to silence Secretary Durant

126
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,117
after Louisiana put her
in the running for president?

127
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,454
I don't use national security matters
for political purposes.

128
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,663
You know that, Adam.

129
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,998
You have any other further questions,
please direct them to Seth.

130
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,125
Thank you all very much.

131
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,296
- You want me to come with?
- No, you stay behind.

132
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,048
- Keep everything under control.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,092
There are reports
that she's left Atlanta.

134
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,593
<i>The First Lady left earlier this morning.</i>

135
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,721
<i>Her mother's health has deteriorated
in the past few days.</i>

136
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,057
<i>- Seth!
- Adam.</i>

137
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,267
<i>Does this mean
she's out of the running for VP?</i>

138
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,644
<i>The First Lady was never in the running.</i>

139
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,522
<i>She and the president continue
to support Catherine Durant--</i>

140
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,575
Father of four, sailor...

141
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,411
staph infection
from stepping on a rusty fish hook.

142
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,912
Heavens!

143
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,040
And this one, yeah, you were a fruit fly.

144
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,377
- A fruit fly.
- Yes.

145
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,462
Oh. Oh, oh...

146
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,383
You were a consort to Rasputin
and his 14-inch...

147
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,801
No, don't say it.

148
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,803
I don't have to say it
because you're already imagining it.

149
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,520
I looked it over.

150
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,606
I'll meet you outside.

151
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,997
Uh, gonna leave all this to Vi
and the girls if you're not interested.

152
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,336
- Grandmother's jewelry?
- Mmm-hmm.

153
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,924
She'd turn over in her grave
if I didn't at least offer it to you.

154
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:38,346
- She had great taste.
- Hmm. Where do you think I got it from?

155
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,059
What's this?

156
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,691
Look at it. Open it up.

157
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,657
Must be worth somethin',
baby teeth of the First Lady.

158
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,370
I like that boy.

159
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,415
Makes me laugh.

160
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,251
Like your father used to.

161
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:12,255
Can't imagine Daddy dressed up
as a fortune teller.

162
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:17,051
Oh, you'd be surprised.
He had a silly side to him.

163
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,053
Not that I ever saw.

164
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:26,478
Well, there were certain things
that he only did with me.

165
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,109
Oh.

166
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,613
Oh, you see,
laughter is good for the pain.

167
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,367
Even better than this morphine.

168
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,119
- Let me help you.
- No, no, I can do it.

169
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,829
You just go.

170
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,208
Go!

171
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,729
You crossed everything out.

172
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,442
- It wasn't good.
- I know.

173
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,993
Is that what you're gonna do here,
after she dies?

174
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,581
Cross everything out...
because it wasn't good?

175
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,130
You're not going to get me
to talk about my mother.

176
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,345
I hope not.

177
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,221
Hatred's ugly.

178
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,558
It's too beautiful a day for that.

179
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,061
Back to the salt mines.

180
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,449
Please, sit.

181
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,784
Sir, these are the current ICO positions.

182
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,912
We're still drafting action items,
but we can give you a rough sense--

183
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,332
Well, before we discuss
any military options,

184
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,418
I'd like to put a call in to Damascus
and see what they'll allow.

185
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,295
Madam Secretary, won't you join me?

186
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,723
So you had to call a national security
meeting just to get us in the same room?

187
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,266
And to keep you off the phone with Conway.

188
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,228
All I needed was one call to him.
I don't need to make another.

189
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,815
You don't actually think he's gonna
make you Secretary of State, do you?

190
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,859
Probably not,
but I would've paid good money

191
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,487
- just to see your face when he told you.
- Mmm.

192
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,573
I never promised you the ticket.
I promised you I'd try.

193
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,575
You pretended to try.

194
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,660
Claire's support
didn't just happen on its own,

195
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:53,124
and you had the gall to take my hand,
look me in the eye and lie to my face.

196
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,960
- You're mistaken, Cathy.
- Oh, come on, Frank.

197
00:13:56,043 --> 00:14:00,339
I've had a front row seat to everything
since the day Walker took office,

198
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,635
all the lies and betrayals,
and I helped you.

199
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,638
My mistake was I assumed
you wouldn't stab me in the back.

200
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,016
Your mistake is that it backfired.

201
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,603
This is all personal, isn't it?

202
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,440
This is about how Claire treated you
when I was in the hospital.

203
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,901
Give me more credit than that.
This is business.

204
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,570
We were partners.
You broke the contract.

205
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,157
- So, what do you want?
- What else is there, Frank?

206
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,242
Nothing.

207
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,831
It's simple.
Either Claire's votes come my way...

208
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,167
or I turn the convention upside down.

209
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,088
<i>We need to talk about Seth.</i>

210
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,800
I've been getting calls
from former clients.

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,844
Now, before you say anything,
here's the dirt.

212
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,263
I cheated on a math test in 8th grade,

213
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,933
I shoplifted a homecoming dress
when I was 16,

214
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,477
I experimented with a sorority sister
in freshman year,

215
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,771
and I was late on my taxes in 2007.

216
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:01,443
What he won't find
is anything that justifies firing me.

217
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,487
I'm sure he was just vetting you.
We do that with everyone.

218
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,615
Okay,
if that's your story, then fine,

219
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,742
but all I care about
is winning this election.

220
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,079
So let's get past our personal shit
and be a team, okay?

221
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,336
We're fighting a common
enemy here, Mr. President.

222
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,129
It's important that we remain united.

223
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,675
Yeah, and I can assure you
that Secretary Durant will reach out

224
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,011
before we conduct any operation.
Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

225
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,681
We'll be in touch as soon
as we come up with a plan.

226
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,183
You're acting like
I'll still be Secretary of State.

227
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,478
Well, if you play your cards right,
you will be.

228
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,896
Who else did you offer the VP slot to?

229
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,982
There's Jackie, Austen, me.
Anyone else?

230
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,317
Austen withdrew on his own,
and so did Jackie.

231
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,111
I did not push her out.

232
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,990
Jackie says you took her for granted,
that you bullied her, you intimidated her.

233
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,743
And that is what
she is telling every member

234
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,455
of the California delegation,
one phone call at a time.

235
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,791
California.
Lots of votes.

236
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,461
California, the largest piece of delegates
at the Democratic Convention.

237
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,464
I'm told that delegation is trending
toward Heather Dunbar.

238
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,548
Let's watch this, Wolf.

239
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,760
Let's imagine she only picked up
two-thirds of the California delegates.

240
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,177
That gets you above 300 there.

241
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,805
Plus, we assume she'll keep
her home state Connecticut's support.

242
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,140
Off to a pretty good start.

243
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,393
It's over 300 delegates.
What, roughly, uh, 7% of the vote?

244
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,562
That alone could take this,
what, to a second ballot?

245
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,064
That takes it to a second ballot,
an open convention again.

246
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,818
Plus, we also assume that
Louisiana will stay with Catherine Durant.

247
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,945
<i>So, we are not going to have
a definitive idea</i>

248
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,363
<i>of how all this is gonna shape up</i>

249
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,282
<i>at least until they conduct
the first ballot.</i>

250
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,867
<i>There's still no update as to, uh,</i>

251
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,037
<i>when the president
and Secretary Durant will return.</i>

252
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,747
<i>No, and that adds to some
of the uncertainty here.</i>

253
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,874
<i>So let's go back to the floor,
see how things are playing out.</i>

254
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:44,045
It didn't specify in the article
which direction the motorcade was heading.

255
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,132
East.

256
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,844
You're sure?

257
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,139
Thank you very much.

258
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,081
Hot damn!

259
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,752
I am promising you Secretary of State
for as long as you want it

260
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,505
and my full support
when you run for president in 2024.

261
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,216
I mean, who knows,
you might even get lucky.

262
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,009
My liver might fail before then.

263
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,638
Your promises stopped meaning much
after you promised Baker my job.

264
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,474
I have no intention of offering him
Secretary of State.

265
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,768
Oh, so you lied to him
the way Walker lied to you.

266
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:46,023
No. Walker and I didn't have a history.
And Walker didn't respect me.

267
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:49,777
You and I have a history, Cathy,
and I respect you immensely.

268
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,446
But our history goes back three years.

269
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,159
Claire's and my partnership goes back 30.
You have to respect that.

270
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,538
I might have... if you had been honest
with me from the beginning.

271
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,876
Well, I wish I could turn back time,
but here we are.

272
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,294
And you can keep me out of Atlanta
for as long as you want,

273
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,756
but you can't hold the vote back forever.

274
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,676
Time's moving forward, not back.
And time is on my side.

275
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,893
If Heather Dunbar wants to take advantage
of the president's absence,

276
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,144
that's her prerogative.

277
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,562
But she's still in D.C.,
there's no public statement.

278
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,732
You see that as taking advantage?

279
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,610
You think Congresswoman Sharp
would make calls on her behalf

280
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,569
if she wasn't pulling the strings
from Washington?

281
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,864
Sharp says
she's doing it on her own.

282
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
You don't have any proof of coordination.

283
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,870
You're right, I don't.
Just human nature, basic logic,

284
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,623
and a slightly better than average
understanding of political gamesmanship.

285
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,961
Uh, if you will excuse me,
even press secretaries have to pee.

286
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,046
- I'll just be right back.
- Okay.

287
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,048
Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

288
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,012
What's up?

289
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,724
LeAnn knows, and I think you told her.

290
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,686
I did. Straight up.
I told her everything.

291
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,689
- Let's go. Upstairs.
- No.

292
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,192
- Excuse me?
- You've got Dunbar in play,

293
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,445
you got Durant with the president,
and the First Lady's in Dallas.

294
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,738
And I've got a room full of press

295
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,323
that I've been keeping at bay
since 8:00 this morning,

296
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:22,286
so I will tell you why I told her...
after I tuck in all the children.

297
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:55,527
Let's vote now!

298
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,531
Order, please!

299
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,702
It is Senator Sheer's time to speak.

300
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,871
Order!

301
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,165
Maybe we should let Cathy have her way.

302
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,544
If the vote's held now, you two win.
We focus on the general.

303
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,132
What's brought all this on?

304
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:21,846
I just wonder if we're in over our heads,
Francis, trying to do this.

305
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,264
<i>Is it your mother?</i>

306
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,267
I'm sure it's difficult
to see her this sick.

307
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,731
She's completely helpless.

308
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,776
<i>But we're not helpless.
We can turn this around.</i>

309
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,363
I guess I'm just...

310
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,869
I don't know, maybe...
maybe we're making a mistake.

311
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,246
Maybe I'm not ready
to be your running mate.

312
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>- Conway has a four-star general.</i>
- Is she happy, your mother?

313
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,295
<i>No, she's miserable.</i>

314
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,589
Tom makes her laugh, but mostly, no.

315
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,011
Imagine my liver's failing.

316
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,263
<i>- Imagine I'm dying.</i>
- Francis...

317
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,349
<i>No, I just want you
to picture it for just a moment.</i>

318
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,228
There I am, lying in a bed
just like your mother is now.

319
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,774
The only thing that would make me happy

320
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,777
is to know that you would
take over after I passed.

321
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,822
<i>If it were Cathy...</i>

322
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,532
<i>I'd be just as miserable
as your mother is.</i>

323
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,869
<i>I'll do my part.</i>

324
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,747
You just concentrate on that speech.

325
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,836
All right.
Thank you, Francis.

326
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,962
<i>Good night.</i>

327
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,300
- She, uh... she won't eat?
- It's hard for her to swallow.

328
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,762
How much time do you think she has?

329
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:52,061
I can't be definitive, but...
a couple of weeks, maybe.

330
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,356
If she stops eating altogether,
it could be days.

331
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,025
She's in a lot of pain.

332
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,863
She doesn't have to be.

333
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,366
When it gets to this point,
we can make her comfortable.

334
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,997
Comfortable enough
that the body will let go.

335
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,129
Does she want that?

336
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,467
That is something you should
discuss with your mother.

337
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,306
I like the plants.

338
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,518
The plants you put in there.

339
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,690
It's the little things, right?

340
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,737
If we take out the refineries,
that would eliminate their revenue stream.

341
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,115
They can't advance
if they don't have the resources.

342
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,244
President Makhzun made it very clear
he wants those to remain intact.

343
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,788
It's our best option
from a strategic point of view.

344
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,291
Minimal loss of life,
maximal impact on capability.

345
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,127
It's either total war or nothing at all.

346
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,673
Well, that doesn't sound
very diplomatic, Cathy.

347
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,841
We're going to be
diplomatic with terrorists?

348
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,053
I made a promise to President Makhzun.

349
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,931
You've broken promises before.
Why should this be any different?

350
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,394
Why don't we break for dinner?
We'll pick this up afterwards.

351
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,021
I wanna review this a bit more.

352
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,605
I'll have some food brought
into the Roosevelt Room.

353
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:19,982
Thank you all very much.

354
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,697
Cathy, why don't you and I eat in here?

355
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,424
"Total war or nothing at all"?

356
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,469
The moment I get in front of those cameras

357
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:52,098
and I tell them that Conway is right
and Brockhart is right,

358
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,601
and that you completely
bungled the ICO situation,

359
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,769
how do you think Dunbar will do then?

360
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,569
Can we get two Cobb salads
in here, please?

361
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,823
- I don't like Cobb salad.
- Then you don't have to eat it.

362
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,288
Thanks for coming over.

363
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,249
Way easier coming here
than you coming there.

364
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,667
Must be ten news crews
outside of my house.

365
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,086
How'd you escape?

366
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,879
The old-fashioned way.
Back door.

367
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,048
- Hmm.
- How did you get my home phone?

368
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,466
Oh, old-fashioned way.

369
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,260
- Rolodex from the <i>Herald.</i>
- Ah.

370
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,637
Come with me.
I won't keep you long.

371
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,846
Yeah.

372
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,767
- How long did this take you?
- Couple of months.

373
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,102
I've been working on my own.

374
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,354
We had a whole team
and we didn't find this.

375
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,440
Well, you probably weren't digging
as deep as the <i>Bates City Vine.</i>

376
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,442
No.

377
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,195
We spent most of our energy
tracking the money.

378
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,947
We should've been more
focused on the travel logs.

379
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,617
I wouldn't have checked either
until I spoke with a pizza guy.

380
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,577
Then I realized they might be
manipulating the logs.

381
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,371
Which gets you to Lanagin.

382
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,706
It still doesn't prove
he met with Lanagin,

383
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,875
but I don't know where else
that motorcade would've been heading.

384
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,710
Are you going public with this?

385
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,548
I could,
but he has some plausible deniability.

386
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,425
He pins it all on Meechum.

387
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:13,429
If he's covering up travel,
who knows what else he's covering up?

388
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,971
That's the story I want,

389
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:18,434
not some Secret Service man
being loose with the books.

390
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,271
- So you're still under the radar.
- Mmm-hmm.

391
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,276
I have to ask you
to keep all this to yourself.

392
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,446
I know it can be tempting now that...
you have a chance,

393
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,075
but if this goes public too early,
his guard goes up.

394
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,119
Listen, it was hard when I withdrew.

395
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,913
How the leadership abandoned me,
how the public did.

396
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:43,834
It took some time...
but I made my peace.

397
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:48,589
It's a crapshoot whether I can win this.
He can probably fight that off.

398
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,304
You need to write the story
that he can't fight off.

399
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,186
You investigated him.
Where's the weak link?

400
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,856
Remy Danton.

401
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,133
Tom did that.

402
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,638
It's a shame.
He'd be good for you.

403
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,602
I never believed in the tooth fairy.

404
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,400
Well, you took the money anyway.

405
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,445
Could you turn off that light, please?
Hurts my eyes.

406
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,831
When you were small...
you used to...

407
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,628
used to ask me to make it stop, the dark.

408
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,754
Do you remember?

409
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,007
Yes.

410
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,429
And I promised you I would...
in the morning.

411
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,893
But, damn it,
you would sit at that window...

412
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,480
every night...

413
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,025
trying to make the sun rise,
all by yourself.

414
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,698
Your daddy would put you in bed...

415
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:43,245
after you'd fallen asleep
with your face against the glass.

416
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,209
And I was so jealous.

417
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,919
Of me and Daddy?

418
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,798
That you believed.

419
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,637
You believed you could make the sun rise.

420
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,728
I spoke to her, Mother, the nurse.

421
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,984
I can't do it.

422
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,446
I can't do it, Mother.
I can't do what you want me to do.

423
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,580
Claire...

424
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,252
it'd help you win...

425
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,797
having your mother gone.

426
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,263
Do this for me.

427
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,934
And let me be a help to you.

428
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,020
Finally.

429
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,040
Tom.

430
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,003
She wants you to be there.

431
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,509
What do you want?

432
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,640
I want you to be there, too.

433
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,352
Okay.

434
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,206
Okay.

435
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,532
I told her because you put me
in an impossible situation.

436
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,702
There's nothing on her,
but you wouldn't listen.

437
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,955
And you must not have listened
when you came over to my house.

438
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,790
I was very clear.

439
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,504
So... you're gonna throw me
on the ground again?

440
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,548
Look, here's a glass.
Let's go ahead.

441
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,300
You wanna fire me?

442
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,388
Fine. It's another resignation.

443
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,684
After Remy, after Brockhart.
With Durant, with Dunbar.

444
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,102
You know, I spin stories for a living.

445
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,771
I can't begin to tell you
how to spin this.

446
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,360
You know, the minibar wasn't open
because you wanted a Diet Coke.

447
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,115
- I'm worried about you, Doug.
- Nobody needs to worry about me.

448
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,200
Yeah, somebody does...

449
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,453
because this scorched-earth policy
is bad for us.

450
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:21,708
I don't give a rat's ass
about LeAnn Harvey. We need her.

451
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,920
And you need me.
And we both need you.

452
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,338
- At your best.
- I'm fine.

453
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,676
Are you?
Instead of having me do damage control,

454
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,511
you're having me
do damage to one of our own.

455
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:36,264
- I am trying to protect the president.
- And I'm trying to protect you...

456
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,266
from yourself.

457
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,478
You're so full of shit.
You don't care about me.

458
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,399
After what you did, I should hate you.

459
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,195
But where does it get us?

460
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,916
Check out the <i>Telegraph.</i>

461
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,753
The strategy is working...

462
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:08,504
if you let it.

463
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,551
Or make me resign.
Your call.

464
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,858
- Are you okay?
<i>- It's what she wanted.</i>

465
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,151
I was asking you.

466
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,823
Schedule the vote for tomorrow.
I'll fly back to speak just before.

467
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,199
Claire, your mother just passed.

468
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,953
Schedule it, Francis.
Tom wrote a speech. It's good.

469
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:08,083
- Cathy's not on board yet.
- Then get her on board.

470
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,044
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

471
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,047
<i>- I didn't mean to--</i>
- No, no, it's all right. I'll get it done.

472
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,549
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

473
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,009
<i>Good night.</i>

474
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,680
Ask Secretary Durant
to meet me in the Oval.

475
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,764
Yes, sir.

476
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,064
Mr. President.

477
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,525
Coffee table.

478
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,491
The funny thing is
I didn't even have to ask him to do it.

479
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,368
He did it on his own.

480
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,536
I especially like where he says,

481
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,958
"Catherine Durant is functional.
Claire Underwood is formidable."

482
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:00,301
So, you see, you don't even have
time on your side. It's on ours.

483
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,221
By tomorrow morning, there'll be
a dozen articles just like that.

484
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,389
So you have a choice.

485
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,058
You can redeem yourself
as Secretary of State

486
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,684
over the next four years,

487
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:12,272
or go down in history as a fluke,
who bungled the Middle East

488
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,733
and couldn't even close the deal
in Brandenburg.

489
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,736
You have your version.
I have mine.

490
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,696
I'm sure mine will get
just as much traction as this.

491
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:23,909
But my version wins
because it's the better story...

492
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,620
and it's also exactly
how things went down.

493
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,956
You see, you don't even have
the truth going for you.

494
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,126
I'm not scared of you.

495
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,965
My endorsement of Dunbar,
that makes for an even better story.

496
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,513
But you wanna know what the best story is?

497
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,894
Claire's mother just died.

498
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,148
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Oh, I don't think you really are,

499
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,484
but that doesn't matter
because the rest of the world will.

500
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,487
And by the time she gives
her speech tomorrow night,

501
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,700
there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta
or across the rest of the country.

502
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:12,082
So, you get to keep your job, Cathy,
in return for your delegates.

503
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,917
That offer is still on the table.

504
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,296
I have been loyal.
I got you that table.

505
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,050
Do you wanna keep it,
or do you wanna give it to Conway?

506
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,018
You know, when I was
waiting for my transplant,

507
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:35,438
I had the most vivid hallucinations.
You wouldn't believe 'em.

508
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,565
Do you know who I saw?

509
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,946
Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes,
right here in this room.

510
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,282
Zoe was trying to seduce me,
right here on this couch,

511
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:51,204
and Peter, he shoved my face
up against this glass.

512
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,166
Cigarettes and razor blades and sex.

513
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,793
It was terrifying.

514
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,922
All I wanted to do
was get out of this room

515
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,924
that I worked so hard to get in.

516
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,470
But of course, it makes sense
that they would've haunted me

517
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,764
because it's all true.

518
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:14,394
- What is?
- Everything Lucas Goodwin claimed.

519
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,147
I killed them both,
just like he said I did.

520
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,903
But of course, nobody believes it,
and nobody ever will.

521
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,197
Because that's how good we are...

522
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,492
at making things...

523
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,120
disappear.

524
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,175
No, we didn't kill anybody.

525
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,639
But we would have...

526
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,349
if it was necessary.

527
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,146
So, you're right,
the time for negotiations is over.

528
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,483
You will hand over your delegates,
and you will serve on in my cabinet.

529
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,570
And we will forget
that any of this ever happened.

530
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,532
Because if you don't...

531
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,913
I swear to God...

532
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,374
I will never...

533
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:23,046
ever forget.

534
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,385
Do you understand now?

535
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,810
Yes.

536
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,493
Good.

537
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,663
Now, let's go decide what we're gonna do
about these terrorists.

538
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,336
Want me to call someone?
Make arrangements?

539
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,619
We made the sun rise.

540
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,333
- She told you that, too?
- Mmm-hmm.

541
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,782
We should get going.

542
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,073
Me and Hannah want to extend
our warmest condolences

543
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,117
to the First Lady and the President.

544
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,538
They and all of Elizabeth Hale's
loved ones are in our prayers.

545
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:10,708
And we won't be campaigning today
out of respect for their loss.

546
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,461
God bless President and Mrs. Underwood.

547
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,422
Got it.

548
00:45:16,506 --> 00:45:18,007
Put it out.

549
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,511
Perfect timing... for her to drop dead.

550
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,053
We were on a roll, too.

551
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,492
I should prep for the speech.

552
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,495
I have a room set up for you.
I'll be right in.

553
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,455
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.

554
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,669
I read the draft.

555
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,338
And?

556
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:01,592
- I wouldn't change a thing.
- I'm glad you're pleased.

557
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,093
I'm glad you were with her.

558
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,055
She's strong.
You're a lucky man.

559
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,641
Don't I know it.

560
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,817
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a great honor to introduce

561
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,486
Secretary of State Catherine Durant.

562
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,882
Thank you, thank you very much.

563
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,845
I know that all of you join me in offering

564
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:50,641
our sincere condolences
to the First Lady for her loss.

565
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:59,191
Tonight, I want to offer
my sincere gratitude

566
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:03,195
to all the delegates
who have honored me with their support

567
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,155
during the course of this convention.

568
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,449
Thank you so much.

569
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:18,628
However, after much deliberation...

570
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:24,842
I have decided that I have more
to offer you as Secretary of State

571
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,762
than to resign and run for office.

572
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:35,352
But I want to encourage
every one of you who has supported me

573
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:40,190
to join me in supporting
this extraordinary woman,

574
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,778
the First Lady of the United States,
Claire Hale Underwood.

575
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,429
Thank you.

576
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,015
Thank you.

577
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,436
And good evening.

578
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,857
As all of you know, my mother,
Elizabeth Constance Hale,

579
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:26,361
passed away last night
after a long illness.

580
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,325
She was a strong woman...

581
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,494
a fierce Texan...

582
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:44,547
We had... a difficult relationship
from childhood onwards.

583
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:49,093
At times, there were
long periods of estrangement.

584
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:55,349
We hurt each other... often and deeply.

585
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,937
If there was one good thing
that came from my mother's illness...

586
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:07,319
it gave us a chance to reconnect,
to mend old wounds.

587
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:11,782
And that's not an opportunity
people always get before a parent dies,

588
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,326
and I'm grateful to have had that.

589
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,707
And what am I doing here?

590
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:28,298
I'm here because my mother
wanted me to be.

591
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,094
Yesterday, before she passed,
she said to me,

592
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,515
"Claire... do this.

593
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,976
If the people want it, listen to them.

594
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,563
And if you lose, then you lose.

595
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,398
But if you win...

596
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:53,574
be honored, be humbled,
and win this election with Francis!"

597
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,252
And I told her, I said,
"The Conways are tough opponents."

598
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,548
And she said, "They may be tough,
but they're not Texas tough."

599
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,889
Loss is a sobering phenomenon.

600
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,267
Several months ago,
I almost lost my husband.

601
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,563
<i>Our nation almost lost a president.</i>

602
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,984
Loss makes us reevaluate
what we hold dear.

603
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:35,575
And I'll tell you, there were...
times in the not too distant past,

604
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:40,204
where Francis and I, we...
almost lost our marriage.

605
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,750
Hard times when we thought
we wouldn't make it.

606
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:49,463
And like many of you know,
marriage isn't always the smoothest road.

607
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:54,301
And it took the actions
of a deranged young man

608
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:58,180
to remind me how important
Francis is to me.

609
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,310
And now, with my mother gone...

610
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,108
he's the only family I have left.

611
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,363
I trust Francis Underwood with my life,

612
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:18,450
with our nation, with our future.

613
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,578
I hope you will, too.

614
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,129
<i>And if you trust the both of us,
I'll heed my mother's words,</i>

615
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:33,966
<i>and I'll be honored
if you nominate me as his running mate.</i>

616
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,147
Claire! Claire! Claire!

617
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,199
Jesus!
You did great work.

618
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,046
Ladies and gentlemen...

619
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:19,386
Madam Secretary, as convention chair,

620
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:24,308
I move that we make the nomination
of Claire Underwood for vice president...

621
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,728
and Francis Underwood
for president by acclamation.

622
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,662
Do I hear a second to vote by acclamation

623
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:49,583
for the nomination of the president
and the vice president?

624
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,294
- Hear, hear!
- So moved.

625
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:56,381
All of those in favor of the nomination

626
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:01,220
of Francis Underwood for President
of the United States, say "aye."

627
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,223
- Aye!
- All those against.

628
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,725
Nay!

629
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,185
All those in favor of the nomination

630
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:13,899
of Claire Underwood for our Vice President
of the United States, say "aye."

631
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:15,735
Aye!

632
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,195
- Against?
- Nay!

633
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,280
The ayes have it!

634
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:31,458
Our party's ticket
for the 2016 presidential election

635
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,379
will be Francis and Claire Underwood!

636
