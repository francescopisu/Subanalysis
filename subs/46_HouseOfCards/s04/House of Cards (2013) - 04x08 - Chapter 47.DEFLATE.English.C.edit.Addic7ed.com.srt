1
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:11,053
I just love your writing, Tom,
ever since <i>Scorpio.</i>

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,471
I think it just gets better and better.

3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:16,684
Oh, yeah?
What else have you read?

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:21,396
All of them. I thought
the latest was brilliant, <i>God's Cauldron.</i>

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,357
- You read that?
- In one sitting.

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,070
But what we'd really love to read
is your book on the Underwoods.

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,157
- Well, it's changed. It's fiction now.
- But based on them.

8
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,703
People might draw parallels.

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,830
Would the Underwoods find it flattering?

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,790
I don't think they'd be too happy with it.

11
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,000
How do you think it'll do?

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,171
- Who knows?
- Better than <i>God's Cauldron,</i> I hope.

13
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,007
Sales were disappointing, weren't they?

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,342
In fact, they've been disappointing

15
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,386
on everything you've written
the past ten years.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,306
We can change that with this new book.

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,475
I'm not a political tool.

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,894
We didn't fly you up here
because my wife's a fan.

19
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,021
I'm sure you had a notion
of what we're after.

20
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,982
I didn't have any expectations.

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,525
I just came because I was curious.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,113
Well, then let me satisfy your curiosity.

23
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,323
If your book can hurt the Underwoods,

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,076
we want it to be published
before the election,

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,411
and we want it to be big.

26
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,831
Dana Treister, do you know her?

27
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,332
The editor of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

28
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,712
- That's right. She's a close friend.
- And Ben Grant, founder of Pollyhop.

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,963
I saw the webcast.

30
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,048
They don't manipulate
search results,

31
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,343
but let's just say
a big spread in <i>Vanity Fair...</i>

32
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,970
Nice juicy excerpt,

33
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:39,182
profile on Thomas Yates,
his literary comeback.

34
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,395
We're on the cover this month, but...
next month it could be you.

35
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,065
I'm on the Marxist side of Democrat.

36
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,236
- Why would I help a Republican?
- You'd be helping yourself, Tom.

37
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,321
And if that helps us
a little bit along the way,

38
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,365
what's the harm in that?

39
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:29,501
Sync and corrections by n17t01

40
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,896
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio,

41
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,398
the leadership's top choice
for running mate.

42
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,567
Twelve years in Congress,
helps us with a major swing state,

43
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,737
middle of the road,
very few enemies,

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,407
and most importantly to them,
long-time friend of the NRA.

45
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,618
Now his shortcomings are
he's another middle-aged white guy,

46
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:08,248
underwhelming, unimaginative
and a long-time friend of the NRA.

47
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,084
So you can see how I feel
about the leadership's choice.

48
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,169
Senator.

49
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,421
I'm honored, Mr. President.

50
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,883
I just have one major reservation.

51
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,177
- Claire.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:21,887
Well, between you and me,

53
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,222
I'm not even sure
this gun bill is gonna pass.

54
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,850
But if I'm being asked to support it,
you know the sort of hot water--

55
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:31,229
Yes, but I need you on the ticket
to balance our stance on guns.

56
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,523
We have to appeal
to the Republicans as well.

57
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,359
And look, I'm not asking you
to get behind the bill,

58
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,695
just not to publicly trash it.

59
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,697
I know this is an important issue to you.

60
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,074
It is important,

61
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,619
but not as much as an experienced
leader who can deliver Ohio.

62
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,290
Then consider me on board, sir.

63
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,462
We're not sure we can get this
to the floor before the election.

64
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,632
That's the deal we made.
You get Austen, we get the gun bill.

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,844
We need a strong Senate version first,

66
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,179
so we don't have two weak bills
going into reconciliation.

67
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,183
You want Austen,
you will make this bill a reality.

68
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,978
Or, we can revisit the choice
for running mate.

69
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,522
No...
let us see what we can do.

70
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,316
I'll call Mitchell.

71
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,652
Gentlemen,

72
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,488
the future vice president.

73
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,031
- Congratulations, Dean.
- Thank you very much.

74
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,367
- Welcome.
- Thank you. Mrs. Underwood.

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,327
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

76
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,996
So, how's it going in here?

77
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,415
Well, I think we're in alignment.
Wouldn't you say?

78
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,335
It's been a productive meeting.

79
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,880
So, let's talk about
when we should announce.

80
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,799
I, uh, I need to soften
the blow to the NRA

81
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,677
- before we go public.
- It's imperative we keep a lid on this.

82
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,972
No leaks until we're ready.

83
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,641
Just the four of us in this room.

84
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,018
And Claire, of course.

85
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,103
Well, I need to go
do this quick interview.

86
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
Um, let me know
how it goes with Mitchell.

87
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,984
All right,
I'm sure you have some--

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,445
Oh, leave that open.
It gets so stuffy in here.

89
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,072
Let's discuss the timing.

90
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,949
Was it you or the First Lady?

91
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,619
- First Lady all the way.
- She thinks she can win me over?

92
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,788
She knows you'll hit harder
than anyone else.

93
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,791
If she's still standing by the end,
maybe the bill has sea legs.

94
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,628
- Kate.
- Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.

95
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,256
How about we talk
in the Roosevelt Room?

96
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,264
Support in the House is already wavering.
The public's losing interest in guns.

97
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,891
Don't you want to wait until we sit down?

98
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,227
Your staff only scheduled an hour.
I want to make the most of it.

99
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,438
Oh, it's being used.

100
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,231
Let's find somewhere else.

101
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,654
Kate?

102
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,617
Well, historically, gun reform
comes and goes in waves,

103
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,455
as you know, so I believe this time,
it can be truly different.

104
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,583
All the data's filtered here,
within these walls.

105
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,710
My analysts do a first pass,
but ultimately,

106
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,920
I do the final round myself.

107
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,797
Our biggest concern is security.

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,842
Top-grade firewall, same as
you guys use at NSA headquarters.

109
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,095
<i>What about internal security?</i>

110
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,973
<i>I'm the only one with full access.</i>

111
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>So,
if you do find anything,</i>

112
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>how do you communicate that
to us in a secure way?</i>

113
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,769
<i>In person.</i>

114
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,731
<i>I'll come to Fort Meade myself,
or you come here.</i>

115
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,524
<i>No hardware leaves the premises.</i>

116
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,445
<i>Can you walk us through
how the filtering algorithms work?</i>

117
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,281
<i>We'll take firearms, for instance.</i>

118
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,783
<i>If we start with everyone
who legally owns a gun,</i>

119
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,911
<i>track geo-location patterns
through their phones,</i>

120
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,622
<i>we start to put together a portrait</i>

121
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>of where gun-owners
live, eat, shop, everything.</i>

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,380
<i>From this, we predict
everyone who might want a firearm,</i>

123
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,007
<i>but who isn't registered.</i>

124
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,260
<i>They're likely to exhibit
the same behavior as people who are.</i>

125
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,721
<i>You can use that for people
who are interested in Arabic,</i>

126
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>uh, wanna travel to the Middle East,</i>

127
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,686
<i>who are disillusioned
with the U.S. government...</i>

128
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,945
So the same techniques that we're using
for our international surveillance.

129
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,116
Yes... but far more advanced.

130
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,495
Okay, turn a little bit
towards me, Mrs. Conway.

131
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,746
Right.

132
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,583
Ooh!

133
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,336
You look great, Hannah.

134
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,048
- What about the candidate?
- Don't get me started, Will.

135
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,386
- You're really photogenic.
- I know.

136
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,516
Franny Wallace, senior year.

137
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,894
- The all-Goldfish diet.
- Did you have these put here specially?

138
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,064
We roll out the platinum carpet, darling.

139
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,648
I wonder what Franny's up to now.

140
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,359
Hmm, not the Editor of <i>Vanity Fair,</i>
I'll tell you that.

141
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,445
Or about to be the First Lady.

142
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,863
Come a long way, haven't we?

143
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,035
Yeah, Will and I, um...
Will and I appreciate your doing this.

144
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,746
It's not charity. This issue will sell
like crazy with you two on the front.

145
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,873
Well, I feel like
I should return the favor.

146
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,085
A night in the Lincoln Bedroom?

147
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,170
A story.

148
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,476
You have a copy for me?

149
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,521
An excerpt.

150
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,691
- I need the whole book.
- That's all you get.

151
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,820
Conway got the same thing.

152
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,368
- That was a mistake, Tom.
- They came to me.

153
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,412
But they don't get to publish...
without my approval.

154
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,375
So what do you want?

155
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,002
- A meeting.
- For?

156
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,548
You're just a messenger, Doug.

157
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,342
You got your message.

158
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,345
One week.

159
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,557
Thanks for the coffee.

160
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,480
Mrs. Underwood, welcome.

161
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,107
Thank you so much
for recording this robocall.

162
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,234
It'll go a long way
in getting this bill passed.

163
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,654
Well, thank you for all
the extraordinary work you're doing.

164
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,030
Uh, where would you like me?

165
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,199
Uh, Sally will show you
where we set up for the recording.

166
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,909
Right this way, Mrs. Underwood.

167
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,622
LeAnn...

168
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,629
What is that?

169
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,384
Names, phone numbers, emails.
A quarter million fresh targets.

170
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,262
A quarter million?
Where'd you get this?

171
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,056
No return address.
It's 50 times the names that we have.

172
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,268
- Is it legit?
- Looks like it. We made sample calls.

173
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,189
Hello, this is Claire Underwood.

174
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,861
I need to confess something...
something I'm not proud to confess.

175
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,114
When I was sitting
beside my husband in the hospital...

176
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,368
all I thought about was me.

177
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,915
My fear.
My pain if I was to lose him.

178
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,336
And it was selfish.

179
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,504
I-- I wasn't thinking
about everyone else

180
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:16,050
who had gone through that fear and pain,
who had to sit where I was sitting

181
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,888
because a loved one was shot
by someone who shouldn't have a gun.

182
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,143
I'm ashamed because
I've never done anything about it.

183
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:30,106
I'm ashamed of how many lives
we could've saved.

184
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,277
How many families
we could've kept from suffering.

185
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,532
We should all be ashamed,
every one of us,

186
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,369
because the blood
is on all of our hands,

187
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,623
and doing nothing
is the same as pulling a trigger.

188
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,126
We need to do something.

189
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,885
And that means changing the law.

190
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,355
<i>♪ I am who I am ♪</i>

191
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,231
<i>♪ And what I am ♪</i>

192
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,192
<i>♪ And I will be what I will be ♪</i>

193
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,654
<i>♪ Okay ♪</i>

194
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,034
<i>♪ Present tense, I am who I am ♪</i>

195
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,705
<i>♪ Not was to be, but I am ♪</i>

196
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,458
<i>♪ Can you imagine that? ♪</i>

197
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,892
Senator Austen's office.

198
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,270
- More than 500 since this afternoon.
- From our district?

199
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,066
We have it light. I'm hearing that
other offices have gotten over a thousand.

200
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,485
Senator Austen's office.
I will take a message.

201
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,407
Francis.

202
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,577
You really shouldn't.

203
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,121
Oh, one won't kill me.

204
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,915
Did you finish it?

205
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,631
Yeah.

206
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,634
One part really caught my eye.

207
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:31,978
"A chasm opened up between them,
a hallway less than ten yards wide.

208
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,440
But it might as well
have been a thousand miles.

209
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,274
A well-appointed no man's land

210
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:41,153
with a plush carpet and high ceiling
between two bedrooms.

211
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,991
In it were two centuries of ghosts,

212
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,119
all the Presidents
and First Ladies before them.

213
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,081
But also the ghost... of their marriage.

214
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,419
A thirty years' war
that left them both dead inside

215
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,255
and this dead space between them."

216
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,761
He's perceptive.

217
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,097
Uncanny.

218
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,523
Well, it's not who we are.
Not anymore.

219
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,528
People will want to believe
it's true even if it's false.

220
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,615
What do you think it is
he wants to accomplish?

221
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,079
He came here one night,
after I'd asked you to resign.

222
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,000
He said he was obsessed.

223
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,128
Or maybe he wants back in.

224
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,847
You felt something for him.

225
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,059
Maybe for a moment.

226
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,149
- Did you?
- No, I don't think so.

227
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,237
I felt...

228
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,909
I felt like he saw me.

229
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,039
Me, too.

230
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,815
Mr. Barnes.

231
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,110
<i>I couldn't stop thinking,
since you called...</i>

232
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,820
about Zoe.

233
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,200
- I guess I want answers.
- That-- That's what I want, too.

234
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:57,289
- <i>What is it you want to know?</i>
- Was there... a relationship?

235
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,792
<i>With Underwood?</i>

236
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,673
When she was 17,
just before she went off to school...

237
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,926
<i>she found out I was having an affair.</i>

238
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,889
<i>Sales rep, some drug company.</i>

239
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,683
<i>- Blonde.
- You know.</i>

240
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,521
This isn't, you know, on the record.

241
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,984
No...
No, not if you don't want it to be.

242
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,199
You said she found out.

243
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:36,287
She gave me three days to tell her mother,
or she would...

244
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,835
I'm sorry, I had a few drinks.

245
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,298
- Did you tell her?
<i>- Yeah, I told her.</i>

246
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,591
We split up.

247
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,012
Zoe didn't talk to me much after that.

248
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,223
<i>I don't know anything about Underwood.</i>

249
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,477
I'm the last person
she would've told.

250
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:09,361
I wish I would've...
made more of an effort...

251
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,157
to reach out to her.

252
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,951
<i>Are you driving, Mr. Barnes?</i>

253
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,537
Yeah.

254
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,374
- I'm almost home.
- You should pull over.

255
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,544
<i>Did you find out anything?</i>

256
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,338
<i>Anything you can tell me?</i>

257
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,592
She didn't have a lot of friends
at the <i>Herald.</i>

258
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:35,763
Um, from what I can gather,
she didn't have any close friends at all.

259
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,183
<i>I spoke to some people
in her neighborhood...</i>

260
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,604
<i>but nothing so far.</i>

261
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,397
Will you?

262
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,610
- If you...
- Yeah, of course, of course.

263
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,320
If you think of anything...

264
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,572
<i>Yeah.</i>

265
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,932
Then what were you doing there?

266
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,645
If I do a meeting at the White House,
I don't have to explain myself, Julia.

267
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,271
This bill might pass.

268
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,108
- I realize that.
- Are you helping them?

269
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,693
Absolutely not.

270
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,494
- Julia.
- Mrs. Underwood.

271
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,497
Sorry, I'd shake your hand,
but I just got back from a run.

272
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,458
Listen, I wanted to say, I know
our meeting last time didn't go very well,

273
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,377
and that's on me.
It was rude, what I said,

274
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,755
and I hope you'll accept my apology.

275
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,464
Have a seat, please.

276
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,930
You ever been
in the residence before?

277
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,724
The personal touch
isn't going to bring me on board.

278
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,810
Neither will a few thousand
calls to Congress.

279
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,688
84,000 in less than 24 hours.

280
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,148
But let's put that aside for a moment

281
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,442
- and talk about your good friend.
- Who?

282
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,946
- Senator Austen.
- He told me. Running mate.

283
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,781
Oh, not just running mate.

284
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,992
You said I wouldn't
have to support this bill.

285
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,953
Yes, but a lot can change in a day, Dean.

286
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,414
We had no idea
there'd be this sort of groundswell.

287
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,876
Julia Melman was all over my ass
even for being in the same room as you.

288
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,586
Did you tell her?

289
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,380
- I had to.
- Christ, Dean...

290
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,091
It was that, or make an enemy for life.

291
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,051
She's upset,
but I think she'll come around,

292
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,679
unless you make me endorse closing
the gun show and Internet loopholes.

293
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:40,930
Then she'll go ballistic.

294
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,016
Dean wouldn't do that.
We've poured millions into his campaigns.

295
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,852
And now he doesn't need you anymore.

296
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,105
Are you trying to intimidate me?
To get us to back down?

297
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,815
No, I have an offer.

298
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:55,319
Ohio's a tough state for Democrats.
Julia's been very good to me.

299
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,574
Loyalty's important, I understand,
but your loyalty has to be with me now.

300
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,284
I just can't do it.

301
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,286
All right, then we'll cancel
the announcement.

302
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,913
I'll find someone else
to be my running mate.

303
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,665
No, I mean,
I... I just can't support this bill.

304
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,794
Oh, but you see,
the two go hand in hand now.

305
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,339
So, are you on the ticket or not?

306
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,718
What if the gun bill passes in the House,
but not the Senate?

307
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,511
In return for what?

308
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,098
You convince the senator to pull out.

309
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,227
Now, the leadership wants him,
and we've played nice,

310
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,314
but the president and I want Cathy Durant.
She's a much stronger candidate.

311
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,608
You're willing to abandon your own bill?

312
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,319
If it's means beating Conway
or beating you,

313
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,695
that's not a hard choice.

314
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,075
I already told Dean that I could
live with him being running mate.

315
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,326
How do I backtrack?

316
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,662
Just watch the news tomorrow.

317
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,330
You made the right choice.

318
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,249
- I hope so.
- Well, don't hope so, know so.

319
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,920
And I'll have Seth
send you a copy of the speech.

320
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,173
You can show the senator out now,
thank you.

321
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,549
Yes, sir.

322
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,873
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Come in.

323
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,089
- What did he say?
- He'll do it. What did she say?

324
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,174
That she'll think about it.

325
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,676
How do we know
she won't tell him our plans?

326
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,970
I told her if she does,

327
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,014
we'll make sure
the bill goes through the Senate.

328
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,682
Can you hand me a towel, please?

329
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,291
- Meechum's hand.
- What?

330
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,839
I traced it on a wall downstairs...
a while back.

331
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,677
They've painted over it.
Oh, never mind.

332
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,388
Francis, I've been thinking about Yates.

333
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,558
The Conways have everything.

334
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,270
They have their children,
their videos, their Twitter.

335
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,441
There are very few people
who understand us.

336
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,693
Meechum... was one.

337
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,030
Tom is another.

338
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,964
Eight...

339
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,970
Seven. Nice.

340
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,692
Mr. Long Pants.

341
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,827
Mr. Nice Shoes.
Go! Go, go, go.

342
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,371
- Go!
- Are you hungry?

343
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,957
No money. You need to go.
You and your money, go.

344
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,628
- I'm calling the cops.
- All right, all right.

345
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,046
- The cops, right now...
- All right, all right.

346
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,090
- I'm calling the cops.
- All right, all right.

347
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,970
Ma'am...

348
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,267
I'm Officer Tom.

349
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,439
You called for me?

350
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,568
There was a man here.

351
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,989
A very bad man.

352
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,285
- Do you live on this block?
- Thirty-three years.

353
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,747
Three... three.

354
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,500
Did you ever see this bad man
on your block?

355
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,337
Did you ever see
this bad man on your block?

356
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,801
All right.

357
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:14,305
What about this woman?
Did you ever see her?

358
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,891
- Pretty.
- Yes, yes, she is.

359
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,227
Whore!

360
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,315
- Go away!
- Why'd you say that?

361
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,442
- Go away. Go away.
- Why'd you say that? Tell me.

362
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,153
Tell Officer Tom.
Why did you call her that word?

363
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,197
Go away!

364
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,994
Built this myself,
with my son.

365
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,331
He's doing El Capitan next spring.

366
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,249
Free-climb.

367
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,835
I feel like running for president

368
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,629
is like climbing a cliff
without a safety rope.

369
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,049
How is it the press don't know
you're here, by the way?

370
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,134
Just like you, General,

371
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,262
I take Sundays off
to spend time with family and friends.

372
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,223
Or to make new friends.

373
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,102
Look, Governor,
I know you still want me to resign.

374
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,104
But I was wrong to threaten that.

375
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,357
Dreyer told me ICO took over
another oil field this week.

376
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,025
They're growing.

377
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,195
Dreyer shares a lot with you, doesn't he?

378
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,655
This is happening on your watch, General.

379
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,994
The president isn't acting
and you can't force him to.

380
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,498
Not if you stay.

381
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,503
If you resign, though,
I promise it'll only be temporary.

382
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,424
Once I get political,
I can't cross back over the line.

383
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,426
I don't mean a recommission.

384
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:39,306
I mean making you my running mate.

385
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,310
Thank you.

386
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:47,481
- Have you read it?
- Just an excerpt. It's powerful.

387
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,067
And it'll be controversial.
Say yes and I'll show you.

388
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,653
The <i>Telegraph</i> would never let me.

389
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,864
- Same parent company, both our titles.
- Doesn't matter.

390
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,366
Paper is strict
when it comes to moonlighting.

391
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,910
It does matter,
because my dad is on the board.

392
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,703
One call to your editor...

393
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:05,207
There... there are plenty
of people who would jump at doing this.

394
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,209
Not who know him intimately.

395
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,378
My new election correspondent,

396
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,214
he saw you and Yates
sneaking off on the campaign trail.

397
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,717
Yates will open up to you.
I'm sure you know what buttons to push.

398
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,844
It's a conflict of interest.

399
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,057
My dad showed me that article you wrote.

400
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,353
The one that never went to print
where you called him a tyrant.

401
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,440
Some of us have
built our careers on our reputations,

402
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,900
not by having their daddies
give them a magazine to play with.

403
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,611
Or by cozying up
to old school chums, right?

404
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,072
I've heard it all before.

405
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:41,327
You may not like me,
you may not like the Conways,

406
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,412
but I have to believe
you can stomach us better

407
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,872
than another four years
of President Underwood.

408
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,503
- Well, the writing is good.
- I know.

409
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,923
Not good enough
to strong-arm a president.

410
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,552
Well, good enough
to get me in this room.

411
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,347
I thought Francis
made it very clear to you,

412
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,474
you were not to challenge us.

413
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:07,102
Yeah. He said he would tell the world
I didn't write <i>Scorpio.</i>

414
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,605
I hope you understand

415
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,275
that we can't allow you
to print this before the election.

416
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,485
I do.

417
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,196
Then why did you want to meet?

418
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,117
I need an ending.

419
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,248
I have one I can live with,
but not the one I love.

420
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,626
- Because it's false.
- Well, it's true that you left.

421
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,587
If I left, I wouldn't be here.

422
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,088
I don't believe for a second

423
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,091
you went to visit your mother
because she was sick.

424
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,175
And why is that?

425
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,177
Because you never mentioned her
one time to me.

426
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:46,225
Saying nothing
says a lot sometimes.

427
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,811
Well, what if the story
isn't about how she left,

428
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,231
but how she came back.

429
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:57,110
Just because you're here
doesn't mean you're here.

430
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,696
Well, wouldn't you like to know?

431
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,576
Don't you want your ending?

432
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,248
Are you gonna tell me about it?

433
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,252
About the two of you?
No lies.

434
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,712
No, I'm not going to tell you anything.

435
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,924
You can observe, like you did before.

436
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,219
The difference is everything
you see this time will be yours.

437
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,056
And in return,
we would like something.

438
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:30,436
Speeches.
We need someone who knows us...

439
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,062
and knows our voices.

440
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,482
A speechwriter?
You're kidding.

441
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,694
It's the only way to justify
you being with us...

442
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,279
in case the press ask.

443
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:43,407
Oh. You want to keep an eye on me.

444
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,493
Well, I think that's fair.
Don't you?

445
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,162
If you're keeping an eye on us?

446
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,710
So you gave us a week.
We'll give you a day.

447
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,882
Hmm.

448
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:05,554
It was right here,
on this very spot,

449
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:10,642
that I was shot with two bullets
from an illegally obtained handgun.

450
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:17,774
Secret Service Agent Edward Meechum,
a marine and my friend,

451
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:22,363
was slain with the bullets
from that very same gun.

452
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,157
The public support...

453
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:31,538
for the First Lady's...
Universal Background Check bill

454
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:35,334
has been deafening
in these last few days.

455
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:39,087
We have heard from
thousands and thousands of voices,

456
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:44,885
and today, we would like to add
one more voice to that chorus.

457
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:49,390
And it is a powerful voice.
Senator Dean Austen of Ohio.

458
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,061
Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,191
I've been a member of the NRA
since I was a teenager.

460
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,319
I've always been
a fierce advocate for gun rights.

461
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,697
But today I want to offer
my strong support

462
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,033
for the First Lady's bill.

463
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,453
Here you go.

464
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,998
- Let me ask you another question.
- I'm tellin' you, man,

465
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,625
if you say she lived on the block,
I believe you.

466
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,793
But she must not have liked pizza,

467
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,461
'cause I don't remember
ever seein' her face.

468
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,588
Not her.
President Underwood.

469
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,799
Oh, Christ,
I can't get away from this guy.

470
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,511
His wife just called me.
Robocall about guns.

471
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,513
You ever seen him
around this neighborhood?

472
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,806
Oh, yeah.
All the time.

473
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,517
With the Queen of England,
Friday nights, after bowling.

474
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,185
When he was in Congress.

475
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,604
Nah, never once.

476
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,355
I would've remembered.
I'm good with faces.

477
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,234
- Parmesan?
- Over there.

478
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:53,454
I saw this guy a few times, though.

479
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,498
- The senator?
- No, the, uh, the dead guy.

480
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,041
The Secret Service guy.

481
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,345
In here?

482
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,098
Yeah, a while back.
He used to stop in for coffee.

483
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,141
Never any pizza, just coffee.

484
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:22,398
- You're positive?
- Yeah. I told you, I'm good with faces.

485
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:34,661
<i>"The wheels lifted,
and within seconds, Washington fell away,</i>

486
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:39,415
<i>disappearing under
a blanket of haze and smog.</i>

487
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,752
<i>Forehead pressed to the window,</i>

488
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,464
<i>she imagined this was exactly
how it must have looked</i>

489
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,675
<i>a thousand years ago,
when the sun rose above the clouds</i>

490
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,928
<i>and there was nothing
but a swamp beneath.</i>

491
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:56,099
<i>From this height, with this view,
she could be anywhere.</i>

492
00:32:56,182 --> 00:33:00,812
<i>But the important thing is
she was anywhere but there."</i>

493
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,525
- You want another?
- Yeah.

494
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,842
Did he say why?

495
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,680
Okay, thanks, Dana.

496
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:36,890
Yates pulled out.

497
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,017
Said he came to an agreement
with the Underwoods.

498
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,936
He was playing us off each other.

499
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,647
We could still leak the excerpt.

500
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,277
It's too risky.
If we get away with it, great.

501
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,782
If we don't, we look like opportunists
fucking over an acclaimed novelist.

502
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,991
It's not worth it.

503
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,369
Do you think it's true,
that chasm between them?

504
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,330
Who knows?

505
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,709
I love that writing.

506
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,671
- I wish I could've read the rest of it.
- I hated <i>Scorpio.</i>

507
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,717
- It was beautiful.
- It's garbage.

508
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,344
- Why?
- The main character's a pussy.

509
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:18,306
- Will, you know I hate that word.
- He is.

510
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,184
He lets his best friend kill himself.
He does nothing?

511
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,895
He was in pain.
He was going to die anyway.

512
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,939
It doesn't matter.
It's cowardly.

513
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,399
I think he was brave.
And his friend.

514
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,318
And I think Yates
was brave to write it.

515
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,030
Brave is never giving up.
You fight, no matter what.

516
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,330
So, Kate Baldwin was willing
if Yates was in?

517
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,666
Yeah, Dana was giving her
20,000 words.

518
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,960
I think we can pivot.

519
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,920
How?

520
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,172
Get her back on the phone.

521
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:59,681
- Julia.
- Olivia, I didn't know you were in town.

522
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,057
Oh, just a little visit.

523
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,769
I miss seeing Dean's face sometimes.
Don't tell him that.

524
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,937
- Will you give us a few minutes?
- No, she should stay.

525
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,355
Oh, I know
you have things to discuss.

526
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,274
Like your husband
withdrawing from the ticket.

527
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,403
That's why she's in town, right?
For the announcement.

528
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,781
I know the press conference
must've caught you off guard,

529
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,282
but the president
didn't want you to know.

530
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,368
- He thought you'd organize a protest.
- He was right. I would've.

531
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,329
My plan was to sit down,
talk this out before the announcement.

532
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,956
There isn't gonna be
an announcement.

533
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,834
You... you can't waltz in here--

534
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:31,379
We've raised $20 million for your husband
since he was a freshman.

535
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,007
That gives me the right
to waltz in whenever I want.

536
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,301
- Show some respect.
- Honey, please.

537
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,262
No. This is what we wanted.

538
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,432
- What we've worked for.
- When Underwood loses,

539
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,476
you'll spend the next two years
fighting off a primary opponent.

540
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,064
Every one of our 200,000 members in Ohio
will turn on you.

541
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,068
By the time you've lost this office,
Olivia's law firm will go tits up.

542
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,446
Don't forget, we pushed
most of your clients your way.

543
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,367
He got cold feet.
What can I do?

544
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,161
Convince him
to change his mind.

545
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,831
He wouldn't listen.
He says the NRA came down hard on him.

546
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,582
Because you had him
do the press conference.

547
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,086
No, that was Austen's idea, not mine.
I told him to lay low,

548
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,171
but he said if he was in,
he wanted to be all in.

549
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:18,134
- The idea was to balance the ticket.
- Well, we can't do anything about Austen.

550
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,511
The question now is
who do we get to replace him?

551
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,180
Go back to the list?

552
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,016
He was fine, but I'm not enthused
by anyone else on that list.

553
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,518
Let's not go back to square one,
Mr. President.

554
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,145
We have a good list.

555
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,646
Everybody can get
behind those names.

556
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,190
It's common sense.

557
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,612
The only problem with common sense
is that it's so... common.

558
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,866
I think we can do better.

559
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,200
Who?

560
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,245
Cathy Durant.

561
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,581
Now, Louisiana's not a swing state,
I know that.

562
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,502
But she is still a national figure,
she helps us with the women's vote,

563
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,796
and I trust her.

564
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,257
What about guns?

565
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,884
I don't think she's ever had
a strong position.

566
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,386
It's better than that.
She's never uttered a word on the issue.

567
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,804
We checked.

568
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,644
- I like it.
- So do I.

569
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,064
- But I had another thought.
- Who?

570
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,649
Not "who." How.

571
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:20,446
I don't think I should choose her.
I think the party should choose her.

572
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,742
Not an open convention.

573
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,077
Look, Bob, let's...

574
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:33,209
We have to face the fact that my health
is gonna be a major liability for us.

575
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:38,214
No matter who becomes the running mate,
they could well end up being president.

576
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,425
Now, that is a...

577
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,593
a scenario
that I don't even like to fathom,

578
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,970
but we can't escape it.

579
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:49,100
And if it's such an important decision,
why not let the party make it?

580
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,061
Because it'd be a free-for-all.

581
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,563
No, no.
We make it so that Cathy wins.

582
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,774
We'll just make it look
like the party chose her.

583
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:59,194
And think of the coverage.
We'll own the news.

584
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,321
You want the convention to be a circus.

585
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,949
Oh, Bob, I'm not sure
if you've noticed or not,

586
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,702
but politics is no longer just theater,
it's show business.

587
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,330
So let's put on the best show in town.

588
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,457
Great.

589
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,167
Will you give me a salute, General?

590
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,716
Active military aren't allowed
to speak to the press.

591
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,302
He delivered his resignation this morning.

592
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,678
No shit.

593
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,890
We're gonna break it online
as soon as the president accepts it.

594
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,310
Not often a monthly
gets raw meat like this, huh?

595
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,771
- His phone's gonna blow up.
- But you get the exclusive.

596
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,735
- Sorry about Tom.
- I'm not.

597
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,738
Thank you, General.

598
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,032
All right, we're gonna go set up
for the...

599
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,079
Good afternoon, General.
Kate Baldwin.

600
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,706
Shall we?

601
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:58,962
So, the main issue that Mrs. Underwood
has been focusing on is guns, obviously.

602
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,839
We've got some talking points
we've been using,

603
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,091
- so you'll want to--
- I'm sorry, is there any water?

604
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,260
Yes.

605
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,098
I'm a bit hungover.

606
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,436
At least I'm not still drunk.

607
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,356
Want some?

608
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,566
Uh, we're fine.

609
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,027
Right.

610
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,488
So...

611
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,073
to the talking points.

612
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,994
What is it?

613
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,838
Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen.

614
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:50,013
What I want to communicate mostly
is about the death toll,

615
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,099
with personal stories,
things that connect with--

616
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,517
Claire.

617
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,354
- Tom.
- Mr. President.

618
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,356
Can we speak?

619
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,484
I'll, uh...
I'll leave you to it.

620
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,786
Does she actually give a shit about guns?

621
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:16,414
What's that got to do with anything?

622
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,925
We knew this was a possibility.

623
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,386
He's gonna make a lot of noise.
It's Conway, I'm sure of it.

624
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,099
Problem isn't Conway, it's LeAnn.
She pressured us to cancel the air strike.

625
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,434
We chose our path, Doug.
Let's not second-guess it.

626
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,020
No offense, Mrs. Underwood,
but she's doing damage.

627
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,313
I think we should replace her.

628
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,482
She's the reason
we're gonna pass the gun bill.

629
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,319
Sir? I just got this from Dana Treister,
the editor of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

630
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,695
Not sure what it means...

631
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,451
He's gonna make
that son of a bitch his running mate.

632
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,954
- What's goin' on?
- I'll see what I can dig up on him.

633
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,623
No. He was fully vetted when he was
commissioned for the Joint Chiefs.

634
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,709
No, you go with Seth
and draft a statement on the resignation.

635
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,296
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
- What's going on, Doug?

636
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,263
And it's LeAnn's fault.

637
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,931
He never would've resigned
if it wasn't for her.

638
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,809
See what you can find.

639
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,520
On the general?
The president said we shouldn't.

640
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,022
On LeAnn.

641
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,149
Hey, I don't wanna get involved
in some cage match--

642
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:28,486
I thought we had an understanding.
Your obedience.

643
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,032
I'll see what I can do.

644
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:38,621
Do you agree with Doug?
You're having reservations about LeAnn?

645
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,999
Less about her and more about Tom.

646
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:44,877
But I told you I trust you on this,
so I'm trusting you.

647
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,216
- Has the leadership agreed yet?
- They're skeptical.

648
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,552
We can use this.

649
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,764
Well, gentlemen, if there was any doubt
about an open convention, let it go,

650
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,142
because we're gonna wanna bury this news.

651
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,227
Brockhart has just resigned.

652
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,522
And the general is about to appear
on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

653
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,482
Imagine what Conway can do with that.

654
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,152
<i>Conway! Conway! Conway!</i>

655
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,490
Thank you for coming.

656
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:17,452
Thank you for coming.
Thank you! Thank you!

657
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,037
Thank you for coming out.

658
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,122
- Dana just sent me this.
- So great to see you.

659
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,873
The story broke.

660
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,626
- Hello.
- Isn't my wife perfect?

661
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,338
Thank you.

662
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,298
Let her know how perfect you think she is!

663
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,134
Stop it. Ahh!

664
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,679
You're too much!

665
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:40,266
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Conway! Conway! Conway!

666
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,082
Yeah, I know, Fausto.

667
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,377
I get exhausted
just thinking about it, too.

668
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,185
All right.

669
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,356
A journey of a thousand miles.
