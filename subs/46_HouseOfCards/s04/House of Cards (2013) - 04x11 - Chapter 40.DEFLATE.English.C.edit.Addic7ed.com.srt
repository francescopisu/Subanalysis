1
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,401
<i>President and Mrs. Underwood
are back in Louisiana today,</i>

2
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,861
<i>in an effort to pick up...</i>

3
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,821
<i>Underwood
is in Las Vegas today,</i>

4
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,907
<i>meeting with leadership
from the Culinary Union...</i>

5
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,408
<i>...questions
from undecided voters</i>

6
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,868
<i>in Charleston this afternoon,</i>

7
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,995
<i>the first of three events
the Underwood campaign...</i>

8
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,081
<i>The First Lady took questions
at a town hall meeting in Casper today.</i>

9
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,626
<i>That's 12 cities
in half as many days for the Underwoods.</i>

10
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,210
<i>Meanwhile,
they still trail Conway</i>

11
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,922
<i>by 12 to 14 points in every national poll.</i>

12
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,256
<i>That's a big gap to close...</i>

13
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,591
<i>...supporters in Boise
waited an extra two hours</i>

14
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,760
<i>for the president...</i>

15
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,095
<i>The president's
whistle-stop tour of Ohio will...</i>

16
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,181
<i>You're one of the states
that will decide this!</i>

17
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>...took questions from
undecided voters</i>

18
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,977
<i>in Charleston this afternoon,
the first of three events...</i>

19
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>Please give a big Boston welcome
to the next president...</i>

20
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,441
<i>For many Americans,
the question remains,</i>

21
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,028
<i>what would an Underwood-Underwood
White House look like?</i>

22
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>Both Underwoods have courted...</i>

23
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,116
So, Arizona, Nevada,
and California on Monday,

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,993
then the upper Midwest on Tuesday.

25
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,913
It's not enough. Conway's hitting
way more states than we are.

26
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,666
Well, he's not a sitting president.
He has more time than you do.

27
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,292
Well, then we have to make more time.

28
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,503
We have to get out there.
We've got to shake...

29
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,787
Francis, are you okay?

30
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,593
- I'm fine.
- Sit down for a moment.

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,346
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let's continue.

32
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,728
If you wanna add
a fundraiser in California,

33
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,520
we can make that happen.

34
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,023
Uh-huh. Okay.

35
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,525
So?

36
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,028
I agree with Dr. Saxon
and the medical team.

37
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,072
We should reduce air travel
to once a week.

38
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,741
I'm afraid that's not possible.

39
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:21,243
You wanted a second opinion, sir.
You have it.

40
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,726
I didn't want a second opinion.
I wanted a different opinion.

41
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,247
Planes take a toll.

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,499
We're concerned
about a sudden organ rejection.

43
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,335
I can't win an election
if I can't travel.

44
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,337
You can't win if you're hospitalized.

45
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,464
Thank you, Doctor.

46
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,808
You stay here.
I'll go wherever Conway goes, I'll just...

47
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,060
I'm on the top of the ticket.
It has to be me.

48
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:49,479
We can't ignore
the doctors, Francis.

49
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,981
It's the story we tell.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,234
If I stay here,
Conway prances around the country,

51
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,862
playing up his fighter-pilot image,
and meanwhile,

52
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,782
- I'm stuck here in the Rose Garden...
- I won't risk losing you.

53
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,665
Let's be smart about this.

54
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:15,380
- I need to project strength.
- So project it.

55
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,507
The air strikes are working, sir.

56
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,802
We've stopped ICO's advance
to the Euphrates.

57
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,679
We've delayed the advance.
We haven't stopped it.

58
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,809
Your own reports say they're regrouping.
I want a decisive blow,

59
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,602
a face, the leadership,
to send a message.

60
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,730
Uh, the Ahmadi brothers are in hiding.
We don't know their location.

61
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,900
Well, your task is to find them.

62
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,485
We've tried, sir.
Our assets hit a wall.

63
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,989
To root them out would require
special forces on the ground.

64
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,116
That is a step I am willing to take.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,285
We don't have authorization
from the Syrians.

66
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,704
Secretary Durant will smooth that out.

67
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,042
I will not be satisfied by blocking
the serpent's path, gentlemen.

68
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,377
I wanna cut off its goddamn head.

69
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,967
The Syrians will say no,
and when they do,

70
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,385
see if they'll work
with the Russian special forces.

71
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,721
The Russians do the dirty work,
we take all the credit.

72
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,889
Petrov won't go for that.

73
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,183
Well, he will if we give him back
some of our drilling zones.

74
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,310
Well, that'll take congressional approval.

75
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,687
Doug's laying the groundwork now.

76
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,358
Are you interested in my opinion on this,
or has it already been decided?

77
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,861
I want to move fast,
so unless you have a quicker option,

78
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,738
it's probably best
you keep it to yourself.

79
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,698
- Yes, sir.
- Cathy.

80
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,702
Do we have a problem?

81
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,455
No, sir.
I'll coordinate with Doug.

82
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,460
After a dog's bitten you,
you either put it to sleep,

83
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,129
or you put a muzzle on it.

84
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,091
I've chosen a muzzle... for now.

85
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,138
Hi. I was, uh,
thinking on the way over here

86
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,349
that I don't wanna do
the same speech at every event.

87
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,976
I really think we'll get
more news coverage

88
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,810
if I have a different speech every time.

89
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,646
LeAnn already told me.

90
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,525
I've been working on some variations.

91
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,571
I think, uh, we also need to respond
to what Conway is saying...

92
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,199
at all times.
Start putting pressure on him.

93
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,576
Seth's office is sending me transcripts.

94
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,297
There was
an interview query from <i>Time,</i>

95
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,507
a voicemail about some memorial fund.

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,842
Senator Halston called
about the meeting on Tuesday.

97
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,387
Wait. The voicemail.

98
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,058
Uh, Laura Moretti,
from the Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.

99
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:35,145
- I guess you... donated?
- Cue that up for me.

100
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,857
Just press one when you're ready.

101
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,610
- I'll catch up with you in a little bit.
- Okay.

102
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,375
<i>Hi, this is Laura Moretti</i>

103
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,461
<i>leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.</i>

104
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,090
<i>I just, uh...
I wanted to reach out to you personally,</i>

105
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,051
<i>to say thank you
for the incredibly generous donation.</i>

106
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,472
<i>It's the biggest donation we've received.
By a lot.</i>

107
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,475
<i>Uh, I don't know
how you found out about us.</i>

108
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>Maybe because of
the president's transplant.</i>

109
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>But whatever the reason,</i>

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,983
<i>it means so much to us,
to me and my children.</i>

111
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,694
<i>Anyway, I...
and I know this is a long shot,</i>

112
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,616
<i>but if you're ever free for coffee,
I'd love to thank you in person.</i>

113
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,662
<i>No worries if... if you can't.
Um, thanks again, Mr. Stamper.</i>

114
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,223
<i>Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti
leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.</i>

115
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,809
<i>I just, uh...
I wanted to reach out to you personally,</i>

116
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,812
<i>to say thank you
for the incredibly generous donation.</i>

117
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,898
<i>It's the biggest donation we've received.</i>

118
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,152
Will there be enough time
to get this up on the teleprompter?

119
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,570
They're mostly cuts.

120
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,990
Should be quick.
I'll get it there now.

121
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,703
What did you change?

122
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,791
I took out the paragraph about love.

123
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,169
- That's the best part.
- It was too soft.

124
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,290
This used to be
a barbecue joint, here.

125
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,753
Frank came a lot before he was president.

126
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,800
What happened to it?

127
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,096
Same thing that happens
to everything Frank touches.

128
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,153
- You mind?
- I do mind.

129
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,615
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

130
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,661
Tell me what you know.

131
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,623
I know Underwood lied
about the money laundering.

132
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,336
I know he met with Lanagin
when he said he didn't.

133
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,048
I know Edward Meechum
doctored travel records,

134
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,759
and I know you were there for all of it.

135
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,304
Then Tusk gets a pardon.
You get Chief of Staff.

136
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,599
- Old news.
- Why'd you quit the job?

137
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,851
I wanted to go back in the private sector.

138
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,105
You just said everything
Underwood touches gets demolished.

139
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,191
I don't like the man.
So what?

140
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,943
Why'd you team up with him again
for the Russia deal?

141
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,571
I don't have to like the people
I work with.

142
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,241
Plus, there was a fortune to be made.

143
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,910
See...

144
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,996
I don't think you give a damn
about the money.

145
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:28,670
There's a lot more to this
you're not admitting.

146
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,755
But I think you want to.

147
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,759
So, truth is,
you don't have anything solid.

148
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,388
I will get to the bottom of this story.

149
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,474
We can talk now, or you can wait
till you have a team of lawyers

150
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,685
talking to my fact checkers.

151
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,233
I've been threatened by billionaires
and by presidents.

152
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,863
You think an out-of-work reporter
makes me nervous?

153
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,910
I can call the White House right now,
let 'em know you're working on this story.

154
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,120
That's a gamble I took asking to meet.

155
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,123
But my chips...

156
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,378
are on the better part of you prevailing.

157
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:18,135
The who... the what...
the why, how...

158
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,764
Don't ignore where.

159
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,820
I think it'd be better
if I turn it.

160
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,825
I think...
I think this side is a little better.

161
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,412
- Yes, that's very nice.
- Freddy.

162
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,873
- Good afternoon, Mr. President.
- Good afternoon.

163
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,585
- Helen is teaching me the ropes.
- We'll leave you be, sir.

164
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,421
Oh, Freddy?

165
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,924
Why don't you stay back for a little bit?
Thank you very much.

166
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,760
I'll be right there.

167
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,639
It's been a while.

168
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,309
Well, they, uh... moved me
to the flower shop a few months ago.

169
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,435
The basement.

170
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,521
That's probably why
you haven't seen me around.

171
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,565
Never would've guessed that,
well, that this would be my thing.

172
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,319
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

173
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,865
- How's your grandson?
- He's good, good.

174
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,326
- Just started school again.
- Mmm.

175
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,662
- What grade is he in now?
- Sixth grade.

176
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,789
- Getting up there.
- Mmm-hmm.

177
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,875
I... I really should go.

178
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,670
We got a big, uh,
shipment of autumn blooms in.

179
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,923
Well, then another time, I guess, maybe.

180
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,716
You know, Frank...

181
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,262
I'm gonna be leaving soon.

182
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,350
Helen's husband opened up
a flower shop in Georgetown.

183
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,268
They want me to work there.

184
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,230
Well, are you not happy here, Freddy?

185
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,109
Time to try something new.

186
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,323
Well, is there anything I can do
to convince you to stay?

187
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,990
A raise? Better hours?

188
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,828
I appreciate it,
but I've already told Helen yes,

189
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:12,166
and... I plan on keeping my word on that.
It's what I want.

190
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,172
Well, I'm gonna miss you around, Freddy.
There's not many people here...

191
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,343
Well, I guess there aren't
that many people here

192
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,428
I'm all that comfortable with.

193
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,514
You know what you should do
before you go?

194
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,351
You should come up here one night
and cook us a rack of ribs.

195
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,895
Now, I realize oven-baked
isn't nearly as good as the smoker,

196
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,857
but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.

197
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,234
Ribs? Really?

198
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,028
You want me to cook ribs for you.

199
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,948
Well, sure, just like old times.
What's wrong with that?

200
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,825
I'm just the help, ain't I?

201
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,497
- No, that's not true.
- I tell you I got something good going,

202
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,540
and your first thought ain't,

203
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,333
- "Freddy, congratulations."
- Oh...

204
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,503
It's "make me ribs."
And what's my big send-off?

205
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,212
- I get to cook you ribs.
- No.

206
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,632
Look, you are being
way oversensitive about this.

207
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,509
You're misinterpreting what I meant.

208
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,885
You're right.

209
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,388
It's all my fault.

210
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,894
- I don't know how Claire does it.
- What did you just say?

211
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,730
Is this how you treat her?
She part of the collection, too?

212
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,690
I don't know where
all this is coming from,

213
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,861
but it's extremely ungrateful,
given all that I have done for you.

214
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,656
What did you do for me, Frank?

215
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,535
This is the White House.

216
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,913
You will call me "Mr. President"!

217
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,998
You're a motherfucker!

218
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,333
Get out!

219
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,425
My bad, my bad.

220
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:47,554
You're a motherfucker, Mr. President!

221
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:57,063
Governor Conway continues to say
we're not doing enough about terrorism,

222
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,943
but he ignores the fact that
ICO has been stopped in its tracks.

223
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,780
The president is working tirelessly
to combat our enemies abroad,

224
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,033
<i>and what Governor Conway lacks
in his assessment...</i>

225
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,412
<i>is the decades of experience
the president brings...</i>

226
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,040
Do you think you should keep
calling him "the president"?

227
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,043
Well, I wanna emphasize
that we're running mates,

228
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,546
and LeAnn is telling me that
the marriage angle isn't working.

229
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,922
Screw the research.

230
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,677
People want to hear
the real you, a real person.

231
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,679
That's what you gave them
at the convention.

232
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,263
- Ow.
- Sorry.

233
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,015
That was very different.

234
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,268
Exactly. It was very different.
It was honest.

235
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,690
And you don't want
to just react to what he's saying.

236
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,067
You wanna offer something.

237
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,570
I have been campaigning
with Francis for 30 years.

238
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,322
You don't ever let the opponent
walk all over you.

239
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,199
If you're getting attacked,
you fight back.

240
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,577
Fine, but fight back in a different way.

241
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,123
This guy is...
He's all spotlight and surface,

242
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,710
and magazine covers and Twitter.
Don't play his game.

243
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,797
Don't play the game at all, please.
Get beyond the game.

244
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,593
Ow. You know what?
Let's finish this in the morning, please.

245
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,938
I'm sorry.
You're right.

246
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,816
You have a lot more experience
in this kind of thing than I do.

247
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,904
- I should follow your lead.
- No, I... I respect your feedback.

248
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,914
Thank you for being so professional
about everything.

249
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,417
- You've been very kind.
- I'm not kind.

250
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,420
Just realistic.

251
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,596
That paragraph you wrote about love,
it made me uncomfortable.

252
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,189
- Saying you love Francis?
- I do love him.

253
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,904
Then what made you uncomfortable?

254
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,368
Saying it in front of you.

255
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,851
- Yes?
- Yeah.

256
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:30,234
- How'd she do?
- Very little effect.

257
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,528
- She was all over the news.
- White noise.

258
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,282
So how do we make it stick?

259
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,910
Well, there's not much I can do.

260
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,453
We gave you access.
I need more than I'm getting.

261
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,127
You're supposed to tell me
what people want.

262
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,590
People didn't know they wanted jazz
until they heard it for the first time.

263
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:58,012
I can get them to like the music.
I can't compose it.

264
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,640
Give me something I can work with.

265
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,112
Is this something
we could take public?

266
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,073
No, it's classified.

267
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,034
But it's perfect,
the president colluding with the Russians.

268
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,244
The idea has merit.

269
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,038
The Russians will have far more access,

270
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,873
and it doesn't put American troops
in harm's way.

271
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,517
We don't get votes by praising
the president's policy.

272
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,837
Let's have Dreyer block it in committee.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,923
I don't like the way the president's
handled ICO from the get-go,

274
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,301
- but his approach might work here.
- That's what I'm trying to prevent.

275
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,429
So, you wanna keep
the ICO leadership alive,

276
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,514
so we can stay on message?

277
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,352
Just until November, and then
we'll hit 'em hard after inauguration.

278
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,897
This is the exact sort of BS
I resigned over in the first place.

279
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,649
I'll see you over there.

280
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,444
Two months away from winning this thing.

281
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,405
But if he gains the initiative,
if he picks up any momentum,

282
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,199
that could put us in the margin of error.

283
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,784
I thought you were different.

284
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,412
Don't get any ideas, General.

285
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,125
You threw caution into the wind
when you got yourself on my ticket.

286
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,335
You do it again,
you start to look foolish.

287
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,880
You talk to Dreyer and 86 this bill.

288
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,426
I couldn't come to Wisconsin
without having a taste test.

289
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,476
Mr. Hayes.
My name's Tom Hammerschmidt.

290
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,317
I'm a freelance reporter. I was hoping
I could talk to you for a moment.

291
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,357
I don't talk to reporters.

292
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:38,905
- It's a story about the president.
- Did you not hear me the first time?

293
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:45,077
I think things happened...
in your barbecue place.

294
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,913
Meetings.

295
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,790
Things you might have overheard.

296
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:54,711
I think the president broke the law,
and I think you know about it.

297
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,674
Come with me.
Let's talk where no one can hear us.

298
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,943
- So, uh, you bring a recorder?
- Yeah.

299
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,216
All right.
Here's the truth.

300
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,554
I don't work for him no more.
I don't serve him ribs no more.

301
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,265
I don't want nothing
to do with him no more.

302
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,186
Even if I hated him, and I do hate him...

303
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,149
I don't snitch.
Not to cops, not to reporters.

304
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,818
Not to anybody.

305
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,655
Leave me the fuck alone.

306
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,998
Okay.

307
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,051
Lincoln and Roosevelt
were progressive Republicans.

308
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,387
Yeah!

309
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,265
- Jefferson was a visionary conservative.
- Yeah!

310
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,559
George Washington was
a strong commander in chief.

311
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,852
Yeah!

312
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,730
William Conway embodies
all these qualities.

313
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,526
I proudly endorse
his candidacy for president,

314
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,488
and I ask everyone in our great state
to do the same.

315
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,909
The next President of the United States,
William Conway!

316
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,634
I'm... I'm humbled by your endorsement,

317
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,180
and by the legacy of these great men
behind me.

318
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,683
Now, they all left very big shoes to fill.

319
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,687
You know who hasn't
come even close to filling them?

320
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,022
Frank Underwood.

321
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,876
I should go.

322
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,255
Once we land.

323
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,924
I'll get a flight back to the East Coast.

324
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,262
- Tom...
- You don't have to say anything.

325
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,336
We've had eggs
thrown at the house.

326
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,090
- Tomatoes, cow dung.
- You name it.

327
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,592
South Dakota's big Conway country.

328
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,303
We've been here all our lives.
We raised our son here.

329
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:35,182
<i>- It's just beyond our experience.
- All these folks are our neighbors.</i>

330
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,934
<i>But once I put that sign up...</i>

331
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,148
Governor Conway is a veteran.
He has children.

332
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,940
Why us and not him?

333
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,654
When we saw you two at the convention...

334
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,323
I don't know.
It just seemed like a real partnership.

335
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,915
<i>Love. Deep, unwavering love.</i>

336
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:05,254
I wanna thank you for reminding me
how important that kind of love is.

337
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,965
Because it is.
It's easy to get caught up in the campaign

338
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,512
and to forget how Francis
and I got here in the first place,

339
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,014
to remember that we're not
just President and First Lady,

340
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,100
or husband and wife.

341
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,518
We're partners.

342
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,855
We have made a choice
to tackle everything together.

343
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,610
We go beyond what's pretty and perfect,

344
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,406
beyond what's scary,
difficult and unknown.

345
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:38,495
We're not just partners on the ticket.
We're partners in life.

346
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,248
<i>Mr. President.</i>

347
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,126
You have someone on the inside
of the House Intelligence Committee

348
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,253
feeding you classified information.

349
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,379
<i>I'm a sitting governor.</i>

350
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,631
<i>There's nothing wrong
with staying informed.</i>

351
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,551
Every Republican is against
the Russians being involved.

352
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,886
You are interfering
with national security.

353
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,638
I haven't influenced a single member.

354
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,100
<i>Oh, that's because
you're having Brockhart do it.</i>

355
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,768
If the general chooses
to share his expertise with them,

356
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:02,978
<i>they're well served by it.</i>

357
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,898
Fifty times a day,
you say we should destroy ICO,

358
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,610
and now you're deliberately
preventing us from doing it.

359
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,278
<i>You could've destroyed them
six months ago,</i>

360
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,821
<i>so don't lay that at my...</i>

361
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,073
I don't blame you
for being a fraud, Governor.

362
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,743
<i>I mean, we all have to be hypocrites,
every now and then.</i>

363
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,705
<i>But if you block this,
I'll send American troops in instead.</i>

364
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,333
You won't send Americans.
Syria won't allow it.

365
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,252
<i>I don't care what Syria will allow.</i>

366
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,421
But wouldn't you rather have it be
Russians in harm's way,

367
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,840
than your fellow American soldiers?

368
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:36,178
If anyone gets killed,
that's going to be blood on your hands.

369
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:39,640
You want me to tell the Republicans to...
get on board.

370
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:45,646
<i>Or have the general do it.
Put politics aside and do the right thing.</i>

371
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,774
Did you really think
you'd be able to convince me

372
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,609
by making this call, Mr. President?

373
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,363
<i>I'm ahead by double digits.
I got a message that's working.</i>

374
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,073
<i>You're on your heels,
and you're asking me to help you</i>

375
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,411
<i>by appealing to my sense of duty?</i>

376
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:04,498
I've even got you sold on my message.

377
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:09,085
Well, you shouldn't believe everything
you see on TV.

378
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,214
<i>The governor has
ended the call, Mr. President.</i>

379
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,640
Hmm, let's go.

380
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,645
We're gonna go forward
with our own ground operation.

381
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:30,649
I'll inform the Joint Chiefs.
Sir, there's another thing.

382
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,902
The Intelligence Committee...
If Conway has someone on the inside...

383
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,322
You're worried about oversight
on surveillance.

384
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,282
There's increased attention.

385
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,325
They dig around,
find out what Macallan's up to...

386
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,787
- Yeah, but I thought we were airtight.
- LeAnn says we are, but still...

387
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,290
The safest thing would be to end it.

388
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,754
<i>Claire Underwood's
been on the move the past two days,</i>

389
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,882
<i>showing up in every state
Governor Conway's held events.</i>

390
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,594
<i>Absent from the trail
has been the president.</i>

391
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,096
<i>Press Secretary Seth Grayson said, quote,</i>

392
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,807
<i>"The president is attending
to the business of government</i>

393
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,559
<i>for the time being," end quote.</i>

394
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,730
<i>But he neglected to say when
the president would resume campaigning,</i>

395
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,984
<i>and there are no upcoming events
currently listed on the campaign website,</i>

396
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,945
<i>leading some to speculate
that the real reason for his absence</i>

397
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,572
<i>may be health-related.</i>

398
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,826
<i>It's been six months since the president
received a liver transplant.</i>

399
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,703
<i>Although he was able
to resume normal...</i>

400
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,957
- What happened to your eye?
- Freddy Hayes.

401
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,585
So I assume he didn't talk.

402
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:36,465
- I need a way in here, Mr. Danton.
- I've helped you as much as I can.

403
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,592
I know you won't go on record.

404
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,971
I'm not even asking
to put you on background.

405
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:49,060
All I'm looking for
is whether I'm warm or cold.

406
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,733
What kind of beer is that?

407
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,948
A lager. Some microbrew they had, um...
I don't know the name.

408
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,284
Mind if I try it?

409
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,289
Go ahead.

410
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,089
It's good.

411
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,969
Used to play a drinking game
when I was a teenager...

412
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,472
called Never Have I Ever.

413
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:28,767
- You know that game?
- You drink when you have.

414
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,562
That's the one.

415
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,483
Or if the president has.

416
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:51,498
Never have I ever perjured myself
when investigated by a special prosecutor.

417
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,889
Never have I ever
struck a deal with Raymond Tusk...

418
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,935
to perjure himself
in exchange for a pardon.

419
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:23,322
Never have I ever conspired
to impeach a president

420
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,907
so I could become president myself.

421
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,846
We're gonna need more beer.

422
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:59,315
- The First Lady is on line one, sir.
- Thank you.

423
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,821
Claire.

424
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:08,492
Doug called me
about sending in our own troops.

425
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:12,120
Well, it was that, or sit on our hands.
Conway wouldn't budge.

426
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,789
<i>And what does Cathy say?</i>

427
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,707
I'm more interested
in hearing what you think.

428
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,628
Well, I think... doing something
is better than doing nothing.

429
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,839
<i>How are the events going?</i>

430
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:26,885
It's hard to tell.
I've done so many, it's all a blur.

431
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,596
There's only one interview left tonight,

432
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,434
and then we're done for the day, but then
there's, uh... seven events tomorrow.

433
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,561
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

434
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,443
I called to tell you Tom's not working
on the campaign anymore.

435
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,362
- Did he quit?
<i>- No.</i>

436
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,782
What happened?

437
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,619
We both decided it was for the best.

438
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,583
<i>We don't have to worry about him, Francis.</i>

439
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,420
You sound tired.

440
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,343
Make sure you get
a full night's sleep tonight.

441
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,676
- Francis?
<i>- Yes?</i>

442
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,597
Nothing.

443
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,184
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, tomorrow.

444
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:45,464
- You're certain Underwood knew?
- And Walker didn't.

445
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:49,926
- Could Danton have some agenda on this?
- He has no reason to lie.

446
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,723
- Who's corroborated, besides him?
- No one. That's why I'm here.

447
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,019
I need institutional support.
Legal, research...

448
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,688
a place to work
where my dog won't bark at me.

449
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,982
If you crack this story,
you can do anything you want.

450
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:08,945
- I'll even make you managing editor again.
- I don't want that.

451
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,157
What I do want... is absolute autonomy.

452
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:16,411
I build my team, I keep it small,
and I answer only to you.

453
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:20,123
- How about security?
- Oh, this was just some bad luck.

454
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:24,377
- I've lost two reporters, Tom.
- Oh, come on, Margaret.

455
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,340
Underwood may be a crook,
but he's not a killer.

456
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,423
I don't think so either,
but I don't wanna take any chances.

457
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,092
You just get me the staff I need.

458
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,762
Once this article comes out,
I'm untouchable.

459
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,473
When the White House
starts throwing punches... lawyer up.

460
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,644
'Cause he's gonna throw 'em
at the <i>Herald,</i> not me.

461
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,501
Hobby I used to have.

462
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:11,341
The Battle of the Wilderness.
I spent months building a model of it.

463
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,219
Started another one,
but never finished it.

464
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,847
- Why not?
- I became president.

465
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,890
- Never enough time.
- Hmm.

466
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,144
Does Claire know you asked me here?

467
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,396
No.

468
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:41,037
It was more than just a fling, wasn't it?

469
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:53,258
- How did she describe it?
- I didn't ask.

470
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,679
Well, I'm not gonna go into details.

471
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,098
I respect you too much for that.

472
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,730
When you two came back from Texas...

473
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,566
I had a feeling.

474
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:17,949
She says... you made her mother laugh.

475
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,160
Yeah, I guess she took a liking to me.

476
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,416
Christ, I haven't seen
that woman laugh in 30 years.

477
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,376
I'm just not a threat.

478
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,756
Just someone who didn't judge,
accepted her.

479
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,300
Do you make Claire laugh?

480
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:43,266
We have a connection.
Yeah... I make her laugh.

481
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,268
I make her feel desired.

482
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:50,565
I think she feels comfortable
being vulnerable around me.

483
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,110
I have to say,
I'm a bit surprised you're not upset.

484
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,530
- What would that achieve?
- I admire that, Frank.

485
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,704
I got angry with an old friend yesterday

486
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:06,497
for calling me "Frank"
instead of "Mr. President."

487
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,916
Just for using your name?

488
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,838
It wasn't the name, I suppose.

489
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:15,298
It's the fact that he's leaving me.

490
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,384
- Leaving you how?
- New job.

491
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:23,473
- Hmm. He worked for you?
- Here in the White House.

492
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,770
It's tough for employees
to be your friends.

493
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,274
That's why I decided to end it.

494
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,908
- You decided to leave.
- So that she wouldn't have to ask me to.

495
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,749
And what about your book?

496
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,128
I would never betray her like that.

497
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,468
Thank you, Tom.

498
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:04,389
- I'll walk you out.
- I know my way out.

499
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,057
But thanks.

500
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,147
Take care, Frank.

501
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,481
Three teams.
North, east, and west.

502
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,443
We'll triangulate
and advance on the center.

503
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,403
Each team will have a field agent

504
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,531
working with local assets
to locate the Ahmadis.

505
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,826
Here's the executive order, sir.

506
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,883
Do you have a preference?
Dead or alive?

507
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,969
Alive, if we can get
intelligence out of 'em.

508
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,012
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

509
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:36,272
You're officially briefing me
on ICO-related surveillance activities.

510
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,942
You never saw or spoke to the president.

511
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,946
This way.

512
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,211
Mr. Macallan.

513
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:03,174
- Mr. President.
- The president's in his residence...

514
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,509
not here.

515
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,388
Security.
We have concerns.

516
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,473
Conway has people
on House Intelligence.

517
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,267
I've got everything masked.

518
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,936
The algorithms for ICO
and the campaign are identical.

519
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,397
It's just a matter
of what variables you input.

520
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Give me English.

521
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,359
Uh...

522
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:28,824
One spoon.
I can use it to stir my coffee...

523
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:30,785
to eat soup...

524
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,704
to boil heroin.

525
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,544
All they see is the spoon,
not what I do with it.

526
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,922
Or we could
just get rid of the spoon.

527
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:46,134
Shut it down? Well, that would be a shame,
especially after yesterday.

528
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:50,846
- What happened yesterday?
- Beyond happened.

529
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,558
"Beyond"?

530
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:57,020
What your wife said in South Dakota.

531
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,855
"Beyond what's pretty and perfect."

532
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,485
Liberation from convention,
from the past.

533
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:08,406
Beyond surface, beyond bullshit,
beyond the election.

534
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,329
- Beyond marriage.
- Yes, exactly.

535
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,709
You're not just husband and wife.
You're not just running mates.

536
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,587
You're both and more.

537
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,880
You're what's possible.

538
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:28,426
The Conways are everything
everyone wants to be.

539
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:33,139
You're everything
everyone wants to become.

540
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,941
The president has been shot.
He's had a liver transplant.

541
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,444
And I'm sure everyone here
in Pittsburgh is wondering,

542
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,030
what happens if he dies?

543
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:51,866
Not to be indelicate, but...

544
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,410
What if I became president?

545
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,786
And that's fair.

546
00:40:56,412 --> 00:41:03,169
Our party chose me because they saw
one half of an indivisible team.

547
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,255
Unconditional support.

548
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:10,343
- Two people working together for years.
- Supporting each other is one thing.

549
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,014
Experience is another.
You have very little.

550
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,517
I can see from your ring
that you're married.

551
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,645
- Yes. Eighteen years.
- So you know what real partnership is.

552
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,439
We have 30 years under our belts.

553
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:27,402
Learning from and advising each other?
I'd call that experience.

554
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,156
Okay, so you've got a strong marriage,
but in terms of your qualifications...

555
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:35,701
What... what I'm saying is that we need
to get beyond husband and wife.

556
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,204
We need to look at the team.

557
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,791
Francis has served in Congress,
in the White House.

558
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:46,796
I've run a major nonprofit.
I served as ambassador.

559
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,841
We have passed legislation,
developed policy.

560
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:55,555
We've done all of that together,
every step of the way.

561
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,349
So it's natural
that we would run together.

562
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,851
And I know Francis better than anyone.

563
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,689
So, if he died, to answer your question,

564
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,733
who better to carry out
his plan for America?

565
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,195
Manipulation.

566
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,613
Deception.

567
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,532
Corruption.

568
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:19,870
That translates to abuse of power
and breaking the law.

569
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,335
We know it's true,
but we need corroboration.

570
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:28,379
People on record,
every fact researched

571
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,466
and checked and double-checked.

572
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,846
Nothing we discuss leaves this room.

573
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,890
Not your friends, not your family,

574
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:44,187
not the 50 reporters outside that door
who wanna know what we're doing in here.

575
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,483
The second the White House
gets wind of what we're doing...

576
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,069
they start to make this story...

577
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,655
disappear.

578
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,909
The radio interview you did
was spectacular.

579
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,035
It felt good.

580
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,455
I feel like we're finally
tapping into something.

581
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,791
Was it Tom, what you said in South Dakota,
with the couple?

582
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,253
I saw a videotape of it.

583
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,840
The core of it, yes.
And then...

584
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,884
I sort of made it my own.

585
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,387
He should stay on.

586
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,930
- No.
- Not as your speechwriter.

587
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,058
Well, I mean, yes, to the rest
of the world, he can be our speechwriter.

588
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:25,561
But that's not why he should stay on.

589
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,108
He should stay on because...

590
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,569
he can give you things that I can't.

591
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:37,157
Look, Claire,
we've been a great team.

592
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,033
But one person...

593
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,663
one person cannot give
everything to another person.

594
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,707
I can't travel with you.

595
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:52,963
I don't keep you warm at night.
I don't see you the way he sees you.

596
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,218
It... Look, it's not my permission
to give, but...

597
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,595
you'll do what's right for you.

598
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,892
But I want you to know, if you want it...

599
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,687
I know you'll be careful...

600
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,231
and I'll be fine.

601
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:15,153
I mean, if we're gonna go
beyond marriage, let's go beyond it.

602
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,537
<i>You have three saved messages.</i>

603
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,789
<i>Message one. September 8th...</i>

604
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,461
<i>Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti
leaving a message for Douglas...</i>

605
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,922
<i>To save this message,
press eight.</i>

606
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,842
<i>To call back, press five.</i>

607
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,845
<i>To...</i>

608
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,288
I'm sorry.
Uh, my sitter was late, and, um...

609
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,832
- and then there was traffic, so...
- Just relax.

610
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,335
It's fine.

611
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,713
It's so nice to meet you in person.

612
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:20,885
Here.

613
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:28,058
I don't know why I got them.
I guess I, uh...

614
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,895
- Anyway.
- No, they're lovely.

615
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,313
Thank you.

616
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:38,611
And, uh... and thank you again...
for that donation.

617
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,738
I just...
I can't tell you how much it means...

618
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,073
You already thanked me
on your voice message

619
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,867
and when we talked on the phone.

620
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,037
You don't need to thank me anymore.

621
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,540
Okay, no more thanks.

622
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,378
I hope this place is okay.

623
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,548
It's nothing fancy,
but I come here a lot.

624
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,051
I like it.
It has a lot of character.

625
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,138
Tony liked greasy spoons like this.

626
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:10,810
He used to take the kids to, um...
Ben's Chili Bowl every Sunday afternoon

627
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,728
and get them hot dogs.

628
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,440
Sorry.

629
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,818
Don't be.

630
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,529
I probably just shouldn't talk
about my husband.

631
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,281
I still get emotional.

632
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,119
You can... if you want to.

633
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,624
Even if I cry?

634
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,503
I wanna know more about him.

635
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:49,974
Will you close the doors, please?

636
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,406
Where is he?

637
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,121
Twice in two days I've been here.

638
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,124
I know.

639
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,503
So, why am I here now?

640
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,300
I want you back.

641
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:32,642
I want you back, too.

642
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,478
But...

643
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,189
He understands.
