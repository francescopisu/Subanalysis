00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,935
<i>Lucas Goodwin was
released from a federal detention center</i>

3
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,562
<i>in Terre Haute, Indiana,
two months ago.</i>

4
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,858
<i>FBI investigators searched
his witness protection residence</i>

5
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,985
<i>- in Dayton, Ohio...</i>
- Why was he even out of jail?

6
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,738
He helped the DOJ
with an ongoing investigation.

7
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,072
How did you not know that?

8
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,242
WITSEC.
Only need-to-know for security reasons.

9
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,455
We found this today at his house.
A suicide note, I guess.

10
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,179
This can't go public.

11
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,183
We haven't told the press anything.
But this is evidence.

12
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,019
Once the report comes out...

13
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,286
Email this to me.

14
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,758
Mrs. Underwood?

15
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,427
It's two o'clock in the morning.
Would you like to go home?

16
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,012
Oh, yes,
I'll be out in a moment.

17
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,430
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,303
<i>His liver is just not
regenerating fast enough.</i>

19
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,388
<i>What does that mean, exactly?</i>

20
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,933
He needs a transplant,
or he'll die.

21
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,353
- How soon?
- Days.

22
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,939
We've made him Status 1.

23
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,150
I'm optimistic
we'll find him a suitable liver.

24
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,693
The recipient list is classified.

25
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,571
You're the only two members
of the administration who've been briefed.

26
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,492
- Is the First Lady aware?
- Yes, I informed her this afternoon.

27
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,334
May I?

28
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,461
Please.

29
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,381
I know it's late,
but they said you were up, so...

30
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,674
No, I know.
I just hadn't eaten all day.

31
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,218
I'm sure you haven't.

32
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,388
- Would you like some salad?
- Sure. Thank you.

33
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,896
It's scary, about Frank.

34
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,774
Well, Francis is a fighter.

35
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,444
I wish I could ask his advice.
I have my call with Petrov in the morning.

36
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,869
I feel good about
my understanding of the plan.

37
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,957
My concern is him
railroading me on the call.

38
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,335
Well, would you like me to be on it?
An extra set of ears.

39
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,007
I don't... I don't know
how Cathy would feel about that.

40
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,010
Well, she doesn't need to know.

41
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,346
I could just listen from up here.

42
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,225
And maybe I could type a note
if you get into trouble.

43
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,954
<i>...tight-lipped
on the president's recovery.</i>

44
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,165
<i>As of now, he's reported
to be in stable condition.</i>

45
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,167
<i>No press has been allowed
into the hospital.</i>

46
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,962
<i>Republican presidential hopeful
Will Conway</i>

47
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,839
<i>spoke of the president
at a rally in Arizona this morning.</i>

48
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,175
<i>I've criticized
President Underwood often.</i>

49
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,926
<i>But right now,
he's our president...</i>

50
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,095
Come back tomorrow.
We're all out.

51
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,097
<i>...and we have to pull together,
both sides of the aisle...</i>

52
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,307
We're all out for today.
Sorry, come back tomorrow.

53
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,309
- We're all out, guys. We're all out.
- Are you serious?

54
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,478
Come back tomorrow.
We're all out for today, sir.

55
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,562
Bullshit!

56
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,403
Hey, uh...

57
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,323
can I siphon a couple of gallons from you?

58
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,908
Fifty bucks.
I'm running on fumes.

59
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,535
I gotta get my kids to school,
and my husband to work--

60
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,246
Eighty bucks, two gallons.

61
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,622
Sorry, I can't help you.
Sorry.

62
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,386
- The line's open?
- Moscow is ready when you are, sir.

63
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,392
You can set it up here.

64
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,523
My Cliff Notes.

65
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,947
I'm ready.

66
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,460
<i>Mr. President,
you're on with President Petrov.</i>

67
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,544
Mr. President.

68
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,130
<i>All of Russia is praying
for the president's recovery.</i>

69
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,133
<i>I hope you will extend
my warm thoughts to Mrs. Underwood.</i>

70
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,218
I certainly will.

71
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,888
You're a brave man to take over
during such difficult times.

72
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,059
<i>I just want to make sure we find
a manageable resolution to this oil--</i>

73
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,978
I've read some of your books,
Mr. President.

74
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,108
I just finished <i>Learning to Learn.</i>
It was good.

75
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,359
Thank you.

76
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:31,071
<i>There was a chapter on visualization
that really interested me.</i>

77
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,282
Yes, it's a... a tool for students.
It helps them--

78
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:37,785
I would like you
to visualize something.

79
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,206
<i>Now, you're standing in the tundra.</i>

80
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,958
Um, wind, snow...

81
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,295
<i>machines drilling through the ice,</i>

82
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,923
long pipelines stretching to the horizon.
Do you see?

83
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,760
If you want to talk about Siberia,
I'm more than happy to--

84
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:59,099
No, no, no. You're not visualizing,
Mr. Vice President.

85
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,644
Close your eyes.

86
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,195
All right. They're closed.

87
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,781
Good. Now...

88
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,911
picture the men working
those drills and pipelines.

89
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,371
What do they look like?

90
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,583
Um, heavy coats, gloves, boots.

91
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,212
Are they... Chinese?

92
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:38,221
You see, when I picture this,
I don't see Chinese.

93
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,141
I agree with you. The less control
the Chinese have, the better.

94
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,268
Then why did you send Milkin to China?

95
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,354
You weren't negotiating with us.
We thought they might have more luck.

96
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,898
Their demands would leave us
worse off than we were before.

97
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,067
<i>I can get the IMF
to provide half the bailout.</i>

98
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,445
<i>This would counteract the Chinese demands
for drilling rights--</i>

99
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,823
- You are playing us off each other.
<i>- Mr. President--</i>

100
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,743
I think you're in
over your head, Mr. Blythe.

101
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,454
If you would just give me
a chance to elaborate--

102
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,663
<i>Why give you a chance?</i>

103
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,123
<i>What do you know about Russia?
About China?</i>

104
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,125
I've been briefed on--

105
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,795
Forgive me, but, uh...

106
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:15,592
I don't feel comfortable negotiating
with anyone other than the president.

107
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,511
<i>When he recovers,
perhaps he and I can speak.</i>

108
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,766
<i>So, are we finished?</i>

109
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,438
The president's
in very bad shape.

110
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,064
Sir...

111
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,733
<i>How serious is it?</i>

112
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,949
He needs a liver transplant.

113
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,246
I wasn't aware that...

114
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,999
You better get used to
negotiating with me.

115
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,586
If the president dies, it's you and I...

116
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,421
<i>or nothing at all.</i>

117
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:00,803
My apologies, Mr. President.
I didn't intend to insult you.

118
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,431
Let's keep a dialogue open.
That's all I'm asking.

119
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,476
I'd like the opportunity to present you
with a detailed proposal

120
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,894
<i>countering the Chinese demands.</i>

121
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,772
I'll have Secretary Durant
work with your foreign minister,

122
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,065
and then we'll take it from there.

123
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,484
<i>Are you open to that?</i>

124
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,695
Of course.

125
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,032
I look forward to reviewing your proposal.

126
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,576
Thank you, Mr. President.

127
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,037
Sir, we didn't want that
to get out to the press yet.

128
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,664
The American people
deserve to know, anyway.

129
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,957
Sir, the Russians don't respond
well to weakness.

130
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,418
Now that they know
that the president--

131
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,128
You heard him say
he's open to negotiation.

132
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,755
I'd say that's progress.

133
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,646
Four days and still nothing?
No press conference, no briefing.

134
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,066
We have to let them conduct
their investigation on their own terms.

135
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,777
- Feels like we're being shut out.
- This isn't just the bureau.

136
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,237
They have to coordinate with Homeland
and make sure nothing sensitive--

137
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,531
That's bullshit.

138
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,658
There's something about Goodwin
that you don't want us to know.

139
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,909
Wrong.

140
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,579
I wanna know why he did this
just as much as you do...

141
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,997
but we've gotta let the FBI do its job.

142
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,012
Same theory as when I visited him.

143
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,932
And that was before
he struck the plea, correct?

144
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:31,644
I encouraged him to plead guilty.
His claims were unsubstantiated.

145
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,270
Tell us about your meeting
with the president

146
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,647
prior to that meeting with Goodwin.

147
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,025
Lucas asked me to investigate.
I did.

148
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,445
That involved an interview
with Underwood.

149
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,655
You still have your notes?

150
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,031
No notes without a warrant.

151
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,749
The press. Calling non-stop.

152
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,834
We suggest you don't speak to anyone
while we're still--

153
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,879
Don't worry. I don't have any interest
in getting dragged into this.

154
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,798
Let me go dig up those notes.

155
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:38,378
Blythe... He told Petrov
the president needs a transplant.

156
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,798
- Why would he do that?
- Petrov got under his skin.

157
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,216
This is why we should've carried out
your husband's plan.

158
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,635
We're giving Moscow
too much room to maneuver--

159
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,263
Let's not debate
what we can't change, Doug.

160
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,475
If Moscow knows,
we'll have to notify the press.

161
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,978
We're doing that tomorrow.
Dr. Saxon will do the briefing.

162
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,149
No, I'll do it.
It's better coming from the First Lady.

163
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,695
I agree.

164
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,323
We need to address this, too.

165
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,326
The FBI found Goodwin's notes
in his house.

166
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,498
- Can we make them disappear?
- No, it's already been catalogued.

167
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,292
We need to get out ahead of it
and control the story.

168
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,379
All right. Get me a copy
and report on the investigation so far.

169
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,340
I wanna see him.

170
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,592
The president.

171
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,385
The Secret Service still won't let me.

172
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,347
I'd like Mr. Stamper to have access
to my husband, please.

173
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,224
We have strict orders, ma'am.
Only you and--

174
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,935
Would you like me to call
the vice president myself?

175
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,270
Douglas, this young man
will escort you to his room.

176
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,689
Thank you.

177
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,400
- What time is it?
- It's a little past 7:00.

178
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,829
Sir? Sir, it's Doug.

179
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,207
Just because his eyes are open
doesn't mean he's fully conscious.

180
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,042
Insufficient liver function.

181
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,045
His brain is swimming
in a pool of unprocessed ammonia.

182
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,048
If he's seeing anything,
it's probably severe hallucinations.

183
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,550
How long until he has a liver?

184
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,219
Could be hours.
Could be days.

185
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,345
He's number three on the list.

186
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,013
Number three?

187
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,559
It's prioritized in terms of need
and who was listed first as a Status 1.

188
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,645
- He's the President of the United States.
- It's the law.

189
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,099
The attorney general is resigning.

190
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,477
Add that to the press release
for this afternoon.

191
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,815
- Uh, her decision or the vice president's?
- My decision.

192
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,067
Goodwin's WITSEC
was a DOJ responsibility.

193
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,653
We needed a head to roll.

194
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,864
First hers... then yours.

195
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,285
You'll resign tomorrow.

196
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,961
Doug, I know you're under
a lot of pressure, but--

197
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:51,798
You sent the photo of the rebel soldier.

198
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,803
- That's not true.
- Personal phone, off the premises.

199
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,014
You know, maybe somebody hacked
my account or something--

200
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,933
Are you really gonna keep lying to me?

201
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,726
I could have you arrested.

202
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,771
But I'd rather you go quietly.

203
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,528
I know things, Doug.

204
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,990
Nothing you can prove.

205
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,535
Now, threaten me again.

206
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,263
There's no proposal
without China's involvement.

207
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:45,685
Now, Cathy's tried, but she doesn't have
the best relationship with them.

208
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,145
Maybe she needs some help.

209
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,563
Help? How?

210
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,195
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Of course not.

211
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,160
I quit about ten years ago.

212
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,372
Marjory forced me to.

213
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,713
Ah, still smells delicious.

214
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,889
What was it like when Marjory died?

215
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,350
Oh, well, it was, um...

216
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm sorry. We don't have to talk about it
if you don't want.

217
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,230
No, it's fine.

218
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,817
We hadn't had a real conversation in...
in months.

219
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,402
Her mind was gone.

220
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:43,284
When she finally died,
it felt like a limb had been hacked off.

221
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,578
I felt... devastated.

222
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:51,834
But I also felt relieved.

223
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,757
That's what I feel about my mother.

224
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,218
Oh, I hadn't--
It hadn't even occurred to me.

225
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,594
You have Frank and your mother.

226
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,682
When my father died, it destroyed me,

227
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,186
but when I think about Mother,
I feel nothing.

228
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,980
- You two aren't close?
- No.

229
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:20,196
And I feel the same about Francis.
Nothing.

230
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,869
I know that must sound awful.

231
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,497
It's a lot to process.

232
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,376
There's no right way or wrong way.

233
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,092
- Ah! Wait, hold on.
- No.

234
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,344
Marjory wouldn't approve.

235
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,431
- We got sidetracked.
- Yes.

236
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,558
China.

237
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,937
I have an idea,
if you can trust me to handle it.

238
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,482
I'd trust you
with my goddamn life, Claire.

239
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,777
You don't want to know.

240
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,044
I got it. Ah, <i>merci.</i>

241
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,689
- LeAnn.
- You are a tough guy to track down.

242
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,526
- What are you doing here?
- You have a plane to catch.

243
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,361
The First Lady needs your help.

244
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,238
I don't want to have
anything to do with them.

245
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,533
Whatever you think of the president,
you still have a duty to your country.

246
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,036
Even if he dies,
the day I walked out the White House,

247
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,954
I promised myself I wasn't going back.

248
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,915
You don't even know
what we have in mind.

249
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,001
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

250
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,544
I'd like you to leave.

251
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,799
- Here's your briefing materials.
- You're not hearing me.

252
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,426
You should really take a look.

253
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,442
Her campaign would be over.

254
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,363
And what would your parents think?

255
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,831
It looks like you're taking
advantage of the fact that he's--

256
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,124
Conway is still campaigning.

257
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,626
He's a Republican and
he's already wrapped up his nomination.

258
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,711
Apples and oranges.

259
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,505
We are gonna lose, if we sit still,
to a guy who's unconscious.

260
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:46,300
Heather's right. Underwood's scoring
major sympathy points.

261
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,427
He's ahead in six
of the next seven states.

262
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,180
We need to keep the pressure up.
Russia, gas prices...

263
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,557
Attack a president
who's fighting for his life?

264
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,436
I didn't call this meeting to debate.
I want those states back.

265
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,647
So let's start organizing events
and media hits.

266
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,109
Prelim budgets and schedules,
by tomorrow morning.

267
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,989
<i>There has been much
speculation as to Goodwin's motivations.</i>

268
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,240
Cynthia.

269
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,703
- Where are we on Goodwin?
- The security guy's taken care of.

270
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,373
He never saw the two of you together.

271
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,128
- What about others?
- None that he knows of.

272
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,005
But it's not like we can ask around.

273
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,216
<i>In November of 2013,</i>

274
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,344
<i>Ms. Barnes was struck
by a D.C. Metrorail train.</i>

275
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,306
<i>D.C. police classified it as an accident.
Some have speculated that...</i>

276
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,660
Have a seat, Remy.

277
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,462
Sorry about Frank.

278
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,340
Oh, please, don't bother.
I've had enough people say they're sorry,

279
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,841
and I know you don't mean it.

280
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,678
I can't help you
the way you want me to.

281
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,888
LeAnn told me she was
very clear with you.

282
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,014
It won't work.

283
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,184
Tusk wants to help you
even less than I do.

284
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,519
Well, nobody's doing
any favors here, Remy.

285
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,313
He's going to get very rich from this.

286
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,357
- Why don't you speak to him yourself?
- Because he won't listen to me.

287
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,818
This needs to seem
like your idea, not mine.

288
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,322
- And you'll make a killing, too.
- I don't need the money.

289
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,908
Hmm. Because you care about
other things now.

290
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,994
Like Jackie.

291
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,498
Which is why you'll make this happen.

292
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,298
If I had told Dunbar about Frank...

293
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,094
about how he knew
about the laundering,

294
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,263
he wouldn't be president
and we wouldn't be standing here.

295
00:25:56,347 --> 00:26:00,142
But you didn't and you can't now,
so here we are.

296
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,647
Two hours and we got nowhere.
All he wants to hear is China.

297
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,650
I told him Beijing is not responsive.
He doesn't give a damn.

298
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,402
The First Lady put a bug in his ear.

299
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,821
Well, whatever bug she put in there
won't crawl out.

300
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,615
I'll set up a meeting.
Just you, me and him.

301
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,450
I don't think a meeting is enough.

302
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,078
We have a vice president that
does not know what he is doing, Doug.

303
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,123
He needs to completely turn over

304
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,208
all diplomatic affairs
to the State Department.

305
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,252
- Otherwise, my hands are tied.
- Not now.

306
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,669
This can't wait.

307
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,338
When we're finished,
I will come and find you.

308
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,299
Could you give us a few moments,
Madam Secretary?

309
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,510
- Seth, you're out of line!
- It's all right.

310
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,970
Call me.

311
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,056
I will.
Thank you, Cathy.

312
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,850
Thank you.

313
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,937
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You can't fire me.

314
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,482
You don't interrupt a meeting
with the Secretary of State.

315
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,527
I can end Dunbar's campaign.
We can end it today.

316
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,487
How?

317
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,490
If I deliver, will you keep me on?

318
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,575
You tell me how first.

319
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,626
Have a seat, Martha.

320
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,971
I've had second thoughts
about your resignation.

321
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,687
Would you like to remain
as attorney general?

322
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,814
Yes, I would.

323
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,107
Thank you, Doug.

324
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:36,154
Did Heather Dunbar inform you of a meeting
between herself and Lucas Goodwin?

325
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:40,075
You're having me interrogated
by my own subordinates?

326
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,744
They only work for you
if you keep your job.

327
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,206
I suggest you answer their questions.

328
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,250
- I'd like a lawyer present.
- Let me remind you, ma'am.

329
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,462
Failing to have informed us
constitutes withholding of evidence.

330
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,755
Heather is a friend.

331
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,593
It's very simple, Martha.
You work with us, you stay on as AG.

332
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,511
You don't, we prosecute.

333
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,770
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the First Lady of the United States.

334
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,483
Good afternoon, everyone.

335
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,236
I'd like to update you
on my husband's recovery.

336
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:20,073
The president's medical team
gave me a full assessment last night

337
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,867
and they have come to the conclusion

338
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:27,581
that the president is in need
of a liver transplant if he's to survive.

339
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:36,089
<i>I'm asking the nation to pray with me</i>

340
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,301
<i>that a healthy liver
makes its way to Francis soon.</i>

341
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,179
<i>I'm sorry. A moment.</i>

342
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,517
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

343
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,101
She's good, isn't she?

344
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,064
- What're you doing here?
<i>- As for the investigation...</i>

345
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,775
First Lady wanted some support.

346
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,654
<i>...the FBI director of counterterrorism
will give you a full briefing. But...</i>

347
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,657
I feel it's important
to personally address

348
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,243
the document found
in Mr. Goodwin's residence

349
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:08,455
that was made available to you
just before this conference.

350
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,750
It's filled with language that would make
for flashy headlines,

351
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,003
words like "murder," "corruption."

352
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,090
The accusation that the president
was involved in the deaths

353
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,343
of Peter Russo and Zoe Barnes.

354
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:27,641
<i>Phrases like "abuse of power,"
while they have no basis in reality,</i>

355
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,437
<i>they do give us a sad glimpse
into a very troubled mind.</i>

356
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,858
<i>And it pains me that anyone,
even someone who is mentally ill,</i>

357
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,071
<i>would think my husband is capable
of what Mr. Goodwin believed to be true.</i>

358
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,700
<i>But mostly it pains me
for Mr. Goodwin's parents,</i>

359
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,411
who are coping
with the loss of their son.

360
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,289
And, by all accounts,
he was a decent man for most of his life,

361
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,208
but clearly, something snapped in him

362
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,919
and he never got the help
he so desperately needed.

363
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,381
So I ask that all of you
respect his parents' grief

364
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,759
by not sensationalizing
the words of a sick young man.

365
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,221
And let's remember
Lawrence and Betty Meechum,

366
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:11,352
whose son Edward gave his life because
of Mr. Goodwin's illness.

367
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:15,105
<i>Edward's sacrifice is the only reason
my husband is still alive.</i>

368
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:19,568
<i>And I'll be forever grateful for
his friendship and his devoted service.</i>

369
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,819
Thank you.

370
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,701
Counterterrorism Director
Nathan Green.

371
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,414
Today we had a new development
in the investigation.

372
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,083
This afternoon,
we interviewed the attorney general.

373
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,628
She gave us a full account
of a conversation she had

374
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:40,005
with Heather Dunbar
the day of the shooting.

375
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,425
<i>In this conversation,
Ms. Dunbar claimed to have met</i>

376
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,886
<i>with Lucas Goodwin personally.</i>

377
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,721
<i>And while we have no reason to believe</i>

378
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,057
<i>Ms. Dunbar had anything to do
with the assassination attempt...</i>

379
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,228
<i>we will be questioning her
about this alleged conversation.</i>

380
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,563
Are you arresting her?

381
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:58,231
No, ma'am.
We're here to ask a few questions.

382
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,567
- Then you need to make a formal request.
- Is she here now?

383
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,110
Send the request directly to me,

384
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,987
and then I'll discuss it
with Ms. Dunbar's attorneys.

385
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,328
Hey, Kate.

386
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,623
I tried calling.
Home and cell.

387
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,000
Pulled out the cord.
Turned off the cell.

388
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,002
Because of people like me.

389
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,755
The others had the courtesy
not to show up on my doorstep.

390
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,883
Courtesy never got me anywhere.

391
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:28,845
Can we talk?
Off the record.

392
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,560
- If it were anyone but you...
- Well, luckily, it isn't.

393
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,481
Let me get Fausto.
It's time for his walk.

394
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,528
I'm in the nuclear game, not fossil fuels.

395
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,363
No one has the relationships
you do in China.

396
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:48,574
Ha!

397
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,742
Chinese disowned me.

398
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,161
They'll come around.

399
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,331
Who put you up to this?

400
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,086
- Starting my own firm.
- I thought you were out?

401
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,589
I was fooling myself.

402
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,384
So, president gets shot,

403
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,680
and you just can't help
taking advantage of the chaos.

404
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,976
What you call chaos, I call opportunity.

405
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,355
And you're my first client.

406
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,487
I wish you the best.

407
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,906
But I'm not your first client.

408
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,201
I don't wanna have
anything to do with the White House.

409
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,704
You lost a lot of money
during the Walker scandal.

410
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,917
I did, indeed,
which is why I'm turning you down.

411
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,880
I'm sorry you came
all the way out here for a "no."

412
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,098
You don't wanna go to prison, do you?

413
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,351
- Hmm.
- Lose the rest of it?

414
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,061
I've already been pardoned.

415
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,108
For the money laundering,
not for perjury.

416
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,112
You said that Walker knew, and he didn't.

417
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,323
What you didn't say
is that you were working with Frank.

418
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,287
Why should anybody
believe you more than me?

419
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,664
You take that chance...

420
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,249
and watch Clayton West
become a penny stock.

421
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,212
Or we're heroes
for ending the oil crisis,

422
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,007
everybody gets rich,
your image is restored.

423
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,596
They'll probably even let you choose
the next ambassador in Beijing.

424
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,022
So you don't think
any of it is true?

425
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,691
No.

426
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,568
And I wanted to believe him.

427
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,279
So the First Lady's
whole teary-eyed thing?

428
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:56,743
I think she's right.
Something in Lucas snapped.

429
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:00,038
I mean, the Lucas I knew
wouldn't have tried to kill a president.

430
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,999
Exactly. That's my point.

431
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,628
You honestly think
Underwood was murdering people?

432
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,171
Where is your skepticism?

433
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,466
I'm skeptical of Lucas and
I'm skeptical of the White House.

434
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,927
How come there's no proof?
None.

435
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,598
After Lucas tried, after I tried.

436
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,226
My advice is to let it go.

437
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,312
You're gonna repeat
the same goose chase we did.

438
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,732
I had to ask.

439
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,694
- What does your editor say?
- To let it go.

440
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,403
You see?

441
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,406
- He's not as good as you are.
- Was.

442
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,868
Wish you were at <i>The Telegraph.</i>

443
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,912
Yeah, let me know if anyone gets fired.

444
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,047
It's open.

445
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,554
I came as soon as I got your text.

446
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,766
We've been slammed
since the press conference.

447
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,892
How's it lookin'?

448
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,352
Major play on the Dunbar story.

449
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,064
It was a good idea
to have the First Lady talk.

450
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,066
You want a soda?

451
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,235
A glass of water or anything?

452
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,320
Water's fine.

453
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,498
I've decided you can stay.

454
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,960
Doug, I hope you can understand.

455
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,171
I got nervous.

456
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,840
You know, things weren't
looking good and...

457
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,427
yeah, I wanted an out,
in case I needed one.

458
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,805
I mean, it was a mistake.
I wish I hadn't.

459
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,224
You corrected your mistakes.
That's all that matters. You want ice?

460
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,810
Sure.

461
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,237
We can't afford any more shake-ups
in the campaign right now,

462
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,364
especially with the president
in the hospital.

463
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,075
Mmm-hmm.

464
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,911
We also can't afford
any more of your mistakes.

465
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:09,042
Shut up. Shut up!

466
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,587
When I first woke up,
I couldn't speak.

467
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,673
I had to blink my eyes
if I wanted to respond.

468
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,342
Do you understand?

469
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,138
If I can't get your loyalty,
I will have your obedience.

470
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,099
Blink.

471
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,978
Blink!

472
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,690
Fuck!

473
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,745
Fucking...

474
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,711
Here.

475
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:55,922
You're fucked up, man.

476
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,692
- Quit it.
- Good morning, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

477
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:17,778
How can I help you?

478
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:21,281
Uh, we're just returning your notes.
We made copies. These are the originals.

479
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,866
Nothing too useful, huh?

480
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,951
No, sir, but thank you
for your cooperation.

481
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,287
Your paper, too.
It was on the step.

482
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,205
Well, you have a good day,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

483
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,791
You, too.

484
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,927
Don't tell me you're hungry already.
I just fed you. Good God.

485
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,429
I'm coming. I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

486
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,926
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

487
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,143
I suggest we turn the negotiations
over to Cathy.

488
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,020
If we keep stalling on Russia,
gas prices will--

489
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,480
Now is not a good time.

490
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,942
I won't have the president come back
to a White House in disarray.

491
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,526
We don't know that he is coming back.

492
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,364
He is. I promise you that.

493
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,534
Are you God?
Who are you to say?

494
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,578
Yes?

495
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,124
- <i>Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton are here.</i>
- Send them in.

496
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,626
It was arranged this morning.
We're discussing Russia.

497
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,169
Sir, I am the Chief of Staff.

498
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,712
You have to keep me
informed of these things.

499
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,839
Excuse me,

500
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,842
but I believe you answer to me,
not the other way around.

501
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,551
Secretary Durant should be here.

502
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,929
This meeting is private.
I'll discuss it with you both after.

503
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,056
The president would never allow
Raymond--

504
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,893
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Tusk.

505
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,686
Remy, good to see you.

506
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,813
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Stamper.

507
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,192
I'll follow up
with you later, Doug.

508
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,318
Yes, sir.

509
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,655
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with us on such short notice.

510
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,449
Well, there's no time to waste
on this oil thing.

511
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,701
I've made some progress
with the Chinese.

512
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,871
Sir, the First Lady is in there right now.

513
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,247
She's expecting me.

514
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,339
We're trying to win an election,
and you want to remind everyone

515
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,341
that the president
pardoned Raymond Tusk?

516
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,719
- Let's find somewhere else.
- These are matters of state.

517
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,097
You don't have the authority to intervene.

518
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,433
If Donald wants my counsel,
that is his prerogative.

519
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,101
You are deliberately deceiving me.

520
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,313
- Going behind my--
- You have forgotten your place, Douglas.

521
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,649
My place?
What about your place?

522
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,651
You leave him when he needs you most,
you threaten him,

523
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,653
and now that he's in here,
you undermine him.

524
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,406
- You're supposed to be--
- Stop. That is enough.

525
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,993
I will fill you in on everything,
but not here. At the White House.

526
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,497
- What's happening?
- His heart.

527
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,461
- Doctor?
- He's had some sporadic arrhythmia.

528
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,546
- Will you give us the room for a moment?
- Of course.

529
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,848
We can't keep battling each other,
not with him like this.

530
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,268
We need a new path forward,
and I would like your help with that.

531
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,812
I promise I won't keep you in the dark.

532
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,150
I'll meet you at the White House
whenever you're ready.

533
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm staying here.
I think this is more important.

534
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,365
Okay.

535
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,004
Mrs. Underwood.

536
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:08,383
Mr. Tusk and Mr. Danton have a proposal
about how to deal with Russia.

537
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,387
I imagine I'm the last person
you expected to see today.

538
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,142
I am a bit surprised, yes,
to see both of you.

539
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,978
I'm sure there's some wariness
about us being here,

540
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:23,189
but I think we have a good plan
on how to handle Russia.

541
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:27,318
Would you like to join us?
Raymond can lay it out for you.

542
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,820
Well, I don't know what I can offer.

543
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,198
Well, we're going
to catch some flack

544
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:35,035
if word gets out that I'm back in business
with the White House.

545
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,995
You could help us smooth that over.

546
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,706
Your press conference was very moving.

547
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,378
- I'm sorry about Frank.
- Thank you.

548
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:49,174
Of course, he'd have a conniption fit
if he knew I were in the Oval Office.

549
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,720
Well, he is a pragmatist,
Raymond. Whatever works.

550
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,348
- Shall we continue?
- Remy.

551
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,393
So, the plan is
to propose a partnership

552
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,104
between American and Chinese
energy companies.

553
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,883
- You seem nervous.
- It's been a while.

554
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,350
<i>Going down.</i>

555
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,995
What should I do, boss?

556
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,521
Dr. Saxon.

557
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,820
- I'd like to donate.
- Mr. Stamper--

558
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:38,491
My blood type is O.
I'm healthy. Let's do the tests.

559
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,577
That's not the only criteria for donation.

560
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,704
You're a recovering alcoholic.
We don't accept--

561
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,832
I don't care about the rules.
If I'm a match, I want you to do it.

562
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,585
Even if you were, it wouldn't matter.

563
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,962
He's too ill
for a partial liver at this point.

564
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,256
He needs a full one.

565
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:58,052
I'm sorry,
but we'll just have to wait and hope.

566
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,913
