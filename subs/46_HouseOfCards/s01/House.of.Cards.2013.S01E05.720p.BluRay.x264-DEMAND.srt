1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,600
What do you think
of Darren Jarvis?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,160
At CBS?

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,594
He wants me to be
a correspondent.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,194
It's not
worth your time.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,079
What about Greer Fisher,
at MSNBC?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,674
Stick to writing,
do TV on the side.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,479
You're more than
a talking head.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,435
How about <i>Slugline?</i>

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,755
What's <i>Slugline?</i>

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,069
If I said <i>Politico</i> wanted to
hire me, what would you say?

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,833
I would say that
that piques my interest.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,957
Six months from now,
<i>Slugline</i> will be

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,037
what <i>Politico</i> was
a year and half ago.

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,316
Everyone at <i>Politico</i>
reads it

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,198
because <i>Slugline's</i> breaking
stories before they are.

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,919
I wonder why I've
never heard of it.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,036
Everyone's
a free agent.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,635
And they write whatever they
want, wherever they are.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,279
Most people write
from their phones.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,353
Well, if freedom and exposure
are what they're offering,

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,314
I would say that is
a meeting worth taking.

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,115
This Hammerschmidt
thing is blowing up.

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,078
I think he might
get fired.

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,560
There's got to be
a thousand tweets here...

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,075
People defending me,
people trashing me.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,510
There's even a hashtag,
GoZoe.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,590
Hmm.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,630
Hey!

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,630
We mustn't leave
any trails.

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,796
All of my contacts
were in there.

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,317
Then it's time for you
to get some new contacts.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,431
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone.
I'll get you two, in fact.

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,557
One for work
and a burner for play.

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,399
Expect them
this afternoon.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,310
Oh, and... Go, Zoe.

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,636
The reporter?

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,796
Yes.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,834
Just this once?

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,279
I'm not sure.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,432
What does she offer us?

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,194
A mouthpiece,
when we need one.

42
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,999
She's been
very useful so far.

43
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,953
What does she want?
Access.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,918
A seat at the table.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,071
Sounds like she's getting the
better side of the bargain.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,112
She can be controlled.

47
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,680
Are you sure?

48
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,195
She can.
I promise you.

49
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,314
Okay, if you say so.

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,879
The moment you
want me to end it...

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,713
I know, Francis.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,839
I should get
ready for work.

53
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,910
Hey...

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,310
I didn't think
you'd be in until later.

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,039
This is your
agenda for the day.

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,839
Here's your schedule
for the rest of the week.

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,957
These are papers that need
to be approved or signed.

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,032
Over here are your one-sheets
for committee meetings

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,158
and briefs on upcoming
legislative action.

60
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,233
I filled Ashley in. She can cover
until you find a replacement.

61
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,349
Christina.

62
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,676
What?

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,680
Thank you.

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
For getting
all this in order.

65
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,440
Ashley can call me if you have any
questions about what's on your desk.

66
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,076
He here yet?

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,236
I put him
in your office.

68
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,799
Marty Spinella. Head lobbyist
for the teachers union.

69
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,315
He wants to rip my head off
and peel it like an orange.

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,194
Why? Because I lied to him.
But what choice did I have?

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,791
When the truth would have ended
the conversation before it began?

72
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,553
I'll call you back.
Marty.

73
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,313
You fucking lied, Frank?

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,392
No, no, no.
You lie to my fucking face?

75
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,352
Marty, I did not lie. What
do you mean you did not?

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,113
We spent a whole
weekend in that room

77
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,953
poring over this bill
line by line.

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,874
And nowhere did it say anything
about collective bargaining.

79
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,873
Let's calm down and sit down.
And we will discuss this.

80
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,158
I will explain everything that's
going on and we will talk it out.

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,873
No matter how long it takes.
No. No more.

82
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,440
This is gonna be
a very short meeting.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,671
'Cause only one of two
things are going to happen.

84
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,793
Either you assure me right
now that amendment is out,

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,873
or I am walking out that door and I
am gonna start launching missiles.

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,395
The amendment was never
intended to stay in the bill.

87
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,800
It's just there for leverage.
That's all.

88
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,715
You threaten to cut federal funding
from union school districts?

89
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,634
That's not a poker chip, Frank,
that's a goddamn dirty bomb.

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,873
Look, the amendment
is not staying in the bill.

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,159
I just need you to work with
me on performance standards.

92
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,749
Performance standards?

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,195
Are you fucking kidding me? You
agreed that they were already out.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,198
You can't just put it back in now, Frank.
Marty, look...

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,078
I have a reputation
to uphold.

96
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,551
I am the one that made the
union reps stay here for you

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,149
while you're in Gaffney playing
with your fucking Peachoid.

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,356
Marty...
You tell me right now,

99
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,113
is that amendment
in or out?

100
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,840
There is a middle ground here, Marty.
We just have to find it.

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,832
I take that as a no.

102
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,069
Okay.

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,750
Marty, do not start a war
you know you're gonna lose.

104
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,957
You fuck me,
I fuck back.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,150
Stamper!

106
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,550
Marty and I have a good
working relationship.

107
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,630
Or used to.

108
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,870
You could see
he has a temper,

109
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,111
but I can usually cut through
that and reason with him.

110
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,352
But I may have pushed him too far.
Which is worrisome.

111
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,750
Friends make
the worst enemies.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,752
How'd it go?
What'd you hear?

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,952
A lot of fucks. Well,
that pretty much says it.

114
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
Let's think
this through...

115
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,189
No, we've got the DNC
leadership meeting.

116
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,629
What?

117
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,110
I'd say you could skip it, but
Birch just dumped it on us.

118
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,556
When? It's here. In 12 minutes.

119
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,313
Why here and not
the DNC headquarters?

120
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,592
The DNC is doing renovations, they're
gonna be green-energy efficient.

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,559
That's a charming
use of party funds.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,310
We've only been in this
space about three months.

123
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,910
It's cool.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,878
Not exactly
<i>The Herald,</i> is it?

125
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,555
Have you been to those offices?
Yes.

126
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,831
Wrist-slitting
was in order.

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,550
So, who else
is courting you?

128
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,116
A few people.

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,310
You mean everyone.

130
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,679
There were a lot of
emails this morning...

131
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
That's not surprising.

132
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,629
You're having a moment,
people are interested.

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,995
I'm one of them.

134
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,754
But if eight minutes passes
on anything, I get bored.

135
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,440
In eight minutes, I could be bored with you.
Unless you keep me interested.

136
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,240
I think you can,

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,674
and I think this
is the place for you

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,911
to keep the rest of
the world interested, too.

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,118
It's your call.
I won't chase you.

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,554
I'm definitely tempted...

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,957
Take as long as you
want to look around.

142
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,999
Email me your figure. I'll
call you back with a counter.

143
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,953
This is our top priority. Ohio,
Florida and Pennsylvania.

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,030
We need all of them or
Walker's a one-term president.

145
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,715
Pennsylvania is why he picked
Matthews as a running mate.

146
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,632
But now we have to
find a replacement.

147
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,558
The special election
is this November.

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,271
Patricia Whittaker.
DNC chair.

149
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,875
A rare example of someone
whose head is in the game

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,758
instead of
up their backside.

151
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,116
Competence is such an
exotic bird in these woods

152
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,556
that I appreciate
it whenever I see it.

153
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,711
Now, this also
affects the House.

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,473
The new Governor will
oversee redistricting.

155
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,755
We lose seats here,

156
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
that means we could lose
our majority in Washington.

157
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,599
Well, the RNC is backing Jack
Swofford, ex-mayor of Pittsburgh.

158
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,797
He's got state-wide
name recognition

159
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,240
and campaign machinery
in place...

160
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,392
It's been three months
and we don't have dick.

161
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,278
What about the A.G.?
Ben Pluckett?

162
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,835
No, Ben's got his eyes set
on the Senate in '14.

163
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,038
Yeah, which he'll lose because he
botched a sex offender sting last year.

164
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,510
Well, there's always McHolland.
He's 78.

165
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,831
When's the last time he held office?
When Carter was president?

166
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,832
Reagan,
but same difference.

167
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,957
Well, he has dignity.
He has gravitas.

168
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,599
I mean, if you need someone
to fill Matthews' shoes...

169
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,400
You can't fill Jim Matthews' shoes.
So we shouldn't even try.

170
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,399
We need a fresh face.

171
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,994
The state has
a weak bench.

172
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,356
Well, let's go through all the
sitting Congressmen one by one,

173
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
and see if anybody
sticks out from the crowd.

174
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,754
All right. I got the list right here.
Okay. Go ahead.

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,480
Pennsylvania's first
district, Peter Russo.

176
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,394
Cross him off. He's no good.
No experience. No chops.

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,439
Okay, moving on. Second
district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

178
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,479
Gwen's too controversial.
Very vocal on abortion...

179
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,550
And, Caroline?

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,756
She's good.

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,870
Yeah? How're the boys?

182
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,030
All fuckin'
four of them?

183
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,873
You feed 'em.

184
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,270
You got any pictures?
On your phone?

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,477
Come on. Let's cut the
shit, Pete, will ya?

186
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,717
What are we gonna do
about the shipyard?

187
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,033
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,316
Yeah, and why
didn't you testify?

189
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,636
We're talking
12,000 jobs here.

190
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,280
My hands were tied, Paul.
People wanted it closed.

191
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,153
I was under a lot of pressure.
From who?

192
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,237
People high up the food chain.
There's nothing I could do.

193
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,957
That's bullshit. You go back to BRAC.
You talk to the DOD.

194
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,396
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy.
You do something...

195
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,470
It's not gonna happen.

196
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,636
Okay, why not?

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,354
I told you,
it's political.

198
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,477
Okay, so I'm supposed to go back
to the Shipbuilder's Association

199
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,835
and say what now,
exactly?

200
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,840
That they're out of work because
Pete Russo's playing politics?

201
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,389
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

202
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,594
We're the ones who got you fuckin'
elected in the first place.

203
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,110
Now you're gonna
turn your back on us?

204
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,998
You should go.

205
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,309
Seriously?

206
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,717
I just got here.
You're kickin' me out now?

207
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
Hey, I'm fuckin'
talkin' to you.

208
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,759
I thought we
grew up together.

209
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,430
But this guy, sitting
behind his big desk,

210
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,119
I don't even know
who the fuck he is.

211
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,073
Where's the Pete Russo who
knew how to throw a punch

212
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,675
when his back was
against the wall?

213
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,837
That guy was my friend.

214
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,557
Every teacher in the country?
A month before school ends?

215
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,676
He doesn't need
all of them.

216
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,752
Fifteen, 20 states.
That's all.

217
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,877
But the AFT and the NEA
can't agree on anything.

218
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,997
You underestimate
Marty Spinella.

219
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,154
So which one
do we target?

220
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,109
We have a better
chance with the NEA.

221
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,314
You think Chuck Sloan
will bite?

222
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,552
Cooperate, we give your people
protection and a place at the banquet.

223
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,359
Fight us, we break you.

224
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,073
He'll bite.
Get him on the phone.

225
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,196
It's after 2:00.

226
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,600
Spinella's potentially mobilizing
the largest teachers' strike

227
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,956
in United States history.
Nobody's sleeping.

228
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,997
I'll call him
right now.

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,753
I'm sorry.
Are we being too loud?

230
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,194
A little.

231
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,956
What are you working on?

232
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,191
The gala.
There's so much to do.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,036
Did Nancy
send you my list?

234
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,270
She did.

235
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,113
And what'd you think?

236
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,393
It's a good list.
Thanks for inviting them.

237
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,680
Is something wrong?

238
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,840
It's still not anywhere near
what Remy brought to the table.

239
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,631
SanCorp offered
1.5 million, Francis.

240
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,270
I'm adding up the numbers and
we're only at half a million.

241
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,477
I got Chuck on the phone.
In a minute.

242
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,596
I can make
more calls...

243
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,034
Enough to raise
1.5 million?

244
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,199
Well, I can at least
get us closer.

245
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,035
I'm going to bed.

246
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,433
Don't move
any of this around.

247
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,673
Claire... We made the
decision to turn Remy down.

248
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,670
No one forced you. I thought
we were okay on this.

249
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,750
You're right.

250
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,674
Good night, Francis.

251
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,831
<i>This is Adam.
Leave a message.</i>

252
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,389
Hi, Adam, it's me.
I know it's late, but...

253
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,715
Well, I was really just calling to
thank you again for the photographs.

254
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,191
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

255
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,153
Hope you're well.

256
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,031
<i>I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.</i>

257
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,158
<i>Hope you're well.</i>

258
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,310
Right this way,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,070
He's here.

260
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,838
Good afternoon, Tom.

261
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,670
Legal?

262
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,431
Did you say it
or didn't you?

263
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,752
To you and to
anyone who asks...

264
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,035
Yes, I did.

265
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,000
Do we really
need them?

266
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,639
Not unless I should
expect a fight.

267
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,710
You shouldn't.

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,998
Give us a few moments.

269
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,237
It's not what
you called her.

270
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,800
It's that you let her
leave the building.

271
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,675
I know how to run
a paper, Margaret.

272
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,558
What I don't know how
to do is run a paper

273
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,518
staffed with people
I can't control.

274
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,717
Was she really
out of control?

275
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,073
To my understanding, she simply
turned down a new position.

276
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,669
It's her attitude. It's the
way she turned it down.

277
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,275
Did you think to ask her what
she'd rather do instead?

278
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,113
Is it my job to pander
to all my employees' wants...

279
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,316
My employees.

280
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,990
And if they have something
to offer that you don't,

281
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,434
yes, it is your job.

282
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,591
We've been
through this, Tom.

283
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,514
The paper's operating at a loss.
We need people like Zoe...

284
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,278
I'm very aware of how much
we're hurting, Margaret.

285
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,677
Staff reductions,
dip in circulation,

286
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,992
each one of those faces
and every subscriber we lose,

287
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,514
they keep me
awake at night.

288
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,752
Now I... I won't argue
the business side of things.

289
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,275
It's neither my place
nor my area of expertise.

290
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,794
But know this,

291
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,630
Zoe Barnes,
Twitter, blogs,

292
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,637
enriched media,
they're all surface.

293
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,400
They're fads.

294
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,951
They aren't the foundation
this paper was built on,

295
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,999
and they aren't
what will keep it alive.

296
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,994
We have a core readership
that thirsts for hard news.

297
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,350
Those are the people I work
80 hours a week for.

298
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,719
And I won't be distracted
by what's fashionable.

299
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,559
That's your
resignation letter.

300
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,474
Hand it to the lawyers
on the way out.

301
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,351
I'll give you
some privacy.

302
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,671
No, no, stay,
it'll be quick.

303
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,679
We'll get a drink.

304
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,477
We're gonna launch
right here in Washington.

305
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,040
We'll see how
Congress likes it

306
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,954
when the streets are teeming
with unsupervised school kids.

307
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,477
Then we'll phase out
the rest of the country.

308
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,831
Everybody, hold on for one minute.
What's up?

309
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,516
The NEA is out.

310
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,716
What?

311
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,952
They pulled out.
Why?

312
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,156
He wouldn't say.

313
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,999
Hold on for
one more minute.

314
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,673
Chuck Sloan? Get him on
the phone right now.

315
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,916
I've got him right here.

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,832
Is he muted?
Yes.

317
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,474
Hey, Chuck, it's Marty.

318
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,791
Listen, you can't do this.

319
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,072
If we don't stay united now,
we don't have a...

320
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,556
You hired me to represent
your interests, right?

321
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,393
How could I possibly
lobby for the teachers

322
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,039
when Congress
sees us splintering

323
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,157
before we even
put up a unite...

324
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,790
All right.

325
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,999
Did Underwood
get to you?

326
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,951
Frank is dishonest
and manipulative.

327
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,918
You've seen that
he's lied to us already.

328
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,993
Wait, Chuck?
Chuck, Chuck? Chuck!

329
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,395
Son of a bitch!

330
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,993
Where are you?
<i>I'm at the office.</i>

331
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,560
False.
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

332
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,790
Not for a second.

333
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,950
<i>Where are you?</i>

334
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,070
About to walk
into a meeting.

335
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,276
<i>With who?</i>

336
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,589
Someone I have to punish.

337
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,830
<i>Give me a name.</i>

338
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,155
No names.

339
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,879
<i>What did this
person do wrong?</i>

340
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,394
Lie to me.

341
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,551
<i>How will you
punish him?</i>

342
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,280
What makes you
think it's a him?

343
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,832
Hold on.
I have to take this.

344
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,909
Where are you?

345
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,269
<i>Me? I am...</i>

346
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,670
Not at the office.

347
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,757
You're gonna give me a new
one of these every week?

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,435
Well, I can't
continue to...

349
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,590
Not without protection.

350
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,554
Nobody tells me when
to work and when to play.

351
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,632
I'm not being
unreasonable, Zoe.

352
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,916
If you can't trust me, we
shouldn't be doing this at all.

353
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,915
Well, then how do we
establish our trust?

354
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,673
I have been very discreet.

355
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,712
Professional
discretion, yes.

356
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,111
But this is
new territory.

357
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,357
You have a camera
on your phone.

358
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,716
Pictures.

359
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,392
The kind I wouldn't
want my father to see.

360
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,154
Well, I'm gonna
need more than that.

361
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,750
Lie back.

362
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,752
Use your imagination.

363
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
I want everything
packed for tomorrow.

364
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,510
We checked already, Dad.

365
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,432
Did you? Those are my pink
Nikes on the kitchen counter?

366
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,240
And you, Autobot, what is Optimus
Prime doing under my bed?

367
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,199
He better transform himself
into your backpack

368
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,034
before you have
to leave tomorrow.

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,792
Hey, Dad,
is Christina coming back?

370
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,874
I don't... I don't
think so, buddy. No.

371
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,990
Oh.

372
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,435
I liked her.

373
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,636
Me, too.
She's cool.

374
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,318
Yeah, she is cool.

375
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,511
Now, you guys
gotta brush your teeth.

376
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,791
And then check
the rooms again.

377
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,758
And then it's
time for bed.

378
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,956
Got it, pumpkins?

379
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,152
Dad, you know I hate it
when you call us pumpkins.

380
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,958
Go. Before I turn you
into a pie.

381
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,670
Peter Russo.

382
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,279
He's a drunk.
He is at the moment.

383
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,319
A very functional one.
Imagine if he was sober.

384
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,080
Even so,
you run him for Governor,

385
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,714
people are going
to dig into his past.

386
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,475
Well, we turn that into an
asset, not a liability.

387
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,553
Here's who I was,
here's who I am now.

388
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,519
You saw how they dismissed him in three
seconds at the Leadership meeting.

389
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,560
Patti Whittaker is very open-minded.
And I am very persuasive.

390
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,070
You think Russo
even wants it?

391
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,277
Any kid who's made it from
the streets of South Philly

392
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,591
to the Capitol
rotunda is ambitious.

393
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,353
We just need
to tap into that.

394
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,875
Surround him with the best people
and then build the machine

395
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,189
and push the "go" button.

396
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,870
So you think
he could win.

397
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,595
I think he can be
a contender.

398
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,717
Okay, let's say we pull off
a miracle and he wins.

399
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,790
What do we gain by it?

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,037
Isn't it better to be holding
the reins in this race

401
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,157
than watching
from the stands?

402
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,396
Your wife
is on the phone.

403
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,636
Put her through
in here.

404
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,710
I understand
that Pennsylvania's

405
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,876
important for
re-districting...

406
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,873
No, no, no, this isn't just
about this race, Doug.

407
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,795
Expand your thinking. Who
else is from Pennsylvania?

408
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,919
No, no, no,
not in Congress.

409
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,200
The executive branch.

410
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,315
The Vice President.

411
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,190
Hello, my dear.

412
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,273
Nancy had my tux dry-cleaned
so I won't embarrass...

413
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>The Cotesworth
canceled on us.</i>

414
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm leaving right now. I'll come get you.
I've gotta go.

415
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,636
What's going on?

416
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,473
The hotel,
for tonight's gala,

417
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,359
they refuse to let
Claire into the ballroom

418
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,319
because their
employees are union.

419
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,430
Spinella.

420
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,319
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants.
But to go after my wife?

421
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,116
No class.

422
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,270
Meet me
at the Cotesworth.

423
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,516
You got it.

424
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,712
Why can't we just move
it to another place?

425
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,075
I looked into that.
Everything's booked.

426
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,117
You have to reserve these
things weeks in advance.

427
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,510
I got Stamper online looking
for another venue somewhere.

428
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,910
Francis, the delivery trucks
are already at the Cotesworth.

429
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,356
I can't have people showing up
at a different place

430
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,715
in case they
don't get the email.

431
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,359
All right. This is my fault.
I feel awful.

432
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,999
There's a half a million
on the line here.

433
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,719
I realize that.

434
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,280
And I can't keep
having my work

435
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,914
take these hits
on behalf of yours.

436
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,639
It's more than
just an inconvenience.

437
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,632
I know.
We'll solve it.

438
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,479
Hey, I just got
your email.

439
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,630
What'd you think?

440
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,110
You don't have to send me
things before you post.

441
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,240
I thought you might
want to take a look.

442
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,595
The goal here
is for everyone

443
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,319
to post things faster than I
have a chance to read 'em.

444
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,000
If you're satisfied with the
article, you just put it up.

445
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,070
Okay.

446
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,390
Are you satisfied?

447
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,630
I think so.

448
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,835
Okay, you are
or you aren't.

449
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,752
Whatever hoops <i>The Herald</i>
made you jump through...

450
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,911
I know.
Let them go.

451
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,197
It's okay
to be opinionated, Zoe.

452
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,590
And it's okay to go outside
and get your hands dirty.

453
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,920
You're no longer
tied to a desk.

454
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,918
Or to that pillow for that matter.
I'm not gonna post it.

455
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,469
Midterm predictions, they're not news.
They're bullshit.

456
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,480
Well, I agree.

457
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,150
I can do better.

458
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,600
I think you can.

459
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,556
Feel free to blow my mind.

460
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,949
If we do this event,
the whole staff walks out.

461
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,952
I've got 300 guests...

462
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,958
You signed a contract
with my wife.

463
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,480
We'll refund your
wife's organization

464
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,751
and pay for whatever the
cost of moving the event

465
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,354
to a more
appropriate venue.

466
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,194
And we would have to refund half
a million dollars in donations.

467
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,600
Can you pay
for that, too?

468
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,273
'Cause I'm pretty sure there's
cause for damages here.

469
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,279
I truly apologize, sir.

470
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,715
Who's your boss?

471
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,870
I spoke with
the owners,

472
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,997
and they authorized me
to do what I think is best.

473
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,117
And do they realize that
they are shutting the door

474
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,675
on 41 members of
the United States Congress?

475
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,919
Yes, sir. They do.

476
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,310
I had to make a very
hard judgment call.

477
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,790
Well, I seriously
question your judgment.

478
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,792
You know, word travels
fast in this town.

479
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,716
All those luncheons
and conventions and dinners,

480
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,996
it's gonna be a shame to lose
all that work, isn't it?

481
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,998
Congressman,
you are absolutely right,

482
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,998
but if my staff
walks out, I...

483
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,399
Please understand
the predicament I'm in.

484
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,516
<i>I got an idea.</i>

485
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,195
I know what
we're gonna do.

486
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,239
Honey, they're not gonna
let us have it inside,

487
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,515
we're gonna
have it right here,

488
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,034
on their front steps.
Picnic style.

489
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,156
What do you
need from me?

490
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,316
I need your manpower.

491
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,920
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

492
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,671
Okay, everybody, stop what
you're doing and listen up.

493
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,510
Yeah?

494
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,115
Hey, Frank.

495
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,429
<i>Listen,
I need a favor, a large one.</i>

496
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,960
How soon?

497
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,235
<i>In about three hours.</i>

498
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,872
How many people we talking?
<i>Just 300.</i>

499
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,872
The florist is gonna send
over whatever he has.

500
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,189
Great.

501
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,549
Francis,
where are we with food?

502
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,512
I've got hot dogs, pizzas,
and soul food coming.

503
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,034
Maybe something else.

504
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,713
Girls.
Here's what I want.

505
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,396
I want four bars, two on each level.
The food can go there.

506
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,073
The silent auction
goes here.

507
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,072
And cancel the string quartet.
Let's get a DJ.

508
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,514
Doug,
how are we on booze?

509
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,756
Kegs are on their way now.
Great.

510
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,194
And call Denise
at the office

511
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,193
and have her bring every
donation envelope she can find.

512
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,312
Okay, messages, people.

513
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,954
Congressman Russo's office. Yes, can
you hold one minute? Thank you.

514
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,470
Congressman? People keep
calling about the shipyards.

515
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,550
We don't know
what to tell them.

516
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,630
We just say we'll
give you the message.

517
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,234
Keep saying that.
Okay, here they are.

518
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,834
The messages and all the
emails we've gotten to.

519
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,640
Do you want me to...
Have a good night.

520
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,669
Who'd we reach?

521
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,797
<i>Herald, The Times,
USA Today.</i>

522
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,832
All right, I want affiliate
stations and cable news.

523
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,230
I want satellite trucks out there.
I want this on live TV.

524
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,470
Okay, I'm on it.

525
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,480
You can't
do this here.

526
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,632
Zoe, 8:00 p.m. tonight,
Hotel Cotesworth.

527
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,191
Benefit for
my wife's charity.

528
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,438
No. Wash your face
and let your hair down.

529
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,037
This is
work and play.

530
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,270
See you.

531
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,592
I can tell you right now
I'm gonna need two dozen.

532
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,913
Paul, I'm gonna need those
by tomorrow, okay?

533
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,390
Your guests are
your problem, not mine.

534
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,675
Julian.

535
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,069
I'll close the gate.

536
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,354
You know, I'm no
expert in fire code,

537
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,557
but I would imagine
that locking your guests in

538
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,518
is a bigger violation than
having them walk around us.

539
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,395
This is trespassing on private property.
You're breaking the law.

540
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,556
All right. Okay.

541
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,191
Let me get Barney Hull
on the phone here for you.

542
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,351
Here you go.
It's ringing.

543
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,952
Who's Barney Hull?
Police Commissioner.

544
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,720
<i>Commissioner Hull's office.
Hello?</i> No? Okay.

545
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,393
You'd rather talk
to him in person?

546
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,709
That's great.
He's coming to the party.

547
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,078
I'll be sure to introduce
the two of you.

548
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,755
Thanks for
your hospitality.

549
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,472
What do you want me to do?
I can't lock the gates.

550
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,074
And they've got
the police on their side.

551
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,117
Unbelievable.
Hold on.

552
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,595
Cassandra. I need 200 teachers
at the Cotesworth Hotel.

553
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,716
Right now.

554
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,790
I need a full picket.

555
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,876
Two hundred?
I don't know if we can

556
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,992
get that many on... I don't want to hear it.
Just get it done.

557
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,276
All right. I don't give a fuck if
they're teachers or not, frankly.

558
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,510
Just get me 200 bodies.

559
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,398
Call the Teamsters,
maybe they'll help us.

560
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,552
We'll give them glasses if we have to.
Tell the guys to look smart.

561
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,430
Charlie, get off the phone. I need
signs right now, at least 100.

562
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,274
<i>You know what?
Let them set it up.</i>

563
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,840
<i>It's actually better
for us that way. They...</i>

564
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,474
<i>This way they
can't hide from us.</i>

565
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,519
You've put me in
a terrible situation.

566
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,237
Thank you very much
for all your help.

567
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,919
Much appreciated.

568
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,960
Here, we've got the signs right here.
Let's hand them out fast.

569
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,035
Everybody, single file, right down the
street, this way and that way, okay?

570
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,473
Well, at least
he spelled it right.

571
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,837
<i>Teachers protesting the Education
Reform and Achievement Act</i>

572
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,436
<i>have descended upon the Hotel
Cotesworth in Washington, D. C.</i>

573
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,760
<i>Union lobbyist, Marty Spinella,
organized the demonstration.</i>

574
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,991
Teachers deserve respect!

575
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,594
Teachers deserve respect!

576
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,718
Now, I knew you'd show up and you'd
bring that beautiful wife of yours.

577
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,871
Hello, it's a pleasure,
thank you for coming.

578
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,519
Come on in,
the drinks are on the house.

579
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,750
Felicity.

580
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,115
The party can begin.

581
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,119
This is Spinella.

582
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,873
He got us shut out
by the union,

583
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,037
so we had to have a party
out here on the steps.

584
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,873
I'm gonna take you
up to a bar right now.

585
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,429
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Welcome.

586
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,472
Teachers, yes! Unions, yes!

587
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,990
Hi.

588
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,159
Thanks, again,
so much for coming.

589
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
Adam's here.

590
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,109
You came.

591
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,714
Looks wonderful.

592
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
You're gonna have
to move over

593
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,398
because I have to serve
this wonderful couple myself.

594
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,757
This is fabulous. Only Claire
could have thought of this.

595
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,510
I don't suppose you have
anything single-malt back there?

596
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,350
Frank, it's worth every penny
to see you on keg duty.

597
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,831
Well then, don't you think that this
is worth just a few extra pennies?

598
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,718
Let's break out
the checkbook, Charles.

599
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,594
Did you RSVP?

600
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,717
I assumed
it didn't matter.

601
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,995
It doesn't.

602
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,912
I'm glad you're here.

603
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,949
When I heard
your message...

604
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,795
You know, I shouldn't
have left that, Adam.

605
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,075
Why not?

606
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,632
Maybe we should
talk at some point.

607
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,278
Make that check with a
lot of zeros, won't you?

608
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,354
Here we are.

609
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,994
Cheers.
Cheers.

610
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,355
Cheers.

611
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,080
Now I'm going to ask a huge
favor of you since you're here.

612
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,280
You want to
put me to work.

613
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,754
Yes, please.

614
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,837
My pleasure.
Come.

615
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,517
So these are some wonderful photographs
by an amazing photographer...

616
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,920
Gillian...

617
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,679
Adam Galloway.
Nice to meet you.

618
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,393
I've heard lots about you.
And to you.

619
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,796
And this is the photographer himself.
Hello, how are you?

620
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,793
Freddy.

621
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,509
I just wanted to thank you so much.
Such a success tonight.

622
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,750
My pleasure, my pleasure.

623
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,110
He's the best.

624
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
I see Adam's here.

625
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,154
I didn't know
he was coming.

626
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,199
Well, guess what I got. Another
check from the Holburns.

627
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,431
For $60,000.

628
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,119
Come on, praise me
like you should.

629
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,560
If Frank Underwood and the
United States Congress...

630
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,994
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm with <i>Slugline.</i>

631
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,118
...think that they can dismantle the
rights of the American teacher,

632
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,954
well, then they are going to hear
our voices wherever they are.

633
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,839
Hi, why protest here?

634
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,999
Congress has to
take this seriously.

635
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,439
We're here for the teachers.
We're here...

636
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,994
Thank you.
Thank you.

637
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,080
We're not asking
for the world.

638
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,197
And Congress needs to step
up and get this done.

639
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,910
Excuse me,
just a moment.

640
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,920
Well, that dress
looks familiar.

641
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,912
It's the one I wore
to the symphony.

642
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,435
Yes, the mutual
admiration society.

643
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,000
That's right.

644
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,556
So. What do you
have for me?

645
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,156
What do you mean?

646
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,197
Well, you're surrounded
by Washington's elite.

647
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,760
Are you saying
you've overheard nothing

648
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,439
that could be useful
to either of us?

649
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,749
I'm covering
the protest.

650
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,797
The rest of the world
is covering the protest.

651
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,075
You may not have noticed,

652
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,595
but you're the only
journalist inside the party.

653
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,830
I've been
feeding you plenty,

654
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,196
information is a two-way
street, Ms. Barnes.

655
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,629
Hello...

656
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,752
Claire, this is Zoe Barnes, you
met her one night at the house...

657
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,231
Yes, I remember. You work
for <i>The Herald,</i> right?

658
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,399
Not anymore. I actually
work at <i>Slugline</i> now.

659
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,989
I've heard of it. You read
it, don't you, Francis?

660
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,275
Religiously.

661
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,516
Well, you seem like a very ambitious
young woman. I like that.

662
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,314
Doing my best.

663
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,392
It's good
to see you, again.

664
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,956
Please,
enjoy yourself.

665
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,116
I will. Thank you.

666
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,232
Take care,
Ms. Barnes.

667
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,078
And she
looks gorgeous,

668
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,876
but really she's thinking,
"When can I go the fuck home?"

669
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,992
I'm off.
Already?

670
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,118
I've done my duty,
I believe.

671
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,840
You know me. I always have to
be the first to leave a party.

672
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,912
How much did you raise?

673
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,714
$750,000.

674
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,116
Eighty of that was your photographs.
Fantastic.

675
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,074
Write a check for 250,
we'll break a million.

676
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,435
Nice try.

677
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,276
Thank you for coming.
And everything that you did.

678
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,954
Call me sometime.

679
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,399
I will.

680
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,156
Teachers should
be getting more!

681
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,390
So what does
a Clean Water gala

682
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,590
have to do with
teachers unions?

683
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,549
Well, we have over 50 members of
Congress gathered in one place.

684
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,518
But the fact that
these members of Congress

685
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,399
are promoting pouring money
out of the country

686
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,518
while neglecting their teachers
at home is precisely the problem.

687
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,832
But this is private money,
not public tax dollars, so...

688
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,553
But we're not
protesting the cause,

689
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,156
we're protesting the Congressmen
and women themselves...

690
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,674
Are these even
teachers picketing?

691
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,712
Sure, some of them. And
some of them are people...

692
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,314
Excuse me...

693
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,680
Frank... What you... Don't take the food.
We'll feed you later.

694
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,156
Don't take this food. Marty,
you know that old saying,

695
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,754
"The most dangerous
spot in the world is

696
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,360
"to come between
a Teamster and free food."

697
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,110
Don't take the food,
we're feeding you later.

698
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,476
I'll take it.
She'll take it.

699
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,879
Who else is hungry?

700
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,356
There you go.

701
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,790
Pass it back.

702
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,435
Plenty more coming, guys.

703
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,632
I know you've all been
out here for hours.

704
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,473
Thank you, Freddy!

705
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,677
The best ribs in D.C.

706
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,516
Marty, come on. You've said your
piece, you got on the news.

707
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,676
Come and enjoy yourself.

708
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,479
I respect you, Claire,
you know I can't do that.

709
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,314
Doesn't matter what side you're
on, everybody's gotta eat.

710
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,198
You can have a plate of ribs.
Yes, you can.

711
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,640
Come on. Yes, you can. I can't.

712
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,433
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.
You can do it.

713
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,034
Come on, Marty!
Come on.

714
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,719
I can't. Thank you.
Thank you.

715
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,912
Freddy's.
You should go to Freddy's.

716
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,792
<i>Several dozen
union sympathizers,</i>

717
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,832
<i>led by labor lobbyist,
Martin Spinella,</i>

718
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,673
<i>attempted to disrupt the gala.</i>

719
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,672
<i>They need to step
up to the plate</i>

720
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,797
<i>and take care of our
teachers and our children.</i>

721
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,276
<i>The protest dissipated
when fundraiser attendees</i>

722
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,317
<i>offer food and drink
to picketers.</i>

723
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,869
<i>Doesn't matter what side you're
on, everybody's gotta eat.</i>

724
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,550
Turn it off.

725
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,518
<i>It's unclear
whether protest will continue.</i>

726
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,349
What now?

727
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,711
Call the union leadership
and the chapter presidents.

728
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,513
See if they're ready
to the pull the trigger.

729
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,399
If they are, we strike
at midnight tomorrow.

730
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,596
You were
extraordinary.

731
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,154
Tomorrow, people
who weren't there

732
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,760
are gonna lie
and say they were.

733
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,350
What are you reading?

734
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,120
She can write.

735
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,595
She can.

736
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,957
And you can
raise money.

737
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,031
Always,
for a good cause.

738
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,270
Thank you.

739
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,797
Wait in the car, please.

740
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,479
Hold on.
I know who that is.

741
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,314
Hello, Peter.

742
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,317
I am starving.
I forgot to eat.

743
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,320
Would you like something,
Peter?

744
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,834
No, thanks.

745
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,116
You should eat.

746
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,236
Don't fight.
She'll win.

747
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,396
I will.

748
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,640
Okay, yes.

749
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,635
You want
some coffee?

750
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,069
Yes, thanks.

751
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,552
Do you have
any children?

752
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,151
Two. A son and a daughter.

753
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,510
Married?

754
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,640
Divorced.

755
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,993
What are their names,
your kids?

756
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,320
There's Sarah. She's 11,
and Kevin is eight.

757
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,830
Do you have any pictures?

758
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,670
Fuck!
I lost my phone...

759
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,751
Sorry, I should...
I gotta go...

760
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,830
Peter, sit down.

761
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,155
You're gonna
enjoy your sandwich,

762
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,913
have some coffee
and stay the night.

763
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,275
Milk and sugar?

764
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,310
Black.

765
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,710
Some fresh towels.

766
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,153
There should be
soap and toothpaste,

767
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,033
everything you
need in the bathroom.

768
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,152
Thank you so
much for doing this.

769
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,879
It's nothing.
Sleep well.

770
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,356
What's going on, Peter?

771
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,514
Talk to me.

772
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,910
You think fresh towels
changes anything?

773
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,150
Changes what?

774
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,230
The shipyard.

775
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,075
If I was home and you pulled that
shit, I'd beat the fuck out of you.

776
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,518
I would crack your skull
on the pavement.

777
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,434
That's why I came
over here today.

778
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,194
To fuck you up for
what you made me do.

779
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,509
I don't care how nice
you're being to me.

780
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,590
I don't give a shit.

781
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,912
I'm gonna
wake up tomorrow,

782
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,114
and all these people,

783
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,600
all my friends,

784
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,995
are still fucked.

785
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,154
And I'm still fucked.

786
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,512
You fucked all of us.

787
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,190
But I'm gonna
get blamed for it.

788
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,274
So, now I have to carry that
weight on my shoulders.

789
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,118
You fucked me, Frank.

790
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,151
I shouldn't have let you
do it, but I did...

791
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,079
Are you done now?

792
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,993
Get up.

793
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,030
No.

794
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,794
I said get up.
And follow me.

795
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,710
Now.

796
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,830
Get in.

797
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,510
Take off your clothes
and get in.

798
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,590
Do it. Now.

799
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,950
There was a DNC meeting earlier this week.
About the Governor's race.

800
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,596
Your name came up as someone
we might want to run.

801
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,958
Aspirin. Go ahead.

802
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,310
Everyone in that room wanted
to cross you off the list.

803
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,073
I said no.
I stuck up for you.

804
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,073
I said, "Peter Russo,
he's got potential.

805
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,955
"He's young, he's capable,
he's going places."

806
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,230
I made them keep you
in contention.

807
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,517
You're still
on that list.

808
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,432
You show up at my house in the middle
of the night, drunk, to whine?

809
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,272
To try to shift
the blame on me?

810
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,751
Instead of taking responsibility
for yourself and your own actions?

811
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,915
Maybe they were right
in that meeting.

812
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,960
Maybe you are worthless.

813
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,515
I'm the only person who
believes in you, Peter,

814
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,069
but maybe
that's one too many.

815
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,796
The hot water will
open up your capillaries.

816
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,595
The aspirin you just took
will make your blood thinner.

817
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,592
It's up to you, Peter...

818
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,876
And if you do decide to
take the coward's way out,

819
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,795
cut along the tracks, not across them.
That's a rookie mistake.

820
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,233
Morning.
Morning.

821
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,480
You need a lift
to the Hill?

822
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,074
I should go home
and change my clothes.

823
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,833
No, no,
we'll drop you.

824
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,473
You want some coffee?

825
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,630
Frank?

826
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,710
One month.

827
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,390
Hmm?

828
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,352
One month sober.

829
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,669
I can give you that.

830
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,878
Not for me. For you.

831
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,237
Has the seed
been planted?

832
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,075
Only Peter can
answer that question.

833
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,714
He has a choice.

834
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,635
Will he wither?

835
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,632
Or will he thrive?

836
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,554
Only time will tell.
