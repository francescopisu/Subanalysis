1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,353
You know what I like about people?
They stack so well.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,232
Let me get
this for you.

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,237
Want the paper?
No.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,600
This is too much.
It's not half enough.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,875
Thanks for opening
up for me.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,674
Anytime day or night.
You know that.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,113
In a town where everyone is so
carefully reinventing themselves,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,433
what I like about Freddy is that
he doesn't even pretend to change.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,513
Oh, I'm late.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,997
Every Tuesday I sit down with the
Speaker and the Majority Leader

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,676
to discuss the week's agenda. Well,
discuss is probably the wrong word.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,594
They talk while I
sit quietly and imagine

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,554
their lightly-salted
faces frying in a skillet.

14
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,351
Vasquez must be
shitting herself.

15
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,116
Shitting herself while
Walker is shitting himself

16
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,793
then shoveling his
shit on her shit.

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,280
Bob, I'm planning
on eating.

18
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,476
Do we have a back-up
on the docket?

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,550
You're on that,
right, Frank?

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,676
I'm working
with my staff...

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,911
The Republicans are gonna
ram this up our ass.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,070
I would if
I was them.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
Well, even if we
squeak it through the House,

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
watch them mangle
it in the Senate.

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,315
Or filibuster it.

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,669
Well, sure, if it
looks anything like this.

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,514
I don't know why Walker's trying
to tackle a charging elephant.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,636
It's madness.

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,154
Congressman,
sorry to interrupt,

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,760
but I saw you
sitting over here and...

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,116
Remy. Gentlemen,
this is Remy Danton.

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,959
Remy, this is Speaker
Birch, and Congressman...

33
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,918
I'm well aware.
Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,391
Remy just made
partner at Glendon Hill.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,315
Glendon Hill? Great team over there.
Congratulations.

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,356
Thank you.

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,033
When was the last time
they added a partner?

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,315
It's been a while.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,635
Well, they know a winner
when they see one.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,440
Remy was the best press
secretary I ever had.

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,715
Why'd you
let him go?

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,149
I didn't.
They stole him away.

43
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,594
What accounts
do you have?

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,110
SanCorp Industries
is my main one.

45
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,839
I run that account now.

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,355
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.
Sorry again to interrupt.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,790
No problem. Very nice
to meet you both.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,600
Christ, these lobbyists keep
getting younger and younger.

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,797
He's probably making more
than all of us combined.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,351
Gentlemen, this one's on me. I'm
gonna track down that check.

51
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,160
Glendon Hill fronts
SanCorp Industries.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,873
SanCorp is deep
into natural gas.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,639
I don't give a hoot
about natural gas.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,680
But I have 67 deputy whips and
they all need cash to win races.

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,433
SanCorp helps me
purchase loyalty

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,199
and in return,
they expect mine.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,511
It's degrading, I know. But
when the tit's that big,

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,114
everybody gets in line.

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,714
Tell them I'm
on top of it.

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,029
I need more than that.

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,271
You are well aware that
I do not drop the ball

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,874
on things
like this, Remy.

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,360
Promises, Frank.

64
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,396
The Secretary of State,

65
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,073
Argentina, the offshore
drilling accounts...

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,276
Talk to me when I've
solved the problem.

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,999
Don't waste my time when
I'm working on solving it.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,151
When there's billions on the
line, you can't not call me back

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,515
and I can't not show up.

70
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,915
Fine. Thank you
for your diligence.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,719
Eight figures to you
and the D triple C.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,757
Six million to build that
library of yours, in your name.

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,876
I know.

74
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't make them throw money at
your challenger next cycle.

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,350
You've made your point.

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,630
Have I?

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,996
I hope so.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,231
Such a waste of talent.

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,880
He chose money over power.

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
In this town, a mistake
nearly everyone makes.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,115
Money is the McMansion
in Sarasota

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,675
that starts falling
apart after 10 years.

83
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,313
Power is the old stone building
that stands for centuries.

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,279
I cannot respect someone who
doesn't see the difference.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,876
What am I looking at?

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,599
The Williams Register.
Williams...

87
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,273
College. September '78.

88
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,993
And why am
I looking at it?

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,514
The editorial.

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,916
Not that interesting.

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,829
Michael Kern went to Williams.
Check out the masthead.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,677
And then there's this.

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,590
It's thin.

94
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,797
The guy's a unicorn.
He pisses rainbows.

95
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,111
You think we can get traction with this?
I think you could.

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,554
Linda Vasquez
is on the phone.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,037
I'm surprised it
took her this long.

98
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,156
It's only six
past 9:00.

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,118
Which means she read the
<i>Herald</i> three hours ago

100
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,634
and spent the past
two and a half

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,160
getting reamed
by the President.

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,469
Tell her I'm on my way.

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me...

104
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,920
Twenty-five years he's been
pushing this particular agenda.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,959
We got between the mother bear and her cub.
It's a setback, that's all.

106
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,599
On our first day
in office.

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,399
Linda, I've worked
with four presidents.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,711
Setbacks are a dime a dozen
with a bill of this size.

109
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,870
Frank, if you can't
control this...

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,196
I don't take well to being
micromanaged, Linda.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,159
You want to do my job for
me and run the White House?

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,118
Good luck. I won't
stand in your way.

113
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,637
Okay, Frank. Fine.
This is yours now.

114
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,480
If this thing can't make it to the
floor in the first hundred days,

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,074
then I'll let you
explain to the President

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,754
why he lied to
the American people.

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
I'm gonna get
back to work.

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,276
Please do.

119
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,275
<i>We really should be doing this on
a Friday instead of a Wednesday.</i>

120
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,750
<i>Because if we do it on a Friday,
people have the weekend.</i>

121
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,194
<i>Fine, we'll
do it on Friday.</i>

122
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,839
<i>Is all
the paperwork ready?</i>

123
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,391
<i>Some of the more senior people are trickier.
There's severance and...</i>

124
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
But we shouldn't run into
any legal issues. No, no.

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,234
We use at-will employment
contracts across the board.

126
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
We'll get started
first thing Friday.

127
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,192
I want all of the exit
interviews done by lunch.

128
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,274
Claire, I just can't help but
think that this is a mistake.

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,750
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.
I know, I know.

130
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,311
But I just have to say it
for the sake of my conscience.

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,279
I think that you
are dismantling

132
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,070
what we have built over
the past 10 years and I...

133
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,475
And I think the way
you're handling this is...

134
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,310
Is cruel.

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,510
It's not easy, Evelyn.

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
But it's necessary.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,357
You have always asked me
to be honest with you.

138
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,113
That's how we
work together.

139
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,431
I disagree with
something, I say it.

140
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,274
Well, I disagree 100%.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
Please, Claire,
don't do this.

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,677
I respect your
opinion, Evelyn.

143
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,195
And I appreciate you
sharing it with me.

144
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,676
But I'm not going
to change my mind.

145
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
Friday, then.

146
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,192
If that's what you want.

147
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,479
This is major reform.
A complete overhaul.

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,313
That would
usually take months.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,278
Well, we only have
days, not months.

150
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,953
But think about the process.
We can't just...

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,953
When I asked my
colleagues, your bosses,

152
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,953
who are the smartest
minds in education,

153
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,919
out of hundreds,
we arrived at you.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,719
The six of you
in this room.

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,632
Now I realize it
is a difficult task.

156
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,792
But we have the opportunity
to make history here.

157
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,793
And I want all of us
to make it together.

158
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,871
So, good luck.
We're counting on you.

159
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,154
Page one.

160
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,995
These bullet points reflect the key
planks at the center of our bill.

161
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,517
Get comfy. This is your home until
we have a presentable first draft.

162
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,912
Donald, what a morning.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,878
I have no idea
how they got this.

164
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,600
I specifically told my staff
to destroy everything.

165
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,313
I can't imagine... It doesn't
matter how it happened.

166
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,437
We can't make it un-happen.
So now we have to adapt.

167
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,432
Don't they realize that
this is a first draft?

168
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,637
All we have here really
is a perception problem.

169
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,040
We don't get
a second chance

170
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,713
at a first impression,
Donald. You know that.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,231
Now, look,
I'm on your side.

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,073
But Linda is furious.

173
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,754
What's she saying?

174
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,400
They want
to point fingers.

175
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,676
At me?

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,836
I told her we
cannot do that.

177
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,389
I mean, you are
vital to this process.

178
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,915
I'm up to here
with them, Donald.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,913
For lying, for turning
their back on you.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,469
You know, I'm of a mind
to say "screw it."

181
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,634
I'll fall on this grenade
myself just to piss them off.

182
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,314
Get me John King at CNN.

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,232
Wait, Frank. This
is not your fault.

184
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,198
No, we have to protect
your reputation.

185
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,237
But you're the man that needs to
get the bill through the House.

186
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,516
I will. Hang on. I will assign
it to one of my deputies

187
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,030
and quietly manage it. And I'll
help guide you through the process.

188
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,554
I am not comfortable with this.

189
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,114
Well, then, what do
you suggest we do?

190
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,918
What a martyr craves more than
anything is a sword to fall on.

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,550
So, you sharpen the blade, hold
it at just the right angle,

192
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,394
and then, three,
two, one...

193
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,630
It should be me.

194
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,710
It was my bill.

195
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,916
No, impossible.

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,994
Donald, education has
been your life's work.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,277
The truth is my heart
is not in this fight.

198
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,351
You know me. I'm not a wheeler-dealer.
I can put my mind to policy,

199
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,477
but I'm no good at
this brand of politics.

200
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,155
Well, if not you,
then who?

201
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,951
It should be you, Frank.

202
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,271
You're formidable.
People respect you.

203
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,956
They will follow your lead. Let
me be on the sidelines for this.

204
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,714
Well, I could only consider
that as an option if I knew

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,235
that I could still
come to you for counsel.

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,073
Of course.

207
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,389
Whatever you need.

208
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,071
Part of me is glad
this got leaked.

209
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,156
Well, it would've been
better if it hadn't

210
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,233
but at least people
know where I stand.

211
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,190
Thank you, Donald.

212
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,999
Happy to do it, Frank.

213
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,791
He has no idea we got
six kids in the next room

214
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,111
already working on
a new draft. Stamper!

215
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,318
But why dampen his mood by telling him?
We just gave him a great gift.

216
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,517
The chance to
fulfill his destiny.

217
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,159
Write up
a statement for Blythe.

218
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,914
Stepping aside, fresh ideas,
et cetera, et cetera.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,117
Make it dignified.
He's a good man.

220
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,192
And bring me that
Williams editorial.

221
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,680
After careful thought and
discussion with my staff,

222
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,231
I am relinquishing my management
of the Education Reform Act.

223
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
I hope to remain a part of the
process, but I won't be working...

224
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,316
Why did
you leak the draft?

225
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,869
I'm not exactly sure
how it got leaked

226
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,440
but it does represent...

227
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
It came from your
office though, correct?

228
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,270
We wrote it...

229
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,510
Who will be
managing the bill now?

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,398
Frank Underwood.
Was that your choice?

231
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,709
Or did the administration...

232
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,794
<i>I feel very confident placing the
bill in Frank's capable hands.</i>

233
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,514
Ms. Barnes.

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,080
How very
Deep Throat of you.

235
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,200
Well, I can't help you dispatch a president.
How about a senator?

236
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,237
The editorial on
the Camp David Accords.

237
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,359
"It is the opinion
of this newspaper

238
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,233
"that President
Carter demand Israel

239
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,993
"withdraw all
its citizens from

240
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,759
"the Gaza Strip
and West Bank..."

241
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,594
"Which it has illegally
occupied since 1967."

242
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,194
"Illegally occupied."

243
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,158
That's quite an incendiary
quote, don't you think?

244
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,118
For an administration
that says

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,118
the Middle East is its top
foreign policy priority.

246
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,078
Michael Kern?

247
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,753
Did he personally
write the editorial?

248
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,672
He was the editor.

249
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,353
But did he
write it himself?

250
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,318
Then there's no story.

251
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,675
I'm saying it's
a question worth asking.

252
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,679
And if he denies
involvement?

253
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,274
He will. Let him.

254
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,115
This is a man trying to be
confirmed as Secretary of State.

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,759
Everything is a story.

256
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,439
There's no direct link.

257
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,796
I can't get this
past Hammerschmidt.

258
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,351
Remember this moment
when you resisted me.

259
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,559
When you said the words,
"Then there is no story."

260
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,711
Get a good night's
sleep, Ms. Barnes.

261
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,439
You have a big
day tomorrow.

262
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,913
Francis?

263
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,200
What is this?

264
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,316
What does
it look like?

265
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,113
But the basement is mine.

266
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,395
I know.

267
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,516
It's not for me.

268
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,676
So who's it for?

269
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,989
For you.

270
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,799
There's a gym
in the Capitol.

271
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,200
Which you never use.

272
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,749
Because I'm a tad
busy running the country.

273
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,752
But not at home.
So now you have no excuse.

274
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,830
I want it out.

275
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,950
Give it a try first.

276
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,834
Is this your subtle way of
saying that I'm out of shape?

277
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,960
No. It's my way of suggesting
you could be in better shape.

278
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,839
That sounds both passive-aggressive
and condescending.

279
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,434
Just plain
aggressive and true.

280
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,755
Don't wait up for me.

281
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,030
Are you going running now?

282
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.
I had an early meeting.

283
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,869
Use the monstrosity.
It's freezing out.

284
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,519
You break it in.

285
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,349
It looks positively
medieval, doesn't it?

286
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,238
Trying to turn
my only sanctuary

287
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,198
into a fitness dungeon.
I won't have it.

288
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,635
It's a stretch.

289
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,837
We're not misleading anyone.
He was the editor.

290
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,639
Did you call for comment?
I tried three times.

291
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,712
The press secretary said he'd
get back to me, he didn't.

292
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,836
What about research?

293
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,718
You couldn't find anything
to echo the editorial?

294
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,473
No quotes?
No op-ed pieces?

295
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,313
Don't you think if something
like that existed

296
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,233
someone would have
printed it by now?

297
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,720
Nobody else
has this, Lucas.

298
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,876
I don't think
there's a story here.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,070
I'm not saying
there's a story.

300
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,914
All I'm saying is that there's a
question that needs to be answered.

301
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,756
This is a nominee
for Secretary of State.

302
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,116
We have an editorial
on Palestine and Israel.

303
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,680
Which he didn't write.

304
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Which we don't
know he didn't write.

305
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,830
Exactly.

306
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,070
We don't have
to print it.

307
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,959
I could just scan the thing, stick
it on a site and tweet the link.

308
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,759
But if I did that,
some other paper might...

309
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,990
Whoa, whoa.

310
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,470
Don't be a bitch.

311
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,870
I'll talk to Tom.

312
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,674
That's all I was asking.

313
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,320
<i>We simply can't
afford to allow...</i>

314
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,596
I got a guy,
he's almost perfect.

315
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,117
He's a libertarian drug fiend
marinating in a mobile home.

316
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,590
<i>I didn't agree with President
Reagan on many things.</i>

317
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,957
<i>But there was some merit to the
notion of trickle-down economics.</i>

318
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,831
<i>And I feel there is much merit to
the idea of trickle-down diplomacy.</i>

319
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,194
Those are my lines. Vasquez
must have given them to him.

320
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,033
<i>...solve the stalemate
between Israel and Palestine,</i>

321
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,034
<i>that success will trickle down to a
hundred other diplomatic dilemmas</i>

322
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,157
<i>between Muslims,
Jews, Christians...</i>

323
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,754
<i>I'm glad you brought
up Israel and Palestine,</i>

324
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,439
<i>because just before
we came on the air,</i>

325
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,989
<i>I received an advance copy of
an article that's going to be</i>

326
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,390
<i>in tomorrow's</i> Washington Herald.
<i>It's front page.</i>

327
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,039
<i>And it was
written by Zoe Barnes.</i>

328
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,157
<i>And in it she quotes
an editorial that ran</i>

329
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,272
<i>in the</i> Williams
College Register

330
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,398
<i>when you were editor,
back in September 1978,</i>

331
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,994
<i>which called
the Israeli presence</i>

332
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,753
<i>in the Gaza Strip
and West Bank, quote,</i>

333
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,991
<i>"An illegal occupation."</i>

334
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,151
<i>May I see that?
Sure.</i>

335
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,072
<i>Did you write those words,
"Illegal occupation"?</i>

336
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,635
<i>No.</i>

337
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,750
<i>I have no memory
of this.</i>

338
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,910
<i>But you were
the editor of the paper.</i>

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,036
<i>Yes.</i>

340
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,998
<i>So it couldn't have gone out
without your approval.</i>

341
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,039
<i>No, of course not.
But my staff...</i>

342
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,636
<i>Somebody else usually wrote the...
And then we'd vote...</i>

343
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,313
<i>Well, did you
vote for it?</i>

344
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,875
<i>Honestly, George, I can't remember.
It was 35 years ago...</i>

345
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,555
<i>So you're not sure whether or
not you supported these words.</i>

346
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,233
<i>I can tell you without
a shadow of a doubt,</i>

347
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,676
<i>I did not write
these words.</i>

348
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,434
<i>But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?</i>

349
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,071
<i>This is ludicrous.
It's ludicrous.</i>

350
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,356
That's all we need,
him laughing.

351
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,716
Nancy, get me
Dennis Mendel at the ADL.

352
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,634
<i>The Middle East is a vital
American interest. Yes.</i>

353
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,757
<i>What you think about
the Middle East is relevant.</i>

354
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,513
<i>You can look at
my voting record.</i>

355
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,876
<i>Every single vote has been
in defense of Israel.</i>

356
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,679
<i>So when did your
views change?</i>

357
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,992
<i>What I'm saying to you is...
What's important now, George,</i>

358
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,551
<i>is how I have voted while I have
represented the great state of Colorado.</i>

359
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,630
<i>I understand
that's your position.</i>

360
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,439
<i>But a lot of other people are
going to look at it and think</i>

361
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,954
<i>what you thought then
is relevant as well.</i>

362
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,191
<i>Let me ask you this, have you ever
changed our views since college?</i>

363
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,074
<i>Certainly. But I'm not the
nominee for Secretary of State.</i>

364
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,595
<i>Even if I did have
this viewpoint...</i>

365
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,995
It's golden.

366
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,559
It's a bull's-eye.

367
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,757
What were you
saying when you came in?

368
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,160
So...

369
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,596
I found a guy who was on the college
editorial staff when Kern was there.

370
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,434
This burn-out still pumping
mimeograph manifestos

371
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,954
out of a trailer park
in the Berkshires.

372
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,992
But you're not planning
on talking to him. Uh-uh.

373
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,550
Peter Russo.

374
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,514
Good.

375
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,632
Sounds like
a perfect match.

376
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,794
Dennis.

377
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,319
Any chance you're
watching Stephanopoulos?

378
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,558
You look sexy when
you're improving

379
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,597
the lives of hardworking
Pennsylvanians.

380
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,800
Is it the improving lives, or is
it these fetching sweat pants?

381
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,273
Why don't you move that
computer out of the way,

382
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,119
let me see
what that looks like?

383
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,036
Yeah, it's better
with the laptop.

384
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,316
Fuck off.

385
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,675
You're not paying
enough attention to me.

386
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,872
I pay attention to you
all day at the office.

387
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,440
Hey, you know, I don't think I've ever
seen you brush your teeth before.

388
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,880
Sure you have.
No, I don't think so.

389
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,314
I mean, I know
that you do brush.

390
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,232
But I don't think I've ever
actually witnessed it before.

391
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,716
Well, here it is
in all its glory.

392
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,830
Is that my toothbrush?

393
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,070
I don't know, is it?

394
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,116
Yes, it is.

395
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,998
You left it here.
Peter, gross.

396
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,040
Come on. We've exchanged
plenty of fluids by now.

397
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,469
No, no, no, no.

398
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,677
No. Toothpaste!
It's not toothpaste.

399
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,910
I'm rabid!

400
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,275
No!

401
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,760
Go get it.

402
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,478
I have to take this.

403
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,760
This is Russo.

404
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,593
Yeah. Right now,
it's 12:53.

405
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,913
Okay, okay, okay.

406
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,910
I have to go.

407
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,476
Is everything okay?

408
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,916
It's work stuff.

409
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,190
What kind of work stuff?

410
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,839
Congressman Wilensky.

411
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,833
He wants to go over the tax
incentive stuff we sent him.

412
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,952
Peter, it's 1:00
in the morning.

413
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,592
Hey, Peter!

414
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,073
I have meetings tomorrow.
I have a committee hearing...

415
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,550
Congress will
survive without you.

416
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,112
Address. Directions. There's
an e-ticket in your name.

417
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,431
Your flight leaves at 6:30. You
should head to the airport.

418
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,556
This is coming
from Frank?

419
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,836
No. This is coming
from no one.

420
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,957
You have the flu and
you're calling in sick.

421
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,157
What's that?
What's what?

422
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,119
Is that a hickey?

423
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,720
Are you whoring
around again?

424
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,075
No. I have a girlfriend.

425
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,159
You mean your
little office romance.

426
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,275
What do you
know about that?

427
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,716
When it comes to your life,
Peter, and what I know about it,

428
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,110
you should assume that there's
no such thing as a secret.

429
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,319
Stay in touch.

430
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,960
You call me on my cell,
never at the office.

431
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
Good luck.

432
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,153
Knock 'em dead, tiger.

433
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,429
How are we?

434
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,197
Over-tired, under-caffeinated,
but we're making progress.

435
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,760
Less than a week to go.

436
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,230
Yeah, we'll do our best.

437
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,356
You what?

438
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,516
We'll get it done.

439
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,191
And somebody open a window.
It's rancid in here.

440
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,193
That is what happens when six people
don't shower for half a week.

441
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,439
Anything you need,
other than deodorant?

442
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,273
Yeah, this performance
standards thing.

443
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,119
The teachers unions are gonna...
Leave it in.

444
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,839
But we could dilute it a bit...
I'll handle the unions.

445
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,718
What else, anything?
Conjugal visits?

446
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,198
I'll get back to work.

447
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,393
Nancy, what do
I have next?

448
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,191
Constituent calls from 2:10 to
2:35, fundraising until 3:50,

449
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,078
deputy caucus at 4:00.
The call list?

450
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,078
It's on your desk. My
briefing for the caucus?

451
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,150
Next to the call list.

452
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,230
Have you been in
the conference room?

453
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,754
Have it steam-cleaned
over the weekend.

454
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,877
In the meantime, get those poor
kids some Febreze or something.

455
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,314
It's like a petting zoo.

456
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,673
You gotta see this.

457
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,913
<i>But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?</i>

458
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,232
<i>We do not consider
the issue of</i>

459
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,357
<i>Israel and Palestine
a laughing matter.</i>

460
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,957
<i>And he calls Israel "illegal"? Well,
he's an anti-Semite and he is wrong.</i>

461
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,592
<i>We would have grave, grave concerns
about appointing such a man</i>

462
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,433
<i>our next Secretary of State.</i>

463
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,912
It's too easy.

464
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,275
Roy. Hi, my name is Peter Russo.
Congressman Russo.

465
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,953
I'd like to just
speak to you for just...

466
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,670
Sir? Either you're lying,
and you can fuck off,

467
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,071
or you're telling the truth, and
you can absolutely fuck off.

468
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,710
I saw your web site.
I'm a fan.

469
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,680
And I brought
you something.

470
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,633
Babe, put some clothes on.

471
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,915
What?

472
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,798
We got a guest.
So?

473
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,870
Hey.

474
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,030
Put some clothes on.

475
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,194
Ice or no ice?

476
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,675
No ice.

477
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,911
Good, 'cause we
don't have any.

478
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,000
Fuck. Echo! I told
you to put the...

479
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,554
It's okay.

480
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,838
I'll keep your secret
if you keep mine.

481
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,879
A congressman,
you say?

482
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,077
Right now, I'm just
a drinking companion.

483
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,800
Well all right, companion,
have yourself a drink.

484
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,595
Come on in.

485
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,799
$10,000.

486
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,799
What will
that get me?

487
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,920
I mean, I'm kinky,
but I don't know

488
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,474
if I'm the girl
you're looking for.

489
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,959
You're definitely the girl
that I'm looking for.

490
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,793
Excuse me.

491
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,076
All I want for that
money is your silence.

492
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,790
My what?

493
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,870
The guy you were
with the other night,

494
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,317
the one who was arrested.
Do you know who he was?

495
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,674
You mean
the congressman?

496
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,035
There was
no congressman.

497
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,789
There was no arrest.
None of that exists.

498
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,396
All that exists is the money sitting
right there in front of you.

499
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,833
Do you understand?

500
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,150
Yeah.

501
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,510
Good.

502
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,674
Open your mouth.

503
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,840
Last little bit's for me.

504
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,953
You're scolding me.

505
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,276
Am I?

506
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,752
You are. Silently.

507
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,634
Is it the rowing machine?

508
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,870
You tell me.

509
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,150
It's the rowing machine.

510
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,676
You haven't used it.

511
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,114
How do you know
I haven't?

512
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,429
Francis.

513
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,796
You know I don't
like to be managed.

514
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,792
I'm not trying
to manage you.

515
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,112
I just don't want to
outlive you by 25 years.

516
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,311
I must walk three miles a
day around that Capitol.

517
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,073
I'm constantly
on my feet.

518
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,159
And do you know how many
calories the brain burns?

519
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,560
I'm not worried
about your brain.

520
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,240
It's your heart
we're talking about.

521
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,720
Use the machine.

522
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,073
She's right. I should take
better care of myself.

523
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,233
But it's the principle.

524
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,312
I won't be a slave
to anybody or anything

525
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,432
you can order
with a toll-free number.

526
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,951
We share the wealth
in this republic.

527
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,955
I thought the whole
editorial team pitched in.

528
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,757
Sometimes.
Not that time, though.

529
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,480
But he must've
written some of it.

530
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,119
No, that was all me.

531
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,000
What if people
thought he wrote it.

532
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,117
Fuck that,
he's a fraud.

533
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,194
No, he's worse than a fraud,
he's a fucking farce.

534
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,999
And I'll tell you
something.

535
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,675
He used to be even more
of a maniac than I am.

536
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,271
Chemicals?
No, politics.

537
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,953
We had some
nights, man.

538
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,397
Long conversations.
Dangerous fucking notions.

539
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,880
Like what?
You name it.

540
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,397
OPEC, Pinochet, the
fucking Food Stamp Act,

541
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,314
then the motherland
sang her mating call.

542
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,915
<i>♪ Oh, say can you... ♪</i>

543
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,878
Next thing, he's
cramming for the bar

544
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,878
at Bryn Mawr and
snapping on a flag pin.

545
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,434
Does Bryn Mawr
have a law school?

546
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,230
My point is, he started goose-stepping
in the marionette parade.

547
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,915
Left, right, red, blue,
Democrat, Republican.

548
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,436
They're all dangling
from the same strings.

549
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,031
Take a sledge hammer to the whole
fucking Punch and Judy show,

550
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,516
that's what's required.

551
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,875
Thought you
were a patriot.

552
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,440
Fuck yeah,
one of the few.

553
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,040
So what's wrong
with public service?

554
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,396
Public service?
Come on, man.

555
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,676
You gotta get a grip
on who your masters are.

556
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,040
The IMF, the World Bank, the
Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

557
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,272
You bank roll their
fucking death squads.

558
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,957
It's called FEMA, it's called
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

559
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,599
NATO, border control.

560
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,558
You think Katrina
was incompetence?

561
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,592
That was highly
orchestrated negligence.

562
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,151
Look at Waco, Amnesty
International, the ACLU.

563
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,596
Smoke screens, all of them.
Blood on their hands.

564
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,199
Well, exactly.

565
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,913
You want me to
lie to the people.

566
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,799
I want you to spare the
people another hypocrite.

567
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,674
What's in it for you?

568
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,994
Poetic justice.

569
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,957
Come on,
you're one of them.

570
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,709
Can a corporate sell-out
roll a joint like this?

571
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,551
If I wanted to do
this thing,

572
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,915
how might I go
about that, precisely?

573
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,759
How did it go?

574
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,798
There were a few tears here
and there and some anger,

575
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,515
but nothing unexpected.

576
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,714
I'm going to need you to
leave us today too, Evelyn.

577
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,274
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,030
I just can't have any doubt
about the direction I'm taking.

579
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,239
You just had me fire 18 people.
I know.

580
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,393
I sat across from
them in this room,

581
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,036
and I had to tell each
and every one... I know.

582
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,070
I am 59 years old.
Nobody hires anybody my age.

583
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,311
I will write you any kind
of recommendation...

584
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,631
To do what?
Bag groceries?

585
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,120
Come on, what am I supposed
to tell my daughter?

586
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,032
I'm sorry,
Evelyn, I truly...

587
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,396
No, you're not.
You don't give a fuck.

588
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,235
Eighteen people, Claire.

589
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,274
Nineteen if
you count me.

590
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,917
I have to...

591
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,951
I have to call
my daughter.

592
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,910
I know today has been tough.

593
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,317
A lot of your
colleagues have left,

594
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,877
and I owe you
an explanation.

595
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,151
Many of those who
left us today helped

596
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,431
build the CWI
from the ground up,

597
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,914
and I'm grateful to them.

598
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,029
But it is time
for us to evolve,

599
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,997
and to accomplish this,
we had to make hard choices

600
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,558
and bring in new people.

601
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,233
That's what today was about.

602
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,272
You have any questions,
my door is always open.

603
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,272
I'm all good for
National and Metro.

604
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,357
We've got space for
Political if we need it.

605
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,557
Janine? Anything new
on Michael Kern?

606
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,394
The White House
is dodging.

607
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,958
You can't get
anyone on record?

608
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,920
Not just me. They're shutting all
of us down in the briefings.

609
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,674
No one is giving an inch,
even on background.

610
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,319
In the meantime, I'm
working on a feature about

611
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,357
the administration's
foreign policy agenda,

612
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,473
how it shifted from the start of the
campaign, increased DOD spending...

613
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,596
We see you, Zoe.

614
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,991
I can link Kern directly
to the Williams editorial.

615
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,396
What? I've got a guy
named Roy Kapeniak,

616
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,392
who was on the editorial
staff when Kern was there.

617
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,199
Hey, Twitter-twat. WTF?

618
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,999
Wait, wait, wait.
Roy what?

619
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,077
Kapeniak.
A classmate of Kern's.

620
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,074
I have him on record saying Kern
wrote every word of the editorial.

621
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,391
Let's move this into
my office. Zoe, Lucas.

622
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,790
Janine!

623
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,197
Let me once and for all
say this definitively.

624
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,556
I didn't author
that editorial.

625
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,872
Not a single sentence,
word, comma or period.

626
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,078
If memory serves me, it was
Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

627
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,437
<i>Why on earth he's trying to
claim that I did is beyond me.</i>

628
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,031
<i>Let me further say that I am a strong
supporter of the state of Israel.</i>

629
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,358
<i>As the most stable country in the
region and our strongest ally...</i>

630
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,358
It's Frank Underwood
for Cathy.

631
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,400
<i>...in any peace process.</i>

632
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,680
<i>Because without the stability of
Israel, there can be no Palestine.</i>

633
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,472
CNN, right now.

634
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,391
<i>"Without Israel there
can be no Palestine"?</i>

635
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,914
I've got it on.

636
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,799
<i>I would remind Senator Kern
that there was a Palestine</i>

637
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,553
<i>long before
there was an Israel.</i>

638
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,678
<i>His comments are not only
ignorant, they are racist.</i>

639
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,359
Get ready, Cathy. Things are
about to move very quickly.

640
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,757
Okay, I'm ready.

641
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,349
Hey. I...

642
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,715
Peter.

643
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
Not now.

644
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,714
Stop! Hey, hey,
where have you been?

645
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,238
God, you're fucking high.
No, I...

646
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,959
Yes, you are,
look at your eyes.

647
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,396
Please, just lay off.

648
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,555
You promised me
it wouldn't be like this.

649
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,910
Cancel whatever I have
for the rest of the day.

650
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,915
Kern is out.

651
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,874
They're tossing him?

652
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,917
Technically, he'll
withdraw himself, but yes.

653
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,679
Can I say, "A source close
to the White House"?

654
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,195
No. You let this story
play out on its own time.

655
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,760
They'll announce
in the morning.

656
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,878
I'm sorry, if not that, what
story are we talking about?

657
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,192
Catherine Durant.
As soon as Kern withdraws,

658
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,511
you say she'll
be the replacement.

659
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,670
Is that true?

660
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,916
It will be after
you write it.

661
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,832
Roy Kapeniak was you.

662
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,152
You might very well think that.
I couldn't possibly comment.

663
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,072
You found him.
You had him call me...

664
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,994
Kapeniak and Kern were
appetizers, Ms. Barnes.

665
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,276
Catherine Durant
is the meal.

666
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,832
Say that name. "Catherine
Durant." Say it over and over.

667
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,515
Tomorrow afternoon,
write it down.

668
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,115
Then watch that name
come out of the mouth

669
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,795
of the President of
the United States.

670
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,951
This is where
we get to create.

671
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,997
Don't miss your train, Ms. Barnes.
It's the last one tonight.

672
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,197
<i>Zoe Barnes of the</i> Washington
Herald <i>now reporting,</i>

683
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,673
<i>...place our faith
in her, knowing that</i>

684
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,473
<i>we have a responsible,
experienced,</i>

685
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,870
<i>brilliant woman representing
our interests abroad.</i>

686
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,038
<i>...middle of the road, team
player, strong on defense.</i>

687
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,839
<i>And if there's
a woman that can work</i>

688
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,719
<i>with the Joint Chiefs,
she's the one.</i>

689
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,069
<i>Durant is the way to go,
it's a no-brainer.</i>

690
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,795
<i>The President should stop this
pageant and simply make the call.</i>

691
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,231
<i>Why are we still talking about if
they're going to nominate Durant?</i>

692
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,198
<i>Why don't they
just do it already</i>

693
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,238
<i>so we can all stop
talking about ifs</i>

694
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,879
<i>and start talking
about when and what</i>

695
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,390
<i>and how Durant's going
to shape our foreign policy.</i>

696
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,232
So, history?

697
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,756
History.

698
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,317
I'm very impressed, Frank.

699
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,631
Good. With your go-ahead,
I'll start the mark-up.

700
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,234
Have Birch and
Rasmussen seen this?

701
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,391
Not yet, I wanted you to be
the first to have a look.

702
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,153
I'll schedule a time for you
to fill in the President.

703
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,312
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda.
You should do that.

704
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,274
Thank you, Frank. My pleasure.
Thank you.

705
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,832
I so apologize
for everything...

706
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,752
No, no, no.
That's not necessary.

707
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,079
Now for
the real meeting.

708
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,514
So, what is happening
with Michael Kern?

709
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,313
It's a total nightmare.

710
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,033
Do you know who you're
going to tap next?

711
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,756
Frank, we still need
you in the House...

712
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,194
No, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

713
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,350
We've got
our education bill.

714
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,193
I was just curious.

715
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,192
Somehow, the rumor
is flying around that

716
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,198
we're going to
nominate Catherine Durant.

717
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,600
I'm sure you've noticed.

718
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,034
Is the rumor true?

719
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,520
Well, we weren't
considering her at first,

720
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,592
but the President asked
me to have her vetted,

721
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,792
in case we
want to go that route.

722
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,109
Interesting.

723
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,350
What do you think?

724
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,719
Well, she wouldn't
be my first choice...

725
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,154
Who would be
your first choice?

726
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,675
She campaigned hard against
us in the primaries.

727
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,989
That's my reservation.

728
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,197
But you'd show yourself
above party politics,

729
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,397
and I know she'd work
all the harder for it.

730
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,040
Decent experience.
Respect across the aisle...

731
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,112
So you think we can
seriously consider her?

732
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,795
It's not the worst idea
in the world.

733
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,831
Where are you
getting this shit?

734
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,593
What?
Your stories.

735
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,912
I was just...
Who are you fucking?

736
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,992
Nobody.
Oh, come on.

737
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,879
You're a Metro scrub,
and now look at you.

738
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,039
You'd have to be fucking
somebody important.

739
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,918
I'm just doing my job,
Janine. Excuse me.

740
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,631
All right.
One sec. Okay.

741
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,990
Is this your
first remote?

742
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,190
Yeah, it's my first time.

743
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,953
Right into the camera.

744
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,311
Don't shift in your seat,
and there's no reason

745
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,120
to speak above a conversational
volume, the mic will pick you up.

746
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,190
You all ready?
Yeah.

747
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,033
All right,
don't forget to breathe.

748
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,280
Five, four, three...

749
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,438
<i>We'd like to welcome Zoe Barnes
from the</i> Washington Herald.

750
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,351
<i>Zoe, thank you
for joining us.</i>

751
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,554
I am very glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

752
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,791
<i>You broke the education
bill, the Kern editorial</i>

753
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,990
<i>and now Durant.</i>

754
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,959
I'm just thrilled to be
reporting news that matters.

755
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,554
And it's truly
been a team effort.

756
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,274
Everyone at
the <i>Herald</i> pitched in.

757
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,072
But yes,
a lot of firsts.

758
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,716
First national story,
first...

759
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,314
Thank you.

760
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,954
Calling it a night.

761
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,514
See you tomorrow, sir.

762
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,720
<i>But yes,
a lot of firsts.</i>

763
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,591
<i>First national story,
first front page by-line,</i>

764
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,276
<i>first TV interview...</i>

765
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,955
<i>I would wave to my mom, but the camera
man said not to shift in my seat.</i>

766
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,032
What a roller coaster.

767
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,593
It really is too bad.
Kern is a good man.

768
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,634
And now Catherine Durant.

769
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,633
Yes. Right place,
right time, I suppose.

770
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,280
We like her,
don't we?

771
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,675
Very much.

772
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,956
The question is does she like
SanCorp as much as we like her?

773
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,390
I would say that
that is a very good bet.

774
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,199
But then again,
I'm not a betting man.

775
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,873
No, you always
like a sure thing.

776
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,957
When it avails itself.
Goodnight, Remy.

777
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,918
Goodnight, Frank.
See you around.

778
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,151
Hopefully less
and less now.

779
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,072
Oh, no, I charged the wrong thing.
What did you have again?

780
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,719
Medium decaf latte.

781
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,991
Med, latt, dec...

782
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,800
I don't know how to
get it to go back.

783
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,479
This one
and this one.

784
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,870
This one?

785
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,036
No. Let me do it.

786
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,114
I'll have to ask you
to stay back, Congressman.

787
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,236
What's going on?

788
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,879
Some guy was trying
to get into the building.

789
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,919
When we said no, he started
tearing his clothes off.

790
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,553
Nobody can hear you.
Nobody cares about you.

791
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,800
Nothing will
come of this.

792
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,951
Why don't you let these nice
gentlemen take you home?

793
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,029
Cover him up.
It's cold out here.

794
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,914
You heard the congressman.
Cover him up.

795
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,114
Francis?
