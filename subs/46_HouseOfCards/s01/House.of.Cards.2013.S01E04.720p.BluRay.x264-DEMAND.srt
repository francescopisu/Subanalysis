1
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,794
It's there
for leverage,

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,917
so that we can lock down
performance standards.

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,673
You don't toss
around their right

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,513
to collective bargaining
like a poker chip.

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,034
If we don't,
they won't budge.

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,918
Has Marty Spinella
seen this?

7
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,394
Not in the version
I showed him.

8
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,113
So you lied to his face? No.

9
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,750
I revised the parameters
of my promise.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,990
Which is lying.

11
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,110
Which is politics.

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,471
The sort you're
well-versed in, Bob.

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,954
Here's some
politics for you.

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,157
I allow this to
go to the floor,

15
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,799
I get murdered
next election.

16
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,878
This is coming
from the President.

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,953
Last time I checked, I was
still a Democrat, Frank,

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,751
and you were, too. Are you
telling me the President isn't?

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,469
Because he's acting a hell
of a lot like a Republican.

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,234
I thought Bob
was on our team.

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,716
Just sit him down with the President.
Ten minutes.

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,553
We won't touch
collective bargaining.

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,279
Are you interested
in my advice on this,

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,714
or you just want me to
deliver the message?

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,598
I'm always interested
in your advice, Frank.

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,275
Birch is right. You're going
to burn a lot of bridges.

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,635
The President should
at least sit down with him

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,080
and let him
make his case.

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,995
You tell Bob I'm happy to schedule
a meeting with the President

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,117
once he's set a date to put
this bill on the floor.

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,834
The President
can fuck himself.

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,276
This is the platform.
It's what he ran on.

33
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,593
I don't give a shit what he ran on.
He can't steamroll the House.

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
And don't forget, you work
for me, Frank, not him.

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,079
If he wants something
on the floor,

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,839
he's gonna have to
talk to me directly.

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,594
I know you take a lot of
pride in your manhood, Bob,

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,399
and it's impressive,

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,439
but as big as it is, Linda can
still shut the door on it.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,000
Tell Vasquez
the bill is dead.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,318
That's not the first time
he's pulled that stunt on me.

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,516
Probably should
have held my tongue,

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,035
but I just couldn't resist the
chance to see him shrivel.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,910
Good morning.

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,030
Frank.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,595
Mr. President.

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,518
Linda.

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,832
Let's strike the anti-collective
bargaining provision from the bill.

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,956
Linda and I have
talked it over,

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,030
and I think
she's right on this.

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,952
Tell Bob he can come by
tomorrow afternoon.

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,713
Sir, respectfully,
I do not think

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,559
you should give
him the satisfaction.

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,150
Well, give me a reason.

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,515
Makes us appear weak.

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,355
This is an opportunity for you
to establish your supremacy.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,916
We should seize it.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,229
But without
Birch's cooperation,

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,555
we're fighting
an uphill battle

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,791
before we even get the bill to the floor.
Frank, we discussed this.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,633
Sir, if you
give in now,

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,112
Birch will walk all over you
for the next four years.

63
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,916
I can get this bill on the House floor as is.
I promise you.

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,474
All right, Frank.
Show me what you can do.

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,550
Thank you,
Mr. President.

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,549
That was her trying to
take credit for my idea.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,235
Advice she wouldn't take
from me. Unacceptable.

68
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,879
I will not allow
her to sell my goods

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,559
when she cuts me
out of the profits.

70
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,394
I specifically told
her no interviews.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,756
She disobeyed me,
not just once.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,433
<i>At least eight
times in the past month.</i>

73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,715
She stays, Tom.

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,076
She has no respect for
my authority, Margaret.

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,112
I said she stays.

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,830
There are rules. There's
a way of doing things.

77
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,240
<i>If I have a reporter
who won't listen...</i>

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,119
Two freshmen girls are moving
into their dorm room together.

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,238
One of them's from Georgia, one
of them's from Connecticut.

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,313
Girl from Connecticut's helping
her mother put up curtains.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,076
Girl from Georgia turns to them and says, "Hi.
Where y'all from?"

82
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,353
<i>Girl from Connecticut says,
"We're from a place</i>

83
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,035
<i>"where we know not to end a
sentence with a preposition."</i>

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,716
Girl from Georgia says,
"Beg my pardon.

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,234
"Where y'all from...

86
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,356
"Cunt?"

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,233
<i>You heard that one before?</i>

88
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,954
A version of it.
With softer language.

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,112
Tom, we don't need people
who follow the rules.

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
We need people
with personality.

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,880
<i>We want Zoe's face,
her energy.</i>

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,317
We want to get her on
TV as much as possible.

93
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,631
<i>It helps us cut
through the noise.</i>

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,518
<i>See what I'm saying?</i>

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,996
I hear you, Margaret.

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,194
Thank you, Tom.

97
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,514
Thank you.

98
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,873
Come in.

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,996
Oh, I thought...

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,794
I wanted to say
hi to Evelyn.

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,516
Evelyn?

102
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,233
This was her office.

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,194
I don't think she
works here anymore.

104
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,955
Oh.
Gillian Cole.

105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,639
I came on board
a couple weeks ago.

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,190
Gillian. WorldWell.

107
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,799
Yeah. I've heard great things.

108
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,390
Remy Danton.

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,120
You work with Claire?

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,190
In a way.

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,151
Hello, Remy.
Claire.

112
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,670
I see you've
met Gillian.

113
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,916
Yes, just now.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,072
She's doing fantastic work
for us, as you can see.

115
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,313
Red is completed wells,
green, potential sites,

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,110
yellow, approved sites, and blue
are the filtration centers.

117
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,670
Nice. So you
liking it here?

118
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,952
Yeah. My staff
and I are loving it.

119
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,190
Claire's opened
a lot of doors for us.

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,630
Sounds like Claire.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,758
Shall we head
to my office?

122
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,998
Gillian, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

123
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,070
What happened?

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,956
Things got complicated.

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,874
SanCorp was in
a difficult situation.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,879
I would have thought you'd step
up when things were difficult,

127
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,560
not hold the
donation hostage.

128
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,473
Well, things are
less complicated now.

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,550
The donation is
back on the table.

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,156
I had to fire
half my staff.

131
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,276
Now you can
hire them back.

132
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,391
SanCorp is prepared to double
its initial commitment.

133
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,480
$1.5 million,
lump sum, this quarter.

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,392
Why? Public relations.
Same as before.

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,439
And what do they
want from Francis?

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,594
Things are square with Frank.
We're only talking about the CWI.

137
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,670
But why double it?

138
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,955
Because I said
they should.

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,072
The more they give,
the more you can do.

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,152
The more you can do,
the better they look.

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,432
And that's why they hired Glendon
Hill, to make them look good.

142
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,751
And they also hired you to
get traction in Congress.

143
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,830
Not in this case.

144
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,993
We want a long-term
partnership, Claire.

145
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,153
This is an investment
in the future.

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,074
We're not attaching strings.

147
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,396
I'll think about it.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,114
They'd really love to
move quickly on this.

149
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,876
I said I'll
think about it.

150
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,194
Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.
I need it in writing.

151
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,794
And with more than
an hour's notice.

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,038
Yeah, I know that, but you have
to understand we have a plan.

153
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,158
We have a way that we do
this, and when you...

154
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,516
Okay.

155
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,679
Fine.

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,231
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

157
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,794
Madeleine has decided to have a
spur-of-the-moment trip to Orlando

158
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,314
with her latest
eHarmony catch.

159
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,558
No heads-up, no warning.
The kids?

160
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,711
They get out of
school at 2:30.

161
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,917
I can do the
Shipbuilder's meeting.

162
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,112
You sure? Yeah, it's just
their public affairs team.

163
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,192
I'll brief you, and then you
can call them tomorrow.

164
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,993
Go get your kids.
Mmm.

165
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,996
Hey.

166
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,672
Remy came by this morning.
To the office.

167
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,989
What does he want?

168
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,355
The donation's
back on the table.

169
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,239
They've doubled
it to $1.5 million.

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,510
You said no, right?

171
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,750
I didn't.

172
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,920
He doesn't want anything
from you, Francis.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,673
Come on, Claire.
You know better than that.

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,633
I specifically asked.

175
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,595
Maybe not right now, but look, I
invented this guy, all right?

176
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,710
It's a slippery slope.

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,790
Think of what I can
do with this money.

178
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,630
I can hire back
the people I let go.

179
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,234
I can help
accelerate the funding

180
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,919
for the projects that
Gillian has brought in.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,673
Let's find another
way to raise the money.

182
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,399
But it's right
there at my feet.

183
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,955
Claire, I have too much
on my plate right now.

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,037
I can't have SanCorp breathing
down my neck again.

185
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,913
I can't have Remy...

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,036
Look, it is Remy.

187
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,313
He knows me too well.
It's dangerous.

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,317
Look at the
bigger picture here.

189
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,710
I'm asking.

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,229
No. You're not.

191
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,836
Claire.

192
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,240
I'll tell you
what I told him.

193
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,752
Which was?
I'll think about it.

194
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,794
I know there's
been some tension,

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,520
and I'm probably more
to blame than you are.

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
But I'd like to
put that behind us.

197
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,717
Zoe, you're going to be our new
White House correspondent.

198
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,236
What about Janine?

199
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,399
I promoted her to
Midwest Bureau Chief.

200
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,230
She's okay with that? She wants
to give up the White House?

201
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,993
It's the decision
I've made.

202
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,436
It's just that Janine
has so much experience.

203
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,439
I thought you'd be
more excited about this.

204
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,594
I'm sorry. I just thought you brought
me in here to... I don't know.

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,319
To fire you.
Maybe.

206
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,395
Water under the bridge.

207
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,350
We're starting over.

208
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,680
So are you ready
to take this on?

209
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,676
Can I think about it?

210
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,393
People usually don't
have to think about it

211
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,034
when they're offered
the White House, Zoe.

212
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,190
Just a day or two.

213
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,391
Janine is booked for a
flight to Chicago on Friday.

214
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,676
I'll let you know before then.
I just need to...

215
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,312
Thank you.
Thank you, Tom.

216
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,073
David Rasmussen is
the majority leader,

217
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,919
which means he's
one step above me

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,152
and one below Birch, which is akin
to being between a very hungry wolf

219
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,680
and a very
quarrelsome sheep.

220
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,674
Let's see if he stays with
the herd or joins the pack.

221
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,592
David. You mind
if I join you?

222
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,195
Please. A salad, huh?

223
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,237
Yes. I'm trying to take
better care of myself.

224
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,555
Good man. Diet?

225
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,711
Diet, exercise,
everything.

226
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,991
You ought to take better
care of yourself, too.

227
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,356
Well, then they should stop
serving such good pizza.

228
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,319
I'm not talking
about the food.

229
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,039
I'm talking about Birch.

230
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,034
You are never
going to be Speaker

231
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,713
unless you do
something about it.

232
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,593
I'm very satisfied
where I am.

233
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,672
Oh, come on.
For the time being, yeah.

234
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,956
Time being never.

235
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,759
The only way
you become Speaker

236
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,519
is if Birch loses his
district or retires,

237
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,630
neither of which
is going to happen

238
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
before you and
I have dentures.

239
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,197
I'm not happy where this
conversation is going, Frank.

240
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,671
If you want it, and I know
you do, there's a way.

241
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,680
Okay. Right.
I can't...

242
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,355
All you need is a simple majority.
218 votes.

243
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,796
We're going to get at
least 205 out of the GOP,

244
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,439
and after that, all you
need is 13 Democrats.

245
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,119
You and I make two.

246
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,276
Are you out
of your mind?

247
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,233
Just consider it
for a moment.

248
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,154
You want to collude
with the Republicans?

249
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,597
I don't want to, but I would if you
become Speaker in the process.

250
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,796
Never been done before.

251
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,593
There's a first
time for everything.

252
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,996
This is ridiculous.

253
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,514
The Republicans
would love a chance

254
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,154
to knock Bob
down a peg or two.

255
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,556
And you want
to help them?

256
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,950
I want to help us.

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,276
Bob will not play ball
with the White House.

258
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,592
Now, you're a reasonable
man, David, and he's not.

259
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,437
You know what I am?

260
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,233
I'm a discreet man.

261
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,510
You're lucky for that.

262
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,353
I'm not going to
mention this to Bob,

263
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,278
but if you ever
bring it up again,

264
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,079
I won't have a choice.

265
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,400
Looks like he
opted for the herd.

266
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,876
Claire. I'd like to put an
order for the water filters

267
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,555
and the well-digging equipment
for the South Sudan project.

268
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,869
Can we talk
about the budget?

269
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,599
How much?
$200,000.

270
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,229
For one project?

271
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,310
I know it's a lot,

272
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,074
but it'll be our flagship
project in Africa,

273
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,119
and we would be the first organization
there to work on this scale.

274
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,672
I'd like to go over
the specifics first.

275
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,830
I have the budget
right here.

276
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,798
Let me just grab my messages,
and then I'll come in to you.

277
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,315
Okay. I'll be
in my office.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,719
Any calls
while I was out?

279
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,918
They're on the desk,
and this came by messenger.

280
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,392
Adam. It's Claire.

281
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,196
Yes. I know. It has.

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,640
No reason. I was just
thinking about you.

283
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,273
You're right. It is a lie.
I do have a reason.

284
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,238
I need to use you.

285
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,279
The White House is where news goes to die.
Everything's canned.

286
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,113
These perfectly
prepared statements...

287
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
It's a prestigious
job, Zoe.

288
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,390
Used to be, when I was in ninth grade.
Now it's a graveyard.

289
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,358
The only halfway
interesting thing they do

290
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,438
is throw a big dinner
party once a year

291
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,193
where they pat
themselves on the back

292
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,999
and rub shoulders
with movie stars.

293
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,150
Who needs that?

294
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,356
Every day since
you started here,

295
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,113
you've begged me to move you
up, and now suddenly...

296
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,119
My goal in life is not to
climb up <i>The Herald's</i> ladder

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,879
one rung at a time until
I've got my own stationery.

298
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,916
Some of us value a career
at a paper like this.

299
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,713
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for that to come off...

300
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,832
Well, it did, and you skipped
a few rungs, by the way.

301
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,516
Do what you
want to do, Zoe,

302
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,954
but if you want me to
be your cheerleader

303
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,679
and say, "Yeah, turn
it down," I won't.

304
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,716
I would have killed for that
job when I first started here.

305
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,196
Put Fichner in the
"leaning yes" column.

306
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,796
Don't you think
he's a neutral?

307
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,990
He hates Birch.

308
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,878
Yeah, but he owes Birch for the
Ways and Means appointment.

309
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,713
Put him in "neutral."
Who else?

310
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,633
Ramirez as a neutral?

311
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,070
Oh, this list
is so shaky.

312
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,520
Any one of them
leaks it to Bob...

313
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,159
No, what we need
is one name.

314
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,599
One person who
can deliver 12.

315
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,510
The Black Caucus.

316
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,469
Womack.

317
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,597
What can we offer him?
What does he need?

318
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,200
Let me pull up his file.

319
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,990
Here we go.

320
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,152
McCuddin Airforce base employs
3,000 people in his district.

321
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,274
It's on the DOD's
chopping block this year.

322
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,510
Who do we know on
the BRAC commission?

323
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,439
That's dangerous.

324
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,433
The trail leads back to us trying
to influence the DOD or the BRAC.

325
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,557
No, no, no. What we do is
we close another base.

326
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,472
We leave enough money
in the DOD's budget

327
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,199
to keep Womack's
base off the list.

328
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,794
What we need...

329
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,994
Is someone we own.

330
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,318
Dad, I'm hungry.

331
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,436
Coming, buddy.

332
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,956
Here we go.

333
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,159
With cheese.
Without cheese.

334
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,520
Umm, Dad?

335
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,630
Yeah.

336
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,638
That looks
pretty disgusting.

337
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,757
Yeah, it looks disgusting.

338
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,313
It's not how it looks,
it's how it tastes.

339
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,359
And a fork
would be nice.

340
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,520
Shit. Okay. Hold on.

341
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,830
Hello.

342
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,030
<i>Good evening,
Mr. Russo.</i>

343
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,316
<i>There's a Mr. Underwood
here to see you.</i>

344
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,830
Uh...

345
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,910
Okay. Send him up.

346
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,310
Hi, there.

347
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,357
Hi.
Hi.

348
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,359
This is Kevin,
this is Sarah.

349
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,238
Hi. I'm Frank.
Nice to meet you both.

350
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,159
Do you work with Dad?
I do.

351
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,993
Congressman Underwood
is Daddy's boss.

352
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,760
I thought you
didn't have a boss.

353
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,390
Everybody has a boss,
sweetheart, even Congressmen.

354
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,079
Why don't you take your dinner
and go into the bedroom?

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,998
But I wanted to watch TV.
Go now.

356
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,877
Cute kids. Yeah, I like them.
Can I get you a drink?

357
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,758
No, I won't
be here long.

358
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,991
Yeah. Have a seat.

359
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,234
Thank you.
Is that a PS Vita?

360
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,310
Uh...

361
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,918
Which games
does he have?

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,071
All of them.
I have a console at home.

363
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,876
I play sometimes to relax. I ought
to get one of these for the car.

364
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,073
So, Peter, we need to close the
shipyard in your district.

365
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,920
The BRAC hearing is tomorrow. You
won't put up your usual fight.

366
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,157
You have zero
testimony to add.

367
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,198
I can't do that.
Yes, you can, Peter.

368
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,918
I spent months
on that testimony.

369
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,872
I lobbied the commission.
My entire office...

370
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,519
I'm sure you've
done splendid work,

371
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,398
but unfortunately, it
can't come to fruition.

372
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,398
Why?
Politics.

373
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,472
There's forces bigger than
either of us at play here.

374
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,035
It's 12,000 jobs.

375
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,315
I know.
It's a shame.

376
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,517
Keeping that shipyard open
is what got me elected.

377
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,030
Those people
are my friends.

378
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,112
I'm not here to
debate this, Peter.

379
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,511
The base will close.

380
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,671
The only question is, will
you make it a swift death

381
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,160
or a painful one?

382
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,671
No way. I won't
sit on my hands.

383
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,759
I sympathize that this is
gonna be difficult for you.

384
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,559
And I don't
know how yet,

385
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,871
but I will make it
up to you, Peter.

386
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,718
I'm a powerful friend
to have right now,

387
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,473
perhaps your
only friend,

388
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,271
so don't defy me.

389
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Love of family.

390
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,518
Most politicians are permanently
chained to that slogan.

391
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,995
Family values.

392
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,239
But when you cozy up to
hookers and I find out,

393
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,835
I will make that
hypocrisy hurt.

394
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,593
Did you get the
present I sent you?

395
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,029
You wouldn't really
call it a present.

396
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,238
Well, more of a
gentle reminder, maybe.

397
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,594
More heavy-handed than
gentle, which surprised me.

398
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,637
It's not really
your style, Francis.

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,198
But, yes. I got it.

400
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,670
I like that one.

401
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,080
I do, too.

402
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,475
But the first
one's better.

403
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,676
You think?

404
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,635
Something special tomorrow?

405
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,917
Adam Galloway's coming
down from New York.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,990
What for?

407
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,833
Because I need some
of his photographs

408
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,038
for the silent auction
at the gala next month.

409
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,110
You speak to Remy yet?

410
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,070
I haven't.

411
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,191
If you want to look inviting,
wear the black one.

412
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,919
Hello.

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,990
Oh...

414
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,676
Okay. Great. Thanks.

415
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,400
Adam?

416
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,519
How is it the world
keeps spinning

417
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,313
and you manage to
stay ahead of it?

418
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,950
David's on board
with this?

419
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,196
It was his idea.

420
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,316
Then why
isn't he here?

421
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,551
Well, we have to be careful
until it's a done deal.

422
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,832
I don't know, Frank.
Think about it, Terry.

423
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,799
You could become the first
African-American majority leader

424
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,360
in the United States
Congress.

425
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,080
Let's make
some history.

426
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,439
You don't care
about history.

427
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,711
You just wanted me because
I can round up the votes.

428
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,395
I need the votes, and I
do care about history,

429
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,837
but most importantly, Terry,
you know how to lead.

430
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,117
You're the head of the
Black Caucus for a reason.

431
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,959
So David becomes speaker,
I become majority leader...

432
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,520
And I stay on as Whip.

433
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,111
Why don't you want majority
leader for yourself?

434
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,839
I'm satisfied where I am.

435
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,311
Maybe one day, when you become
Speaker, you'll bump me up.

436
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,278
This is the sort of thing
that there's no turning back.

437
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,513
I can throw a
cherry on top.

438
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,960
McCuddin stays open.

439
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,870
How?

440
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,394
You don't want
to know how.

441
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,917
You just want the headline when you
keep 3,000 jobs in your district.

442
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,713
12 votes?
12 votes.

443
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,632
I can get you 10,
probably 11.

444
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,959
It's so refreshing
to work with someone

445
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,599
who will throw a saddle
on a gift horse

446
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,955
rather than look
it in the mouth.

447
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,070
That's nice.

448
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,710
Wow.

449
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,358
I found her in
a village outside Amravati.

450
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,079
Her name was Tyala.

451
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,231
She died three weeks
after I took that picture.

452
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,993
Oh, that's awful.

453
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,719
You can have
them all if you like.

454
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,678
I love your hair short.

455
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,156
You have plans tonight?

456
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,030
No.

457
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,316
Is Frank
expecting you home?

458
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,437
I'm sure he'll
be home late.

459
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,510
Get dinner with me.

460
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,870
What time is your train?

461
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,074
I don't book
round-trip tickets.

462
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,352
It's going to be a while
before I can leave.

463
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,755
What time will
you be done?

464
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,552
Probably around 8:00.

465
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,918
I'll pick a place,
let you know.

466
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,760
Ah, David.

467
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,000
How are you, Joe?

468
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,792
I'm behind you.
Let's do this.

469
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,950
Do what?

470
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,599
Keep your cards close.
I like that.

471
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,034
Hi. Yeah.
This is room 1214.

472
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,478
I'd like a bottle of
the Weinbach, please.

473
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,399
Yeah. Actually, could you
make that two bottles?

474
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,879
Thank you.

475
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,959
Sit down. You're
making me nervous.

476
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,475
You still smoke?
From time to time, yes.

477
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,157
I quit. These are
an illusion.

478
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,996
You want?

479
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,196
Sure.

480
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,039
What?

481
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,550
Not now.

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,229
Okay.

483
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,234
I should go.

484
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,116
I just...
assumed...

485
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,310
I know.

486
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,119
We can't start
this again.

487
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,556
When I end something,
I end it.

488
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,432
So why'd you have me come all
the way down from New York?

489
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,030
It was a mistake.

490
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,920
I'm sorry, Adam. I should've
kept it business.

491
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,713
Side of you
I like the least.

492
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,192
There are no
mistakes, Claire.

493
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,638
Hi.
Hello.

494
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,797
More wine?
Mmm-hmm.

495
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,237
How was your day?

496
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,917
Good.
Adam well?

497
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,760
He is.

498
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,120
We just had dinner.

499
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,550
Hmm.

500
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,875
I emailed Remy
on the way home.

501
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,792
I told him I'm not
taking the money.

502
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,034
Thank you. I appreciate
that this was not easy.

503
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,112
Well, we don't
like easy, do we?

504
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,557
All the evidence
would suggest it.

505
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,230
Is it all right
if the Holburns

506
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,640
come over for
dinner Wednesday night?

507
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,951
I want Felicity to buy
some tables for the gala.

508
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,475
Yeah, of course.

509
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,917
I'm going to need Congressmen
and senators there.

510
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,116
You need to
call in favors.

511
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,356
Done.

512
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,954
Not a few, a lot.

513
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,430
I'll start making
calls in the morning.

514
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,997
Adam donated
10 photographs.

515
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,231
That was generous
of him.

516
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,438
He's staying
at the Mandarin.

517
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,955
And you?

518
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,111
Here.

519
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,838
<i>But the Proving
Ground's importance</i>

520
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,754
<i>stems far beyond its
strategic geographic value.</i>

521
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,955
<i>APG's research and development
of military materiel</i>

522
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,397
<i>is central to our nation's
counter-terrorism efforts.</i>

523
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,036
<i>The base houses research laboratories
for preventative medicine</i>

524
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,875
<i>as well as a wide variety of training
grounds for military personnel.</i>

525
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,279
<i>APG is also a job creator.</i>

526
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,440
<i>It provides $400 million
in payroll annually,</i>

527
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,639
<i>and nearly $500 million
in contracts.</i>

528
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,919
<i>Thank you for the opportunity
to testify before you today.</i>

529
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,238
<i>Any questions for the
Congresswoman from Maryland?</i>

530
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,152
No.

531
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,472
<i>Those in favor of removing
the Aberdeen Proving Ground</i>

532
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,472
<i>from the list of closures?</i>

533
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,829
<i>Aye.
Aye.</i>

534
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,639
<i>So noted and removed.</i>

535
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,154
<i>Okay, we'll next consider the
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.</i>

536
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,755
<i>Would the congressman from
Pennsylvania's first district</i>

537
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,593
<i>like to offer testimony?</i>

538
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,232
I have no testimony to offer.

539
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,276
Yeah, but the difference
that we're gonna make...

540
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,876
Uh, Terry, let me
call you right back.

541
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,640
Terry Womack?

542
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,710
Possibly.

543
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,519
I've had three members of
the Black Caucus tell me

544
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,960
they're backing my
play for the speakership.

545
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,560
Interesting.
I have a sense

546
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,916
you've been disseminating
some misinformation.

547
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,196
No. I'm afraid it's you
who are misinformed, David.

548
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,159
You don't have three members backing you.
You have 10.

549
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,475
I made it very clear I didn't
want any part of this.

550
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,994
Yes, you made it
crystal clear.

551
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,355
Then why are you
telling people?

552
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,636
Because they don't know
you made it crystal clear.

553
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,155
I have to go to
Bob with this.

554
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,118
He'll think you
organized a coup,

555
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,840
got cold feet, and are
making me the scapegoat.

556
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,311
David, if I pick up
this phone right now

557
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,675
and leak this story,

558
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,915
Bob will have no
choice but to drop you,

559
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,038
even if he believes
your version of events.

560
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,036
You wanna take a seat?

561
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,919
Ah, Freddy?
Yeah, Frank?

562
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,560
You better make
it a half order.

563
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,835
I got a big
dinner tonight.

564
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,355
Sure thing.

565
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,394
Slaw? Uh-huh. You got it.
Always.

566
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,520
Here you go.

567
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,270
So, what's the latest?

568
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,192
You know, Frank.
Same old shit.

569
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,599
Almost got killed
last weekend.

570
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,350
Here?
No.

571
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,080
State fair
down in Virginia.

572
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,636
Me and my brother hauling
this smoker down there,

573
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,874
and this fucking minivan
had a fridge strapped on top.

574
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,597
A fridge strapped on
top of a minivan, Frank.

575
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,155
That's stupid. Well, that
fridge slipped loose.

576
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,838
Boom! Right in front of us. I had to
swerve to the left. Barely missed it.

577
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,991
But now that smoker
is fishtailing,

578
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,191
almost hit a hatchback
in the next lane.

579
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,352
Swerved to the right.
Barely missed that, too.

580
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,557
Jesus.
Oh, man, it was real.

581
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,752
But, you know, that's
why God gave us reflexes.

582
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,474
So we can move
the fuck out of the way

583
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,954
when a fridge
come out of nowhere.

584
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,635
How are them ribs?

585
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,989
You know
how they are.

586
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,714
You know I like
to hear it.

587
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,320
Perfection, Freddy.

588
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,750
Perfection.

589
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,070
You go on ahead, Frank.

590
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,390
Thank you, Freddy.

591
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,394
Well, this is a surprise.

592
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,598
<i>You usually text.</i>
Where are you?

593
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,155
On the other side
of the tracks

594
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,509
trying to find
the meaning of life.

595
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,829
Find anything for me?

596
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,634
You mean anything
newsworthy?

597
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,591
I actually didn't
call to badger you.

598
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,435
Yes, you did, but that's
part of your charm.

599
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,194
No. I wanted to
tell you that

600
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,080
I've been promoted to White
House correspondent.

601
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,120
I'll have to travel with the
press corps, be at briefings,

602
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,999
but I can work
around all that.

603
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,312
If you need me. It
won't change anything.

604
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,633
Oh, on the contrary.
This changes everything.

605
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,155
No. I can
be flexible.

606
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,552
I'm not interested in
someone who's flexible,

607
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,632
I'm interested in
someone who's available.

608
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,070
So you think I
should turn it down?

609
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,914
That's entirely
up to you.

610
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,671
Well, I mean,
it's not official yet.

611
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,995
I could... <i>Oh, look,
I've got to go,</i>

612
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,636
but call me, you know, if you
find yourself available again.

613
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,431
You see, Freddy believes that if
a fridge falls off a minivan,

614
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,352
you better swerve
out of its way.

615
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,478
I believe it's the fridge's
job to swerve out of mine.

616
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,312
Hey, Janine...

617
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,796
Keep walking, Zoe. I really don't
want to talk to you right now.

618
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,880
It's not like I
asked him for it.

619
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,400
He just called me
into his office, and...

620
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,756
Oh, please. You've been
gunning for my job

621
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,514
since the day you bounced in here
with a lollipop in your mouth.

622
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,836
Congratulations.

623
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,879
I'll send you a bottle of
champagne from the Middle West,

624
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,913
wherever the
fuck that is.

625
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,959
I'm gonna turn it down.
You don't have to leave.

626
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,679
Are you trying to rub
this in or something?

627
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,150
Please believe me. You should
be in the White House.

628
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,511
I don't want it.
I never did.

629
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,435
I was hoping we could
go see Tom together.

630
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,670
I want him to
know that we both...

631
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,956
Get the fuck
out of my face.

632
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,800
I'm asking. For real.
I don't want the job.

633
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,600
Then you're an even bigger
idiot than I thought you were.

634
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,114
Go. Before I get violent.

635
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,957
Peter?

636
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,514
Hello?

637
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,760
Hi. My name is Christina.
I work with your dad.

638
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,797
He's not here.
Where'd he go?

639
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,190
I don't know. He said he'd
be back in a little while.

640
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,914
When was that?

641
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,357
When he dropped us
home from school.

642
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,556
He left his phone here.

643
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,315
Are you Dad's
girlfriend?

644
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,916
No. No. I work
for your dad.

645
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,798
Then why do you have the
keys to his apartment?

646
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,080
Will you
make us Pop-Tarts?

647
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,318
It was just
sublime, Claire.

648
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,437
- Thank you.
- I don't think I'll eat for a week.

649
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,036
Does that mean no
room for dessert?

650
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,271
I'd love to,
but none for me.

651
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,359
Why don't you and
I head downstairs

652
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,073
for a little brandy
and some cigars?

653
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,196
Cubans?

654
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,158
You don't think I smoke
anything legal, do you?

655
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,232
Dessert for you?
No. No, thanks.

656
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,118
But I will take a refill of
this Chardonnay, though.

657
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,358
Of course. This is almost out.
I'll grab another.

658
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,560
I hate how they just hit you
like that with no warning.

659
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,677
You get night
sweats, too?

660
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,193
I, umm...

661
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,280
This is very
new to me.

662
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,390
Does Frank know?

663
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,673
I haven't...
We haven't... No.

664
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,152
I'm sorry. We don't have
to talk about this.

665
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,075
No. It's fine.
I'm just...

666
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,194
It's fine.
I feel better now.

667
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,834
Could I have a little bit more?
Sure.

668
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,036
Just say when.

669
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,276
Charles is driving
tonight, so...

670
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,989
And when.

671
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,912
Cheers.
Cheers.

672
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,389
So, you mentioned, when
you invited me, the CWI.

673
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,194
You're having a gala and
launching some new...

674
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,834
Yes, that's right.

675
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,514
We just brought on this
brilliant young woman

676
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,957
who's going to help us
expand our efforts overseas.

677
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,032
Claire, I will save
you the trouble.

678
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,039
Charles and I would be
delighted to contribute.

679
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,277
Well, that's very generous
of you, Felicity.

680
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,275
Well, you were such a darling, getting
us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

681
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,716
Oh, that was nothing.

682
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,876
It wasn't nothing.

683
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,520
It was...

684
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,719
People in this town don't go out of
their way to be nice to each other.

685
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,631
Fourteen years Charles and
I have been here, and...

686
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,837
Anyway, um...

687
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,350
I'm grateful to
have a friend.

688
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,560
How much
do you need?

689
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,233
Christina, what the fuck
are you doing here?

690
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,874
Shh! They're sleeping.

691
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,719
Peter.

692
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,992
Hey, Dad.
Hey, kiddo.

693
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,994
Would you take your
brother downstairs?

694
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll be there
in a second.

695
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,795
Okay.
Bye, Dad.

696
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,720
Bye.

697
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,240
Bye?
Where they going?

698
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,070
I'm taking them to
their grandmother's.

699
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,152
I was able to get ahold of
Madeleine, and I told her...

700
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,356
Fuck. You didn't
tell her?

701
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,190
No, I didn't.
But I should have.

702
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,312
I told her that you had
to travel for work,

703
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,750
which is the last time
I ever lie for you.

704
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,990
Look...

705
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,355
What happened, Peter?

706
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,313
I'm sorry about
the BRAC hearing.

707
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,515
Fuck the BRAC hearing.
What about your kids?

708
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,760
After I drop
them off, I'm done.

709
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,275
I am no longer your girlfriend.
I no longer work for you.

710
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,079
No. Hey, Christina...

711
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,954
I don't want to hear it, Peter.
There's no excuse this time.

712
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,670
I don't have
much time, Frank.

713
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,950
I'll make it short.

714
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,032
The President?
No. The speakership.

715
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,590
David's making a play.

716
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,919
What? He came to me for support.

717
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,633
My first thought was
to tell you right away,

718
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,195
but then my second thought was
to ignore my first thought,

719
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,715
because we have
the votes, Bob.

720
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,111
If there had been a party revolt,
I would've known about it.

721
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,669
We don't need the whole party to revolt.
We need 13...

722
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,077
Thirteen Democrats, plus the
other side of the aisle.

723
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,240
Are you out
of your mind?

724
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,033
People have been asking
me that a lot lately.

725
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,953
I'm inclined to
start saying yes.

726
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,033
Who are they, the 13?

727
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,077
David and I are two,
Terry Womack,

728
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,715
and 10 members of the Black
Caucus make another 11.

729
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,434
Is the President
behind this?

730
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,920
No. He doesn't
have a clue.

731
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,680
This was David's
plan executed by me.

732
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,911
But there is
an out for you, Bob.

733
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,073
I can sway Womack
either way

734
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,995
as long as you make him
the next majority leader.

735
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,992
And...

736
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,400
The Education Bill.

737
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,840
Now we're on
the same page.

738
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,877
I can't do that.
You know I can't.

739
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,112
You're the Speaker, Bob. You
can do anything you'd like.

740
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,556
And I have to say,
appointing the first

741
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,990
African-American
majority leader,

742
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,232
why, that isn't
a bad legacy to have.

743
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,837
I'm sorry.
I changed my mind.

744
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,116
I thought
about it, and...

745
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,039
Thinking about it was what
those two days were for.

746
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,510
And then I thought about it
some more, and I realized I...

747
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,274
Jesus Christ, you're
fucking unbelievable.

748
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,278
Look, Tom, I
appreciate the fact

749
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,760
that you took
a chance on me, but...

750
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,754
No, I don't think you do. I don't
think you appreciate anything.

751
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,440
I think you're an ungrateful,
self-entitled little...

752
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,470
Little what?

753
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,439
Little what, Tom?
Say it.

754
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,440
Cunt. You're a cunt.

755
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,119
What are you doing?

756
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,710
Don't you dare...

757
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,996
You don't even
know what I'm typing.

758
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,112
Get out, Zoe. Just a second.
I'm almost done.

759
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,237
Get out.
You're fired.

760
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,040
Whatever you have to
tell yourself, Tom.

761
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,310
Get out!

762
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,800
So should I
press send?

763
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,076
I think I should.

764
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,999
Call me whatever you want,

765
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,396
but you should remember,
these days,

766
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,598
when you're talking to one
person, you're talking to 1,000.

767
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,076
<i>Well, you'll say you
wanted to spend more time</i>

768
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,594
<i>focusing on
your home district.</i>

769
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,994
You'll say Womack is the right
man to fill your shoes.

770
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,154
You won't make waves.
You won't do interviews.

771
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,755
You'll suck it up
and be a team player.

772
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,360
This was Frank's idea.

773
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,397
I told you he was gonna
try to blame me on it.

774
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,630
Ask around.
Talk to Womack.

775
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,677
I did. He said
you came to him.

776
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,236
He's fucking lying, Bob!
I would never...

777
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,760
Shut up, David.

778
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,950
Do you understand how you're to
behave when we make the announcement?

779
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,474
And if I don't
play along?

780
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,638
Then the DCCC will pour
everything it's got

781
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,633
into your primary opponent's
campaign next cycle.

782
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,191
We'll cleave you from the herd and
watch you die in the wilderness.

783
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,513
Tell us now, David.

784
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,393
If you think
it's best, Robert.

785
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,473
And just think,
he could have been a wolf.

786
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,797
You made yourself
available.

787
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,590
I quit.
Fuck that place.

788
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,320
It was a prison.
I'm free now.

789
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,200
Congratulations.

790
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,634
Where are you?

791
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,836
<i>In a car.</i>

792
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,910
So am I.

793
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,195
Where you headed?

794
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,680
<i>Home.</i>

795
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,200
So am I.

796
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,873
To your home or mine?

797
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,440
Is that an invitation?

798
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,797
It's whatever
you want it to be.

799
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,075
You sound tipsy.

800
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,350
<i>I am.</i>

801
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,914
I just spent
the last two hours

802
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,520
drinking Long
Island Iced Teas.

803
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,720
What's your address?

804
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,878
Do your parents know
you live like this?

805
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,714
No. They
haven't visited.

806
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,555
Are you cared for?

807
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,550
How do you mean?

808
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,351
Do you have a man
who cares for you?

809
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,756
An older man.

810
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,950
No.

811
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,558
But you've been with
older men before?

812
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,710
Yes.

813
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,120
Then you know
they hurt you,

814
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,640
and after
they hurt you,

815
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,990
they discard you.

816
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,153
You can't hurt me.

817
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,159
Take your heels off.
