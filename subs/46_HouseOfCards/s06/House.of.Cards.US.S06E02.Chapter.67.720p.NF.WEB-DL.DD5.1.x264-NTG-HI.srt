1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,885
[Claire] I want a Declaration, Roger.
So we can send them in.

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,097
<i>- </i>[Roger] <i>But, Madam President...</i>
- I have the Guard, FEMA and the EPA

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,808
mobilized and waiting
on the outskirts of that town.

4
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>I just got off the phone
with the refinery.</i>

5
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,895
<i>The leak is well on its way
to burning off.</i>

6
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,733
My understanding is that the air quality
is dangerous.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,110
The levels are somewhat elevated, yes,

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,155
- but the winds are in our favor.
<i>- And subject to change.</i>

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,823
<i>That's how wind works.</i>

10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,075
This will all be over in a day or two,

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,661
the idea of keeping these families out
of their homes...

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,663
<i>This is a prudent precaution</i>

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,332
<i>and on my watch,
that’s what I want to happen.</i>

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,418
I don’t think we should
exaggerate the situation.

15
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,840
Do you remember where you were
on election night, Governor?

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,676
<i>Because I do.</i>

17
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,970
<i>You were going to lose.</i>

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,933
Statistically, there is no reason
you should have won.

19
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,957
<i>Keep the phone away from your mouth
while you’re thinking, Governor.</i>

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,357
<i>I can hear you breathing.</i>

21
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,984
Yes.

22
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,824
I do believe I need to declare
a state of emergency.

23
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,287
Of course, it's your call.

24
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,874
And I assure you,
you will have the full support

25
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,292
of the federal government.

26
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,048
I promised myself I wouldn't be like him.

27
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,383
That was textbook Francis, wasn't it?

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,097
But he handed me over to them
like a shaker of salt

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,807
and now they won't let go.

30
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,936
This is a wound of their own making.

31
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,607
Mr. Vice President?

32
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,860
[Mark] Yeah, come in.

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,866
Do you need a moment, sir?

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,244
No, no.

35
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,036
What is it?

36
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,875
Okay. Governor?

37
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,188
[man] They said it was fine.

38
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,400
It smelled like rotten eggs and trash.
That’s all.

39
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,486
You could smell it coming out
of the faucet.

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,323
And then my son, his...
his nose started to bleed and I thought,

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,687
- "Is that related?"
- Where is your little boy right now?

42
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,370
Now? He's in triage with his mom.

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,499
- He's my heart, that little guy.
- No, I know. I know.

44
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,584
But, ma'am. If I may. You...

45
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,836
You have to tell us.
Is this real or not?

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,798
Because at first they said that
we don't need to evacuate,

47
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,067
and then all of a sudden that we should.

48
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,852
I want you to know everything
is going to be all right. I promise you.

49
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,680
[man] We were relying on that plant
to keep us informed.

50
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,390
Sir, you and your safety

51
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,642
is the most important thing.

52
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,770
In fact, all of the families of Bellport,

53
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,231
nothing else matters.

54
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,693
I want to give my thanks
to Governor Olmstead

55
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,279
for his quick and decisive act
this morning

56
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,239
in declaring a state of emergency.

57
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,117
We have FEMA, we have EPA,

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,286
the Ohio National Guard.

59
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,537
They're all here.

60
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,374
No one should ever feel unsafe.

61
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,751
In her own home.

62
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,041
[Bill] <i>And how is it you have no idea, Mark?</i> -[Annette] <i>It doesn't matter.</i>
- [Bill] <i>Oh, it does matter.</i>

63
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,926
<i>It speaks to this untenable arrangement.</i>

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,470
[Annette]<i> Later, I said. Let’s stay</i>
<i>focused on our response.</i>

65
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,389
She was all set to sign the bill
this morning.

66
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,659
We had photographers,
a press pool waiting, the whole thing.

67
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,412
- [Bill] <i>But she didn't sign it, did she?</i>
- [Annette] <i>I'm on my way there now.</i>

68
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,814
Because she was too busy manufacturing
an emergency out of nothing.

69
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,483
[Mark] <i>Look, let’s not forget</i>
<i>who escalated this. Okay?</i>

70
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,568
Excuse me?

71
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,278
<i>If we're working together, Bill,</i>

72
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,447
<i>I need to be included in every decision.</i>

73
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,574
<i>Every one.</i>

74
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,200
[Bill] <i>This conversation's over.</i>

75
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,119
Oh, for God's sakes.

76
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,682
[Mark] <i>I'll join Annette in Bellport.</i>

77
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,955
[Bill] <i>No, you won’t.</i>

78
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,957
<i>One of you showing up on site
is bad enough.</i>

79
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,917
- Annette, call me back.
- [phone beeps]

80
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,044
[sighs]

81
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:37,794
Mark.

82
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,422
Mark, are you still there?

83
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,673
Yes.

84
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,260
<i>Let me talk to him. I'll circle back.</i>

85
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:52,393
[inhales, exhales]

86
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,275
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

87
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,195
My name is Kelsey Stewart.

88
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,489
I'm the deputy press secretary,

89
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,699
and I will be taking your questions today.

90
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,742
Sarah.

91
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,079
Is it true that Governor Olmstead
was resistant

92
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,955
to declaring a state of emergency?

93
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,541
<i>The Governor did declare
a state of emergency,</i>

94
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,834
and the White House concurs.

95
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,795
Something very wrong happened
in that plant.

96
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,253
Yes.

97
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,425
Arcas has been slow to provide any details
when it comes to the leak and explosion.

98
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,469
Not to mention the two lives lost
in the accident.

99
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,888
Have they been cooperating
with the White House?

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,765
Now that the president is on the ground,

101
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,309
it seems that, yes,
they have been more agreeable.

102
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,479
Uh...
That's not the real question, though.

103
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,858
<i>Somebody might want to ask, where is
Shepherd Unlimited in all of this?</i>

104
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,320
<i>The Arcas Refinery is a subsidiary
of the family’s conglomerate.</i>

105
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,407
[woman] <i>Are you saying that the Shepherds</i>
<i>are personally aware</i>

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>of problems at the plant?</i>

107
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,952
<i>Who is responsible and how</i>

108
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,122
<i>is all the White House and the president
are trying to find out at this point.</i>

109
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,665
[clamoring]

110
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,874
Will this have any effect

111
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,252
on the regulatory bill
on the president's desk?

112
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,254
The president will be speaking
on that shortly.

113
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,796
Marcus.

114
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,883
Was the president planning
to divorce the former president

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,094
in the days leading up to his death?

116
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,807
Uh, let's...

117
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,685
- Oh. Mr. Vice President.
- Morning, everyone.

118
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,396
I hope Miss Stewart won’t mind me
taking a couple of questions.

119
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,559
[clamoring]
[woman] Mr. Vice President, one question!

120
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,734
[Usher] Marcus, who's your source?

121
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,779
- [Marcus] Unnamed officials.
- Nope. We don't do that anymore.

122
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,531
We need names. You have a name?

123
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,451
I mean really, where do you get this?

124
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
The former president

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,413
spent his last night alive

126
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,216
next to his wife in the White House.
Period.

127
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,624
As for Bellport...

128
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,770
let’s not jump to conclusions
before all the facts are in.

129
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,795
What else?

130
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,631
We still going door to door,
but it's really a precaution.

131
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,633
Are there enough beds?

132
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,012
We have a few church basements
and the local jail if we need more.

133
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,182
Whatever hydrogen sulfide there is left
in the air is already dissipating.

134
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,785
[man] In a day or two, people will be back
sleeping in their own beds.

135
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,144
[man 2] You have to understand,

136
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,854
Madam President,

137
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,232
most everyone overreacts
when it comes to chemicals.

138
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,193
We have years of experience...

139
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,153
And the men who died in the accident?

140
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,573
That's tragic, of course.
They were valued employees.

141
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,701
Members of the community.
There's no way to replace them.

142
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,286
And Bill Shepherd?

143
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,164
- Yes.
- Have you heard from him?

144
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,335
I've kept him informed,
as well as all of our partners.

145
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,838
Bill called me directly.
They're ready to do whatever's needed.

146
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,465
They're important to Bellport.

147
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,235
They built the local stadium.
Even this gymnasium. They contributed...

148
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,303
No, I’m well aware
of the family’s philanthropy.

149
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,679
That wasn't the question.

150
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,725
Yes, Mr. Shepherd has been monitoring
the situation closely.

151
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,435
I would like to tour the area.

152
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,440
Is that a problem, Governor?

153
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,443
No, no, not to my understanding.

154
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,780
I was hoping to get you over to...

155
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,448
to where we set up our triage.

156
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,384
It might be best
if we stick to the itinerary...

157
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,160
I'd actually like to see it for myself.

158
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,037
Unless, of course, you tell me otherwise.

159
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,997
No, of course not.

160
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,634
[man] The guard
marks the doors of the evacuees.

161
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,387
Pretty standard procedure.

162
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,474
Stop the car. I think I see someone.

163
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
Stop the car.

164
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,273
Madam President,
we’ll have someone circle back.

165
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,566
Stop the car now.

166
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,118
Damn it.

167
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,704
Is she safe?

168
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,998
Nothing is 100% safe.

169
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,098
Hello. Anyone here?

170
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,560
- [woman] The boy could have lost an eye.
- [man] That’s not how we treat people.

171
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,520
- [woman] How could she?
- [man] My God, Elizabeth, stop it.

172
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,147
[Elizabeth]
Am I raising a daughter or an animal?

173
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,232
[man] They're the animals,
the way they attacked her.

174
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,759
[Elizabeth]
Oh, of course, take her side. Of course!

175
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,636
It's time she learned about the world.

176
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,306
Pretty girls have a responsibility
to their beauty.

177
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,184
I’ll bet she dared those boys.

178
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,769
Shame on her.

179
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,814
Why can't you just do as you're told?

180
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,275
Why, indeed?

181
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,278
Madam President! Madam President.

182
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,908
Madam President...

183
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,411
might be best if we head back.

184
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,861
[Claire] So, the house is safe?

185
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,882
Drink it then.

186
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,891
I thought so.

187
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,035
[indistinct chatter]

188
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,749
- But what am I agreeing to?
- I can read it for you.

189
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,083
I can read.

190
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,044
And what's this for?

191
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,631
That lets the app figure out
how we can be most helpful.

192
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,552
It can be tailored to your specific needs.
We want to keep you informed.

193
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,304
We want you to know what happens
before it happens.

194
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,640
You can’t trust the government to do that.

195
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,934
- Hello, my name is Seth Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.

196
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,737
I'm with Shepherd Freedom Foundation,
can I talk to you for a second?

197
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:14,191
[man] Sure thing. I was looking
at the pamphlet saying just...

198
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,654
[indistinct chatter]

199
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,989
[door closes]

200
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,198
[woman] It's the president.

201
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,184
Madam President.

202
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,062
Whose idea was it? To leave it on his bed?

203
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,106
Not here.

204
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,903
The Shepherd Freedom Foundation
is here to help.

205
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,240
The federal government is here
to help you.

206
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,075
Yes, Madam President.

207
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,288
The only way America’s problems
will be solved is through alliances

208
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,875
between government and private industry,
each doing its part.

209
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,671
The Commander in Chief and I go way back.

210
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,216
We do. And I know I have
the full cooperation

211
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,592
from the Shepherd family.

212
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,930
The blatant disregard for human life
exhibited by companies like Arcas...

213
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,682
Arcas is committed
to the safety of its workers.

214
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,976
And with the help of...

215
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,271
the right kind of legislation,
like the FUTURE Act.

216
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,357
Which is under review at the moment.

217
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,526
Until then,

218
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,404
I am hereby moving
the EPA’s Criminal Investigative Division

219
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,906
<i>into the Pentagon,</i>

220
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,369
<i>where it will enjoy the forces
and the resources of our military.</i>

221
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,205
<i>And they will investigate this disaster.</i>

222
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,751
<i>I swear on my husband's grave,
I will find out what happened here.</i>

223
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,671
<i>Thank you for your support.</i>

224
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,853
I wanted to leave it on your bed.
Don't be thick, thick I can't use.

225
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,810
[Marcus]
<i>Did she actually ask for a divorce?</i>

226
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,855
- As if that matters.
- <i>And if I’m asked to justify the question?</i>

227
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,566
It was justified the moment
they didn’t have an answer.

228
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,945
The last thing the president wants is
to be talking about the former president.

229
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,238
<i>Let me ask you this.</i>

230
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,322
How did your mother feel

231
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,658
when the president
yanked her hand away like that?

232
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,952
<i>That's none of your goddamn business,
Marcus.</i>

233
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,662
[beeps]

234
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,101
- [man] Recoil? Is that the word you used?
- [Hammerschmidt] Yeah, that's what I see.

235
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,352
- [woman] Are you kidding me?
- [Hammerschmidt] No.

236
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,504
Are we really gonna waste time
dissecting a gesture between two women?

237
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,715
Nora’s right. I was there.
There wasn't a recoil.

238
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,383
I gotta agree with Tom here. For me,

239
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,677
it's Annette Shepherd
sort of manhandling the president

240
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,471
as a sign of victory,
and then I detect a flinch.

241
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,765
A slight flinch, then recoil.

242
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,101
- Recoil? I mean...
- She’s trying to separate herself

243
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,229
from the primary source of the funding
for what was to be

244
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,357
- the Francis J. Underwood Foundation.
- This is about culpability.

245
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,402
She went to Bellport
to hold those responsible accountable.

246
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,655
Companies like Shepherd Unlimited
have been hamstrung.

247
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,819
And that's why this bill on her desk
is so important.

248
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,827
Legislation means nothing
without proper enforcement.

249
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,288
Weaponizing the EPA is wrongheaded.

250
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,748
And it does nothing to make...

251
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,876
Instead of ascribing negative motives
to her every action,

252
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,086
why can’t we just accept
that President Underwood

253
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,172
was out there being presidential?

254
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,383
She put the fear of God into you
and your new friends, Mr. Grayson.

255
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,761
Being "presidential"
means signing the bill

256
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,013
and modernizing antiquated regulations.

257
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,576
[Hammerschmidt] As if you would know.

258
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,433
What's that supposed to mean?

259
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,852
Her husband, whose administration
you were a part of,

260
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,770
was about to...

261
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,397
Was in the midst of setting up
a philanthropic foundation.

262
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,149
Her husband was about to be indicted.

263
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,235
- There wasn’t even a grand jury.
- I have it on good authority

264
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,113
he was about to be indicted,
and she was about to pardon him.

265
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,990
But she also wanted a divorce.

266
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,159
To save herself. Distance herself.

267
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,829
Because, come on. Are you telling me
she knew nothing of what he was up to?

268
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,082
- If he was guilty, she was guilty.
- [woman] Tom? Tom,

269
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,845
I have great respect for you
and the work you’ve done at the Herald.

270
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,630
But are you even capable
of defining her on her own terms?

271
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,359
I’m sorry. One minute she’s playing
the grieving widow and the next,

272
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,235
<i>- she's riding on the coattails.
- Case in point.</i>

273
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,339
[Hammerschmidt]
<i>This may be an unseemly thing to say,</i>

274
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,263
<i>but it’s quite possible</i>

275
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,225
<i>her husband's death
was the president's lucky day.</i>

276
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,477
[sighs]

277
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,396
[Rosen]
<i>You can say whatever you want in here.</i>

278
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,272
<i>Whatever your feeling, thinking.</i>

279
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,608
I’m questioning your ability.

280
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,236
My ability?

281
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,865
To tell the difference
between justifiable paranoia and...

282
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,494
Do you use the word anymore?

283
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,577
"Madness?"

284
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,541
What do you feel paranoid about?

285
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,460
Myself, maybe.

286
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,339
Why we do what we do and for who?

287
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,052
Who’s more evil, Doctor,

288
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,431
the taskmaster or the tasked?

289
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:00,269
Do you feel like Francis Underwood
betrayed you?

290
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,646
I guess I'm wondering who betrayed him.

291
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,439
Who do you think?

292
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,107
You?

293
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,615
I don’t know if these sessions
are helping me anymore.

294
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,079
Why are you trying to drug me up, Doctor?

295
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,789
I think you should consider it.

296
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,873
Clozapine.

297
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,084
You must know what that does to a person.

298
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,170
They're a newer class
of antipsychotics, Doug.

299
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:30,382
The side effects are not as sensational
as some of the older ones.

300
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,053
You don't have to suffer like this.

301
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,056
From my understanding, the side effects
themselves can make you look...

302
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:41,268
And again, I’m asking you
if you use this word "mad."

303
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,940
Are you fucking kidding me?

304
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,442
Pardon?

305
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,629
You're gonna talk to me about side effects
while you look at your fucking clock?

306
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,155
No, you’re right. I’m sorry.

307
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,718
We’re gonna have to take this up tomorrow
afternoon. This is a much bigger conversation.

308
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,083
No, I'm talking now.

309
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,795
I'm sorry, but your time is up.

310
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,713
I don’t give a fuck about the time.

311
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,839
Mr. Stamper.

312
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,635
I’m glad that you finally decided
to take advantage of your time here,

313
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,803
but you know the rules.

314
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,680
I'm not going anywhere.

315
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,182
Mr. Stamper, please.

316
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,310
I don’t want to have to call someone,
but I will.

317
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,232
This is bullshit.

318
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,071
[door slams shut]

319
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,369
Your uncle is not happy.

320
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,665
Are you aware of how many of your
sentences start with you quoting him?

321
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,666
He's right.

322
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,084
This circus backfired.

323
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,169
- I thought you were wonderful.
- Your uncle thinks

324
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,421
- we've made a bad situation worse.
- Mom.

325
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,298
Now I'm the face of this thing.

326
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,676
Which we will use to our advantage.

327
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,803
She called us out by name.

328
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,514
We can spin it any way we want.

329
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,057
Work the Congress.

330
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,518
Even if she vetoes the bill,
they can override it.

331
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,311
She overreacted.

332
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,274
- And it made a fool of me.
- I'm telling you,

333
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,691
you won.

334
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,444
She thinks she did.

335
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,114
I know that expression, trust me.

336
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,076
Phew. She can’t decide
if she’s Lady Macbeth or Macbeth.

337
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,955
- Your uncle takes it from here.
- No.

338
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,125
This isn't personal for me,
not like it is for you and Uncle Bill.

339
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,043
You know he hates the spotlight,

340
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,753
for any of us.

341
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:36,014
Prefers an old school way of dealing with things. - I...
- And don’t think you know everything.

342
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,678
Because you don't.

343
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,390
Let me talk to Uncle Bill.

344
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,519
He’s taken a suite at the Hay-Adams.

345
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,438
Frank’s old room.

346
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,818
It's Doug Stamper, Madam US Attorney.

347
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,154
<i>- </i>[woman] <i>How did you get this number?</i>
- Don't hang up.

348
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,407
<i>The next call I expect is
from your lawyer. In my office.</i>

349
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,408
You really shouldn’t.

350
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,576
<i>Mr. Stamper,</i>

351
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,162
<i>- this is highly...</i>
- I’m going to recant.

352
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,292
<i>Are you there?</i>

353
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,667
Yes.

354
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,296
<i>I'm going to lay out
how it's going to go.</i>

355
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,090
<i>And you stop me at any point
if I’m wrong.</i>

356
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>But I'm going to recant.</i>

357
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,512
Which means you’re going to need
a new prosecutor.

358
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,890
Because you’re going to have
to recuse yourself

359
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,808
so you can testify against me.

360
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,394
And this call we're on,

361
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,648
is not going to look very good for you.

362
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,860
Anything you say in court
will be ruled hearsay.

363
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,820
And the judge,

364
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,616
if he’s in a good mood,
is going to ask for more evidence,

365
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,119
and you and your new prosecutor
aren't going to have any.

366
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,707
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

367
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,880
This case isn't going to make your career.

368
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,926
<i>The case that's going change your life</i>

369
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,220
<i>is the prosecution of Claire Underwood.</i>

370
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,303
[clicks]

371
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,932
[birds caw]

372
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,271
It's gruesome,

373
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,647
what's gone on here.

374
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,024
I checked all the log books myself.

375
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,819
I spoke with the executive housekeeper.

376
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,822
She interviewed the staff.
Nobody knows anything.

377
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,365
So his ring just appeared on his bed
by magic?

378
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,287
My feeling is, it’s not the fact of it
that we should be focusing on.

379
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,371
But...

380
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,123
what it means.

381
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,794
Tell me, Mark. What kind of people
dig up a man's grave

382
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,047
and remove a ring from his cold...

383
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,465
hard finger?

384
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,927
The same people that are generating
this drum beat about Francis' pardon

385
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,470
and your divorce.

386
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,806
You are daring them.

387
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,851
You've turned it into a spectacle,
and now they will not stop.

388
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,562
Believe me. These people will not rest.

389
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,896
You need to make amends.

390
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,356
For slighting her?

391
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,693
- For identifying them?
- You have to give them something.

392
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,737
- I don't believe in the bill.
- Oh, goddamn it!

393
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,822
This bill. Are you listening?

394
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,075
Do you want to spend
the rest of your presidency

395
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,744
defending your dead husband,

396
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,995
defending his...

397
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,163
deeds?

398
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,875
Because they will make sure
that every waking and even sleeping moment

399
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,794
of your time in the White House
is about him!

400
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,506
[sighs]

401
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,143
Make amends for the last hundred days.

402
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,395
Then you can have the next four years.

403
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,900
When you present the scholarship
at the Take Aim Club this weekend,

404
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,223
Annette Shepherd will be there.

405
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,779
She's on the board. They're all donors.

406
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,947
Appear with your old friend...

407
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,326
and sign this bill.

408
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,580
You know, I can help you...

409
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,500
with the Shepherds.
I know how to talk to them.

410
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,172
And please, please explain to me
why you thought...

411
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,007
putting that elevated intern

412
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,771
in front of the press yesterday
serves you.

413
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,762
- Because she's honest.
- I had Mitch Glazer lined up.

414
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,139
- He's got 30 years of...
- Because she’s not Mitch.

415
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,683
Because I know you pushed out Sean.

416
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,144
Sean Jeffries had a hard time
telling the truth.

417
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,523
- Your truth?
- Yes, the one that keeps you in power.

418
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,065
And now what?

419
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,946
We’ve traded his ambition for her naïveté?

420
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,114
I believe her.

421
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,741
And so will everyone else.

422
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,167
[door opens, closes]

423
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,680
- Oh, I’m sorry, do you need me to...
- No, no, actually, I was looking for you.

424
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,766
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

425
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,810
No, please.

426
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,187
- I was happy to have your help.
- Okay.

427
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,566
You know Sean's not coming back, right?

428
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,733
I heard.

429
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,862
The president must see something in you.

430
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,655
What do you think that is?

431
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,368
It was an amazing opportunity.

432
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,080
And I've heard there are some
wonderful candidates for the position.

433
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,206
Yeah.

434
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,376
Well, until then...

435
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,547
why don't you to continue on

436
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,174
as acting press secretary.

437
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,552
Of course. Yes, sir.

438
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,387
And thank you and the president.

439
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,267
Do you believe in her, Miss Stewart?

440
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,350
I do.

441
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,229
I ask because...

442
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,358
I want you to know
there are powerful forces out there

443
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,361
that are invested in seeing her fail.

444
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,533
So you're gonna hear rumors.
You're gonna hear innuendos.

445
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,452
You’ll need to stick
to your talking points.

446
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,373
Not get lured off-track with,
what, salacious questions.

447
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,875
I understand.

448
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,420
Right now,
I’m thede facto chief of staff.

449
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,005
So, if you need...

450
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,174
help or advice,

451
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,426
you know where to find me.

452
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,970
Good luck. Thank you.

453
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:24,981
[chuckles]

454
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,319
[Seth] There’s a fire burning
in the Valley outside of Los Angeles.

455
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,405
So, the Foundation sends volunteers in,
we sign them up for the app.

456
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,283
[Bill] How many signed up in Bellport?

457
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,579
In and around the area,
close to 50,000 phones.

458
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,250
But beside the fires,
there's flooding in the Panhandle.

459
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,585
It's been raining for days.

460
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,421
There's a pipeline that's burst
in North Dakota.

461
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,590
And my nephew came up with this?

462
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,134
Well, it’s based
on pre-existing technology, but...

463
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,886
he saw the potential.

464
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,639
Essentially they’re handing over
their phones,

465
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,142
which as you know, is basically
an extension of the self at this point.

466
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,187
Duncan calls them
"the sarcophagi of our souls."

467
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,107
We’ll be crawling peoples’ phones.

468
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,610
You get to decide what people see
and when.

469
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,071
Did Frank take this room
because of the view?

470
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,827
Yes, I think he did.

471
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,669
You respected him.

472
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,462
Did you fear him?

473
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,548
Yes.

474
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,218
But you always knew
where you stood with him.

475
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,011
And her?

476
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,180
You never know.

477
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,605
Did the workers at the plant sign up
for the app?

478
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,816
- Most of them did, yes.
- Good.

479
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,067
Good.

480
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,237
I'm glad you’re working with us, Seth.

481
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,657
Your perspective,
when it comes to the Underwoods,

482
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,825
my nephew.

483
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,579
I appreciate it.

484
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,543
Retired agents?

485
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,795
They're freelance now.

486
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,882
Working for Nexis Securities.
A lot of guys do it.

487
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,402
Apparently these two have been
on the ground in Gaffney

488
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,927
for the last week or so.

489
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,555
- Hired by who?
- We don't know yet.

490
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,409
But they're making enough
so that one of them just purchased

491
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,185
a second home on the Chesapeake Bay.

492
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,145
They...

493
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,024
broke into your Gaffney residence, ma’am.

494
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,527
What? Where was Secret Service?

495
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,945
And why wasn’t I alerted?

496
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,031
Because no one was alerted.

497
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,450
They left it completely untouched,

498
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,951
as far as anyone can tell.

499
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,039
How did you know anyone was there, then?

500
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:50,251
An insomniac neighbor who spotted
the light from a phone screen inside.

501
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,506
Taking pictures, I’m assuming.

502
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,383
My, my, my.

503
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,052
Night life in Gaffney
certainly has picked up.

504
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,600
[laughs]

505
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,269
Started when I was a kid.

506
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,689
Whenever the opportunity
would present itself,

507
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,359
I’d slip my hand into a coat pocket
to see what I could find.

508
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,613
A stranger’s pocket is a window
into his soul.

509
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,783
And what did you find?

510
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,828
Condoms.

511
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,622
- [chuckles]
- Mints. Keys.

512
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,000
Did you steal what you found?

513
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,337
Not the mints.
Because that would be cruel.

514
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,547
[Usher laughs]

515
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,966
Was that you...

516
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,719
on the way to the airport?

517
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,846
Were you trying to teach her a lesson?

518
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,472
- Talk to Bill.
- Come on.

519
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,099
I already did.

520
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,646
- She's late.
- Yeah, she’s the president.

521
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,774
You know, you have a weakness
for strong women.

522
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,858
Oh.

523
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:56,943
No, really.

524
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,739
You think they need your help.

525
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,121
Really?

526
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,998
- Still?
- No, no.

527
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,916
I chew now.

528
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,835
I just like to...

529
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,670
play with this.

530
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,008
- [cell phone ringing]
- Wait.

531
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,386
She's here.

532
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,828
Madam President, Duncan Shepherd.

533
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,081
- Oh. Hello.
- [Annette] Claire.

534
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,291
Annette.

535
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,711
I see you've met Duncan.

536
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,464
- Shall we?
- Yes.

537
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,930
Don’t ever recoil from me again.

538
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,854
[jazz music playing, indistinct chatter]

539
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,611
- Ain’t 50 nifty?
- Mm-hmm.

540
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,240
I think the last time you dragged me
into a bathroom,

541
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,908
it was to show off your hickey.

542
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,327
[laughs]

543
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,623
I don’t think your brother
is gonna let up, Annette.

544
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,252
Until he gets his ring kissed directly,
I think.

545
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,631
Reminds me of someone you were married to.

546
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:45,468
Oh, no. Bill and Francis
are very different people.

547
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,553
Agreed.

548
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
You know I slept with him once.

549
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:52,975
Your brother?

550
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,228
Your husband.

551
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,938
I know.

552
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,859
Interesting.

553
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,736
Though, come to think of it,
I guess it makes sense.

554
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
What does?

555
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,868
That your marriage allowed for that.

556
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,997
Well, it was the '98 campaign.

557
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,000
Francis was facing a robust challenger,

558
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,253
and there you were
at some DC fundraiser or other.

559
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,046
It was at the Union Station,

560
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,131
- East Hall.
- Yes.

561
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,934
And there you were,
dangling your checkbook.

562
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,177
So, it sounds like a favorable transaction
all around.

563
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,180
- Is that what he told you?
- I never asked for details.

564
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,391
I mean, I was curious.

565
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,018
I really was.

566
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,145
He was a good kisser, I’ll say that.

567
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,815
But then the rest
was so underwhelming.

568
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,276
Felt like he wasn’t all there.

569
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,694
Like, he wasn't...

570
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,821
all in, so to speak.

571
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,824
Of course, my first thought, and...

572
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,243
isn’t this true of most women?

573
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,828
Was to wonder if it was me.

574
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,791
Was I somehow less skilled
than I like to believe I am?

575
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,545
Well, I can’t really answer to that,
Annette.

576
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,254
I can.

577
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,007
It was him.

578
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,259
And...

579
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,513
I bet it was never very different
with you.

580
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,391
Even you.

581
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,477
The blonde goddess.

582
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,772
Even with you. Am I right?

583
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,566
Wow.

584
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,112
It's really only dawning on me now.

585
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,740
The sacrifice you made.

586
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,785
I sort of pity you.

587
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,372
What you must have denied yourself
all those years.

588
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,375
And this is where I tell you
to shut your mouth, Annette.

589
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,503
You don't know anything about marriage,

590
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,129
much less mine.

591
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,716
Tell yourself whatever you want, Claire.

592
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,052
We both know the truth.

593
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,472
He’s waiting for you down the hall
in the prep kitchen.

594
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,351
My brother.

595
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,021
I can still do it by the way.

596
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,065
Can you?

597
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,277
[Bill] Well, you missed dinner.

598
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,207
I can have 'em make you
whatever you like.

599
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,375
I'm not hungry.

600
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,753
The secret here is how much

601
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,713
lemon juice you put in.

602
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,840
Balance out the butter.

603
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,885
People and hollandaise.

604
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,678
They think it tastes like money.

605
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,140
- A night at the hotel.
- What where you looking for?

606
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,310
There’s nothing in the Gaffney home
of value.

607
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,980
Frank did things.

608
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,607
And you just, what?

609
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,442
Look the other way?

610
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,904
That shot you took at me,
it’s not like you to be so reckless.

611
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,281
You don’t scare easy.

612
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:41,120
The future of our country is at stake.

613
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,331
Does that sound...

614
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,750
pat to you, naive?

615
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,086
No, not at all.

616
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,464
Do you think I don't have friends
at the Pentagon, Claire?

617
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,884
You may want to make my four years
in office miserable...

618
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,595
All I want you to do is behave,
as promised.

619
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:01,099
You can dig up a ring or whatever else
you can get your hands on.

620
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,019
But that doesn't mean I won't make
your time a living hell as well.

621
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,272
[laughing]

622
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,567
Raymond Tusk said about you one time,

623
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,319
some dinner we were at,
he just said it...

624
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,506
This is where I'm supposed
to be a little bit afraid of the answer,

625
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,965
- I suppose.
- He said, "I don't know,

626
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,699
whether or not she's a person...

627
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,328
or just playing the part of one."

628
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:26,165
And I thought it was so strange
at the time, but maybe it's true.

629
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,083
Just...

630
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,545
unreachable.

631
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,509
I know it'll be hard for you.

632
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,304
But you're going to have to treat me
as an equal, Bill.

633
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,018
What did you do with your husband's will?

634
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,771
[Claire] It was a revocable trust.

635
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,272
All done.

636
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,066
I'm not talking about that one.

637
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,694
I'm talking about the other one.

638
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,362
The new one.

639
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:01,284
Bet Doug Stamper would love
to see the contents of that one.

640
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,911
What's in there anyway?

641
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,707
That you would go to such lengths

642
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,876
to keep him from it?

643
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,214
Claire Hale has a secret.

644
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,556
Douglas Stamper is meeting
with the US District Attorney

645
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,974
as we speak.

646
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,351
He's out, Claire.

647
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,313
And he's not going back in.

648
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,317
Now, you need my help.

649
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,652
Later tonight,

650
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,781
I'm going to watch you sign that bill

651
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,159
that's sitting on your desk.

652
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,828
"To the dead,

653
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,289
a kingdom means nothing.

654
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,376
They have their requiem and eternity."

655
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,546
That's <i>Macbeth. </i>The opera, not the play.

656
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,175
All you have to do now
is just go on out there

657
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,510
with your oldest, dearest friend and...

658
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,931
hold her hand up high.

659
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,489
Madam President.

660
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,242
You don’t really think
the military is irrelevant?

661
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:29,497
I watched your confirmation
from my chambers for the UN.

662
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,959
- Wasn't my finest hour.
- Well, he who laughs loudest...

663
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,835
Or is it "laughs last"?

664
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,587
"Last." "She."

665
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,507
- Vincent Abruzzo.
- Ninth Circuit.

666
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,842
I am no good at functions like this.

667
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:47,014
I tend to find a chair at these things
and sit in it for the rest of the evening.

668
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,558
- Madam President.
- Yes. Well, it's been a pleasure.

669
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,811
Madam President, if I may say,

670
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,481
I'm so glad that we finally have a woman
in the Oval Office.

671
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,150
The arc of history is long, but...

672
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,279
The reign of the middle-aged white man
is over.

673
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,283
The Bill Shepherds of the world
who won’t let go, have to go.

674
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,168
Does anyone except you know about
the document that came for him?

675
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,837
[Rosen] <i>No, of course not.</i>

676
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,215
Because if anyone else
gets their hand on that will...

677
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,092
<i>That is strictly between us.</i>

678
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,011
We only just discovered
that he was missing.

679
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,222
I put a call into the US Attorney
and was just informed

680
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,765
charges have been dropped.

681
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,018
How is that even possible?

682
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,645
<i>I thought I’d lost my phone
a couple of days ago, but...</i>

683
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,607
<i>But now I'm certain that he took it
and reached out to make a deal.</i>

684
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,527
I can have a grand jury impaneled

685
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,780
and we can be taking testimony
from witnesses within a week.

686
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,700
Who do you have?

687
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,827
Secretary Durant?

688
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,788
And others.

689
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,419
I'm sure I don't need to talk to you
about what's right or wrong.

690
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,505
But in my experience,
most people, in the end,

691
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,758
will do whatever they need to,
to save themselves.

692
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,560
Do you think you have
a strong enough case?

693
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,729
That depends on you.

694
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,775
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need to know you're going to win.

695
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,777
This can be a very unforgiving town.

696
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,570
I'm giving you a chance to start over.

697
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:28,991
- Come on.
- I can offer you immunity

698
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,242
for your testimony.

699
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,455
But, Mr. Stamper, of course,
I can't give you any guarantees

700
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,792
when it comes to your reputation
or that of the former president.

701
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,961
You would have to testify
in an open court.

702
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,713
That is the deal.

703
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,554
I should consult with my lawyers.

704
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,643
Thank you for your time, Mr. Stamper.

705
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,073

707

<i>Take aim.</i>

708
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,926
Look at these marvelous faces.

709
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,053
The faces of our future.

710
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,932
And I am so, so honored

711
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,852
to be chosen to introduce to you

712
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,355
the President of the United States,
Claire Underwood.

713
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,491
[cheering, applause continues]

714
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,342
I look at these brilliant young women

715
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,094
and words fail me.

716
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,182
What's this?

717
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,392
They gave us these.
What are they gonna do?

718
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,686
Yeah, I'm not drinking the water,

719
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,188
no fucking way, I'll tell you that.

720
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,899
I'll go all the way to Canton to buy it,
if I have to.

721
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,693
And... Mr. Grayson,

722
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,821
what else did he tell you about the app?

723
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,699
Nothing.
You can go online and check it out.

724
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,578
'Cause a lot of people I know signed up
for it even after the president left.

725
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,661
Hmm.

726
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,041
He said...

727
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,002
Mr. Grayson?

728
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,298
Yeah, him.

729
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,510
That they were gonna tell us
what was gonna happen

730
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,220
- before it happens.
- How?

731
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,140
Look, I don't know.

732
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,560
Ithaca's, like, where?

733
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,230
There’s one in Greece.

734
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,315
And the other's in upstate New York.

735
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,776
Guess which one I'm from.

736
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,985
[both chuckle]

737
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,242
It’s a paper, it comes out once a week.

738
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,251
It was going to happen,

739
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,336
because it happened before.

740
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,422
We complained all the way
to the EPA, but...

741
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,048
whatever.

742
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,969
Only this time the explosion was bad.

743
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:38,764
And yeah, some guys died.
And the company knew.

744
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,975
They knew.

745
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,818
[sirens wail in the distance,
Doug clears throat]

746
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,901
[door shuts]

747
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,614
[Claire] Welcome home.

748
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,295
Good timing. I just put on coffee.

749
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,589
A little late for coffee.

750
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,757
Well, we have so much to talk about.

751
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,261
I'm glad you're out, Doug.

752
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,305
I don't know what you were doing in there.

753
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,388
[Doug sighs]

754
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,891
How's the US Attorney?

755
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,565
Secretary Durant's
negotiating her appearance.

756
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,360
And if...

757
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,363
Cathy should somehow be dissuaded?

758
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,033
- Silenced?
- Then it all goes away.

759
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,411
Yes, but they'll still want to know

760
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,830
who knew what, when.

761
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,626
I feel pretty clear.

762
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,339
You think it was me
who asked you to take the fall

763
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,508
- just because I said the words, right?
- He told me it was you.

764
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,927
- He whispered it in my ear.
- And you believed him.

765
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,346
Like you always believed him.

766
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,100
Well, here’s what I believe.
Zoe Barnes killed herself...

767
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,394
And I expected to be pardoned
for the rest.

768
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,980
Since his death, my hands have been tied.

769
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,231
[Doug scoffs]

770
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,817
But I believe the universe
has given us a gift.

771
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,363
I don't know what that means.

772
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,406
Well...

773
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,356
We both lost someone who shaped
the course of our lives.

774
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,832
For good, but also for ill.

775
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,543
And now here we are

776
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,213
unexpectedly free.

777
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,549
To take a different tack.

778
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,931
We can do whatever we want, Doug.

779
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,893
And we’ve been entwined, you and I,

780
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,436
like it or not,

781
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,438
for decades now.

782
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,023
But I think...

783
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,193
we deserve to go our separate ways.

784
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,865
The only problem is we have something
urgent to attend to called Cathy Durant.

785
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,078
And then we can finally be free.

786
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,998
Do what we really want.

787
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,251
Do what we need to do.

788
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,756
What does Doug Stamper want?

789
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,592
Are you trying to erase him?

790
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,762
Because you can't.

791
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,181
I’m not trying to do anything

792
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,892
except be the sitting President
of the United States.

793
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,730
It's wrong to assume

794
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,650
Francis’s ambitions directly aligned
with mine, Doug.

795
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,030
The best way to not to be associated
with his questionable deeds

796
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,994
is to do good.
That’s what I plan to do, anyway.

797
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,911
[Doug laughing]

798
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,332
[Claire] Oh, you find that funny, do you?

799
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,293
Well, it's true.

800
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,134
I never understood what he saw in you.

801
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,720
I mean the outside, sure.

802
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,306
But the inside...

803
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,726
- LeAnn’s death.
- No.

804
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,395
You never cared for her.

805
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,980
It wasn't necessary.

806
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,274
And I told him so.

807
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,318
And yet...

808
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,494
Doug, do me a favor.

809
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,792
Close your eyes.

810
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:37,753
Please.

811
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,642
He wanted you to have them.

812
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,815
For this to happen
at this point in your life,

813
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,817
the prognosis is not good.

814
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,903
I know.

815
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,458
Somebody killed Francis,

816
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,335
and yet they don't want him to die.

817
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,881
That last night, the last time we spoke,

818
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,675
was when I declined his phone call
in the Oval Office.

819
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:11,305
It had been close to two months,
and he was tired of waiting.

820
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,391
So he showed up here in the White House.

821
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,059
Like a thief.

822
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,061
It was terrifying.

823
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,064
He was furious, slurring his words.

824
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,567
"Why can't you do as you're told, Claire?"

825
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,946
I told the world that he died in our bed,

826
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,907
but that's not the truth.

827
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,326
I locked myself in my room that night,

828
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,912
woke up in the morning
and found him dead in his.

829
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,333
They killed him to shut me up.

830
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,546
I need to bury Francis, once and for all.

831
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,319
Do you need help signing it?

832
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,413
No. Bill. Shepherd, enough.

833
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,668
I actually have one condition.

834
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,171
Put it back.
