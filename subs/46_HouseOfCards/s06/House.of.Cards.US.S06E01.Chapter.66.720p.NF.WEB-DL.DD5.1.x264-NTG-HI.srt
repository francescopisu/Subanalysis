00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,091
[insects and birds chirping]

2
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,845
[boy] Stop. Claire Hale. Stop!

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,313
[man]<i> "I'd like to fry her eyeballs.</i>

4
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,400
If no one else steps up
to kill the president, I will.

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,027
I'd enjoy it."

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,446
A tweet out of North Dakota.

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,738
What else?

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,160
"God never intended a woman
to rule this land.

9
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,995
She is the anti-Christ.

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,873
- And a Jew."
- [Mark] A Jew?

11
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,751
- Do we really need to hear all of this?
- Yes.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,962
[man] An unpublished editorial.

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,548
Someone pointing a gun at your likeness.

14
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,426
Lots of other online stuff, including a...

15
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,803
contest...

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,429
For?

17
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,224
For the most creative way to kill you.

18
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,435
And the winner?

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,645
Rather not say, ma'am.

20
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,649
I want to hear.
Just hand me the report, Rick.

21
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,488
It involves, essentially, skinning you.

22
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,824
Cutting your body into dozens of pieces

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,118
and arranging them
in the shape of the American flag.

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,665
Flesh for the white stripes,
blood for the red.

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,959
What else?

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,756
Lot of threats
involving the C-word, ma'am.

27
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,966
Lots and lots of the C-word,
unfortunately.

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,370
You mean Claire? It's a long list.

29
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,850
- If you really want me to, I'll...
- Listen, I am not the first president

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,976
to face threats.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,646
I know with Francis,
sometimes there were several a day.

32
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,939
Is it about the same

33
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,857
what we're dealing with here?

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,276
It's...

35
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,903
significantly up.

36
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,821
By how much?

37
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,948
[Mark] There are roughly
four times as many threats

38
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,950
on any given day since you took office.

39
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,577
Now it's twice that since Francis died.

40
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,581
I thought everyone loves a widow.

41
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,084
Not if she's also
Commander-in-Chief, I guess.

42
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,216
These are not rational people,
Madam President.

43
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,839
But, ma'am, as far as today's threat,

44
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,608
regarding your first
scheduled appearance...

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,092
We're canceling the appearance.

46
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,804
We're not canceling.

47
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:19,889
It's a military base.

48
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,517
That's got to be the safest place on Earth
for a president.

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,353
An anonymous soldier
has made a serious threat...

50
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,231
"To shoot me in the cunt on behalf
of the United States of America."

51
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,400
Yes, Mark, I heard.
The threat's unconfirmed.

52
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,203
He says he's among
those shipping out today.

53
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,296
- Anyone can claim that.
- [Mark] And that you have no right

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,698
waging war in Syria. You, in particular.

55
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,867
I think we stay away.
Rick, don't you agree?

56
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,494
There's no proof the threat is credible.
Isn't that right, Rick?

57
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,705
Our intelligence division
is investigating,

58
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,624
and the advance team is already there,
but it'll take at least a day

59
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,334
to comb through that base.

60
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,462
I think what the vice president says
is the best course.

61
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,091
- Maybe by tomorrow you could...
- Tomorrow is the fifth of July.

62
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,512
- Yes, ma'am.
- So what do you suggest I do?

63
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,057
- Wish the nation a happy belated birthday?
- Our only concern is your safety...

64
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,434
[Claire] We're not cancelling.

65
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,687
I am sending those soldiers
onto a battlefield.

66
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,815
The first female president
of the United States

67
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,027
is not gonna keep her mouth shut
on the Fourth of fucking July.

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,529
[theme song plays]

69
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,462
[Mark] Lieutenant General Gallagher
would understand.

70
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,008
- I could appear instead. Speak for you.
- Stop.

71
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,431
Is it my safety that concerns you,

72
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,725
or my potential endorsement of Gallagher?

73
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,435
Your safety first, of course.

74
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,563
But singling her out,
that's a provocation.

75
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,897
And so?

76
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,941
I can't provoke them?

77
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,444
You're forwarding a candidate
the Shepherds are against,

78
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,820
in their home state.

79
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,699
- After months of negotiation.
- This is not a negotiation,

80
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,327
this is an ultimatum.
Sign the bill or what?

81
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,786
Or what, Mark?

82
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,584
When Francis was looking
to finance his foundation,

83
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,170
why did you point him
towards Bill and Annette?

84
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,422
I didn't. Raymond Tusk arranged it.

85
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,215
Or maybe they reached out to him?

86
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,551
I don't remember.

87
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,180
I... What does it matter?
They're working with you now.

88
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,476
I need to meet
with the Shepherds directly.

89
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,435
Madam President.

90
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
I'll see them before my appearance
at the base.

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,897
- You can't.
- I what?

92
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,942
I'll let them know.

93
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,527
Thank you.

94
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,621
You're due at the base by 4:45,
which will have you back here by 8:30.

95
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,123
The fireworks show
begins right after nine.

96
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,086
And the <i>Examiner</i> would love your okay
on the photos.

97
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,062
Is there any progress
on the source of the sound?

98
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,897
The GSA is still looking into it.

99
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,584
They're checking the floorboards
above and below, in case there's...

100
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,318
I don't want to wait anymore.

101
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,362
Please tell the executive housekeeper

102
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,906
I'd like the former president's belongings
packed up.

103
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,366
I'll have it taken care of.

104
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,913
[double thud]

105
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,128
[double thud]

106
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,933
[double thud]

107
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,151
[double thud]

108
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,122
[double thud] [double thud]

109
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,113
[double thud]

110
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,873
[sirens wailing in the distance]

111
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,381
It's not true what he told you
all those years ago.

112
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,468
That there are two kinds,
useful and useless.

113
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,679
There's only one kind.

114
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,306
Pain is pain.

115
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,192
Francis...

116
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,902
[bird chirping]

117
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,195
I'm done with you.

118
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
There.

119
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,585
No more pain.

120
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,845
[Seth] You do this all day?

121
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,851
I'm under psychiatric observation, Seth.
This is what you do.

122
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,857
Who's your new tailor?

123
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,526
You gotta look the part.

124
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,155
So, when do they decide

125
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,115
whether you're crazy or not?

126
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,659
Because if you're not,

127
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,703
you should come work for us.

128
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,537
Us?

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,834
Have you been working there
for about five minutes?

130
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,252
It's been a month, actually.

131
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,298
So his body wasn't even cold.

132
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,872
It's what he would have wanted.

133
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,069
The Underwood Foundation
was basically gonna be modeled

134
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,613
after the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

135
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,347
I don't need the job.

136
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,018
Oh. Well, for a confessed murderer,
you're pretty confident.

137
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,354
I'm about to be pardoned.

138
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,896
Pardon?

139
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,238
You really think
that she's gonna give you one?

140
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,570
As usual, you don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

141
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,865
You know, there wasn't the kind of crowd
that you'd expect for him

142
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,075
down there in Gaffney.

143
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,701
He wanted to be buried in Arlington.

144
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,828
Not next to his father.

145
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,413
That's not what his wife said.

146
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,710
Tell me something.

147
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,630
She even shed a tear?

148
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,674
You know...

149
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,843
I'm almost envious, to tell you the truth.

150
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,138
That even beyond the grave,

151
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,141
you'd do anything for Francis Underwood.

152
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,191
Doug, do you have my lighter?

153
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,657
Much obliged.

154
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,580
Was that who I thought it was?

155
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,625
Fred Amburg? He went off the deep end?

156
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,627
Everyone has problems, Seth.

157
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,463
Especially the ones who think they don't.

158
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,098
[jazz music playing]

159
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,814
[door hinges creak]

160
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,650
- Claire.
- Annette.

161
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,945
Oh, did you get my note?

162
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,115
Oh, I haven't had the courage
to read the condolences yet.

163
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,244
It's good to see you finally out
and about.

164
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,288
Oh, what you've been through.

165
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,791
You know all about it.

166
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,503
Well, for a long time,
I pretended he was still alive.

167
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,756
Out of town.

168
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,049
It was our son Duncan
that really saved me.

169
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,553
Of course, we weren't married
anywhere near as long as you and Frank.

170
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Claire Hale.

171
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,807
Nine years.

172
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,059
Late spring,

Sun Valley.

174
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:52,562
[Claire chuckles]

175
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,816
You look exactly the same.

176
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,027
Well, it's cities that age you,

177
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,029
it's what I tell everyone.

178
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,118
I hope you don't mind saying hello
to a few of our closest friends.

179
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,247
They're just here for a cocktail
before the...

180
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,292
the sun goes down
and the rest of the party shows up.

181
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,962
My sister's fireworks show have become
a bit of a tradition.

182
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,511
Don't worry. They know how to be discreet.

183
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,769
Scotty here just got his hands
on Nexis Security.

184
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,230
I heard you are speaking
to the vice president about this.

185
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,023
It's a company of peacekeepers, mostly.

186
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,318
Oh, tremendous potential
to create global partnerships.

187
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,530
Your husband helped me secure the deal.
I wanted to bring him onto the Board.

188
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,448
Bill was saying...

189
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,033
Yes, I was just saying.

190
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:50,704
Why in the world do they play
the "1812 Overture" at a fireworks show?

191
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,541
It's Russian, for Chrissakes,
in every sense.

192
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,293
This is Tabitha.

193
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,128
Oh. Peters, I know.

194
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,338
Frank...

195
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,551
- Wasn't he planning to be here today?
- He was.

196
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,344
You must miss him terribly.

197
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,139
I had some long
and hard-fought conversations with him.

198
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,726
He was going to help me resolve this
AFL-CIO thing

199
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,770
that's been going on forever
out in Nevada,

200
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,605
with your help, of course.

201
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,275
When the union stands
in the way of innovation,

202
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,277
it's sentencing itself to death.

203
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,322
[Tabitha] I do admire the way you hang on
to your party.

204
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,699
Your loyalty.

205
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,327
Did I hear that
Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher

206
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,246
will be appearing with you later today?

207
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,460
I think she'd make an excellent candidate,

208
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,921
if she decides to run, of course.

209
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,173
Oh, she's going to run.

210
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,598
The president is on a tight schedule.

211
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,023
Excuse me.

212
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,029
[birds cawing]

213
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, this is a surprise.

214
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,921
You know how Midwesterners
feel about those.

215
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,132
Oh, don't listen to him.
It's about time you came out.

216
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,635
Seems we have some things to discuss.

217
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,886
Yeah.

218
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:32,222
Well, as far as this special election
is concerned, Claire,

219
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,517
you need to know that
the soon-to-be-retiring Miss Gallagher

220
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,645
is out of question.

221
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,650
And I'm happy to see we're both fans
of the Declaration of Independence,

222
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,318
unalienable rights and all that.

223
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,904
But it says down here in the speech
you're gonna give later...

224
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,822
Miss Gallagher has my support.

225
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,660
I believe Mark conveyed our concerns.

226
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,828
And communicated mine, I hope.

227
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,666
She's a tax and spend Democrat
underneath that uniform.

228
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,377
- A patriot with a pristine resume.
- Claire.

229
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,296
Who is very vocal about keeping
private contractors away

230
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,775
- from US military operations.
- Even as a negotiating point,

231
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,879
you can do better than her.

232
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,094
And I am tired of these delays,
Madam President.

233
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,595
It is time for you to deliver.

234
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,559
- Your husband and I had an agreement.
- Francis is dead.

235
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,937
- Promises were made.
- Not by me.

236
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,026
Just like you, I like to negotiate
my own agreements.

237
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,613
And make no mistake about it,
the lieutenant general is not an anomaly.

238
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,741
I know that. I've seen your list
of candidates for the midterms...

239
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,911
- Yes, mostly women.
- I don't care what sex they are.

240
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,622
And for the record,
nobody loves women more than me.

241
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,083
But this slate of yours,
it will bankrupt the country.

242
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,044
They will set us back a generation.
They will completely...

243
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,297
Support me and what I stand for.

244
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,590
And what is that?

245
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,342
- Oh, come on, Bill.
- No, no. Tell me.

246
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,011
I wanna know. What's your mission?

247
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,263
- I wanna know what your platform is.
- Oh, please.

248
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,557
I know you'd like
to drown DC all at once.

249
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,101
But I'm gonna tell you right now,
I cannot let that happen.

250
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,562
I still believe in government
and its ability

251
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,398
to make the everyday lives
of its citizens better.

252
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,442
- Yeah.
- You don't wanna support my slate,

253
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,525
that's fine.

254
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,155
- Claire...
- All I ask is stay out of the way.

255
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,535
There's a bill sitting on your desk.

256
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,122
A bill that took years...

257
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,208
and money to get passed.

258
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,793
You sign that,

259
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,838
and I know I got a friend
in the White House.

260
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,549
If not...

261
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,886
- Then I don't.
- Enough.

262
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,391
Nothing good happens to you
when she's around.

263
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,476
Nothing.

264
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,145
Why did you come out for Francis?

265
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,105
For his foundation?

266
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,232
I don't think you ever really liked him.

267
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,695
Probably never respected him.
Why back him now?

268
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,199
Because he gave us you.

269
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,747
Tell our friends I'll be back down
in time for the fireworks.

270
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,342
Just so you know, I always liked Frank.

271
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,137
His desperation.

272
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,060
I'm sorry you can't stay.

273
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,146
I do enjoy curating our little show.

274
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,275
I collect a variety of fireworks shells
as I travel.

275
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,653
Italy, Spain, China.

276
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,949
Do you know what the hardest color
to make is?

277
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,328
- Red?
- No, red's easy.

278
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,955
White's easy.

279
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,249
It's blue.

280
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,418
Very tricky chemistry
involving copper and heat.

281
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,463
A truly bright blue is extremely elusive.

282
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,468
Whatever Francis promised or did...

283
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,054
is buried with him.

284
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,223
No, I know.

285
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,977
We all need to let him go.

286
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,230
Start from some kind of scratch.

287
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,276
Though it must haunt you,

288
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,821
the fact that he died next to you in bed.

289
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,496
Hon...

290
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,250
be patient.

291
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,900
- [woman] She doesn't like the name?
- [man] I think she finds it incomplete.

292
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,569
[woman] What's wrong with
the Comprehensive Safety Act?

293
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,112
[man 2] Comprehensive Chemical Safety Act?

294
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,030
[man] Or we could go back
to the Smarter Safety Act.

295
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,057
- Would she like "Smarter" better?
- No, we need a good acronym.

296
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,268
Mr. Vice President? Mark?

297
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,729
Yeah. Agreed.

298
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,901
[man] At one point, we talked about
the Repeal Unsafe Regulation Act.

299
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,736
That's RURAL if we come up with an L.

300
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,737
Legislation?

301
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,464
That doesn't make sense
with the rest of it.

302
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,741
"RURAL" is too hard to say.
"SAFE" is good.

303
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,409
Safety. Future.

304
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,705
- I like "FUTURE."
- Federal Universal Toxic and Unsafe...

305
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,041
- Regulation Eradication.
- [Mark] Okay.

306
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,793
- The FUTURE Act.
- That could work.

307
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:16,632
May I ask, Mr. Vice President,
does her hesitation go beyond the name?

308
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,427
She'll come around. I'm guessing...

309
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,198
- by the end of the day.
- [phone vibrating]

310
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,765
Because in one form or another,

311
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,448
- this bill has been on her desk since...
- She'll sign it, Henry.

312
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,062
- [beeps]
- Bill.

313
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,400
What do you want me to do?

314
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,444
Yank her from her own military base?

315
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,322
[whoosh]

316
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,702
When, in the course of human events,
it becomes necessary

317
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,538
for one people
to dissolve the political bands

318
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,249
which have connected them with another,

319
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,542
you just have to do it.

320
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,003
Sever the relationship.

321
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,340
Our nation's founding document,

322
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,425
the Declaration of Independence...

323
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,927
America's independence...

324
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,721
was hard-fought and hard-won.

325
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,556
Are you still there?

326
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,727
Our Founding Fathers
imagined a nation that was free.

327
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,980
Free from despotism.

328
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,565
Free from absolute tyranny.

329
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,318
Free from an oppressive king.

330
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,903
Do you miss Francis?

331
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,989
Tyrants come in many forms.

332
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:27,536
From the American oligarchs trying
to change the very fabric of our society,

333
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,998
to autocrats threatening from abroad.

334
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,795
Now, each one of us
has to defend our destiny.

335
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,256
And as I see it,

336
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,969
the fight against tyranny
is the only justification for war.

337
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:49,683
My first 100 days as president
have been difficult.

338
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,477
I lost my husband.

339
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,315
We were about
to celebrate 30 years together.

340
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,318
But I know what he would want.

341
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,696
For me to stop mourning and carry on.

342
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,034
With the help of women like
Lieutenant General Nancy Gallagher,

343
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,494
my presidency will not rest.

344
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,414
Nancy has been an inspiration to me.

345
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,750
A tireless warrior.

346
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,795
I promise her and all of you
that I will work on behalf of the rights

347
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,758
and freedoms earned over the last
241 years of our democracy.

348
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,553
As I look into the eyes

349
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,348
of you brave soldiers
standing before me today...

350
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,349
Here's the thing.

351
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,476
I'm feeling so proud right now.

352
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,936
Proud to be your Commander-in-Chief.

353
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,814
Whatever Francis told you
the last five years,

354
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,274
don't believe a word of it.

355
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,569
Our country is 241 years old, my friends.

356
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,655
Let's wish this great nation
a happy birthday.

357
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,948
Say it with me.

358
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,368
Happy birthday, America!

359
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,204
[all] Happy Birthday, America!

360
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,806
It's going to be different for you and me.

361
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,915
[Claire] <i>One more time.</i>

362
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,291
I'm going to tell you the truth.

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,835
[all] Happy Birthday, America.

364
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,977
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

365
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,466
Thank you for your service.

366
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,469
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

367
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,349
I want you to know how wonderful it is
to be here and meet

368
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,017
all of you new recruits.

369
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,310
So, thank you.

370
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,937
Thank you for your service.

371
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,605
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

372
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,441
Thank you for your service.
Where are you from, private?

373
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,026
Kalamazoo, Mr. President.

374
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,312
- Excuse me, Madam President.
- That's quite all right.

375
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,198
I actually hate "Madam."

376
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,742
Makes me sound like I'm running a brothel
and not a country.

377
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,471
- [chuckles] Thank you for your service.
- Thank you, Madam President.

378
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,038
Thank you for your service.

379
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,790
And where are you from, Pvt. Burton?

380
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,125
South Bend, ma'am.

381
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,085
Oh, I love Indiana.

382
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,504
I enlisted right before you took office.

383
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,507
Well, I promise you
and every woman in this country

384
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,008
that during my presidency

385
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,386
the key components
of the Equal Rights Amendment

386
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,388
will finally pass.

387
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,098
I'm going to make sure of it.

388
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,600
I want you to know I support you.

389
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,270
[Burton] Do you even have a plan?

390
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,230
What did you say?

391
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,817
One that won't get us all killed?

392
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,485
[man] Oh, man...

393
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,072
Would you have asked me that
if I were a man?

394
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,579
- [reporters shouting]
- [camera shutters clicking]

395
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,791
[woman] Madam President!

396
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,212
- [shouting continues]
- [man] One question, please!

397
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,623
[muffle double thud, echoes]

398
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,993
[sighs]
How much longer till we get to the plane?

399
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,579
Just another 25 minutes or so,
Madam President.

400
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,623
Okay, thank you. [gasps]

401
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,041
- [man] Shit!
- [engine revving]

402
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,376
[siren wailing]

403
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,499
- [man] Is she shot?
- [man 2] Stay down, stay down!

404
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,964
Shots fired! Shots fired!

405
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,328
Are you okay, Madam President?
- Are you all right? - Yes.

406
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,302
[man 2] Lone Star is safe.

407
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,393
[echoing]

408
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,940
[gasps, whimpers]

409
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,127
[phone vibrates] [Rick] Sir, someone
just tried to kill the president.

410
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,708
I just got the alert. Is she all right?

411
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,250
[Rick] This way.

412
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,049
- [chattering over police scanner]
- [siren wailing in the distance]

413
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,560
Lincoln,

414
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,481
Garfield, McKinley, Kennedy.

415
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,193
Successful assassinations, total of four.

416
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,908
The attempts... Nine?

417
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,246
Jackson, both Roosevelts.

418
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,750
Truman. Ford twice.

419
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,501
Reagan...

420
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,005
the first Underwood and...

421
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,510
I will say, whoever tried to kill me,

422
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:23,099
perversely, it's the first sign
of real respect I've gotten in 100 days.

423
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,444
Somebody tried to kill her.

424
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,738
Bill.

425
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,493
Can you blame them?

426
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,955
The Underwoods
have always been hard of hearing.

427
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,750
She's not him.

428
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,251
No, no.

429
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,586
She is not.

430
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,963
<i>You </i>know that better than anyone.

431
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,634
Is it public?

432
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,471
Secret Service shut it down.
Standard procedure, apparently.

433
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,848
- [fireworks whistle and pop]
- Threats beget threats.

434
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,350
[crowd exclaims]

435
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,433
Bill...

436
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,853
were you behind this?

437
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,315
- [fireworks booming]
- [carousel music playing]

438
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,650
We're gonna miss the show.

439
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,861
[crowd cheering]

440
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,619
- How are y'all?
- Madam President.

441
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,703
Hi, I'm so sorry.

442
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,580
I want to apologize
for the late departure.

443
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,667
I know you all have families
and festivities waiting.

444
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,087
Madam President,
may I ask what happened?

445
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:39,050
Oh, the Beast was re-routed due
to security concerns. Pretty routine.

446
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,138
I know it's been a while
since I've been back here.

447
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,849
I just wanted to wish you all
a very happy Fourth,

448
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,602
even if you're gonna be celebrating it
on the fifth. I'm so sorry.

449
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,188
Your speech, afterwards with...

450
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,023
Yes, the new recruit.

451
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,486
If a new recruit, especially a female one,
can't speak her mind,

452
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,781
I don't know what kind of country
we actually are.

453
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,743
[reporters muttering indistinctly]

454
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,954
And be sure to tell us
if you run out of beer.

455
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,248
Because I am sure
there's a couple of cases left over

456
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,876
- from the Carter administration.
- [laughter]

457
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,878
And you're new.

458
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,299
Yes, ma'am. Melody Cruz.
I'm with Beltway Television.

459
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,885
Well, I hope everyone
is making you feel at home.

460
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,261
Very much so.

461
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,096
It's an honor to finally meet you.

462
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,973
I'm a bit overwhelmed, sorry.

463
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,726
- Don't worry, I don't bite.
- No, I know.

464
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,773
It's strange, I was supposed
to interview your husband.

465
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,984
It was scheduled for a few days
after he died.

466
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,655
It was going to be an exclusive.
We'd had a number of pre-interviews.

467
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,657
Questions we'd agreed on.

468
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,285
Questions like?

469
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,790
Like, was the president
going to pardon him?

470
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,750
And when?

471
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,753
Will you? Even now, posthumously?

472
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,176
I know you did an exclusive
with <i>The New York Examiner,</i>

473
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,596
but I'm guessing that's only
going to scratch the surface.

474
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,015
I bet you have more to say

475
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,856
- about the state of your marriage...
- Miss...

476
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,186
Cruz, is it?

477
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,021
I don't know if anyone's told you,

478
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,184
but when the president visits
this part of the plane,

479
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,792
it's usually considered off the record.

480
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,462
But you can ask my press secretary
anything you like

481
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,686
once we're back on the ground.

482
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,500
You're especially quiet this evening.

483
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,711
[Doug] Maybe I'm a little agitated.

484
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,845
Our patients don't do too well
when it comes to fireworks.

485
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,847
Ah. Pardon me.

486
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,474
[firework whistling, phone chimes]

487
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,145
Yes?

488
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,108
I don't understand why you leave that on
when we're meeting.

489
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,237
Well, it's not like you're saying
anything different or new.

490
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,115
Your dedication to your script
would be admirable

491
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,033
if it weren't so concerning.

492
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,664
In a few weeks,
I'll be appearing at a hearing

493
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,166
regarding your state of mind

494
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,253
and when it comes to your confession,

495
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,715
even a guilty man
changes his story now and then.

496
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,220
Who do you answer to?

497
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,015
I mean, who do you work for?

498
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,310
- You.
- [scoffs]

499
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,855
That's the idea, anyway.

500
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,191
Everybody works for somebody.

501
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,950
I worked for a man who refused to fail.

502
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,662
I respected that.

503
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,206
I appreciated it.

504
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,130
I'd be dead without him.

505
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,131
Why?

506
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,563
I was working as an aide
for a congressman.

507
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,191
He was idealistic and naive.

508
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,568
Had one-term written all over him.

509
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,615
But I needed a job, a place to be.

510
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,952
I was barely keeping it together.

511
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,041
Francis and I met at some function.

512
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,669
You know, the kind you stand up at.

513
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,884
I don't know how he knew,
but I had eight bottles in my trunk.

514
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,172
I got through four that night
when he came to my door.

515
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,016
I don't remember much.

516
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,352
Not clearly.

517
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,399
He took me to his home.

518
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,360
But Claire...

519
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,615
Francis got me dry.

520
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,412
I shook so badly
I thought I was gonna die.

521
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,041
And then when I was finally got clean,

522
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,752
he gave me my first job.

523
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,131
As an aide?

524
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,718
Hmm. Sort of.

525
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,180
He asked me to go talk
to Congressman Kyle from Iowa.

526
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,973
To what end?

527
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,269
To persuade him.

528
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,273
And I did.

529
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,194
[sighs]

530
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,488
But Claire...

531
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,950
The way she treated him,

532
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,871
in life and in death...

533
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,751
[exhales]

534
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,132
But you pay a price,
when you work for somebody like him.

535
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,426
Somebody you owe.

536
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,604
Somebody close to me died
in a car accident.

537
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,234
That's how I broke the terms
of my house arrest.

538
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,198
I went to see the site of her wreck.

539
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,160
It was twisted on the side of the road.

540
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,749
I just stood there.

541
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,585
An accident?

542
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,839
So they said.

543
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,927
And Zoe Barnes?

544
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,348
I killed her.

545
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,726
For the president.

546
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,275
[double thud]

547
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,572
That's what he used to do when he won.

548
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:23,204
What did he leave you with?

549
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,299
Last thing that Francis gave me
was the letter opener from his desk.

550
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,845
I mean, I chose it, but...

551
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,935
But I guess really the last thing
he gave me was an apology.

552
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,106
I spoke to him the night he died.

553
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,075
- [clock ticking]
- [crickets chirping in the distance]

554
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,018
[sighs]

555
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,150
[bottles rattling]

556
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,764
[beeping]

557
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,149
[beeping continues]

558
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,243
[Claire] <i>My presidency will not rest.</i>

559
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,705
<i>Nancy has been an inspiration to me.
A tireless warrior.</i>

560
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,542
<i>I promise her and all of you
that I will work on behalf of the rights</i>

561
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,672
<i>and freedoms earned
over the last 241 years of our democracy.</i>

562
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,299
<i>Tyrants come in many forms...</i>

563
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,259
Pathetic.

564
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,011
<i>From the American oligarchs trying
to change the very...</i>

565
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,898
[Mark] Are you sure you don't want
to take an hour or two to...

566
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,359
Mark. I'm inside the White House.

567
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,945
There's only two of us in the Oval,
so unless you're packing,

568
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,490
- it's literally the safest place I can be.
- Well, I'm not packing, Madam President,

569
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,702
but no one would fault you
for taking a breath for a minute.

570
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,955
I'm breathing just fine.

571
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,208
Can we keep news of this contained?

572
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,753
- I've taken every possible step, I think.
- So who is he?

573
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,258
Well, they did forensics on the route.

574
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,552
Compared notes with the aerial detail.

575
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,055
Homeland Secretary and the Bureau
were brought in.

576
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,101
He never left the place
he took the shot from.

577
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,568
Can you answer a single question directly
and simply?

578
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:47,992
He shot himself in the head
with his own US military-issued handgun.

579
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,620
And we're sure he's the one?

580
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,789
Yeah. Pro-militia. Anti-government.

581
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,209
Dishonorably discharged last year.
All the typical markers.

582
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,045
Secret Service is confident.

583
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,088
And the Bureau's investigating.

584
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,011
How did Bill Shepherd get his hands
on my speech?

585
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,680
What? Um...

586
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,975
Well, the press usually gets it
hours before.

587
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,269
It wouldn't be that hard
to access a copy, I guess.

588
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,274
I won't be signing that today.

589
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:23,944
[sighs]

590
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,324
You went there to declare
your independence, and you declared war.

591
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,325
That was a mistake.

592
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,303
No, the mistake was I didn't hire
a chief of staff,

593
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,007
and things are slipping
through the cracks.

594
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,079
That's where I have to disagree with you.
We need to keep this circle small.

595
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,460
You know, Francis warned me about you.

596
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,381
[sighs]

597
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,801
I assure you, I serve at your pleasure,
Madam President.

598
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:50,179
You need to stop meeting in my office
without me.

599
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,016
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,704
[Nathan] Secret Service took the lead.
But do you believe the theory?

601
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,534
That it was a disgruntled service person
who took a shot at me?

602
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,952
PID does.

603
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,163
I'm asking what you think.

604
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:23,129
[sighs] It depends if it was a warning
or an actual attempt.

605
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,842
Given the accuracy, the shooter
would have been informed enough to know

606
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,803
that a .50 caliber round
wouldn't penetrate the Beast.

607
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,681
I think he wanted to scare you.

608
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,766
On behalf of someone.

609
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,394
Lots of people make threats
against sitting presidents.

610
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,188
I'm starting to believe
Francis was murdered.

611
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,738
Before he died, he aligned himself
with some very powerful people.

612
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,883
And I think they turned on him,
and they wanted him dead,

613
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,784
and I think they want me dead, too.

614
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,788
Do you think that sounds crazy?

615
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,916
No, ma'am.

616
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,128
But I think we need to bring in
Special Agent Bowman...

617
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,505
Of these people, these powerful families,

618
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,050
they advocate
dismantling intelligence agencies.

619
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,303
CIA, FBI, Homeland.

620
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,553
You know that, right?

621
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,347
- Ma'am...
- We cannot bring

622
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,475
anyone else in at the moment.

623
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,686
I'm relying on you

624
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,397
the way I know my husband could.

625
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,941
So, please see what you can find.

626
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,825
Is it ever Nate

627
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,410
or always Nathan?

628
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Nathan.

629
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:41,999
Like Francis.

630
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,542
For me, anyway.

631
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,383
Oh, have you spoken to Doug Stamper?

632
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,428
No.

633
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,682
I'm so worried about him.

634
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,645
He did things no one
in this White House should be proud of.

635
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,539
[sighs]

636
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,376
[clamoring]

637
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,627
Hey, Mom.

638
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,713
[Annette]
<i>How many people do you have there?</i>

639
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,006
Not many.

640
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,175
Nobody that interesting, anyway.

641
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,844
Her visit to the base.

642
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,429
Independence speech,

643
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,890
<i>even the naughty soldier
is playing well for her.</i>

644
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,434
Her charmed life persists.

645
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,937
<i>Tell Uncle Bill we should step up.</i>

646
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,856
I can manage the narrative. De-charm her.

647
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,316
<i>He won't like that.</i>

648
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,777
He's not going to like any of it,
so what's the difference?

649
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,948
- I don't know.
- Mom, just say the word.

650
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,242
Trust me.

651
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,246
Don't do a thing
until I get back to you.

652
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,539
[beep]

653
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,625
- [fireworks popping]
- [indistinct chatter]

654
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,852
Can't even tell you're still in DC.

655
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,522
There are parts of this city
that will always remain a secret.

656
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,804
I don't think I'll be welcome back

657
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,615
in the White House press pool
anytime soon, FYI.

658
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,366
Doesn't matter.

659
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,995
She won't speak to me.

660
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,873
- An interview? Not after...
- She will.

661
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,967
[Rosen] <i>Tonight, for the first time,</i>
<i>he was forthcoming.</i>

662
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,802
[Claire] But still saying he's guilty?

663
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,346
<i>Yeah, as always.</i>

664
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,932
And did he mention Mr. Grayson by name?

665
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,685
<i>No. He was just more distressed.</i>

666
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,646
So he's getting worse?

667
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,606
<i>Or better, he's finally talking.</i>

668
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,273
[door closes]

669
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,111
But the idea of his leaving the facility
anytime soon,

670
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,074
that's still out of the question.
I mean, for his own good.

671
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,867
<i>He's either guilty of the crime</i>

672
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,078
<i>- or psychotic for admitting to it.</i>
- Madam President,

673
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,343
Miss Shepherd is on the White House line.

674
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,790
[mouths]

675
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,169
Well, maybe it's time to give him
one of the antipsychotics.

676
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:36,006
Possibly. But we'd have to consider
his history of addiction.

677
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,218
By the way, in answer to your question,

678
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,178
it was a letter opener,

679
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,056
the last thing that Francis gave him
from his desk.

680
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,891
<i>Keep me posted, Charles.</i>

681
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,393
<i>And thank you.</i>

682
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,185
Sure.

683
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,945
[Annette in low voice] <i>Are you prepared?</i>

684
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,781
Excuse me.

685
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,493
[laughs] Don't you remember? Andover?

686
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,994
Our prep school joke?

687
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:10,290
[sighs] I'm prepared to fail the test.

688
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,127
Are you all right?

689
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:20,426
I'm sorry to call so late.
I... I heard about what happened today.

690
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,389
<i>These things have a tendency to leak out.</i>

691
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,474
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

692
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,686
It's bulletproof, the motorcade glass.

693
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,187
<i>Did they catch the guy?</i>

694
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,190
How do you know it's a guy?

695
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,651
It's always a guy, right?

696
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,369
What was it Bill wanted adjusted
in my speech?

697
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,416
<i>Oh. Something about...</i>

698
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,418
<i>freedom.</i>

699
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,424
You're in my thoughts, Claire.

700
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,217
Thank you.

701
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,221
<i>He's still with us, don't you think?</i>

702
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,305
Who? <i>Frank.</i>

703
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,770
<i>We're so glad we got to spend
so much time with him before he died.</i>

704
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,149
He told us some fascinating things.

705
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,652
He's been on my mind.

706
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,326
<i>Bill and I finally went down to Gaffney
a few days ago...</i>

707
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,622
<i>to pay our respects.</i>

708
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,499
[phone beeps]

709
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,658
[double thud]

710
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,801
[double thud]

711
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,702
- [muffled, echoing breathing]
- [double thud]

712
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,722
[noisy breathing continues]

713
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,606
[boy] Claire!

714
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,358
I shouldn't have let them.

715
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,443
I'm sorry.

716
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,236
Come on out now.

717
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,738
[horse neighing]

718
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,327
[Claire] Are you still there?

719
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,410
Yes.

720
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,338
- [boy screams]
- [horse neighs]

721
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,923
Help!

722
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,176
[crying]

723
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,137
[echoing] Help!

724
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,195
I know.

725
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,573
You want to know
what really happened to him.

726
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,743
A man like Francis doesn't just die.

727
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,495
That would be...

728
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,246
what's the word?

729
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,124
"Convenient."
