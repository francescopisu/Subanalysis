1
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:11,761
[man] Brothers and sisters,
behold, I tell you a mystery.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,806
We shall not all fall asleep,

3
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,935
but we will all be changed in an instant,

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,188
in the blink of an eye,
at the last trumpet.

5
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,066
For the trumpet will sound

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,862
and the dead will be raised incorruptible,

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,281
and we shall be changed.

8
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,951
Almighty God,

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,372
remember the mercy with which you graced
your humble servant.

10
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,836
Receive her, we pray,
into the mansions of the saints.

11
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,590
As we prepare our sister's final resting,

12
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,926
look also with love on those who mourn

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,679
and give them comfort in their loss.

14
00:00:55,847 --> 00:01:00,143
Grant this through Christ, our Lord, Amen.

15
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,811
[all] Amen.

16
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,172
[chattering]

17
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,946
- Madam President, can I ride with you?
- Of course.

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,706
[engine turns over]

19
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,477
Has he approached you?

20
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,145
Who?

21
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,189
Petrov.

22
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,819
[sighs] Didn't he just arrive?

23
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,032
If the talks on Syria have broken down,
what's he doing here?

24
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,993
It's either a good thing or a bad thing.

25
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,704
Well, which is it?

26
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,124
Madam President?

27
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,378
He was fond of Cathy.

28
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,388
I need to know that you won't stand
in the way of my handling...

29
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,974
Mark. It's done.

30
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,267
You won.

31
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,859
It was necessary to show you,

32
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,569
but not what I wanted.

33
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,613
I don't know what you're talking about.

34
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,450
You did that to both of us. You did it.

35
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,329
You involved me, you implicated me.

36
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,209
- You left him in my house.
- Mark, that's enough.

37
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,504
It doesn't matter anymore.

38
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,510
[chattering]

39
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,685
Stan, my deepest condolences.

40
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,732
This is Cathy's brother Hunter.
He flew in from Eugene.

41
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,276
Just outside Lane County.

42
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,069
[Claire] Beautiful country out there.

43
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,740
I was planning to come out anyway.

44
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,451
Stan's birthday is on the sixth.

45
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,827
Cathy and I have been...

46
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,912
back and forth for months.

47
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,873
I'm so sorry for your loss.

48
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,836
- Doug, this is Cathy's brother Hunter.
- Hi.

49
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,397
- Hey.
- [Claire] And you've met Stan.

50
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,423
- Of course.
- Thank you for coming.

51
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,927
Doug, I think, spent more time
with Cathy than anyone.

52
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,180
She didn't deserve this.

53
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,141
Honestly, it doesn't seem real.

54
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,480
Would you excuse me?

55
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,650
What time did she die?

56
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,528
I don't...

57
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,947
Sorry, I know it's a weird question.
I just...

58
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,908
I had one of those feelings that day.

59
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,038
Um... 5:43, I think.

60
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,957
Yeah, right around then.

61
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,586
Mr. President.

62
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,254
President Underwood.

63
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,509
Secretary Durant was
from a time that's passed.

64
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,386
Holbrooke, Albright...

65
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,138
They knew how to have a good meal
and some friendly conversation

66
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,015
before diplomacy got ugly.

67
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,727
It certainly won't be the same
without her.

68
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,439
I hear they have you on a short leash.

69
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,609
How could you let that happen,
Madam President?

70
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,655
Now, when we're only moments away
from crisis.

71
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,575
You know, in some cultures

72
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,037
it occurs to them
to actually honor the dead.

73
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,749
Every seven years the Malagasy people

74
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,335
exhume the bones, wrapping them in cloth,

75
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,546
so they can dance with the bodies.

76
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,175
[sighs] How does this town
rise to the occasion?

77
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,471
It's like their heads are on a swivel.

78
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,268
Yeah. What do you call those things?

79
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,561
Bobble heads?

80
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
Terrifying.

81
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,899
No, don't... Let her be.

82
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,196
You wanted her to play the part.

83
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,198
Voilà.

84
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,410
- The president.
- The president is too agreeable.

85
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,996
What did you do to her?

86
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,416
I trust her contempt
more than whatever this is.

87
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,460
Love, I know what you're capable of.

88
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,336
Hey.

89
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,383
DIA believes there are
over 100,000 Russian troops

90
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,760
- on their way to the border.
- Did you find Bugayev?

91
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,555
As of a few minutes ago,
his second in command assured me

92
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,558
that was the last contact
we would have from anyone at the Kremlin.

93
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:57,935
Except for him.

94
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,538
[Siegerson] He's requesting
a private meeting with the president.

95
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,774
- Sure.
- God damn it.

96
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,777
- Mr. President.
- Mr. Vice President.

97
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,488
You know Secretary Siegerson.

98
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,573
- Yes. Of course.
- So good to see you.

99
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,868
Madam President, excuse me.

100
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,287
Oh, yes. Excuse me a moment.

101
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,413
[man] Of course.

102
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,875
Cathy was kind to me.

103
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,212
A role model. Sensible, shrewd.

104
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,005
Fluent in French.

105
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,090
[speaks French] Rest in peace.

106
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,719
I know it's not the place, but...

107
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,139
this isn't normal, what's going on.

108
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,809
When I accepted my position,
it was to work with you and your agenda,

109
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,894
not...

110
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,478
not...

111
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,651
Certain members of our Cabinet

112
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,736
in positions related to National Security

113
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,614
have had several secret meetings
regarding Syria.

114
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,741
President Petrov has become aware

115
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,036
of their plans for sending
private contractors to the region.

116
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,495
Ma'am...

117
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,082
there are officials in the Pentagon,

118
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,543
people at the Kremlin,
who would very much like to prevent

119
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,462
- a proxy war...
- Nora, I appreciate your candor,

120
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,297
but Mark has this.

121
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,258
Ma'am, the Cabinet is his.

122
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,842
He knows what we need to do.

123
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,975
What makes me suspect
you're vying for speaker is

124
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,893
the frontrunners change day to day,

125
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,062
but everybody's second choice
remains the same.

126
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,147
- You.
- Brett, are you saying you wouldn't do it,

127
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,357
if the party asked?

128
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,401
If the party knew what was good for them.

129
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,862
This is Douglas Stamper.
He's coming on as a consultant.

130
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,322
We've met.

131
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,199
Jonah, back when Francis was whip,

132
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,244
and you,
back when you were getting us coffee.

133
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,246
I do wonder how he'd feel with some

134
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,333
of the legislation the good congressman
is putting his name on.

135
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,669
Constitution was built
on checks and balances.

136
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,962
And the people's will.

137
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,548
It's not about who the president is.

138
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,550
It's about what the office has become.

139
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,388
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me
for a minute,

140
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,391
I promised Brett here I'd introduce him
to a blue dog Democrat,

141
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,184
assuming I can find one.

142
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,825
[Jonah] I never thought I'd see him again.

143
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,897
He was in rehab.

144
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,317
And is back in the program.

145
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,987
[Rob] Those charges were dropped,
but he's still got a case chasing him.

146
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,741
If anything, my bet is
that case is chasing the president.

147
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,701
[Seth]
Petrov is no longer in the main room.

148
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,995
Secretary Siegerson is still
with Ms. Davis,

149
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,289
while the vice president's exiting.

150
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,752
And Homeland Secretary Cafferty
was just whispering with the president.

151
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,548
As for Doug Stamper,
he's with Assistant Director Green.

152
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,471
I want to know who Durant was with,

153
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,849
when and where, leading up to the moment
she was pronounced dead.

154
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,101
If I start asking around...

155
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,687
Questions bring more questions.

156
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,440
- Is this an open investigation?
- No.

157
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,027
But for any agent I work with,
I'll be the red flag.

158
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,531
Doug, the more I know,
the better it is for both of us.

159
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,242
You trust me?

160
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,665
You've always followed through.

161
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,125
Then do as I say.

162
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,801
[Claire] But what did you find?

163
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,011
Is he talking?

164
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,058
All right. Get back to me
when you know anything more.

165
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,476
Day or night.

166
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,852
[beep]

167
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,022
Is everything okay?

168
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,149
That was about Tom Yates.

169
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,443
There's been a recent charge
on his credit card.

170
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,487
The Grand Mark in Prague,

171
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,531
except it wasn't Tom.

172
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,283
He didn't make the charge.
Or any of the others.

173
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,911
- Somebody stole his...
- His identity.

174
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,749
As of now, we have no idea
where the real Tom Yates has been.

175
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,545
Well, I hope he's safe.

176
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,338
Wherever he is.

177
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,465
Me too.

178
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,141
[humming]

179
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,019
[Petrov] Oh.

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,230
Ah.

181
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,027
1945 Mouton-Rothschild.

182
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
"V" label.

183
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,495
Rothschild commissioned it
to celebrate the Allied victory

184
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,497
in the Great Patriotic War.

185
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,791
You mean World War II.

186
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,421
Hmm.
I wonder what she was saving this for.

187
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,468
Should we?

188
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,349
Ah, come on. There must be some mischief
in you somewhere.

189
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,894
Do you object?

190
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,772
Not my place.

191
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,649
And where exactly is your place?

192
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,737
I specifically asked
to meet with the president.

193
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,788
Hmm. There must be
a corkscrew somewhere, hmm?

194
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,749
She wouldn't keep these bottles in here
without one.

195
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,002
- When it comes to Syria, Mr. President...
- A moment, please.

196
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,171
Sir...

197
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,425
our only goal is stability,

198
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,011
peace, prosperity for the Syrian people.

199
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,556
We need to re-engage.
We need to re-start talks...

200
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Talks?

201
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,267
Talk, talk, talk.

202
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,020
While you're busy making side deals
with Nexis

203
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,314
and the rest of your Republican friends.

204
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,398
The Shepherds.

205
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,777
That is who you really work for, isn't it?

206
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,947
We can freeze assets,

207
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,367
put sanctions back into place.

208
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,373
Must be about...

209
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,793
7:30 at night in Damascus.

210
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,462
If we do nothing,

211
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,216
by dawn, skirmishes
between our troops and yours will begin.

212
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,928
And once Russian soldiers
start killing American soldiers,

213
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,014
the chaos will continue.

214
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,683
Or...

215
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,178
we can pull out a map of
Syria, right here, right now.

216
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,319
And you and I,
like the imperialists we are,

217
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,822
can decide who gets what.

218
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,243
Shall we?

219
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,496
I'll speak to the president.

220
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,711
Whoever decides...

221
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,881
is who you should speak to.

222
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,347
Aww. What a shame.

223
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,563
What a shame.

224
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,841
I talked to Doug. He asked me,

225
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,194
and at first I thought he was just
covering his tracks,

226
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,012
as far as the Secretary's death, but...

227
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,014
Now I wonder...

228
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,683
the nature of his questions.

229
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,269
Ma'am, I've made some calls.

230
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,146
There are some inconsistencies.

231
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,981
When she left her house. Where she died.

232
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,543
- Wait, what are you telling me?
- I'm not saying it isn't true...

233
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,485
Just a second, back up.

234
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,445
It's just hard to be certain
is all I'm saying.

235
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,786
- I'd like you to go find him.
- I can't talk to him again.

236
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,666
My fear is he'll become suspicious.

237
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,543
He knows me as someone
who does what he's told.

238
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,129
I don't understand,
If it's not him, then...

239
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,966
how did she die, for God's sake?

240
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,385
Ma'am...

241
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,595
I don't know.

242
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,776
Mr. Shepherd would like
to be kept informed in real time.

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,111
It's under control.

244
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,446
Then it shouldn't be a problem
to keep us included.

245
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,449
Do you understand how long
I've known the Shepherds?

246
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,828
Whatever you discussed with Petrov
needs to be run by him.

247
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,080
Let me enlighten you
about something, Mr. Grayson.

248
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,417
I do not need you to convey a message
between me and Bill Shepherd, okay?

249
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,211
Well, that's preferable,
as long as, and forgive me,

250
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,715
you make no decisions
when it comes to Syria without his say-so.

251
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:52,078
- Don't get over your skis, sir.- We're done here.
- I don't think... - The vice president says we are done.

252
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,435
[Linda] Doug Stamper.

253
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,982
Linda. How are you?

254
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,193
- You weren't at the funeral.
- I arrived late.

255
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,113
Out of politics, I understand?

256
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,574
President Walker made sure
I had a soft landing.

257
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,993
I'm at a university in Colorado,

258
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,496
where the water is fresh
and the air is clean.

259
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,332
- Hmm. Sounds dangerous.
- It is.

260
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,126
To think that clearly.

261
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:25,919
How are you?

262
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,338
What have you read?

263
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,673
About you?

264
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,550
Most of it.

265
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,927
The last three months of it.

266
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,264
About your supposed confession.

267
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,143
What more could I possibly add
that you haven't already read?

268
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,480
There's what you read,
and there's the truth.

269
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,066
I'm not ashamed.

270
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,986
The time away led me
to finally realize who I am.

271
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,158
Does the congressman know about you?

272
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
I mean... know.

273
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,790
With my help he's gonna be
the next speaker of the House...

274
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,292
I went to law school
with the US Attorney.

275
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,419
She's tired of waiting.

276
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,840
She's issuing a subpoena
with your name on it sometime tomorrow.

277
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,760
Tell her what you know.

278
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,097
You have a chance
to survive all this, Doug.

279
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,686
[speaking Russian] Tartus, yes?

280
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,731
But the rest of the coast...

281
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,610
can we afford to let it go?

282
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,780
Goodbye.

283
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,270
- It could work.
- [phone beeps]

284
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,785
Petrov has plans to expand the Naval base

285
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,245
to the port of Tartus.

286
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,622
The only reason
he's propping up the regime

287
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,082
is because they control the coast.

288
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,708
He needs the ports.

289
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,337
Force him to fight for those
and he'll leave the rest of Syria alone.

290
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,881
Mark...

291
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,052
the moment is here.

292
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,303
He's here.

293
00:18:59,138 --> 00:18:59,972
It can't wait.

294
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,433
I still don't understand how agreements
which haven't even been finalized yet...

295
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,811
- Doesn't matter. He got wind of it.
- From who?

296
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,772
The point is, is he is a greedy...

297
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,067
- Motherfucker, yes.
- And greedy motherfuckers always find out.

298
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,862
He's relentless.

299
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,700
I spent two years
in the Kurdish northwest,

300
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,161
outfitted rebels in the southeast.

301
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,165
I know every angle
Petrov will keep in play.

302
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,586
He has a sixth sense
when it comes to hesitation.

303
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,966
- If you need me to be in there...
- [laughs]

304
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,135
You just can't do it, can you?

305
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
What? Nothing.

306
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,767
- Mark...
- You just can't step back and trust.

307
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,769
I trust you, Mark.

308
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,107
But if the backseat president
is gonna take the wheel, you gotta drive.

309
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,071
There's a reason you and I
are alone in the world, Jane.

310
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,827
Yes, of course.

311
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,832
- How long?
- A lifetime.

312
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,920
You moved out west, right?
More time with your son.

313
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,504
As much as he'll give me.

314
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,174
- And is he still enjoying Stan...
- Claire.

315
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,426
Madam President,

316
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,887
we don't need to exchange pleasantries.

317
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,434
These days I tend to think a lot
about what might have been.

318
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,270
I'd like to apologize.

319
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,523
- For what?
- My one regret.

320
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,944
I should've been there in Gaffney.

321
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,946
Honestly,

322
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,697
it's been haunting me.

323
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,908
There was something he needed to know.

324
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,285
It was a mistake.

325
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,831
Overlooking Francis
for secretary of state.

326
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,750
- Linda, it's water under the bridge.
- No.

327
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,794
No.

328
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,004
If we hadn't,

329
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,631
I don't know.

330
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,133
Maybe everything
would have been different.

331
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,970
For who?

332
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,388
This country.

333
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,600
Obviously, there's no way for me
to tell him that now.

334
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,144
The least I can do is tell you.

335
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,438
There is no need for that.

336
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,316
How do you expect to separate yourself
from his crimes?

337
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,196
As corrupt as these politics
we put up with have become...

338
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,284
[scoffs]
how can the people against you not use it?

339
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,122
You thought you got away
with it all, Claire.

340
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,416
But that remains to be seen.

341
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,423
Everything happens exactly as it should.

342
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,217
Nice seeing you.

343
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,567
[Jane] What are you up to?

344
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,405
I'm thinking about mortality.

345
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,533
I think a lot of us are doing that today.

346
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,577
We're about to have a meeting.

347
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,038
I can't be a part of it.
Viktor knows me all too well.

348
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,497
I'm on board.

349
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,501
Claire, I see you.
I told Mark not to worry about it.

350
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,396
But I have an inkling
that's not necessarily...

351
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,547
Spare me your inkling, Jane.

352
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,718
This deal is for your own good.

353
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,470
It's about the whole region.

354
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,889
Our presence. Our authority.

355
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,851
Mark and Marcy can do the heavy lifting.

356
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,190
Help me prevent a war
from happening today.

357
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,736
Any more instability and everybody loses.
Help me avert that.

358
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,282
I promise you...

359
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,870
I will chip away
at Bill and Annette Shepherd.

360
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,375
Because the only way
to truly take them down

361
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,753
is one piece at a time.

362
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
What do you think really happened
to Cathy?

363
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,019
Okay.

364
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,481
I guess you got lucky then.

365
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,735
No one is that lucky.

366
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,742
The president is willing
to leave the coast uncontested.

367
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,078
- Tartus...
- That port is already ours.

368
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,413
[Mark] And will remain so.

369
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,332
We'll keep our forces away
from the entire Western coast.

370
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,709
This will give you unfettered access
to the Mediterranean.

371
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,379
- No.
- Sir, the Sixth Fleet is en route.

372
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,005
- No.
- If you want a naval standoff...

373
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,299
No! Let's not pretend.

374
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,428
What's really at stake here
is your country lining its pockets and...

375
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,679
[knocks on door]

376
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,181
Madam President,

377
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,808
Mr. President,

378
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,686
- the vice president asked me to join.
- Mr. Grayson...

379
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,937
[Seth] On behalf of a company

380
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,060
- with subsidiaries in the Middle East.
- Excuse me.

381
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,358
We want to ensure
that we're part of the solution.

382
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,611
This will signal to the world
that Russia is back.

383
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,381
- Russia's back?
- [Nora] Mr. Vice President,

384
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,366
there are terms being negotiated here
that need to be discussed...

385
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,534
Christ!

386
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,080
If Secretary Durant were here,
we'd be long past this posturing

387
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,833
- and dealing with the real question.
- Yes, peace in the region.

388
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,793
Peace? Really?

389
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,713
You want to use peace to decide

390
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,467
who will rebuild this <i>pizdets?</i>

391
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,427
[Mark]
I don't understand what that means,

392
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,805
- Mr. President.
- That means clusterfuck.

393
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,349
Sir, stability in the region
helps all of us.

394
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,060
You want to give me the West
and take the East?

395
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,646
That's a first.

396
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,398
So, here's what I want.

397
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,734
The ports, yes, of course.

398
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:50,322
But I also want Russian exclusivity
on all offshore oil and gas exploration.

399
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,908
- [Seth] I think we need to wait.
- Shut up.

400
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,333
We can't be in a position
where we can get in,

401
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,768
and we can't get our resources out.

402
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,039
[Petrov] If history
has taught us anything, it's that

403
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,291
the Americans always find a way to leave,

404
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,126
no matter what it costs them.

405
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,835
So...

406
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,632
thoughts, Madam President?

407
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,470
Anything?

408
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,269
I concur with the vice president.

409
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,023
[Petrov] Hmm.

410
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,070
I believe we have much to consider.

411
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,626
Playing incompetent is so exhausting.

412
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,797
Hey.

413
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,109
Here's a copy of the president's remarks
for the secretary's memorial this evening.

414
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,635
I already have a copy.

415
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,887
It includes the changes she made
in the car.

416
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,764
Right. Thank you.

417
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,312
Hey. Is it true Tom Yates is missing?

418
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,022
I believe so.

419
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,527
Oh. Is it true he had an affair
with somebody in the White House?

420
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,445
Was it you?

421
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,281
Excuse me.

422
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,660
I'll look through this.

423
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,953
[scoffs]

424
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,919
[birds chirping]

425
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
[Claire] Thank you.

426
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,639
- I don't like liars.
- Me neither.

427
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,284
Why would you let me believe...

428
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,436
It seemed like you wanted me
to be the one responsible for Cathy.

429
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,022
That it might be useful to you somehow.

430
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,653
Every time I plan to quit,
something happens.

431
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,908
Francis would certainly be disappointed
in me.

432
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,080
Terrible habit.

433
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,876
Helped me though when I quit drinking.

434
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,964
Don't say anything
to the US attorney, Doug.

435
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,841
She's working with the Shepherds.

436
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,971
I pardon you tonight, and anything else
she has will be my problem.

437
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,892
I'll always be a problem for you.

438
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,810
What do you want from me, Doug?

439
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,396
You're the one
with all the leverage here.

440
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,525
Congressman Cole.
I'll put him on my ticket 2020.

441
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,362
Mark won't survive, I'm sure of it.

442
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,073
2024, Brett Cole will be the president.

443
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,200
And you will be back in the White House.

444
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,663
We can make him president,

445
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,707
just like we did with Francis.

446
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,044
Cole will mean a split ticket.

447
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,756
And that might be the very best thing
for this country.

448
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,136
Pardon Francis as well.

449
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,558
If I do that, I could get impeached.

450
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,642
No.

451
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,855
You're a survivor.
You've proven that much.

452
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,692
Pardon him as well.

453
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,029
Bill's gonna hate anything

454
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,073
even approaching a partnership
with the Kremlin.

455
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,866
It's his sister who holds a grudge.

456
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,618
But still, you have no choice.

457
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,206
I mean, in my experience,
once the chaos tips into forever,

458
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,290
you've got nothing.

459
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,292
And we're very close to forever.

460
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,215
And she said nothing.

461
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,720
It really bothers you, doesn't it?

462
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,555
When you can't figure a person out.

463
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,267
- Especially when you're attracted.
- Oh, my God, what are you...

464
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,105
I am not involved with Claire Underwood.

465
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,899
I'm talking about Annette.

466
00:28:55,984 --> 00:29:00,384
I'm not involved with anyone at the moment. Every time I
see the both of you together, it brings back memories.

467
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,741
[Mark scoffs]

468
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,161
Never thought you'd step out
from behind the scenes.

469
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,913
Well, wherever I can do the most good,
Congressman.

470
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,374
[scoffs] He hasn't changed. Not at all.

471
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,917
Blessing and a curse.

472
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,421
I haven't forgotten
everything you did for me.

473
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,841
Oh, you made it to the House
with or without me.

474
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,468
You showed me the way.

475
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,637
Well...

476
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,890
I've been meaning to say hello,

477
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,101
ever since you left the party
and went to the other side.

478
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,313
Jane.

479
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,155
Haven't spoken to him in over a decade.

480
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,364
He knows.

481
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,074
He knows I was involved.

482
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,535
Well, weren't you?

483
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,413
Weren't we?

484
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,710
When's the last time you were in my house?

485
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,087
Don't.

486
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,635
Mark, I'm not going back there.

487
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:09,057
No, no, Tom Yates was sleeping
with the new press secretary

488
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,475
in the White House.

489
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,358
He traded the East for the West.

490
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,654
Yes, all offshore oil
and gas exploration, sir.

491
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,591
They're saying we'll still have access,

492
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,803
but all shipping through the Mediterranean
will be affected.

493
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,621
And there's no denying
we'll be somewhat at their mercy.

494
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,252
Because there wasn't time to consult you.

495
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,134
Petrov upped the ante and it looks like
the vice president is going to cave.

496
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,973
It's not a complicated question,
Miss Stewart.

497
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,933
Were you sleeping with him?

498
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,356
Do I need to say this administration
has taken a huge chance on you?

499
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,817
- Were you sleeping...
- It is none of your business.

500
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Well...

501
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,529
- that answers that, then.
- [scoffs]

502
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,950
This is exactly the kind of thing
the White House needs...

503
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,537
to avoid.

504
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,002
And Tom Yates is missing.

505
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,797
Which only makes the whole story
more problematic.

506
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,761
I have no idea
where any of this is coming from.

507
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,927
Well, I suggest you find
a more convincing way of denying it.

508
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:32,557
Because your inability to lie
is a liability, right?

509
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,147
Now, where is our president?

510
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,236
Why didn't you tell them I invited you?

511
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,114
You didn't rat me out.

512
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,825
You sound like a gangster,
Madam President.

513
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,454
Curiosity, I suppose.

514
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,789
I wanted to watch you

515
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,875
and hear them.

516
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,171
Your vice president
is serving too many masters.

517
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,009
Strange, hmm?

518
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,764
Cathy passing away so soon after Francis.

519
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,183
Death usually comes in threes.

520
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,270
Except when it comes in fours or fives.

521
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,232
Are you free now, Madam President?

522
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,486
Not quite.

523
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,740
Were you happy with what they proposed?

524
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,742
Mostly, I'm just curious.`

525
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,869
Hmm. About what?

526
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,039
What you're about to offer.
That is why you invited me.

527
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,583
- And that is why I said yes.
- Hmm.

528
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,086
Well, Nexis Securities

529
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:48,007
or any other contractor
connected to Shepherd Unlimited

530
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,261
will never be allowed in Syria
while I'm president.

531
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,681
That's a strong declaration.

532
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:58,226
Bids will be contingent on my approval.

533
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,229
You can have the oil and gas, the ports.

534
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,191
And 20% of profits
from the resources passing through.

535
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,819
That's...

536
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,655
That's quite a taste.

537
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,201
Maybe you are a gangster.

538
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,538
And how will you...

539
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,957
defend your position?

540
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,875
Peace.

541
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,172
Isn't that what our two countries

542
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,384
have used to justify what we've done
in the region for over a hundred years?

543
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,344
Peace is overrated, Claire.

544
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,430
So are my vice president's promises.

545
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,849
And yet, yours seem too generous.

546
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:47,233
Your husband would have lost himself
in the brightness of this day,

547
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,652
blinded by how he needed to be seen.

548
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,488
That always cost him.

549
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,824
Can I ask?

550
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,286
If you knew this...

551
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,081
why did you marry him?

552
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,710
Do you even know?

553
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,715
As it turns out...

554
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,760
my husband was a means to an end.

555
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,721
Hmm.

556
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,860
[cell phone keyboard clicking]

557
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,321
Tell the people you work for
that I'm not going to testify.

558
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,448
- [Seth] A second.
- [keyboard clicking continues]

559
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,531
Seth.

560
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,827
- [message sent chime]
- Seth, do you hear me?

561
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,579
Back off, Doug.

562
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,707
Whatever you told them,
I'll have no part of it.

563
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,668
The U.S. Attorney can subpoena me.
She can try to...

564
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,632
I'm done.

565
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,553
You wouldn't know a good thing
if it smacked you in the face.

566
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,641
I don't know why I'm trying to help you.

567
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,687
You're not
in the White House anymore, Doug.

568
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,362
Oh. Where were you?

569
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,577
Even presidents need to pee, Mark.
Look, there's a rumor flying around.

570
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,494
- Was it good?
- It's easily dismissible.

571
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,830
Then I talked to NSA.
It's not gonna work, Claire.

572
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,125
Some White House affair
is not gonna make it go away.

573
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,837
The dead never really stay dead, Mark.

574
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,589
Not for the people who loved them.

575
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,726
[sighs]

576
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,437
- Ah. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

577
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,985
Did you get taller?

578
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,653
Yes.

579
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,989
So strange

580
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:01,117
for someone trapped in a Napoleon complex.

581
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,538
If only your personality
matched your looks, Jane Davis.

582
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,751
I was surprised you left negotiations

583
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,130
to your surrogate Ms. Siegerson.

584
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,632
Always best to speak for oneself.

585
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,801
Hmm. That's rich, coming from you.

586
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,262
Doublespeak is your mother tongue.

587
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,181
And subterfuge is yours.

588
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,726
You and your agencies, hmm?

589
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:32,064
The CIA is nothing short
of a cultural terrorist.

590
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,065
It's men like you...

591
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,443
Barging into countries
you know nothing about.

592
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,571
- You get under my skin.
- Profiting from destabilization.

593
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,907
Leaving nothing but ruin in your wake.

594
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,409
- It's chemical, it's...
- And then you're offended...

595
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,370
You're offended when it's my men,
my air strikes,

596
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,098
- that bring some kind of order.
- Chemical!

597
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:52,251
You are nothing but a communist
in a handmade suit.

598
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,586
A pig!

599
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,759
So emotional.

600
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,512
Emotions make deals come apart, Jane.

601
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,389
Tell me,

602
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,310
why should I trust any deal
that involves you?

603
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,197
[speaking Russian] I will not rest

604
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,908
until you're done, Viktor.

605
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,954
Dead and buried.

606
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,083
Bastard! Then I guess...

607
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,673
you'll never rest.

608
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,647
Okay. My directions were clear.

609
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,774
- No doubt.
- So where's the confusion?

610
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,610
Well, I'm guessing somewhere between
what you wanted to happen

611
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,195
and what had to happen.

612
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,049
If you didn't want me to call Bill,
you shouldn't have given me a reason to.

613
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,825
There was no place for you in that room.

614
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,508
And unless you show some proper respect,

615
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,370
no place for you
in this whole fucking town.

616
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,663
I'll see to that personally.

617
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,123
I'll keep that in mind.

618
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,959
From now on, stay in your lane,
keep your mouth shut,

619
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,752
unless I say otherwise. You got it?

620
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,588
Again, coming in clear,

621
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,632
but not a dent.

622
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,593
It's okay, we'll get there.

623
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,180
Even if we don't, fuck do I care?

624
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,558
I don't work for you.

625
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,477
We both work for him.

626
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,901
Mr. Stamper.

627
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:48,451
We usually meet
under more orchestrated circumstances.

628
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,745
Not that this isn't one of those, as well.

629
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,081
Where do you find yourself these days?

630
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,709
Consulting for an ambitious Congressman.

631
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,044
Midterms are coming.

632
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,544
I bet...

633
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,674
he has no idea
how well you see in the dark.

634
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,887
Who do you fear most?

635
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,598
Out of all of them.

636
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,518
Her.

637
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,450
- I can't eat at these things, either.
- [chuckles]

638
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,626
The spread looks lovely. Everything.

639
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,836
You all did right by her.

640
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,421
Well, I didn't do a thing.

641
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,549
Stan took care of all of it.

642
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,305
[Doug] How you holding up?

643
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,768
I can't make sense of it.

644
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,522
[Doug]
My dad went the same way, you know?

645
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,692
Never sick a day in his life. And then...

646
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,822
Right when he was driving,

647
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,844
just drifted onto oncoming traffic. - Jesus.
- Oh, my goodness.

648
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,453
I had to quickly grab the wheel

649
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,288
and swerved us over to the shoulder.

650
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,791
How old were you?

651
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,126
Twelve.

652
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,505
Twelve. That's rough.

653
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,632
[Doug] It's all rough.

654
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,717
Twelve. Twenty-one.

655
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,136
Fifty-one.

656
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,972
You're never ready.

657
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,399
Wednesday afternoon she calls me,
as she does.

658
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,109
Said her head hurt.

659
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,486
Like migraine bad, so she...

660
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,781
was headed to her personal doctor.

661
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,161
I call back to see how she was doing.

662
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,954
Stan hits me with it.

663
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,292
She didn't even make it to the office.
It happened in the car.

664
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,378
So, I got on the first flight out.

665
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,797
Hey, it's okay.

666
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,299
[Claire] Doug's right.

667
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,135
It's fine, let it out.

668
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,893
By the time I landed, it was all done.

669
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,937
Body was...

670
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,357
whatever, at the place...

671
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,735
to get cremated.

672
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,738
No autopsy, nothing.

673
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,990
Stan made it happen so fast.

674
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,291
And I'm the only one who can't
keep his shit together. But it's just...

675
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,630
I never got the chance to see her.

676
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,635
To say goodbye. [sobbing]

677
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,518
I'm sorry.
You all didn't ask for any of this.

678
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,014
- [Claire] No. Please.
- [Doug] We get it.

679
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,144
Yes, Doug Stamper and the president
seem very much in sync.

680
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,772
Mm-hmm.

681
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,567
I was hoping to attend
the secretary's memorial as well,

682
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,486
but my time is limited.

683
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,030
It was meaningful
that you traveled all this way.

684
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,115
I've been thinking about
what you said to me.

685
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,161
I accept.

686
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,748
I'm so happy to hear that.

687
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,502
One other thing. Tom Yates.

688
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,506
Your government was behind
whatever happened to him.

689
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,147
Presidents aren't allowed to be human.

690
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,942
You have to choose. Power or love.

691
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,820
That was very clear from the beginning.

692
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,656
Forgive me, Tom Yates.

693
00:42:56,031 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm about to drag you through the mud
to deny we ever happened.

694
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,623
I'm killing you for the second time.

695
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,876
One day, you'll rest in peace.

696
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,086
Madam President.

697
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,924
Ma'am, I have to tell you

698
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,844
- there are rumors circulating...
- I know, I know.

699
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,806
- If you need me to resign...
- Kelsey, you're not going anywhere.

700
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,127
[Hammerschmidt] <i>You can stay</i>
<i>at my place as long as you like.</i>

701
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,189
I appreciate it.

702
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,400
Two weeks in Bellport

703
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,610
tapped me out.

704
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,529
Well, your paper will cover some of that.

705
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,157
[laughs] They don't do expenses, Tom.

706
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,079
And my mom didn't have much to leave.

707
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,666
I liked the piece.

708
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,834
It was strong.

709
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,421
What's your follow-up?

710
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,549
Well, it's not like anybody
at the EPA can confirm.

711
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,510
Well, if the emails exist,
they went to somebody.

712
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,639
Yeah, but my only source
won't return my calls.

713
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,143
He's gotta show up to work every day.
He's afraid. He should be.

714
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,191
Follow up with the app.

715
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:17,571
Grayson was there,
signing up people who were very scared.

716
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,740
They took advantage of a crisis.

717
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,743
- The Shepherds.
- It's unethical, but it's not illegal.

718
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,413
Oh, shit.

719
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,249
They shut down Pennsylvania Avenue.

720
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,879
[phone keyboard clicking]

721
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,966
It says to take Massachusetts.

722
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,009
All right.

723
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,058
It's Cathy Durant's memorial today.

724
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,230
The bodies are adding up.

725
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,030
Tom, from the very beginning,
we did what we thought was right.

726
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,452
At the time, anyway.

727
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,588
Is that how we ended up
in this car together?

728
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,373
Look, you cannot blame yourself for...

729
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,874
For not doing enough. Why not?

730
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,042
Why shouldn't I?

731
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,043
Rachel Posner?

732
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,046
Somebody with her name is bouncing checks
in and around New Mexico.

733
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,382
Yeah. And if it leads to nowhere?

734
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,347
Will you ever be able to...

735
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,848
leave it?

736
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,852
If the truth starts to fade away?

737
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,604
Truthfully...

738
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,192
I don't know.

739
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,786
I just heard from Bugayev. 20%?

740
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,833
I haven't told Mark and the rest yet.
Just know you'll be crucified.

741
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,002
Yes, and how will I feel the difference?

742
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,880
You shouldn't have excluded me.

743
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,053
[camera shutters clicking]

744
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,556
What's going on with you and Claire?

745
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,977
Look, I can only assume
while you were away

746
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,396
somebody broke down
the definition of insanity.

747
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,607
If not, here's a refresher.

748
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:21,612
Doing the same shit over and over
and expecting different results.

749
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,616
Yeah, I don't know what she told you

750
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,493
to induce such amnesia,

751
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,329
but if you're seriously
looking down that road again,

752
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,248
there is something that you should know
about Francis' will.

753
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,584
Has she told you what's in it?

754
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,795
Who told you?

755
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,881
If I were you, that's not the question
I'd be asking right now.

756
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,469
I'd be asking, "Why is she keeping me
from the truth?"

757
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,890
He left you more than those cuff links.

758
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,977
You're welcome, Doug.

759
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,654
President Underwood,

760
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,863
Brett Cole.

761
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,532
Yes, I know who you are.

762
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,367
I'll take that as a compliment.

763
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,245
Madam President,
you should make your way to the stage.

764
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,788
Yes, of course. Thank you.

765
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,871
Doug.

766
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,210
- Speak soon?
- Yes, ma'am.

767
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,672
Anything you need to tell me now?

768
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,715
Nope, nothing.

769
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,928
That story about your father,
is that true?

770
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,975
Does it matter?

771
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,686
Well, if it's true, it explains a lot.

772
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,231
If it's not, it explains a lot.

773
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,829
- Thank you for coming.
- Sorry.

774
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,163
I appreciate it.

775
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,707
So sorry.

776
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,461
Good to see you.

777
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:31,116
[Claire] <i>To weather the slings and arrows</i>
<i>of 30 years of service</i>

778
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,410
<i>and not lose a fraction</i>

779
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,413
<i>of one's signature grit and integrity,</i>

780
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,707
<i>that's not a legacy,</i>

781
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,834
<i>that's a miracle.</i>

782
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,963
<i>But Catherine Durant
wasn't just a Secretary of State.</i>

783
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,090
<i>She was a sister.</i>

784
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,469
[speaking French]
Why isn't someone on the house right now?

785
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,138
Well, then you heard wrong.

786
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,182
That's right. Day and night.

787
00:48:55,641 --> 00:49:00,854
[speaking English] Yes, every second
until he is on the C-130 to Switzerland.

788
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,940
No, no, no. No ETAs.

789
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,524
Hard dates and times.

790
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,818
Mm-hmm.

791
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,781
Mm-hmm. Correct.

792
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,824
No.

793
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,243
I'll be the one
to intercept him in Annecy.

794
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,997
Yes, of course. As soon as the money
is wired, you'll be taken care of.
