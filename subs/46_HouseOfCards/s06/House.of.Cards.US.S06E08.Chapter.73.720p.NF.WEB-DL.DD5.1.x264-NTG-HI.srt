1
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,099
What would Frank do?

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,145
Given that she's carrying his child.

3
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,918
I've always promised
to tell you the truth.

4
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:11,214
Transparency is the cornerstone
of my presidency.

5
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,592
And in that spirit, I feel compelled

6
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,177
to share the following.

7
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,931
For some weeks now,

8
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,809
the Justice Department has been
investigating allegations

9
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,728
that the former president, my husband,

10
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:31,234
falsely inflated 2016 election day dangers
in several states

11
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,445
that may have played a role
in tipping the results.

12
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,030
[murmuring]

13
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,074
[Claire] This news, as you can imagine,

14
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,244
has caused a widow's dark night
of the soul.

15
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,767
- [man] Madam President!
- [shouting]

16
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,128
This used to be my office.

17
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,466
That was my desk.

18
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,847
The couch is different, but I slept here
more nights than I care to remember.

19
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,059
Congressman Underwood's desk
was right through there.

20
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,146
He never slept.

21
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,578
Never button the bottom.

22
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,085
- Madam President!
- Sarah, yes.

23
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,045
Ma'am, to follow up.

24
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,088
What specific action, if any,

25
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,216
are you planning to take,
since your husband is...

26
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Dead.

27
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,970
Well, everything is on the table.

28
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,098
Up to and including
a posthumous indictment.

29
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,727
- Larry.
- But, Madam President,

30
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,890
if you're calling the election results
into question,

31
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,856
what does that mean for your presidency?

32
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,691
This is the highest office in the land.

33
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,738
Public service is a sacred privilege,
and no one is above the law.

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,033
Not the father of my child, not me.

35
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,409
- [clamoring]
- Marcus.

36
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,372
Were you given any warning
about this article that just came out?

37
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,123
By Janine Skorsky?

38
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,961
- I don't know what you're referring to.
- It was posted as you were speaking.

39
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,545
The headline reads,

40
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,633
"Former President Underwood
excluded his wife from his will."

41
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,635
Would you care to comment?

42
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,013
Well, I can't comment
on what I haven't seen. Thank you.

43
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,850
The source named in the piece
is Douglas Stamper.

44
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,936
[murmuring]

45
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,815
I have known Douglas

46
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,860
since he became my husband's
right hand man over 20 years ago.

47
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,612
And it is no secret

48
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,907
that he's been having
a difficult time lately.

49
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,618
Emotionally, above all else.

50
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:54,085
And when I pardoned him months ago,
it was based on compassion.

51
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,879
I feel for the man, I do.

52
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,592
But Doug Stamper will never be the one
to lead us to the truth.

53
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,346
[man] "The former president
apparently handwrote an 11th hour will,

54
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,850
technically known as a holographic will,
with instructions that his estate

55
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,602
be left to his former Chief of Staff
Douglas Stamper."

56
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,439
Does it say anything about what's in it?

57
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,441
"The specifics of the will
are not yet public,

58
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,860
but in an exclusive interview
with Mr. Stamper,

59
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,571
he promised
to reveal the contents 'soon.'"

60
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,905
That'll be all for now.

61
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,240
Get White House counsel.

62
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,161
No, no, actually get my personal lawyer
on the phone now.

63
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,748
Yes, ma'am. And Assistant Director Green
is here, but he insisted that his...

64
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,166
Madam President.

65
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,588
Let me introduce you to my wife Abby
and this is our son Jackson.

66
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,671
[Claire] Hello.

67
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,800
Abby's such a fan,
we were hoping to take a picture.

68
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,551
Of course.

69
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,555
I wanted my family here with me
when I let you know,

70
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,432
I'm leaving the Bureau.

71
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,644
I already submitted my letter
of resignation.

72
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,149
[sighs]
Nathan, we can't possibly accept that.

73
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,736
Please, President Hale. I'm begging you.

74
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,650
- [intercom beeps]
- Lynn, can you come in here, please?

75
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,374
Nathan, I insist
we speak about this one-on-one.

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,251
Can you give us a moment?

77
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,721
I'm sorry I failed you
as far as the desert,

78
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,306
but I can't do this anymore.

79
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,016
- Nathan...
- I've made up my mind.

80
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,770
It's better for both of us
if I go quietly.

81
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,901
I'm sure you're looking forward to walking
Jackson to his first day of school.

82
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,403
I am, ma'am.

83
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,488
Well, my feelings haven't changed.

84
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,700
I want Doug to finally,
finally get the help

85
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,494
he so desperately needs.

86
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,538
You're right to be concerned.

87
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,041
There are some crazy people out there.

88
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:02,713
In my last conversation with Doug,
he told me entities had approached him,

89
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,883
hoping to recruit him. Abby.

90
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,472
You should cancel your upcoming
public appearances.

91
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,396
[camera shutter clicks]

92
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,815
- [shutters clicking]
- [clamoring]

93
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,377
- Here to see an old friend.
- The president said,"Doug Stamper

94
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,081
will never be the one to lead us
to the truth." You care to comment?

95
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,575
It must serve the president to paint me
as some sort of crazy man.

96
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:36,115
Bu I'm sorry to disappoint her, I am of right mind, and she knows it.
In terms of a revised will, who knows about its contents?

97
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,418
- Why don't you ask her that question?
- Sir, how did you become aware of it?

98
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,506
I was with him the night he died.

99
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,299
He asked me to his suite at the Hay-Adams.
He told me he no longer had faith

100
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,429
in his wife's ability
to serve as president.

101
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,264
And President Underwood,

102
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,226
the <i>real</i> President Underwood,
kept an audio diary.

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,480
- Pieces of which I've heard.
- [clamoring]

104
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,063
Then let's find a court
that will rule in our favor.

105
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,278
[woman on TV] <i>...Stamper, former Chief</i>
<i>of Staff to President Francis Underwood,</i>

106
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,988
<i>recorded earlier today.</i>

107
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,991
<i>Let's turn to our panel for their take
on the claim that the leak...</i>

108
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,202
[man] <i>...remember, this is a troubled man.</i>

109
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,913
<i>We can't take everything he says
at face value, right?</i>

110
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,540
[woman] <i>The question is,</i>
<i>what is Stamper's endgame here?</i>

111
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,084
- <i>Why the whole attack on President Hale...</i>
- What?

112
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,046
- He was supposed to provoke her.
- <i>He walked away from murder charges.</i>

113
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,369
<i>- Don't forget that...</i>
- Mark...

114
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,509
- I don't have time to read your mind.
- I tried to warn you.

115
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,345
I've worked with this guy.
We could be exposed.

116
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,056
- Do you trust me, my instincts...
- Yes, of course I do.

117
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,603
That has nothing to do
with evaluating the risk he is becoming.

118
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,355
He's unhinged, Annette.

119
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,440
Unhinged is what's called for.

120
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,734
Contain him. That's your job.

121
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,654
Hey.

122
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:53,908
Annette!

123
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,958
What's going on?

124
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,837
If my son were anyone else
in this country, he'd be out by now.

125
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,173
- No, what's going on here?
- [sighs]

126
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,883
Between us?

127
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,928
We're having sex again.

128
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,223
Until it seems like a bad idea, again.

129
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,849
- Hey, listen to me...
- That bitch

130
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,733
is tipping the scales
when it comes to Duncan.

131
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,062
And there's no way
he can get a fair hearing,

132
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,564
until she's gone.

133
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,441
Okay, hold on. Just, um...

134
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,860
Can you back up a few words?

135
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,530
How far back?

136
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,199
Uh, "Moments like this require..."

137
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,201
What is it?

138
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,413
"Someone who will act.
Who will do the unpleasant thing."

139
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,832
You know what?
Can you just let me hear it?

140
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,915
No.

141
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,002
Why not?

142
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,047
I can't. It's...

143
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,178
What are you doing?

144
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
Nothing, I... Nothing.

145
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,403
Look, we don't have
to go ahead with this. Okay?

146
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,991
And whatever you need
to figure out, you should.

147
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,703
Like, can't you just leave him alone?

148
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,998
- What do you think I am?
- Look, I know exactly what you are.

149
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,843
She's gonna come after you.

150
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,141
"Requires someone who will act.

151
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,186
Who will do the unpleasant thing,
the necessary thing.

152
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,400
Don't be fooled by her beautiful face.

153
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,861
My wife is ruthless."

154
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,990
[Claire] "The most ruthless woman
I've ever met. If people only knew."

155
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,493
We've filed an injunction.

156
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,546
But Skorsky's saying her source believes
the material belongs to him.

157
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,455
This is insane.

158
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,916
Unless someone produces evidence
of a will, there's no...

159
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,876
Why are we even taking this seriously?

160
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,379
I am confident I can silence her
with a gag order.

161
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:12,880
But once a thing is in print,

162
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,051
- any other news outlet has the right to...
- Print? This isn't print, Geraldine.

163
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,472
- Can't we just shut down the site?
- No, ma'am. I don't think we can.

164
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,308
My advice, let's depose.

165
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,356
Get Mr. Stamper under oath.

166
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,876
- If he perjures himself...
- No. That's exactly what he wants.

167
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,694
He wants a public forum.

168
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,407
And he's been through enough already.

169
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,410
[Jennifer] Madam President, I have to ask.

170
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,995
And I will ask you this
in front of your attorney.

171
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,164
Is it your position

172
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,226
that you were entirely unaware
of your husband's...

173
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,752
- You don't have to answer that.
- No, no, I want to.

174
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,799
I don't know
if he did it for his sake or mine,

175
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,719
but he never told me a thing.

176
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,847
Ma'am, in <i>United States v. Nixon...</i>

177
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,641
I swear on his unborn child.

178
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,981
Well, there's no doubt
that there's areas of the company

179
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,567
she's not quite as well versed in.

180
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,360
Partly my fault, our...

181
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,363
Our father didn't believe in succession.

182
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,032
Are you saying you don't think
your sister deserves...

183
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,618
No. That's not what I'm saying.

184
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,581
If anything, when I talk about succession,
I'm talking about this presidency.

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,751
Let's face it, our Commander In Chief,

186
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,337
who basically inherited the job
from her husband,

187
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,339
is acting like a goddamn monarch.

188
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,258
When...

189
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,471
When a tyrant pretends to be transparent,

190
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,055
nation beware.

191
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,932
And these...

192
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,225
These comments,

193
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,688
these public comments from Doug Stamper
make nothing but sense.

194
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,024
I mean, follow the complicity.

195
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,319
So, do you have any advice
for President Hale? Yes. Abdicate.

196
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,408
- Oh. Come on now, Bill.
- No, no. Listen

197
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,119
it wouldn't be the worst thing
for this country

198
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,872
if she didn't finish out her term.

199
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,998
Wow.

200
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:15,002
If that's what was fated for her.

201
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,754
- Mr. Shepard...
- Listen,

202
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,089
I was flipping around the channels
last night,

203
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,883
and I came across <i>The Alamo.</i>

204
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,885
<i>I know it's not a great movie,</i>

205
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,806
<i>but when John Wayne
chokes up saying "Republic...</i>

206
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,064
Bill Shepherd, shut the fuck up.

207
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,989
Reach out to the others.

208
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:48,369
Remind them of the perils
of loose lips. [sighs]

209
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,711
Nathan Green was in a meeting
hosted by Annette Shepherd.

210
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,674
I don't get rattled easily,

211
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,053
but the secrecy around this one,
who was there and why,

212
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,055
is more than I have ever come across.

213
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,309
I suspect there were some
very powerful people in that room.

214
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,144
Douglas Stamper?

215
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,272
I don't know yet.

216
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,108
Anything else?

217
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,157
Walter, you have worked with us
from the beginning.

218
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,913
Yes. I liked Frank.

219
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,082
So, I'm curious.

220
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,878
How did you pull it off?

221
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,422
Oh, Claire,

222
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,134
my calling is a practical one.

223
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,097
I don't judge. I don't question.
I simply work for the highest bidder.

224
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:54,727
I'm agnostic,
but this virtual landscape is new to me.

225
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,353
And someone out there

226
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,607
is working very hard
to make Frank look very bad.

227
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,152
Listen,
it's just a lot of noise at the moment.

228
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,946
It's not only about him.

229
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,449
[Claire sighs]

230
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:13,037
How will you manage to separate yourself
from all this shit?

231
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,832
All that's left is Doug to connect me.

232
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,256
Be careful, Claire.

233
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,303
Oh, you guys.

234
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,014
I really didn't wanna
have to have to do this, but...

235
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,269
An extreme faction
of the ICO terrorist group

236
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,273
made an attempt to purchase
a nuclear device in Pakistan.

237
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,816
That's a fact.

238
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,153
- Madam President, all due respect...
- Maria, I know you're new to this,

239
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,116
but please don't ever use that expression with me.
"All due respect" means precisely the opposite.

240
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:56,455
Ma'am, it's just that this threat remains
squarely in the category of a potential...

241
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,082
The intent is there.

242
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,976
Until we have confirmation
that the deal has...

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,921
Our intelligence has told us
that they will regroup and try again.

244
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,633
This goes back to the warning
from Rafiq Nasser two months ago.

245
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,635
Now acting Secretary Gallagher and I

246
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,138
have been keeping a close watch
on this threat ever since Nancy took over

247
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,515
for Nora at Homeland.

248
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,395
And in the spirit of the full transparency
this administration is embracing,

249
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,729
we're going to take it public.

250
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,984
Ma'am. Frankly, I'm concerned.

251
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,277
From a strategic perspective,

252
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,781
if ICO doesn't act,
we appear to be crying wolf.

253
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,135
But on the other hand,
are we putting ourselves in a position

254
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,120
where we're daring them to act?

255
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,143
We don't want to appear reckless.
I couldn't sleep last night.

256
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,384
For obvious national security reasons,
of course,

257
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,467
but...

258
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,304
also because the baby kept me awake.

259
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,099
And for some reason...

260
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,353
the word "misogynist" popped into my mind.

261
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,856
And I was trying to think
of the word for the opposite.

262
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,818
You know, the word for
when a person hates men.

263
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,320
Does anyone around this table
know that word is?

264
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,157
The word for when a person hates men?

265
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,700
Anybody?

266
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,496
I had to go and look it up.

267
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,331
"Misandrist."

268
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,754
And no one really knows that word
because it's not used in our culture.

269
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,633
So what I'm getting at, is maybe we all,
regardless of our gender,

270
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,180
would do well to examine
the pre-conceived notions that we have

271
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:41,018
about who can and cannot act
as Commander In Chief.

272
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,562
[Seth] There you go.

273
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,067
They're from a place
called the Federalist Pig.

274
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,651
I don't know it.

275
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,362
Well, I've been told it is
the next best thing to Freddy's.

276
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,865
I'm good. You want some?

277
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,533
No, they're for you.

278
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,789
Doyle has been asking around about you.

279
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,459
[Seth] Now we can shut him down.

280
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,877
But...

281
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,800
Yeah, come on, give me one.
I mean... [sighs]

282
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,843
What kind of man says no to ribs, right?

283
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,104
The articles and the press conferences.

284
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,856
A little goes a long way, Doug.

285
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,783
A lot of people,

286
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,954
in a way, the whole country,

287
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,911
we're relying on you. Seth,

288
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,794
I can take care of myself.

289
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,550
Can you pass that sauce?

290
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,105
- [cell phone beeps]

[rings]

293
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,350
You must be so alone.

294
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,314
Do you even have anyone around anymore
that you can trust?

295
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,815
What are you playing at?

296
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,443
<i>"Surely, she saw it all. The killing.</i>

297
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,737
The lying," says Frank at minute six.

298
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,281
<i>Doug, you and me have to have
a come to Jesus.</i>

299
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,784
Agreed. Stop publicly accusing him
or it's all gonna come down.

300
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,621
All I'm trying to do
is seek the truth these days.

301
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,749
<i>Minute 76...
"Before I ever made any big moves,</i>

00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,463
I like the sound of your voice, Doug.
It's so soothing.

<i>- I never really thought about it before,</i>

you remind me of Francis.</i>

306
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:25,140
<i>The one thing I really miss is his voice.</i>

307
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,601
It was always my favorite thing about him.

308
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,103
No matter what he would say,

309
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,275
the sound of his voice made me feel
like everything was going to be all right.

310
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,443
<i>It's not.</i>

311
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,783
<i>Besides Annette, who else was there?</i>

312
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,455
I'm the only one who can save you, Doug.

313
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,791
<i>"And then he asked
if I had no faith in God.</i>

00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,381
<i>Minute 14.
Would you like me to play it for you?</i>

317
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,592
Drop the investigation and apologize
for what you're doing to him

318
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,386
<i>or more of this is gonna come out.</i>

319
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,639

[exhales]

323
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,301
My security team just informed me
that Russian soldiers are firing

324
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,679
- at American Special Forces, Viktor.
- They invaded the coast,

325
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,639
which violates agreements you and I made.

<i>- Preventing a nuclear device from...</i>
- Did you orchestrate this, Claire?

327
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,688
<i>For what?
To distract from your husband's diary?</i>

328
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>And don't act like that
would be beneath you.</i>

329
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,694
I don't believe motherhood
automatically makes a woman a saint.

330
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,113
- Rafiq Nasser...
<i>- Is dead.</i>

331
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,616
<i>We hit him with a drone strike
an hour ago.</i>

332
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,373
He was providing us
with necessary intelligence.

333
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,375
That you provided him with first.

<i>The threat is real.</i>

335
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,504
I'll have my people, the GRU,
take it from here.

336
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,630
No, you won't.

337
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,341
Look, Claire, just...

338
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,178
worry about having your baby now.

00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,812
It's like watching some movie,
just out of date.

342
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,443
<i>If a rogue element gets their hands
on a nuclear device, Viktor,</i>

343
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,070
<i>I will strike first.</i>

344
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,453
What time is it there now?

345
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,914
Must be close to sunrise, huh?

346
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,042
Just about.

347
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,717
If you drop an atom bomb,

348
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,388
<i>our world, your daughter's world...</i>

349
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,392
[scoffs]

350
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,814
That sun will never
look the same again, Claire.

351
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,444
What time is it there?

352
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,324
Uh...

353
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,287
I'm about to have lunch.

354
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,872
And what are you having?

355
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,792
<i>Oh, a salad.</i>

356
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,711
<i>Cucumbers and tomatoes, a bit of feta.</i>

357
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,382
Some Spanish olive oil
and herbs from Tangiers.

358
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,300
I don't eat bread anymore, you know.

359
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,138
We never had a proper meal, you and I.

360
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,098
Not really.

361
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,393
<i>I'll have to oppose you now,
openly at the UN.</i>

362
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,520
<i>And at every turn.</i>

363
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,024
Privately, I...

364
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,444
[chuckles]

365
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,950
- I will miss you.
- [beep]

366
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,293
As I made clear to President Petrov,

367
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,754
I will not have terrorists
waltzing out of the desert

368
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,214
with an atomic bomb.

369
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,968
It's time for me to treat you all
like the adults you are.

370
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,719
The truth is...

371
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,098
I'm not the only one who's in danger.

372
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,226
No one's safe. Not really.

373
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,979
Not ever.

374
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,066
Does that mean a nuclear strike?
The first one since Nagasaki?

375
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,153
If need be, yes.

376
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,280
- [clamoring]
- [camera shutters clicking]

377
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,490
[Bill] <i>Terry.</i>

378
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,742
[Terry] <i>You've become a vocal critic</i>
<i>of the president.</i>

379
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,577
<i>Even before your arrest.</i>

380
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,456
<i>Actually, the first time you went public
was to support legislation</i>

381
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,707
<i>limiting her powers.</i>

382
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,335
Which is now more urgent than ever.

383
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,878
<i>And recently, as you await trial,</i>

384
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,255
<i>you got into some more hot water
with your comments.</i>

385
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,674
<i>Yes, I misspoke.</i>

386
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,178
<i>But let's face it.
This president is fatal.</i>

387
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>I mean, she's out there
evoking end of days.</i>

388
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,810
<i>And with her in office, that is exactly
where this country is headed.</i>

389
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,312
<i>And what am I?</i>

390
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:27,359
Some antiquated soul
because I still believe in family?

391
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,363
Listen, if you want to do something
in this country about poverty,

392
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,489
family.

393
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,200
Crime, family.

394
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,870
Education, family. It's family.

395
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,832
My parents had dinner at six o'clock.
Every single night.

396
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,586
They didn't care where you were,
what the hell you were doing.

397
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,880
<i>Dinner was at six, goddamnit.</i>

398
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,509
[Terry] <i>And when's the last time</i>
<i>you and your sister had dinner?</i>

399
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,308
That is a fair question.

400
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,311
And it has been some time

401
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,648
since we sat across from each other.

402
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,901
[bird cawing]

403
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,200
[birds chirping, cows mooing]

404
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,661
How you doing, Bill?

405
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,415
Depends on the day. And the dose.

406
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,511
I brought you some pastries,
from Poupon, Georgetown.

407
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,014
I know you have a soft spot for those.

408
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,767
Well, I don't do sugar anymore.

409
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,520
It's... fuel for the tumor.

410
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,888
You can have one, if you want.

411
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,524
No, I'm good.

412
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,571
Twenty years ago,

413
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,157
I probably would have sat down...

414
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,786
and written out my memoirs,

415
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,330
instead of...

416
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,959
trying to just get it out there
any way I can.

417
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,591
I thought she would have come out.

418
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,889
I'm sorry. She sent me.

419
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,520
Does she want me to stop?

420
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
The opposite.

421
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,193
She wants you to keep
hitting the president hard...

422
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,407
- so that she can come out against you.
- [sighs]

423
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,786
Is this gonna be a mess?

424
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,458
Could be.

425
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,130
When did it happen?

426
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,925
That we were the ones catching up.

427
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,722
Were we not paying attention?

428
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,307
Not enough.

429
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,145
Francis was a son of a bitch.

430
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,439
[laughs]

431
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,608
But he was a talented son of a bitch.

432
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,070
He saw her coming.

433
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,449
He just couldn't stop himself.

434
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,617
Or her.

435
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,914
Where do you think we're gonna be
in ten years, Mark?

436
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,719
Huh? Come on. I'm asking everybody. - For obvious reasons.
- You think about it more than I do.

437
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,219
Fat, wasted and distracted.

438
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,182
Might be a good night out,
but it's no way to live a life.

439
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,322
Come on, ten years?

440
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,282
I don't know.

441
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,953
Things don't really change, Bill.

442
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,830
They just...

443
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,917
They just fade away, man.

444
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,303
God, I'm angry.

445
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,771
[Annette] I heard your husband's voice.

446
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,649
Douglas Stamper came to us.

447
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,360
Offered up Francis' diaries,

448
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,322
snippets of which Doug played for me.

449
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,869
And to tell you the truth,
I considered using it against you.

450
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:34,207
But I don't think it should ever
find its way into the public sphere.

451
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,086
- Forgive my surprise.
- I'm not my brother.

452
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,421
Bill's become bad for democracy.

453
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,215
Like Francis was.

454
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,176
The world loves a cat fight,

455
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,721
but I say
let's deny them the satisfaction.

456
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,890
It's not too late for us.

457
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:57,689
You know, you're right.
Let's not give them what they want.

458
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,691
Fuck them all.

459
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,527
Oh. Sorry, Angel.

460
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,865
They hear things, you know.
There have been studies.

461
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,533
Is it amazing?

462
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,159
It is.

463
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,037
She's an active little thing.

464
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,707
May I?

465
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,584
Sure.

466
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,134
Oh, she's kicking.

467
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,889
[Annette gasps]

468
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,309
We'll take care of Doug.

469
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,604
I don't believe your support.

470
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,731
You're a bad liar, Annie.

471
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,358
And you tried to kill her.

472
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,193
You have my son.

473
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,695
How are you gonna do it?

474
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,489
I don't know what you're talking about.

475
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,534
Tell me who the others are
and I will let Duncan go.

476
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,996
- He's innocent, as am I.
- God, please.

477
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,582
This so-called nuclear crisis.

478
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,417
You're worse than Frank.

479
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,088
Oh. She's kicking again.

480
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,762
It's like she senses
we're nearing the end.

481
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,519
The only question, Doug,

482
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,814
is if you're their plan A,
what's their plan B?

483
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,275
[Doug] <i>If Francis were here, we'd know.</i>

484
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,152
Yes. Well, if he was going to kill me,

485
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,821
<i>- how would he do it?</i>
- He'd find an opportunity you provided.

486
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,115
He was always
three steps ahead, wasn't he?

487
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,016
[young Claire] <i>Francis Underwood...</i>

488
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,243
[Doug] <i>Maybe he still is.</i>

489
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,203
[telephone beeps]

490
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,790
[young Claire]
<i>Have I been keeping him alive?</i>

491
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,505
<i>Just how far am I willing to go?</i>

492
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,135
[young Claire] I'm having second thoughts.

493
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,722
Am I sure this is a good idea?

494
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,265
Yes.

495
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,726
What if I'm carrying
a demon seed or something?

496
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,812
The odds are 50-50.

497
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,357
So tired of talking about Francis.

498
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,068
I miss my boyfriend Reed.

499
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,823
- I do too, sometimes, but...
- Reed wanted too much.

500
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,868
Francis gave me permission to hunger.

501
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,704
Because he felt it himself.

502
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,248
All the time. Insatiable.

503
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,667
Everyone thinks I should feel sated.

504
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,963
Then he said,
"No, Claire, be as hungry as me."

505
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,256
And so I ate him?

506
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,509
He ate himself.

507
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,387
Doug Stamper?

508
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,765
Am I going to eat him?

509
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,897
- Herr God.
- Herr Lucifer.

510
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,190
[both] Beware.

511
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,704
[Seth] You know, I always thought...

512
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,124
- maybe one day, you know, but...
- Put it back.

513
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,376
What?

514
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,628
The picture. It belongs on the fridge.

515
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,382
[Seth] Okay, sorry.

516
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:18,264
You know,
if there is anything that I can do.

517
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,351
- I mean, in case it doesn't go as planned.
- Can you please stop moving?

518
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,187
I'm a little worked up, all right?

519
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,608
Claire Hale Underwood lived
and then she died.

520
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,110
- She's no different from anyone else.
- Yeah.

521
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:35,698
Well, I'm not sure the world's
gonna see it the way you do.

522
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,330
If this breaks right, you can be a hero.

523
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,623
[scoffs]

524
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,126
Don't spin me, Seth.

525
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,217
How do they plan to do me in?

526
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,558
Seth?

527
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,977
Look. [clears throat]

528
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,897
I'm gonna say this to you.

529
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,608
Not because we're friends.

530
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,404
But because of everything
that we've been through together.

531
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,868
[gags]

532
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,662
[Seth sighs]

533
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,582
You're an asshole.

534
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,840
You don't have to be a part of this,
if you don't want to.

535
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,342
You saying that for me or for you?

536
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,971
Maybe both.

537
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,022
I don't know who it is...

538
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,571
but they have someone
inside the White House.

539
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,995
Military always hated her.

540
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,872
Hmm? That's one thing.

541
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,131
Fuck 'em all. [scoffs]

542
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,386
- What about the two of us? We just leave.
- [cell phone ringing]

543
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,972
Where do you wanna go?

544
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,724
- [beeps]
- Hello.

545
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,058
How does he look?

546
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,479
He's fine.
He's sure that she'll invite him in.

547
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,855
Put him on.

548
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,694
<i>Doug.</i>

549
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,322
Yeah.

550
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,824
What extraordinary times these are.

551
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,701
<i>I wish I could be there
to shake your hand.</i>

552
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,786
Annette,
I want to make something very clear.

553
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,788
I'm not doing this for you.

554
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,584
We'll be sure to move him
from Gaffney to Arlington.

555
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,502
And help fund the Library.

556
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:57,798
And, Doug, given your recent struggles,

557
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,302
nine or ten years from now,
you could be out.

558
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,512
<i>- </i>[Doug scoffs]
<i>- And I want to thank you.</i>

559
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,348
<i>Seth.</i>

560
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,434
Yes.

561
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,687
Everything is set from our side.
The quarterback is standing by.

562
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,439
And Duncan?

563
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,401
Is going to have to wait.

564
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,700
What else did she say?

565
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,327
Nothing.

566
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,204
Just...

567
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,581
everything's in place.

568
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,588
Later.

569
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,384
Seth.

570
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,430
It's not going to go like you think.

571
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,941
[door opens, closes]

572
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,362
No.

573
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,199
I never liked talking to you
in the first place.

574
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,165
[Nathan] <i>From what I hear, you were right</i>
<i>to cancel your public appearances.</i>

575
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,334
- You think so?
<i>- I do, ma'am.</i>

576
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,462
<i>I think the White House is
the safest place for you to be right now.</i>

577
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,716
Nathan, you're a liar.

578
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,679
Do me a favor.
Kiss your sweet baby's forehead for me.

579
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,055
[beep]

580
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,483
Our intelligence confirms the hand off
is on the verge of taking place.

581
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,570
<i>And our intelligence says that's not so.</i>

582
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,614
We're talking about
a 20-mile radius of sand.

583
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,325
Unreachable by conventional means.

584
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,036
<i>I'll have my forces coordinate
with yours, okay?</i>

585
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,205
I'm not asking
for your permission, Viktor.

586
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,877
<i>Look, Claire. I can see how eager you are
to show your enemies</i>

587
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,129
<i>just how powerful you are.</i>

588
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,173
<i>But, please,</i>

589
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,343
<i>please don't do this.</i>

590
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,972
<i>I know you,</i>

591
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,932
<i>the things you've done.</i>

592
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,020
<i>Think how the world will judge you.</i>

593
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,981
As if you have any credibility
with the world stage.

594
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,983
Prepare a statement.

595
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,069
Ma'am, I need to object.

596
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,236
Pardon me?

597
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,406
The public is aware we're prepared
to strike.

598
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,116
We don't need to alarm them further.

599
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,371
I will not be a part of this...
this fabrication.

600
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,916
Alert the military aide. I want him ready
and waiting with the briefcase.

601
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,549
A targeted strike
will destabilize the region

602
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,259
for decades to come...

603
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,639
and it will create a distrust that will
ripple through Europe and much of Asia.

604
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,601
Markets will be rocked.
Yes, the consequences will be grave.

605
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,022
But it has come to my attention...

606
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,567
that there is a plot against me.

607
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:08,447
Someone in my White House is planning
to betray me.

608
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,741
And until I find out who that is,

609
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,619
I will not reconsider my position here.

610
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,585
Ma'am? Something arrived for you
from Doug Stamper.

611
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,087
It was passed through security.

612
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,004
Thank you.

613
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,480
[panting]

614
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,239
[sighs]

615
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,326
[telephone ringing]

616
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,206
[Claire] <i>Yes.</i>

617
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,333
The men in uniform don't support you.

618
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,083
[beeps]

619
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,512
I want the White House emptied out.

620
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,097
Other than yourselves,
minimal and essential staff only.

621
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,433
- All visitors need to be cleared by me.
- Yes, ma'am.

622
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,145
[ringing and vibrating]

623
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,369
[ringing stops]

624
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,749
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you standing me up?

625
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,419
[scoffs] God bless you, man.

626
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,713
But this is not what you promised me.

627
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,257
And you can tell the president

628
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,343
that she can send
an army of lawyers at me,

629
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,679
but I won't be buried.

630
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,639
I am not going to stop.

631
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,100
And I don't know when it will be or how.

632
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,562
But I am going to finish
this godforsaken story, okay?

633
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,521
[phone beeps]

634
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,234
[seat belt clicks]

635
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,995
[Bill] See, the Harry Brooker painting,
that's my very favorite.

636
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,331
And then there's the Hogarth.

637
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:07,376
That's 1700's, English.

638
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,423
And from France, the Chardin, same period.

639
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,466
<i>Maison des Cartes.</i>

640
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,094
There's...

641
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,180
one from the 1800s from Germany

642
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,308
that's very interesting in here.

643
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,852
There, see?

644
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,147
They all have one thing in common.

645
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,775
Children watching,

646
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,987
waiting for the cards to fall.

647
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,618
[cell phone ringing]

648
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,538
Seth Grayson.

649
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,754
[Mark] Annette.

650
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,925
I won't be here for this.

651
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,303
Where would you rather be?

652
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,596
I don't know.

653
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,389
1999.

654
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,851
Tenants Advocacy Group,
south side of Chicago.

655
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,454
But I can't be there, so I don't know.

656
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,402
If you're leaving, leave.

657
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,601
Ma'am.

658
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,940
Thank you, Colonel Flora.

659
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,528
What did they promise you?

660
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,407
- Ma'am, I didn't...
- Quiet.

661
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,420
What took you so long?

662
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,844
May we have the room, please?

663
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,545
- Are you sure, ma'am?
- Yes. It's all right. Thank you.

664
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,898
Doug.

665
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,568
Do we need a drink?

666
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,694
You can't.

667
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,157
Well, desperate times, right?

668
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,084
Here's who wants you dead.

669
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,297
Annette Shepherd had me waiting.

670
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,132
I know who was there.

671
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,343
Thank you.

672
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,015
Whatever happens here...

673
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,601
It's between us.

674
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,992
Doug, I know you.
You've never really had anyone else.

675
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,912
Rachel Posner, but...

676
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,457
How long do you think
you're going to get away with that?

677
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,837
I don't.

678
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,009
What are you going to call her?

679
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,721
I haven't decided yet.

680
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,850
- What do you think?
- Frances Underwood.

681
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,060
Frances with an "e."

682
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,770
That belongs to her.

683
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,276
She ever gonna get to hear his voice?
His words?

684
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,359
No.

685
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,362
And neither is anyone else.

686
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,239
- Her father was a great man, Claire.
- Doug.

687
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,078
How many times
did he even mention your name

688
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,705
in those recordings?

689
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,877
- He was protecting me.
- No.

690
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,671
I'm so sorry you need to believe that.

691
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,762
Do you want it?

692
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,181
I'm the only one left
who knows you, Claire.

693
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,453
You're using that child out there,
acting like the mother of this nation.

694
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,677
- [USB drive drops]
- I know the truth. Doug, I'm happy.

695
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,026
Believe me. I'm good.

696
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,158
I want you to know that I forgive you.

697
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,369
It was you, right?

698
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,343
He was coming here to kill you.

699
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,180
And then he was going to go to you next.

700
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,182
I couldn't let you destroy him.

701
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,021
Did you want him to die in my bed?
Was that your plan?

702
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,106
I didn't have a plan.

703
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,110
I didn't know.

704
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,863
[blubbering] I didn't... I didn't know.

705
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,329
I used his meds.

706
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,877
I didn't know how long
it would take, but I...

707
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,296
I knew.

708
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,843
I couldn't let him destroy
everything we built.

709
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,057
I had to protect the legacy from the man.

710
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,850
He got weak, Doug.

711
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,519
That wasn't your fault.

712
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,312
[grunts] He made you!

713
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,732
Say it. Say it.

714
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,653
Say it.

715
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,322
I'm not going to give you what you want.

716
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,954
[sobbing]

717
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,916
Damn it, Claire. Just say it. Please.

718
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,419
You're happy he's dead, too.

719
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,215
- Then say it! Say it!
- [gasps]

720
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,466
Say it!

721
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,926
Say it right now.

722
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,178
Let him go, Doug.

723
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,389
I can't!

724
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,187
- I'm sorry.
- [grunts]

725
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,357
I'm sor...

726
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,444
[Claire] It's okay.

727
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,407
It's okay. It's okay.

728
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,703
It's okay.

729
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,621
I'm sorry.

730
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,498
[Doug grunts]

731
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:50,672
[gasping]

732
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,266
[groaning]

733
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,075
- It's all right, Doug.
- [gasps]

734
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,536
- Everything is gonna be all right.
- [exhales]

735
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,085
It's all gonna be all right.

736
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,758
[gasps]

737
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,816
[gurgling]

738
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,945
[Claire sighs]

739
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,575
There.
