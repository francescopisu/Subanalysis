00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,214
[Doug] Tom.

00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,175
[dog barking]

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,552
[Doug] Tom, you here?

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,804
[dog whines]

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,474
Tom!

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,815
[barking continuing]

8
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,513
[dog whimpering]

9
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,766
[woman on TV] <i>Sources say</i>
<i>that the FBI was made aware</i>

10
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,519
<i>of the evidence linking the vice president
and a number of cabinet secretaries</i>

11
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,355
<i>with several senior
Russian government officials.</i>

12
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,107
<i>Meanwhile, President Underwood,</i>

13
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>who has still not commented on the matter,</i>

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,820
<i>in what could be construed as an attempt
to distance herself</i>

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,114
<i>and her administration

16
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,493

00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,332
[clicks]

19
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,234
Not one, not two,

20
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,862
but threeabortions.

21
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,074
The third oneat 16 weeks.

22
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,701
Think about it.

23
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,912
That's not a few cells

24
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,289
or a collection of cells.

25
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,125
It's more like four and a half inches long

26
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,211
and three and a half ounces. At 16 weeks,

27
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,841
the president's baby
would have been the size...

28
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,093
of this.

29
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,597
My fellow Americans,
there are certain parties out there

30
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,434
that hope to use my private life
for political gain.

31
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,729
I'm going to say this exactly once.

32
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,274
For many years, my late husband and I
tried to start a family.

33
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,028
I downplayed that fact
in the past because...

34
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,697
Well, it's a painful subject.

35
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,284
When I finally became pregnant,

36
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,995
the baby wasn't viable,

37
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,373
and the pregnancy had to be terminated.

38
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,791
End of story.

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,003
The baby was viable.

40
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,381
Francis and I, as parents,

41
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,548
were not.

42
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,969
So, let me be clear.

43
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,137
This is the last

44
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,182
I will ever say on this subject.

45
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,393
Okay.

46
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,940
[men and women shouting]

47
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,866
I am so proud of every person
around this table.

48
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,245
Each of them has served this country
with honor

49
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,371
and distinction.

50
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,623
Some as deputy secretaries.

51
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,502
They are all accomplished Americans

52
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,338
and members
of their respective departments.

53
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,717
But I'll let them speak for themselves.

54
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,555
Hello, my name is Jennifer Baumgarten,

55
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,308
and I am the acting Attorney General
of the United States.

56
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,437
Jenny's going to come in very handy.

57
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,773
[Jennifer] And as far
as the Justice Department is concerned,

58
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,028
I share the president's commitment
to cleaning house.

59
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,945
[man] But isn't it customary
for the vice president

60
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,490
to attend all cabinet meetings?

61
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,034
Not necessarily, no.

62
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,204
Listen, ever since I joined
the Underwood administration,

63
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,665
the president and I have worked together
on a daily basis.

64
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,375
Hand in glove. That's the way we work.

65
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,419
Is it true that you were asked to resign?

66
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,879
What? No.

67
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,171
No.

68
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,467
And the Russians and me,
it's preposterous.

69
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,595
Look, the president and I agree

70
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,306
the best way to find out
who's behind these accusations

71
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,391
is to appoint a special prosecutor.

72
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,769
And let him or her do her job.

73
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,813
- Thanks very much.
- [man] One more question, one question!

74
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,315
Mr. Vice President, one question.

75
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,483
One more question!

76
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,568
Mr. Vice President!

77
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,071
Mr. Vice President, one question,
one more question!

78
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,160
Okay. Great. Thank you. Great.

79
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,162
Okay, good. Thanks, thanks. Bye.

80
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,580
Did she find him?

81
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,083
Tom.

82
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,001
- Did she find him?
- No.

83
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,711
Front door was open.

84
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,880
Dog's not there. No one was there.

85
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,549
Okay, Tom, I am so sorry.
I felt like I had no other option.

86
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,926
I mean, I swear,

87
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,345
- I saw someone inside your...
- No, I know. I know.

88
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,765
We can go circle back
and take another look if you want, but...

89
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,683
That doesn't sound like a good idea.

90
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,853
[machine whirring]

91
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,358
[woman] That's your fax.

92
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,653
Great. How much is that?

93
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,989
$1.90 for the first page,
$1.25 for each additional.

94
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,284
And it looks like you've got
quite a few additionals coming in.

95
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,202
But can I just...

96
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,165
Let me just figure out
how much it's gonna cost.

97
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,497
Oh. That's more than enough.

98
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,957
Yeah, thank you.

99
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,507
[printer beep]

100
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,884
Here you go.

101
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,762
- Thank you.
- You bet.

102
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,813
[whirring] [machine beeping]

103
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,184
[beep]

104
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,145
"102.7."

105
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,189
Why did you send the nurse away?

106
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,275
Because she needed to eat.

107
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,319
And I feel fine.

108
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,114
- I find this anything but fine.
- No, no, look...

109
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,700
This fever's good.

110
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,077
I don't think it's supposed
to last this long.

111
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,498
Do you want me to change the sheets?

112
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,166
[sighs]

113
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,503
What's the point?

114
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,674
You know, I support you no matter what.

115
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,093
Whatever you want to try,

116
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,179
but this is...

117
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,139
Research is very good.

118
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,642
Proven effective in Europe.

119
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,570
Do you remember

120
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,450
how dad used to make me
wear long sleeves at dinner?

121
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,912
Do you miss them?

122
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,083
Her, not him.

123
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,794
He was always so sure about what was right.
Mom's doubt actually allowed her

124
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,303
to deepen as time went by.

125
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,346
Depth is overrated.
Do you want to cancel tomorrow?

126
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,775
We can't cancel.

127
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,322
What's wrong, Annie?

128
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,951
Annie? [sighs]

129
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,915
I keep calling Duncan.

130
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,629
And I've heard nothing,
and he still hasn't gone home.

131
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,052
You knew he was gonna find out someday.

132
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,598
Maybe it's for the best.

133
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,643
[man] If you're hungry or thirsty...

134
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,313
[Jane] Angry. Tired. Frustrated.

135
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,276
I should've been debriefed by now.

136
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:13,112
Again, if you need water
or a cup of coffee...

137
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,530
This is ridiculous.

138
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,657
- [knock on door]
- Excuse me.

139
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,175
[sighs]

140
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,551
No visible scars.

141
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,472
I assume you've been looked at
by a physician.

142
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,223
It's protocol.

143
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,144
So is talking with a senior member
of the Agency.

144
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,439
That won't be happening today.

145
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,193
You're essentially burnt

146
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,196
when it comes to your work
with any of the agencies.

147
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,323
That's the term, isn't it, burnt?

148
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,449
Not necessarily.

149
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,867
Virtually always.

150
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,080
Nobody knows what you said or didn't say
while in captivity.

151
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,706
I didn't say, Claire.

152
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,291
Madam President.

153
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,379
Oh, and have you heard about Mark?

154
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,508
He's made quite a spectacle of himself.

155
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,344
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my voice out of it.

156
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,846
I guess he thought
he could come out from under it.

157
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes. Well, the people that know us best,

158
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,560
know best how to hurt us.

159
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,554
President Underwood... Actually,
I've gone back to "Hale."

160
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,072
You're wrong if you think I have...

161
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,991
You are foolish
if you don't tell me what it is.

162
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,709
Guess which kind of people
I'm done suffering, Jane.

163
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,563
You were wise to come.

164
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,566
I told you and I'll tell them.

165
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,109
I don't want the job.

166
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,903
[Seth sighs]

167
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,782
Doug, just promise you'll hear them out
before you do anything.

168
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,411
And just so you're aware,
Bill's not shaking hands at the moment.

169
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,209
[Brett laughs] Doug. May I introduce you?

170
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,920
Annette and Bill Shepherd.

171
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,255
[Annette] Hello.

172
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,716
You remember Fred Amburg.

173
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,051
Doug, for the record,

174
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,679
I really enjoyed our conversations
in the facility.

175
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,139
Oh, come on, man.

176
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,558
All roads lead to Rome, you know?

177
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,810
And Annette and Bill are Rome.

178
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,272
Come. Sit down, please, Mr. Stamper.

179
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,333
[Bill] These guys were just leaving.
[Brett] Well, Mr. Shepherd,

180
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,237
- Annette.
- Brett.

181
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,489
[Fred] Talk soon, Bill.

182
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,449
- Fred.
- Annette.

183
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,341
[Bill]
Frank spoke very highly of you, Doug.

184
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,470
You cold?
I can have 'em switch off the AC.

185
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,931
Humidity in this town, my God,

186
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,601
makes you feel like you're living
inside the mouth of a dog, doesn't it?

187
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:36,106
Frederic Gustav Amburg

188
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,983
is my very best friend

189
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,860
over 52 years.

190
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,073
We've traded marbles,

191
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,950
stocks...

192
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,161
a fiancée once upon a time.

193
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,665
Please.
You're making me nervous standing there.

194
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,922
[Bill] Oh, Jesus Christ. Get over it.

195
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,384
You should consider yourself lucky
you had Fred to talk to in there.

196
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:08,681
You're like the guy who
finds $999,000 and says "Yeah,

197
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,140
but it isn't a million."

198
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,142
Brett Cole will be the speaker.

199
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,395
Next in line, if you don't count Mark.

200
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,939
[Bill]
We've gotta get this woman outta there!

201
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,817
Mr. Stamper,
my brother gets a little impatient

202
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,402
when it comes to the president.

203
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,864
We know we share a common enemy in her.

204
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,961
Whatever he left you must be damning.

205
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,547
We know that much.

206
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,048
Frank knew

207
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,553
you were the only other man who truly knew
what his wife was capable of.

208
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,889
The only one he could trust

209
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,641
to do the right thing when the time came.

210
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,685
Unless, Frank was wrong about you.

211
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,446
[Bill] A letter opener.
What does that mean?

212
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,031
How did you get your hands on the will?

213
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,490
[Annette] It's called reach.

214
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,784
You see, the thing is,

215
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,662
whatever brings her down,
could bring Francis down, as well.

216
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,373
Now you listen to me.

217
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,418
Frank was a hell of a guy.

218
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,461
We were going to accomplish
great things together.

219
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,174
[Bill] But this is too damn important
for the future of this country.

220
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,550
A future that includes you.

221
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,762
The past is just that.

222
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,449
Hold on a second.

223
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,204
Do you work for the brother or the sister?

224
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,622
The family.

225
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,168
She's not that fond of you.

226
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,132
I wanted you to know.

227
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,093
What? That I was working for them
all along?

228
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,763
One way or another,
Francis got both of us hired.

229
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,224
We know you've been meeting
with Tom Hammerschmidt.

230
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,230
You need to stay away
from him for a while.

231
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,693
God, this thing takes forever.

232
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,655
I have done nothing wrong.

233
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,200
And I'll tell you something,
I am going to expose her.

234
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,576
[Jane] And yourself.

235
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,161
And then where will you be?

236
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,330
- You're not thinking, Mark.
- What happened?

237
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,892
Did she get to you? She got to you,
is that what you're saying?

238
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,627
I'm saying something's changed
in those steely blue eyes of hers.

239
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,711
Walk away.

240
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,755
My recommendation is walk away
from this shit show.

241
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,007
No. I'm not doing that.

242
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,844
You never even wanted this.

243
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,513
And now you're willing
to fight to the death for it?

244
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,245
Who said anything about "the death?"

245
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,854
Fuck her, Jane. Fuck!

246
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,360
Fuck her.

247
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,075
[Mark sighs, panting]

248
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,790
Forgive me,
but why is your timing always off?

249
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,378
I tried to get you out.

250
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,547
Out.

251
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,341
What a quaint concept.

252
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,263
When the only way out
was never to get in in the first place.

253
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,479
- I swore. I swore.
- Ow!

254
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,940
I swore I would never set foot
in this house again.

255
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,447
What the hell are you doing here?

256
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,702
The optics are awful, Mark.

257
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,165
I mean, really.

258
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,084
It's the only place I feel safe.

259
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,049
[Claire] That looks lovely.
I don't blame her for choosing it.

260
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:17,096
And that blue-green color,
it's so specific to the French Alps.

261
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,265
Azure, yes, azure.

262
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,353
Well, of course
our little tariff agreement

263
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,605
caused some consternation, Viktor,

264
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,234
but I don't regret it.
Tell me you don't, either.

265
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,279
[laughs]

266
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,115
Right now?

267
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,117
Nothing, really.

268
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,327
Just planning for the future.

269
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,207
Out with the old.

270
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,003
[Mark] Yeah.

271
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,215
And exactly who the fuck was
Jennifer Baumgarten 72 hours ago?

272
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,969
Because I want you to push
for a special prosecutor.

273
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,430
Or... Well, hearings then.

274
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,225
Because it will if you...

275
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,069
Mitch, don't give me that.
[TV news program playing in the background]

276
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,272
It will if you do.

277
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,650
Because I was a Republican a lot longer
than I was a Democrat. You know it.

278
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,921
- Listen to me, Mitch...
- [Cruz] <i>Considering the latest revelations</i>

279
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,739
<i>regarding the vice president,
there's no denying it.</i>

280
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,701
<i>These are serious allegations
that cannot be ignored.</i>

281
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,288
<i>And something tells me
this is just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

282
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,039
<i>I mean, how deep does this go?</i>

283
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,892
- What? I'll call you back.
<i>- And to what end?</i>

284
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,311
<i>- We deserve to know. Look...</i>
- 'Cause I need to call you back.

285
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,130

288
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,512
<i>You have Ms. Stewart meeting

00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,055
<i>in the vice president's home.</i>

290
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,143
<i>Tom Yates, who we now know was someone

291
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,187
<i>And now you have the vice president</i>

292
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,355
<i>holed up in that safe house,</i>

293
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,525
<i>- assuring us that everything is...</i>
- Every news outlet is asking for comment.

294
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,485
<i>It doesn't take a genius to realize...</i>

295
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,697
It's terrible how people live
to see others fail.

296
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,325
It's going to be hard for me
to continue here in any capacity.

297
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,160
On the contrary, Kelsey,

298
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,872
I am naming you
my permanent press secretary.

299
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,042
- Ma'am, I ca... I...
- I'm going to announce it

300
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,002
the next time I take questions.

301
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,256
For the time being, though, I think
I should handle the daily press briefings.

302
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,342
I feel like I need
to give them a little face time.

303
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,885
You don't understand, I can't...

304
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,221
I will let you know
when you need to speak.

305
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,850
Don't worry.
We'll get through this together.

306
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,895
Listen, I saw this in my closet today.

307
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,563
And I thought of you.

308
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,565
I want you to have it.

309
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,612
[stammers, sighs]

310
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,000
Tom was looking to move back to New York.

311
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,712
We would have coffee,
the occasional dinner.

312
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,423
He told me he was involved with somebody

313
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,467
he couldn't get away from.

314
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,597
That it was killing him.

315
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,226
I can't think about it.

316
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,603
I won't think about it.

317
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,942
What to do about Kelsey?

318
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,195
I mean, look at that face.

319
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,031
Enjoy the bag.

320
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,619
[Mark] Oh, hi.

321
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:33,333
So what Melody Cruz just said on the air,
that was your son, I'm guessing.

322
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,335
You need to talk to him or I will.

323
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,713
- Keep your voice down. Bill's resting.
- Where is Duncan?

324
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,716
- Not here.
- Bill. Bill Shepard.

325
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,592
Won't be seeing you today.

326
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,844
[Annette sighs]

327
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,764
Still wearing it?

328
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,853
Why are you allowing me to be gutted?

329
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,856
- Gutted?
- Yes, gutted.

330
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,733
Gutted, gutted.

331
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,777
I told Melody Cruz to run the piece.

332
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,406
I have been nothing but loyal to you.

333
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,201
The press secretary was in your house

334
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,245
- with Tom Yates.
- Oh, my God. Come on.

335
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,956
Even if there isn't an ounce
of truth to it.

336
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,085
Mark, you're the face
of this whole Russia fiasco.

337
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,129
It's bad for the country.

338
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,006
It's bad for Bill and me.

339
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,594
You need to get rid of it.

340
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,140
Burn your house down, if you have to.

341
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,018
Anything that connects you to the story

342
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,937
and get a hold of yourself.

343
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,387
[Claire] <i>How's the Bureau feeling</i>

344
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,613
about the latest revelations
when it comes to Mark Usher?

345
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:49,368
It's difficult when all the evidence
is coming from Russian intelligence.

346
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,245
But we have to follow every lead.

347
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,706
To be honest, ma'am,

348
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,334
the vice president
is well-liked around town.

349
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,837
Yes, but we're talking about
very serious crimes here, Nathan.

350
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,339
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,345
So, tell me,
once Doug knew you were listening in...

352
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,431
He's been operating pretty much
in plain sight.

353
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,309
He tried to meet with Tom Hammerschmidt.

354
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,977
Again?

355
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,274
And he met with Bill and Annette Shepherd
at the Hay-Adams.

356
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,237
Also, he returned to his apartment
with a canine.

357
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,614
Doug has a dog?

358
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,199
There's one in his apartment.

359
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,744
Another thing that caught my attention
was the two men we have following

360
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,790
Doug's psychiatrist
from the facility contacted me.

361
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,751
Seems Dr. Rosen was pretty shaken up.

362
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,922
He said he blacked out and fell down.
But I mean, it doesn't make any sense...

363
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,466
- You sound very distracted, Nathan.
- Excuse me.

364
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,237
I don't know if it's the lack of sleep
because of the night feedings,

365
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,223
but I wonder if you're still capable
of doing the job that I expect of you.

366
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,186
I promise you, ma'am, I'm fully capable
of executing my duties.

367
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,106
Boy or girl?

368
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,279
- Oh. A boy.
- Oh. I'm so happy for you, Nathan.

369
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,031
They do say second marriages are the best.

370
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,911
[Claire sighs]

371
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,886
What time is it?

372
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,429
[Annette] Don't worry about it.

373
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,682
- Are you okay?
- [mutters]

374
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,975
Can I check your temperature?

375
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,393
[Bill] No.

376
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:43,315
Every time I wake up,
you people put your hands all over me.

377
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,818
When I went to bed, I was 53 years old.

378
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,782
I don't know how old I am.

379
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,036
Was Mark here?

380
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,121
I heard these voices,
I was going in and out.

381
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,623
- Seth!
- Bill,

382
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,185
- maybe you should go back to your room.
- No, I'm not dead yet.

383
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,877
- [door opens]
- Was he here?

384
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,340
- Yes, but...
- Okay. Well, where is Ms. Skorsky?

385
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,716
We have people looking for her.

386
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,885
We're fairly sure she's still
in the DC area.

387
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,261
But what does she have?

388
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,059
We now know that Ray Meyers
was faxing some kind of document

389
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,102
- to a copy shop here in the city.
- [Bill sighs]

390
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,940
- And anything from your Doug Stamper?
- No, sir.

391
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,276
Bill, please, you're still feverish.

392
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,240
[sighs] Can you give us a minute?

393
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,323
Of course.

394
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,459
Where is he?

395
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,419
[Doug] <i>He's safe.</i>

396
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,214
<i>Which is more than I can say for you.</i>

397
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,427
You know, at times I can't tell
if you're making a threat

398
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,637
or offering help.

399
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,807
Why is Seth Grayson looking
for Janine Skorsky?

400
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,229
I'm assuming the men who turned your place
upside down were looking for her.

401
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,356
She's working on an article.

402
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,859
But she'll have to find
someplace else to publish.

403
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,862
Her newspaper was bought by the Shepherds.

404
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,615
- [dog barks over the phone]
- <i>We still need to meet, Tom.</i>

405
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,242
Yeah.

406
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,246
And, Doug,

407
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,709
you lay a hand on that innocent animal,
and I swear to Christ,

408
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,460
I'll beat the living shit out of you.

409
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,505
Your dog's fine.

410
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,677
[beep]

411
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,516
Seth?

412
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,613
I know you look up to my brother.

413
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,198
And you've been very attentive.

414
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,660
But he's not well, okay?

415
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,788
And from this moment on,

416
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,791
any information you think he needs,

417
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,627
I need to hear it first.

418
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,504
I understand.

419
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,049
He will recover.

420
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,052
Thank you for saying that.

421
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,558
Doug Stamper doesn't like
to be told what to do.

422
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,352
[chuckles]

423
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,812
It only works if he thinks it's his idea.

424
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,399
Listen,

425
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,945
it may be none of my business,
but I haven't been able to reach Duncan

426
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,324
since he received a package
from the White House.

427
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,659
I don't know what it was.

428
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,703
But he was very upset.

429
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,163
Thank you.

430
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,874
You're right.

431
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,543
That's none of your business.

432
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,473
I urged him. Believe me.

433
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:07,811
I urged him to resign, but he listens
to me half the time, at best.

434
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,856
I need you to understand.

435
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,653
I don't want to hurt Mark again.

436
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,999
There was a troubled young woman...

437
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,585
I wonder why so many stories
have to begin that way.

438
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,714
I know. I know. I hate this story.

439
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,674
I hate that I'm telling you.

440
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm tired

441
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,803
of the disposable girl story.

442
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,515
She started as a volunteer
on Brett Cole's first campaign.

443
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,975
Mark and I were consulting.

444
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,687
Brett's wife was as pregnant as could be.

445
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,774
And the troubled young woman
wouldn't leave him alone.

446
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,652
Well, that's how Brett characterized it.

447
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,489
Did he encourage her attention?

448
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,657
Enjoy it?

449
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,659
You bet he did.

450
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,288
He's a man with a man's ego.

451
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,708
Anyway, of course it became a mess

452
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,085
in all the ways these stories do.

453
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,088
And suddenly,
it was Mark's job to clean it up.

454
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,051
He leaned on her too hard.

455
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,224
Badgered and berated her.

456
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,186
"You're ruining Brett's future.

457
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,396
You better disappear."

458
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,648
And so she did.

459
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,822
She jumped off the Roosevelt Bridge.

460
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,243
It fucked with Mark's head, Claire.

461
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,705
He lost his nerve after that. He...

462
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,082
He started to question everything.

463
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,460
Everything.

464
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,796
Everything.

465
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,840
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,052
I'm... I mean, this is not me.

467
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,887
Jane.

468
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,935
You're saving him, you know that, right?

469
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,608
Now, tell me the truth.

470
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,319
Did you help Cathy get away?

471
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,159
The FSB have been very helpful,
so you know.

472
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,119
They're very close to locating Cathy.

473
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,963
I've noticed that you always
adjust your hair

474
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,673
right before you tell a lie.

475
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,929
I want you to know I forgive you.

476
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,684
She wants to try and impeach me?

477
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,395
Be my guest, I cannot wait.
They hate her, you know.

478
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,482
The House, all the Senators,
they hate her guts.

479
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,069
By the time this thing is over,
she'll be begging me to...

480
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,696
[Jane] <i>Don't do this.</i>

481
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,075
Everything I've done for that ungrateful...

482
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,327
<i>Don't let this happen again.</i>

483
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,038
I didn't take proper care of you.

484
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,292
As a friend.

485
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,879
<i>Machiavelli died in exile.</i>

486
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:26,342
<i>Boss Tweed made a deal with the governor,
but in the end, was never released.</i>

487
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,510
Where are you, Jane?

488
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,263
<i>And Nixon was a prisoner of his past</i>

489
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,181
<i>till the day he died.</i>

490
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:36,603
<i>All men who had no idea how to walk away.</i>

491
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,356
I am still in possession of his body,
and I'll use it, if I have to.

492
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,150
Oh, God.

493
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,154
[sobbing]

494
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,415
No matter what you hear,

495
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,001
I was trying to help you.

496
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,423
[birds chirping]

497
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Jane.

498
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,221
- [Doug] <i>It's around the back.</i>
- You did good.

499
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,515
<i>What is it?</i>

500
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,851
<i>What does she have?</i>

501
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,354
You don't have
to concern yourself with that.

502
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,230
<i>I delivered her, didn't I?</i>

503
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,067
Whatever Janine Skorsky has
will never see the light of day.

504
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,568
She has no right to it.

505
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,820
And her source will be singing
a different tune

506
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,584
when he sees the jail time
he's looking at.

507
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,991
[scoffs] <i>Listen to you, Mr. Grayson.</i>

508
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,327
<i>By the way, what's your title?</i>

509
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,706
Vice president of research and outreach
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation.

510
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,875
<i>You're like a starfish, Seth.</i>

511
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,418
<i>Your legs grow back.</i>

512
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,645
[Doug clears throat]

513
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,774
Here's her article.

514
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,819
- And the emails?
- There's a copy attached.

515
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,904
Seth's on his way.

516
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,782
And Janine says thank you
for the head's up.

517
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,617
He'll bring the cavalry.

518
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,036
Calamity Janine can handle herself.

519
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,373
My dog?

520
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,107
All right, then.

521
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,821
Did you kill Rachel?

522
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,868
I need to hear you say it.

523
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,413
You need it for yourself.

524
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,249
I did.

525
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,044
But you won't find her.

526
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,545
No one will.

527
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,964
Turn yourself in.

528
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,507
Take me.

529
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,139
Point me in the direction
where you left her.

530
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,143
There are people who cared for her.

531
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,644
I cared for her.

532
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,785
Did Francis kill Zoe?

533
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,541
Tell me if Francis killed Zoe.

534
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,294
Is this still off the record?

535
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,301
Will it be enough for you
to know the truth?

536
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,678
Because you're never
gonna be able to prove it.

537
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,517
Tom, it has to be enough, or I walk away.

538
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,521
- No. Someone has to answer...
- Jesus Christ, he's dead.

539
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,857
But her...

540
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,069
You said it yourself,
she's as guilty as he is.

541
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,946
I'm saying, maybe more.

542
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,073
Maybe he did it all for her.

543
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,366
What d'you got?

544
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,077
Do we have an agreement?

545
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,664
I give you the truth,
and you leave him out of it.

546
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,040
I can't do that.

547
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,541
[scoffs]

548
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,255
It's not a just world, Tom.

549
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,093
But sometimes you have the chance
to make the right person pay,

550
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,886
even if it's for the wrong crime.

551
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,348
Is that enough for you?

552
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,601
Because if it's not, I respect you,
and we can say goodbye.

553
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,603
- No, Doug. It's not enough for me.
- Tom.

554
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,148
- And I do not agree!
- Tom.

555
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:54,277
I am never going to tell you
that Francis killed the three of them,

556
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,903
Zoe, Russo

557
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,781
and LeAnn.

558
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,908
But you already know the truth.

559
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
Yes.

560
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,792
Yes, I do.

561
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,676
On the record.

562
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,220
From here.

563
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,475
What did she do?

564
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,520
[Seth] Ms. Skorsky.

565
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:32,607
Members of the US Attorney
Cyber Task Force are on their way.

566
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,690
I'm giving you a chance.

567
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,902
And I'm giving you a chance
to go on the record.

568
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:42,575
Emails or any correspondence
written while at Arcas Refinery

569
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,577
or any subsidiary of Shepherd Unlimited

570
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,163
are the sole property
of Bill and Annette Shepherd.

571
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,124
Were Bill and Annette Shepherd aware

572
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,753
of the possibility that workers might die
at the Arcas plant?

573
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,546
Get that outta my face.

574
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,049
We know what Ray Meyers sent you.

575
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,135
Did you use the Arcas accident

576
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,972
to get the citizens of Bellport
to sign up for this app?

577
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:09,560
An app that you helped develop
for the Shepherd Freedom Foundation?

578
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,103
Ms. Skorsky,

579
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,274
they're about to confiscate your computer
and any devices.

580
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,609
You can take it right now.

581
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,030
You're not gonna find anything here.

582
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,618
I knew you were coming, Mr. Grayson.

583
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,460
[Nathan] Doug.

584
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,217
I'm ready to see the president.

585
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,555
[Claire] <i>You expect a person</i>
<i>to be true to his character.</i>

586
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,268
You're so careful. You're so good
about cleaning up after yourself.

587
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,395
Why didn't you just get rid of him?

588
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,065
Well, Francis wanted it otherwise.

589
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,112
I was so hoping you'd surprise me.

590
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,532
What are you gonna do, Mark?

591
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,786
You gonna pull out the body,
drape it over the tombstone?

592
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,164
Gelsemium is known to be used
by Russian intelligence.

593
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,582
I want you out of my house.

594
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:17,044
But from what I understand,
you're pretty much a murderer anyway.

595
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,672
You don't normally make mistakes, do you?

596
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799
But when you do,

597
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,217
they are something.

598
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,721
Was there some hope in you
that the troubled young woman

599
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,014
would do herself in?

600
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,683
That Congressman Cole
would be relieved somehow.

601
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,768
I'd like you
to get out of my house, Claire.

602
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,071
It's important to be
organized and ruthless.

603
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,282
Three piles, I always say.

604
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,242
The stuff you wanna keep.

605
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,078
The stuff you might need later
that you put in storage.

606
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,914
And the stuff you have to destroy.

607
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,801
- [line trills, click]
- [Jane sighs over phone]

608
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,887
- Jane, it's me.
<i>- I'm so sorry.</i>

609
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,263
Hey, hey.

610
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,724
I don't care that you told her.

611
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,809
You hear me? I don't care.

612
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,688
I have the worst migraine

613
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,858
of my life.

614
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,650
Jane.

615
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,820
Jane, are you okay?

616
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,079
[groaning]

617
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,748
<i>Are you okay?</i>

618
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,875
<i>Jane.</i>

619
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,958
[groans]

620
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,504
[sighs]

621
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,556
I almost forgot.
There's always a fourth pile.

622
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,850
The stuff you don't know what to do with.

623
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,353
Can I get you some water?

624
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,230
Something stronger, maybe?

625
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,149
No, thank you. But don't let me stop you.

626
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,778
I take a month off drinking,
come every Labor Day.

627
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,365
Kind of an academic calendar ritual

628
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,492
to prove to myself
I'm not actually an alcoholic.

629
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,246
[laughs] I'm actually abstaining myself,

630
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,789
at the moment.

631
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,834
For pursuit of...

632
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,586
clarity, I guess.

633
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,299
Would you like to sit down?

634
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,051
Sure.

635
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,976
[Claire sighs]

636
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,145
He's crazy.

637
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,814
Certifiable. You know that, right?

638
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,944
Doug got out of a psychiatric facility

639
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,696
all of a month and a half ago.

640
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,866
And no matter how hard he tries
to revive his political career

641
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,242
or get back in the game...

642
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,912
He's a delusional liar.

643
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,957
And to tell you the truth,

644
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,043
maybe he was a better wife to Francis.

645
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,882
Which is why he was never able
to see things clearly.

646
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,343
I mean, what did he tell you, Tom?

647
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,514
What do you think he told me
that you don't want me to know?

648
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:20,269
Oh, boy. The fantasies
he must have reported to you.

649
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,063
You need to pity him.

650
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,483
You really do. I do.

651
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,902
Madam President, this type of intrusion

652
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,196
- into a civilian's home...
- Listen, there's no denying

653
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,866
that Francis was a desperate man
who did,

654
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,202
yes, a lot of desperate things.

655
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,998
And I don't know. Maybe towards the end,
he was slightly deranged.

656
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,251
But whatever he did, he did alone.

657
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,670
I was not complicit.

658
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,179
[sighs] And do you...
Do you remember the last interview

659
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,097
you did with my husband?

660
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,769
And the conversation ended
where he asked you if you'd believed

661
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,479
what he'd told you.

662
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,856
Do you remember how you responded, Tom?

663
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,067
I do.

664
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,365
I said, "Not for a second."

665
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,247
Madam President,

666
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,958
when it comes to your complicity,

667
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,920
I think it's best if we meet
under more formal circumstances.

668
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,507
I'll be sending over a list of questions
to your press office.

669
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,467
You can answer them by mail, email.

670
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,012
Or if you prefer,
face-to-face and on the record.

671
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,899
[door opens]

672
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,235
[closes]

673
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,533
[Annette] Hi.

674
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,876
How many years did she clean up after you?

675
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,212
My mother, the housekeeper.

676
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,721
From the second I saw you, Duncan.

677
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,725
Your beautiful little scrunched up face.

678
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,019
Like an old man.

679
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,940
I just knew. It was instant.

680
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,651
We just belonged,

681
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,447
we belonged, we did.

682
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,743
Why didn't you legally adopt me?

683
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,834
I guess, because I didn't have to.

684
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,753
And my father?

685
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,422
Was it...

686
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,883
Oh, no, no, no.

687
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,346
A one night stand.

688
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,014
She...

689
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,351
said she didn't remember his name.

690
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,572
I went to see her.

691
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,659
My birth mother.

692
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,787
She lives not more than
half an hour from here.

693
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,330
Did you know that?

694
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,998
Did you talk to her?

695
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,376
Couldn't.

696
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,171
I couldn't do that to her.

697
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,799
I just...

698
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,135
I just watched her.

699
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,098
How could she let...

700
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,183
I knew I could take care of you.

701
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,976
I knew she couldn't.

702
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,650
If not now,

703
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,404
I hope you can forgive me.

704
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,077
You okay, Duncan?

705
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,788
Help me, Bill.

706
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,629
Who your real parents were,
where they came from...

707
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,631
I never cared about any of that.

708
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,261
Because...

709
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,597
Well, you know why.

710
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,391
[Annette] Say it.

711
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,394
Who he is, Bill.

712
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,730
I don't need this.

713
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:33,981
Stay where you are.

714
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:34,898
- No.
- Duncan,

715
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,861
if you and I are to have any chance,
you need to stay right here.

716
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,909
Bill, say it.

717
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,580
Who he is to you. To me.

718
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,583
Honey...

719
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,043
Who is he, goddamn it?

720
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,221
He's not one of us.

721
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,439
You're a coward.

722
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,401
Letting Claire Hale say it for you.

723
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,321
Well, I hope you die.

724
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,783
Let's go. Now!

725
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:44,718
[Doug] <i>The email links</i>
<i>to corporate minutes that clearly indicate</i>

726
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,261
a foreknowledge of hazard

727
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,972
that resulted in catastrophic harm
and loss of life.

728
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,141
In attendance and party to consent

729
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,643
of the corporate policy

730
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,813
was the entity's chief executive officer
William Shepherd.

731
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,651
Arcas Refinery is liable.

732
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,444
As is Shepherd Unlimited.

733
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,864
The corporation and Bill Shepherd himself
can be charged

734
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,866
with involuntary manslaughter.

735
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,868
Expose him as a murderer

736
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,120
and cost him billions in the process.

737
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,457
Is Ms. Skorsky publishing?

738
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,501
Hmm. I made sure of it.

739
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,005
It's a better story once you arrest him.

740
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,008
And the article will justify the arrest.

741
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,263
We can get some lawyers in here and delay,
at the very least.

742
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,597
No.

743
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,601
Then we can make sure
they walk you out the back.

744
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,641
No, no, no.

745
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,186
No, no. I want the cuffs.

746
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,022
President's gone too far this time.

747
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,524
I want the whole world to see.

748
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,485
And my sister?

749
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,909
You could've handed me this anywhere,
why here?

750
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,328
Seemed appropriate.

751
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,164
You never struck me as nostalgic, Doug.

752
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,794
Could this be
about the posthumous pardoning

753
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,379
you've been imagining for Francis?

754
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,006
You don't belong here.

755
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,094
I sometimes worry about your imagination.

756
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,929
Your slavish devotion.

757
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,265
You can't think beyond him. Not really.

758
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,934
I can imagine you not
in the White House quite clearly.

759
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,561
Oh, my goodness.

760
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:22,524
You keep saying things like that,
I might not be able to let you leave.

761
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,367
What did you do with it?

762
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,953
The will.

763
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,664
Did you burn it?

764
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,209
He left me everything.

765
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,503
You know it, and I know it.

766
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,257
[yawns] Excuse me.

767
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,845
I get sleepy so early these days.

768
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,307
Oh.

769
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,480
I'm not going to be told
what to do anymore, Doug.

770
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,193
Not by you or anyone or any man,

771
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,528
ever, ever again.

772
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,490
- Thanks.
- No problem.

773
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,991
- Won't be long.
- Whatever.

774
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,008
Turn.

775
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,468
Sit, sit.

776
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:32,843
Good boy, listen.

777
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,684
- Get down, below the counter.
- Okay, okay.

778
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,894
You do exactly
like I told you before, okay?

779
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:44,064
Remember, it's all about having fun,
remember?

780
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,827
You be a good boy.
It's gonna be all right.

781
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,418
- Just have fun, alright?
- [dog whines]

782
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,778
Okay. [pants]

783
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,947
[gunshot echoes]

784
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,658
[gunshot fires]

785
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,899
[man on TV]
<i>And in breaking news just in,</i>

786
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,126
<i>we are sad to report that one</i>
<i>of the </i>Washington Herald's

787
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,265
<i>most accomplished journalists and editors
Tom Hammerschmidt</i>

788
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,768
<i>was pronounced dead at the scene
of a robbery gone terribly wrong.</i>

789
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,353
<i>The White House was quick to comment,</i>

790
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,231
<i>as the president had sat down
with the award-winning Hammerschmidt</i>

791
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,233
<i>for an interview only hours before.</i>

792
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,902
<i>Along with her condolences,
the president used the opportunity</i>

793
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:35,073
<i>to call for greater gun control,
particularly in our inner cities.</i>

794
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,992
Fuck!

795
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,040
[Claire] <i>The last thing he gave you.</i>

796
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,333
<i>If you don't tell me what it means...</i>

797
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,537
[Doug] <i>I was kind of hoping</i>
<i>you could tell me, Claire.</i>

798
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,799
Doug, Tom Hammerschmidt is dead.

799
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,259
Cathy, Jane.

800
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,886
Bill Shepherd is going to prison.

801
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,763
Mark has no one to turn to.

802
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,806
It's just you and me.

803
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,309
Gimme a moment, please.

804
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,402
[retches, coughs]

805
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,154
[hinges squeak, door closes]

806
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,334
Please know. [sighs]

807
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,256
The thought of accelerating the exit
of three poor souls from this earth

808
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,467
is beyond painful.

809
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,969
[gags, gasps] [clears throat]

810
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,049
Sorry about that.

811
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,218
Not at all.

812
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,933
I'm not worried about you anymore, Doug.

813
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,896
You wouldn't do anything to hurt Francis.
You're not capable.

814
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,732
And see, the thing is...

815
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,279
whatever Francis left you,
it doesn't actually belong to you.

816
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,616
We entered our marriage with a his,
hers and ours agreement.

817
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,911
You keep
and do whatever you want with yours,

818
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,997
I keep and do whatever I want with mine.

819
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,292
My daddy and mother insisted,
as you can imagine.

820
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,337
But the prenup we had, had a clause.

821
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:58,133
If ever we have descendants together

822
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,635
and one of us is first to die,

823
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,055
we agree to waive our rights
to everything passed on.

824
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,473
By which I mean,

825
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,143
all of Francis's assets

826
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,895
are entitled to his heir.

827
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,106
If he should have one.
