1
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,889
And where are you from,
Mr. Brown?

2
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:04,976
Sheldon, sir.
I'm a retired police officer.

3
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,269
Well, then I can only imagine
that Sheldon must be

4
00:02:07,353 --> 00:02:09,271
one of the safest places in this state.

5
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:12,608
We do our best.

6
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:16,487
But my son, he's a marine,
stationed at Camp Dwyer.

7
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:19,074
He keeps our country safer than I do.

8
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:20,533
Me and my wife were wondering,

9
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:24,704
if he got sent over to the Jordan
Valley, will that really keep us safer?

10
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:28,541
Because it sure seems like
the whole peacekeeping mission

11
00:02:28,624 --> 00:02:30,501
is only making things more dangerous.

12
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:32,754
Thank you for that. May I?

13
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:39,177
Well, first of all, let me say how
grateful I am for your son's service.

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,804
I know we all feel exactly the same way.

15
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,229
And now, uh, let me try
to answer your question.

16
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,607
Have we run into some difficulties
with the Russians?

17
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,358
Yes, we have.

18
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:57,904
Is there tension between
the Israelis and the Palestinians?

19
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,321
Absolutely.

20
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:04,035
But, that is the very reason
that this mission is so important.

21
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:08,539
We have gathered together
a coalition of seven nations

22
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:11,251
to bring stability to a region

23
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,921
that has suffered
from unrest for decades.

24
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,006
It will take time.

25
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,968
And there may be lives
that will be lost.

26
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,512
But this is not just important
for the Middle East's security,

27
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:27,767
it's important for the security of the
United States and the rest of the world.

28
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,228
And I hope that I've
answered your question.

29
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,688
Now, who was next?

30
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:35,233
Uh, let's see here.

31
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,652
Well, how about
this young woman right here?

32
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:40,738
Now, I'll give you my microphone,
but only if you promise to give it back.

33
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:42,531
He seemed to want to hang
onto it for a while.

34
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:47,245
- There you are.
- Um, my name is Annie Wietz,

35
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,124
and I'm also worried
about what the officer was just saying.

36
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:54,127
- I want a safe world for my grandkids--
- Give me back the mic

37
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,838
- and I'll answer your question.
- I haven't asked my question yet.

38
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,422
Oh!

39
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,341
Apologies. I'm ahead of myself.
Go ahead.

40
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:04,512
The covert operation, the one
that caused the Israelis to invade.

41
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:09,225
Was that us? Because that really
seemed to make a mess of everything.

42
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:10,559
- May I?
- Please.

43
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,270
Thank you. Now, Annie?

44
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,521
- Is that your name, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:13,604 --> 00:04:16,107
Now, I have said this
on this matter before,

46
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,985
and I know it may be frustrating,
but it is the truth.

47
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:23,072
When it comes to covert operations
by any nation,

48
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:27,451
or matters of intelligence,
for security purposes,

49
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,370
including the security
of our own soldiers,

50
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,123
I simply cannot comment on these issues.

51
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:36,002
But, sir, I'm sorry, but what is
the point of having us ask questions

52
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:39,797
- if you won't answer them?
- Well, she's got me there. Uh...

53
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,050
I can answer any question but that one.

54
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,969
In fact, I hope that we can
ask some questions

55
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:48,181
about how we're gonna focus
on things right here at home.

56
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:49,724
How about someone up there
in the cheap seats?

57
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,184
Anyone have a question there?

58
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:57,065
The situation in Jordan Valley,
it threatens to bleed across the border.

59
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,444
We already have refugees
requesting to enter Jordan.

60
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,488
Forgive me, Prince Ryad.
You may be dealing with

61
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:07,158
a few hundred refugees,
but we are facing mortar attacks.

62
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:09,244
Fourteen in the last two weeks.

63
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:10,745
None of your people have died yet.

64
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:13,331
The last one came
within 50 meters of a school.

65
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,917
Your troops have killed over
a dozen Palestinians in house raids.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,794
- You expect us not to fight back?
- We need the violence to stop.

67
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:22,757
If it continues, the peacekeeping
mission will fall apart.

68
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,177
And it's our best hope
for long-term stability.

69
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:29,680
Can you speak to Hamas and Hezbollah?
Get them to agree to a cease-fire?

70
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,433
Israel has twice as many troops
in the region

71
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,394
as before the peacekeeping
mission began.

72
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,400
No, it is we who are defending ourselves.

73
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:42,026
You agreed to remove
two thousand troops.

74
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,613
If there's a cessation of mortar
attacks, and if the Russians leave.

75
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,407
A one-third troop reduction.

76
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,867
That should be enough
to convince your people, no?

77
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,995
Once the troops leave,
I engage them, but not before.

78
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,374
Show some goodwill.
You'll still have 4,000 troops there.

79
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,210
Because we cannot accomplish anything

80
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:02,046
unless we have proof
of de-escalation on both sides.

81
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,881
What about Russia?

82
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,134
That's a separate issue.
We will tackle that another time.

83
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:08,928
Can you convey to Jerusalem
the importance of this troop reduction?

84
00:06:09,011 --> 00:06:10,763
Yes, but no promises.

85
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:16,560
All right. Thank you, everyone.

86
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,021
We'll meet again tomorrow morning.

87
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,356
Thank you, madam.

88
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,195
Eliana.

89
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,614
We need to discuss the no-fly zone.

90
00:06:28,697 --> 00:06:32,201
It's only for the Russians,
not the peacekeepers.

91
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:35,371
They can't stay
if they have nothing to eat.

92
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:38,498
What are you going to do,
shoot down a supply plane?

93
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:40,793
We hope they won't make us
face that choice.

94
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,420
They'll ignore it.

95
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,964
And you're just going
to antagonize Moscow.

96
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:47,675
I'm sorry, but the no-fly zone
is above my pay grade.

97
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,345
Perhaps your husband can talk
to the prime minister.

98
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:52,096
When are we looking at?

99
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,640
Could be tomorrow, could be a week.

100
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,310
I'm not a part of those
conversations anymore.

101
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,103
We could vet the questions.

102
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,563
That doesn't work in Iowa.
It'll piss people off.

103
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,232
Even if we did,
it wouldn't make a difference.

104
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:06,486
The country is preoccupied with
the Jordan Valley. We're off message.

105
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:10,198
In the meantime, we can put the town
halls on hold. Just do the stump.

106
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,782
I think we should also
postpone the debate.

107
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,826
Dunbar'll hit you hard for that.
Say you're dodging.

108
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,411
Have Jackie request
the postponement.

109
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,038
- What's her reason?
- I don't care.

110
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:20,166
Just as long as it isn't coming from us.
Talk to her. Thank you, gentlemen.

111
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,335
What's next?

112
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:27,923
Uh, you're slated for fundraising calls
until 4:15, then a DOD briefing.

113
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:31,093
Also, your friend
from The Sentinel called, Tim Corbet.

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,263
Thank you.

115
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,406
You know, I can fold my own clothes.

116
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,324
Took me two seconds.

117
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,706
You remember when we
shared a room my senior year?

118
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:03,584
And if I left, like, one sock
on the floor, you'd freak?

119
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,713
Yeah, I started doing that on purpose,
just to see you flip out.

120
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:10,132
Yeah. I remember.

121
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:25,356
Come on, leave it.
Be a rebel.

122
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:33,364
Hey, sweetie.

123
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,202
Well, tell her if it wiggles,
it means it's gonna fall out.

124
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,499
Okay. Let me talk to her.

125
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,546
Hi!

126
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,883
Uh, now, listen to me. You--

127
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,510
I know your mom
doesn't want you playing with it,

128
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:56,304
so you have to do what she says.

129
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:01,267
Well, because the tooth fairy
doesn't want fingerprints all over it.

130
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,396
Okay, I'll do it,
but you have to promise me

131
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,940
that you and your brother
will stop playing with your tooth.

132
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,152
Okay, you ready?

133
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,028
Are you super ready?

134
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,575
Boogala, boogala, boogala,
boogala, boogala.

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,121
Okay. Put your mom back on.

136
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:25,749
How much of a postponement?

137
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,793
Until we get this crisis resolved.

138
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,504
Dunbar will see right through that.

139
00:09:29,587 --> 00:09:31,297
Not if it's coming from you.

140
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,300
Say you want to focus on meeting people
face to face, not a televised debate.

141
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:35,843
We'll back you up.

142
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,678
All right, I'll talk to my staff.

143
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,888
We'll draft some language
and I'll run it past you.

144
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,974
Jackie?

145
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:46,437
I want to talk to you about
what happened a couple weeks ago.

146
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:49,106
- I crossed a line.
- Remy, you don't have to.

147
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,233
I want to. I want to explain myself.

148
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:59,074
I still have strong feelings,
I'm not gonna deny that.

149
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:05,247
Maybe a different job...
a different time, different place.

150
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,666
But, uh...

151
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,377
Look...

152
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:13,922
I've loved people before,
and I've learned to let 'em go.

153
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,427
I'm not gonna put you
in that position again.

154
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:27,061
It's been hard for me, too.

155
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:35,736
Hm...

156
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,324
You've got work.

157
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,379
I'm glad you said something.

158
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,886
Hello?

159
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,180
Tim, it's Frank.

160
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,224
I'm sorry it took me all day
to get back to you.

161
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:50,227
Ah, no worries.
Your plate must be pretty full.

162
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,354
Well, more than I'd like at the moment.

163
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:53,648
Is this a bad time?

164
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:57,735
I think I can spare a few minutes
for the President of the United States.

165
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,570
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

166
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:03,115
Good. Uh, last kid got off to college,

167
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:06,535
so Beth and I are on our own.

168
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:09,913
Finally. Yeah, the business is strong.

169
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:13,375
I'm actually, uh, I'm thinking
of expanding to Glenwood Canyon.

170
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,834
That's great.

171
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:19,632
Listen, I called because that, uh...
that writer reached out to me.

172
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,717
You know, the one doing your book.

173
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:25,763
Said, uh, he wanted to talk
about The Sentinel.

174
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:26,972
What'd you say?

175
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:29,266
I said I was in a rush
and I'd call him back later.

176
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,769
I didn't want to say more
without talking to you first.

177
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,604
Well, he should've checked
with me beforehand.

178
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,356
I don't want him harassing my friends.

179
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,857
He wasn't harassing me at all.
He's a nice guy, actually.

180
00:12:37,941 --> 00:12:41,696
I mean, I'm happy to talk with him
if it'll help your book.

181
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:43,364
Well, the book isn't really
about The Sentinel,

182
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:46,408
so I don't know why he'd bother, but
I'll talk to him and I'll let you know.

183
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,202
Whatever you need, Mr. President.

184
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:49,995
Stop that.

185
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,833
Hey, listen, uh, we run a half-price
special for Commanders-in-Chief.

186
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:58,838
So, uh... if you're ever in Colorado
with some time on your hands...

187
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,716
Well, I hope the same goes
for ex-presidents, too.

188
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,010
Nope. Only sittin' ones.
So you better win that damn election.

189
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:08,514
I'll do my best.
Nice talking to you, Tim.

190
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,015
You too, Frank.

191
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,736
I want to set aside time
for Tom Yates, in person. Tomorrow.

192
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:23,278
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:49,012
Yes.

194
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,215
Francis?

195
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,217
I just got off the phone with Cathy.

196
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,261
The Israelis are
instituting the no-fly zone.

197
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,847
I'm scheduled to have a call tomorrow
with the prime minister.

198
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:33,515
They want to cancel the call.

199
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,016
Let me see if I can get him
on the phone now.

200
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,645
They just sent out a communiqué
to all embassies.

201
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,783
Good morning.

202
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:52,827
As you--

203
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,165
Excuse me.
It's been a long night.

204
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,584
Thank you.

205
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:07,048
Israel instituted a no-fly zone

206
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,845
over the Jordan Valley,
6:00 a.m. today, Israeli time.

207
00:15:10,928 --> 00:15:12,680
And while I disagree with this action,

208
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:17,351
I understand the reason behind it,
and we must stand with our ally.

209
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:20,938
Our chief goal remains
de-escalation in the region.

210
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,773
Ambassador Underwood
and the State Department

211
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:26,318
are working with all interested
parties toward that end.

212
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:30,531
Our utmost priority
is guaranteeing civilian safety.

213
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:35,076
- And Israel has confirmed--
- When are you off to Des Moines?

214
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,372
A couple of hours.
I have to make some donor calls first.

215
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,332
You have surgery today?

216
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:43,335
A double bypass.
Triple tomorrow.

217
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:46,129
But nothing scheduled
for almost a week after,

218
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,966
so maybe I can come out
to Iowa and we can--

219
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,468
- Russian aircrafts that ignore this...
- What's going on?

220
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,637
...could potentially be subject
to military action...

221
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,056
This Jordan Valley thing's a mess.

222
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,432
He's in big trouble.

223
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:58,726
...any such actions...

224
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,978
And then there's the whole
AmWorks thing.

225
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,897
All the baggage from last year.

226
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:07,401
- You having doubts?
- I don't know.

227
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,194
Maybe.

228
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,823
That sounds serious.

229
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:17,077
If there was an ideal time
to walk away, now is it.

230
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,788
Mm-hm. And then what?

231
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,124
Focus on Congress.

232
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,502
Yeah, but you want more than that.

233
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,255
I could spend more time
with you and the kids.

234
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,091
Well, I don't want a wife
who's miserable

235
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,343
because she turned her back
on the White House.

236
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,641
Look...

237
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:43,311
The thing about surgery is,
once you're in, you're in.

238
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:48,191
There's a beating heart in front of you.
Someone's life.

239
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,693
There's no room for doubt.

240
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:53,072
So, whatever goes wrong...

241
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,451
say hemorrhage or a blood clot,
you deal with it.

242
00:16:57,534 --> 00:16:59,369
You don't get to walk away.

243
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:04,458
But that's life or death.
This isn't.

244
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:08,003
It is for you.

245
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:11,131
...to maintain international peace
and security.

246
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:16,762
The United States is committed
to defusing this situation.

247
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,848
We are here for Israel,
we are here for Palestine,

248
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:22,267
we are here for Russia.

249
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,936
And we are here for--

250
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:28,273
- Ready to go to your meeting?
- Yeah.

251
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:45,833
Come on.

252
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,419
I was thinking...

253
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:53,966
you know how a while back, you mentioned
the kids coming out from Ohio?

254
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,093
You want them to visit?

255
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,095
Well, maybe you don't want them
to see me like this?

256
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,181
- Doing my 60 days?
- You've been doing great.

257
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:04,018
I'd be thrilled for them to come
out here and meet their uncle,

258
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,602
if that's something you want to do.

259
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,063
I could hit the couch for a few nights.

260
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,024
You guys can have the bedroom.

261
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:12,818
I'll call Sarah.

262
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,906
I say to Israel,
keep your airspace.

263
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,534
Keep your no-fly zone.

264
00:18:20,617 --> 00:18:23,912
I will be flying through it, nevertheless.

265
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:27,791
Shoot me down, if you wish,
because nothing can stop me

266
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,127
from standing side by side
with my countrymen.

267
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,505
I will embrace the men
who serve this country,

268
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:35,841
because I am Russian,

269
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:39,427
and Russians... do not abandon their own.

270
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,390
Russian TV.

271
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:46,810
Forty-five minutes ago.
It could be hot air.

272
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,896
Petrov wants the world to see this.

273
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,355
He wouldn't put it out there
unless he meant it.

274
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:52,399
Israel says they're prepared
to enforce the no-fly zone.

275
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:54,526
They'll never shoot down
a head of state.

276
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,570
Yeah, which means they'll
lose face and compensate

277
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,488
by increasing their ground presence.

278
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,075
I got Jerusalem to agree to a pullout.

279
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:03,160
- Two thousand troops.
- Not if Petrov flies there.

280
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:06,371
If we downplay Petrov's move
as political theatrics,

281
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:09,290
I might be able to convince
the Israelis to follow through.

282
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:12,169
No, we need to respond
to Russia directly,

283
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,462
not waste our time with Israel.

284
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:16,882
Israel is our ally.
We're far more likely

285
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:19,009
to have a productive dialogue
with them than with Russia.

286
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,427
What's our main objective here?

287
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,471
To get Russian troops
out of the Jordan Valley.

288
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:27,350
Let's stop poking around from the sides.
We need to tackle this head on.

289
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,072
Open up a line of communication
with Moscow.

290
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:42,407
Tell them I'm coming
to the Jordan Valley myself.

291
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,658
Sir, I--

292
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,786
I'm gonna meet with Petrov face to face,
on the ground.

293
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,704
- Mr. President, the risk factors of--
- I'm well aware.

294
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:50,165
I want to be notified the moment
that Petrov is on his way.

295
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:52,000
You work with the CIA and DOD

296
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:54,377
to figure out any logistics
and security you have to.

297
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,671
Talk to Seth.
Let's start drafting our message.

298
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:59,800
Cathy, I want to sit down with you and
Defense, and work out bargaining chips.

299
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:01,509
Thank you all very much.

300
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,555
I meant now.

301
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:14,773
- I'm not to be disturbed.
- You have a meeting with Mr. Yates.

302
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:16,650
Have him wait and tell him
it might be a while.

303
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,110
Yes, sir.

304
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,994
You're on
with Ambassador Moryakov.

305
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:30,330
- Alexi?
- You're wasting your time, Claire.

306
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,458
We can't let Petrov go.

307
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,669
I'm powerless.

308
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,463
Then tell me who we can speak to
who can influence him.

309
00:20:38,546 --> 00:20:41,967
His mind is made up.
No one would dare challenge him on this.

310
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,594
All right, then I'll come to New York.
Let's meet with Caspi.

311
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,596
We'll ease Jerusalem's fears together.

312
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,099
I can't.
I'm on my way to Washington.

313
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,977
- What for?
- The embassy sent for me.

314
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,812
I'm being recalled.

315
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,897
- Is it because...?
- I don't know.

316
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:58,317
Alexi, if you need anything--

317
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,403
The ambassador
has ended the call, Mrs. Underwood.

318
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:13,957
- Mrs. Underwood.
- Hello.

319
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,254
- Edward?
- Wait here a moment.

320
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,550
Yes, ma'am?

321
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,885
What's he doing here?

322
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,846
The president wanted to meet with him.
He asked me to have him wait upstairs.

323
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,597
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

324
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:36,104
If he wants the same terms
as we had before,

325
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:39,482
I'll smooth it over
with our NATO allies.

326
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:43,070
It's tough to lose Poland,
but I think that we can compensate

327
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:46,240
with anti-missile subs
on patrol here in the Finnish Sea.

328
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:49,409
- Thank you.
- Francis? Do you have a moment?

329
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:51,203
I'll be right back.

330
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:55,040
Give us a minute.

331
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:59,169
I think this is a mistake.
You're chasing him.

332
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:02,214
- Let me work with Israel.
- You've been working with Israel.

333
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,632
Now there's a no-fly zone.
One step forward, two steps back.

334
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:06,260
Diplomacy takes time.

335
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:07,928
Iowa is in two months.

336
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:10,597
You can't let the campaign drive
our foreign policy.

337
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,850
If I don't win in Iowa,
there is no foreign policy.

338
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,228
Excuse us, Mr. President.

339
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:18,313
Let's not talk out here.

340
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:21,275
If you go to the Jordan Valley,
you have to walk away with a solution.

341
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:24,069
And he knows that,
which means he gets all the leverage.

342
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:27,446
Well, it's not as if we have much
leverage at the moment.

343
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,824
He's going to want
the peacekeeping mission out.

344
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,411
That's right.
And the missile defense system, too.

345
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:35,205
And I'm prepared
to give him both if necessary.

346
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,417
What are you talking about?
Don't toss the mission aside, Francis.

347
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:41,253
Claire, you're too invested in this.

348
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,921
The mission is dead.

349
00:22:43,004 --> 00:22:46,258
It was dead the moment
those troops got blown up.

350
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:49,677
Your plan failed. I'm sorry.

351
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,554
It's my fault. I approved it.

352
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,681
But now, I have to fix it.

353
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:56,726
Why won't you place faith
in a diplomatic solution?

354
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,353
This is diplomacy.

355
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:01,315
Sometimes it comes down
to two men in a room.

356
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:04,067
I have no faith in the UN anymore.

357
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,946
I do have faith in my ability
to negotiate with this man.

358
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:10,031
Francis, I know you value my opinion.

359
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:12,033
Absolutely, above all others.

360
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:15,578
We have both put a great deal of effort
and thought into how to handle Russia.

361
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,956
I'd like for this to be a decision
we make together,

362
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,750
instead of an impulsive response--

363
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,836
- Not right now.
- Petrov's in the air.

364
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,881
Get Admiral Dale on the line.

365
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:31,386
Claire, I value your opinion.
I just don't agree with it this time.

366
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,151
Mr. Yates.

367
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:48,362
The president's
gonna have to reschedule.

368
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:01,875
Thomas.

369
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,002
You give us a few moments, Edward?

370
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:06,254
Yes, ma'am. I'll be by the stairs.

371
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,219
How's the book coming?

372
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:20,060
I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

373
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:21,853
There's a big piece missing.

374
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:24,439
- What is it?
- You.

375
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:29,110
He hasn't... mentioned me at all?

376
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,947
Plenty of times, but...
it's not enough.

377
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:35,242
What has he said?

378
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:38,828
You're putting me in an awkward
position, Mrs. Underwood.

379
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,830
You don't want to betray his trust.

380
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,999
He and I have an agreement.

381
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:47,045
I understand. I shouldn't pry.
I'll leave you be, then.

382
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:49,839
He said he loves you more than anything.

383
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:53,427
That there wouldn't be
a White House without you.

384
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:58,181
He showed me your first house...
in Gaffney.

385
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,310
Where you planted the tulips.

386
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,187
And he said he was ashamed.

387
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,189
Of what?

388
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:09,025
That you married him.
Because you deserve better.

389
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,488
You should really be in this book,
Mrs. Underwood.

390
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:15,449
I've got a lot of stories
from his perspective.

391
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:17,158
Not a single one from yours.

392
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:20,328
Well, he's the one running
for president, not me.

393
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:22,122
Yeah.

394
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:23,790
I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

395
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:27,626
I think people need
to hear your voice to hear his.

396
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,379
Can we set up a time to meet?

397
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:33,883
Um... I'll think about it.
Thank you, Thomas.

398
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,552
Mm-hm.

399
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,144
Okay.

400
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:48,064
Seth, this is good,
but downplay expectations even more.

401
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:49,857
There's no telling
what we'll walk away with.

402
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:51,526
- Yes, sir.
- We shouldn't inform the press

403
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,612
until after you land,
for security purposes.

404
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,113
Donald...

405
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,699
- If anything should happen to me--
- I'm prepared.

406
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:01,536
- But nothing will.
- God help us.

407
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,662
Danton will walk you
through the full brief.

408
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,706
Everything's set up in the Situation Room.

409
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,666
- Good luck, Mr. President.
- Thank you. I'll be right back.

410
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:17,051
Now, listen, I know you have
reservations about all this.

411
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:19,887
You're doing what you think is best.

412
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,515
Please be careful out there.

413
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:22,681
I will.

414
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,851
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

415
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,649
Let's go.

416
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,824
Hello?

417
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,909
- Hi!
- Hi.

418
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:45,497
Hello! Wow! You guys really look alike!

419
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,874
- Okay.
- Oh...

420
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:50,877
We're a hugging family.

421
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,671
I see.

422
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:54,964
Hi, you must be Francine.

423
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:57,884
- No, I'm not!
- She likes Franke better.

424
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,094
Oh. Nice to meet you, Franke.

425
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:01,429
- No.
- Yep.

426
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:03,722
- I told you!
- Careful.

427
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,393
It's your Uncle Doug.

428
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:07,894
Do you want to give
your Uncle Doug a hug?

429
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,770
Come here, you.

430
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,651
We'll land in Tel Aviv,

431
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,405
then take a special forces convoy from
there to the perimeter of the valley.

432
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:21,199
The Israelis will provide air support
until we get to the valley,

433
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:22,950
then our helos will take over.

434
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:26,496
Once we get to the camp,
the Russians insist on ground units only.

435
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,249
- We'll pass through a checkpoint--
- How secure is this location?

436
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,585
The position is not fortified
to our liking.

437
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,169
It's not blast-proof.

438
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:36,923
Sir, we're going to ask that
you wear your Kevlar and helmet.

439
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:40,343
- Sir?
- Mary.

440
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:43,513
- Why were no press allowed to go?
- Given the security situation,

441
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:45,390
we didn't want to put any press
in harm's way,

442
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:48,602
or risk any hostile elements
knowing in advance.

443
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:50,311
So the president has already landed?

444
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,689
About 90 minutes ago.

445
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,898
Mark.

446
00:27:53,981 --> 00:27:56,443
What exactly does the president
hope to achieve?

447
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:59,446
Ideally, we'd like the Russians
to vacate the region.

448
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:01,072
We can't promise that they will.

449
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:04,701
But the president hopes that we can
make progress toward a withdrawal.

450
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:05,952
Kate.

451
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,662
This could be seen as an election stunt.

452
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:10,164
He's trailing Dunbar in the polls,
so he wants to save the day.

453
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:11,750
I guarantee you this is no stunt.

454
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,793
The president is taking extraordinary
measures to end this crisis.

455
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:28,326
Mr. President.

456
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:37,794
You can take your vest off now,
Mr. President.

457
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:41,047
- We're safe here.
- You trust these walls?

458
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,007
If you're frightened,
you shouldn't have come.

459
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:48,638
When I was in the KGB,
I spent six months in Afghanistan.

460
00:29:48,722 --> 00:29:52,225
This place is a palace compared
to the hole in the ground I lived in.

461
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:57,856
Here. You should stay hydrated.

462
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:59,899
I brought a shipment of water

463
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:00,983
- in on my plane.
- Thank you.

464
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:04,237
So much for the Israelis
stopping our resupply.

465
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:09,367
I wish we were in the fertile part
of the valley, though.

466
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,703
I hear it's quite green and beautiful.

467
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:14,080
Well, this is better for pictures.

468
00:30:14,163 --> 00:30:15,248
How do you mean?

469
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:19,293
Well, if you flew into a paradise,
wouldn't be as effective, now, would it?

470
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,546
You do have a flair for the theatrical.

471
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:25,633
I can say the same about you,
showing up on my doorstep like this.

472
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:29,136
This isn't your doorstep.
You're squatting where you shouldn't be.

473
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,014
I don't think my men
will see it like that.

474
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:35,685
Do your men know that you're
responsible for killing their comrades?

475
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,145
Accusations.

476
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:40,899
That's how you plan to convince me?

477
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:46,237
What do you require
to pull out of the valley?

478
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,617
That your troops leave as well,
and the entire peacekeeping operation.

479
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,869
Well, as soon as your troops withdraw,

480
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:55,538
I'll make sure the UN
forces do exactly the same.

481
00:30:55,622 --> 00:30:59,250
Hm. And you scale back missile defense.

482
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,836
As we agreed to twice already.

483
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,505
That's when we were making
an entirely different deal.

484
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:08,802
The main difference now is that
we're both standing in the desert,

485
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:13,180
and you can't leave with nothing
to show but sand in your shoes.

486
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,600
I'll agree to the scale-back.
Same terms as before.

487
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:18,102
How soon can you mobilize a withdrawal?

488
00:31:18,185 --> 00:31:21,355
Well, the moment UN forces begin
to pull out, we will do the same.

489
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:24,734
I've had the Pentagon come up with
an exit plan that we can put into effect

490
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:27,069
as early as tomorrow.
As for the rest of the UN forces,

491
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,989
I can reach out to
the Secretary General immediately.

492
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:33,493
You or... your wife?

493
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:35,703
Well, yes, she would probably
make the call on my behalf.

494
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:37,580
I don't think she should.

495
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:39,415
You think I should make the call?

496
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,041
More than that.

497
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,461
I think she should be gone.

498
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:47,799
Gone in what way?
Gone from these negotiations?

499
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:50,134
As ambassador.

500
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:51,970
My final condition.

501
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:57,809
That cannot be on the table.

502
00:31:57,892 --> 00:32:01,646
It is. And it's non-negotiable.

503
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:10,279
Ms. Dempsey.
I'm a friend of Lisa's.

504
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,699
- Uh, Max?
- That's right.

505
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:15,451
Yes, she told me to tell you
she's running a few minutes behind.

506
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,077
Okay, I'll just wait outside.
Thank you.

507
00:32:17,161 --> 00:32:18,621
No, it's... chilly.

508
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,540
You can come on up to her room.

509
00:32:20,623 --> 00:32:23,417
Okay.

510
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:26,337
I just want you to know...
I'm so sorry.

511
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,216
Lisa told us and our prayers
are with you.

512
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,721
Thank you so much.

513
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:39,141
She said you and your husband
were like parents to her. I see why.

514
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:41,519
Come on in.

515
00:32:44,814 --> 00:32:47,608
Max, hey.

516
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:49,109
Sorry I'm late.

517
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,945
Here, I want you to take that back.

518
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,530
No, no, no, that money's yours.

519
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,032
No, I can't. I can't take it.

520
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:55,867
Everyone at the fellowship pitched in.

521
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,369
- Just give it back to 'em.
- I can't.

522
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:01,205
You said that you needed the money
for the medicine.

523
00:33:04,124 --> 00:33:05,543
Yeah, sit down.

524
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:08,128
Sorry, please.

525
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:11,632
Okay.

526
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,227
What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound fucked up,

527
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,940
but just hear me out
before you say anything, all right?

528
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:29,984
Okay.

529
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,031
I'm leaving.

530
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,324
And I'm not coming back.

531
00:33:37,408 --> 00:33:41,120
And... I have to leave
because I'm in danger.

532
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:45,666
My name isn't Max.

533
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:48,461
I don't have AIDS.

534
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,047
- Wait. Hold on.
- Let me finish, please.

535
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,050
I want to explain everything to you,
but I can't.

536
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,843
The less you know, the better.

537
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:57,637
But listen to me.

538
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,848
If the FBI comes here,
you can't say anything.

539
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:02,642
You have to tell them you don't know me.

540
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:04,477
- The FBI?
- Yes, and if they do,

541
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,647
I want you to contact this man.
His name is Doug Stamper.

542
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,317
- And he can help you.
- Max. This is crazy.

543
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,611
It's not my name.

544
00:34:13,694 --> 00:34:15,738
I made it up.
I made up everything.

545
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:17,531
The name, the girlfriend, the clinic.

546
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:19,158
No, I was there with you.

547
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:21,577
I faked it. I had to.

548
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:31,004
If you're not Max... then who are you?

549
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:38,594
Take this. He will help you.

550
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,680
- Oh...
- He can protect you.

551
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:44,475
Please. I know it's not fair.

552
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,019
- Please leave.
- Let me leave this with you.

553
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:47,520
I don't want to have
anything to do with it.

554
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:49,605
Please, just take it with you.

555
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:53,192
Please leave.

556
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:55,153
You're a good person, Lisa.

557
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:58,031
I'm just not.

558
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,283
And I'm sorry.

559
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:14,088
What can I offer you instead of her?

560
00:35:14,172 --> 00:35:16,090
Nothing.

561
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:20,553
What about a humanitarian relief fund,
for your allies in Africa?

562
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:22,972
You can distribute it
any way you see fit.

563
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:25,141
A few billion dollars?
I'm not that easily bought.

564
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:28,895
All right, let's say that we
re-examine our base in Izmir.

565
00:35:28,978 --> 00:35:30,396
Congress would never let you.

566
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:34,608
And realistically, you're willing
to barter major strategic airfields

567
00:35:34,692 --> 00:35:36,276
on account of your wife?

568
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,529
You can't make this about her.

569
00:35:38,612 --> 00:35:40,698
She was never equipped
to be an ambassador.

570
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:43,242
You know that.

571
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:45,161
I understand.

572
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:48,581
How could you say no to your own wife?

573
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:50,374
But she's blinding you.

574
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:53,460
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You are being petty.

575
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,257
The SEAL team you sent.

576
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,052
Look how easily we manipulated her.

577
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,514
Moryakov didn't have to work too hard.

578
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:09,643
Did we blow up our own men?

579
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:11,520
Maybe we did.

580
00:36:13,064 --> 00:36:15,482
Maybe we didn't.

581
00:36:15,566 --> 00:36:17,902
But we made her believe that we did.

582
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,486
And she convinced you.

583
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,907
Now, wouldn't you call that blindness?

584
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,624
You want to kill me now. I can see it.

585
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:39,006
I read an amusing article about, um...

586
00:36:40,758 --> 00:36:43,677
a Civil War re-enactor,

587
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:47,181
who said that your
great-great-grandfather

588
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:50,101
killed a Yankee soldier
with his bare hands.

589
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:57,316
When I was in Afghanistan,
we were ambushed by the Mujahideen.

590
00:36:57,399 --> 00:37:01,195
And the man who shot me here and here,

591
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:04,240
he stabbed me when his rifle jammed.

592
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,742
I pulled the knife away
and slit his throat.

593
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:09,120
Yes, I know, you've told that story
dozens of times to the press.

594
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:13,499
The part I don't tell is that after
I slit his throat, I kept going.

595
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:19,880
We strapped his head to a donkey so
it would carry it back to his village.

596
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:24,051
I've killed a man with my bare hands.

597
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,639
It wasn't make-believe.

598
00:37:31,142 --> 00:37:33,227
Do you think you're capable?

599
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,112
I think you are.

600
00:37:46,324 --> 00:37:47,825
You're ruthless.

601
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:51,745
Like me.

602
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:58,544
Sometimes we must be ruthless
with those who hate us.

603
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,674
And sometimes we must be ruthless
with those we love.

604
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:11,224
I don't see why Claire
means so much to you.

605
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:14,727
Because she means so much to you.

606
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:21,942
And if you do this,
I will know you're serious.

607
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:45,674
Your wife is on the line, sir.

608
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,093
Tell her I'll call her back.

609
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:48,386
I've told her that twice now.

610
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:50,512
- Tell her again.
- Yes, sir.

611
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:59,272
- You don't have to do that, Sarah.
- I don't mind. It doesn't take long.

612
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:01,107
No, no. Let us do it.
You go relax.

613
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,192
I'll move the monsters in a few minutes.

614
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:04,818
- Okay.
- All right.

615
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,822
See you in bed.

616
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:10,241
See you tomorrow.

617
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:27,674
I wish I could sleep like that.

618
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:32,471
You ever think of settling down?

619
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:35,224
Gettin' a couple of these for yourself?

620
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:36,850
Hasn't ever crossed my mind.

621
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,437
Never?

622
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,772
It's not for me. A life like that.

623
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,359
You mean a life like mine?

624
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,446
- That's not what I said.
- I know you've always felt that way.

625
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:54,160
A mortgage, nine to five,
wife, two kids, a dog.

626
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,577
No.

627
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,413
It's just my freedom's important to me.

628
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:00,333
I'm freer than you are, pal.

629
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:06,546
I stayed in Columbus because I liked it,
not because anybody made me.

630
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,215
I chose to put down roots.

631
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:09,883
You've always been running
from something.

632
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,969
Hey, I don't judge you.
Don't judge me.

633
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:13,553
Listen to your big brother
for a second.

634
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,264
No, last thing I need
is a lecture right now.

635
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:21,645
During your whole recovery, all you kept
talking about was getting back to work.

636
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:23,481
Over a month I've been here,

637
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:25,691
using all my vacation time
and then some.

638
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:28,361
If you don't want to be here,
then maybe you should go home.

639
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:30,904
It's not about that, Doug.

640
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:33,782
I'm here because you're family.

641
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:36,369
Because you're more important than work.

642
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:42,166
Hey... If I lost my job because of you,
I'd find another one.

643
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:44,126
What do you have?

644
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,296
Frank Underwood?
You don't even have that.

645
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,510
You got two pictures
on your fridge,

646
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,928
and they're of my kids.

647
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:56,514
That's not freedom.

648
00:41:18,952 --> 00:41:22,373
Petrov wants a diplomatic change.

649
00:41:22,456 --> 00:41:24,500
At the UN.

650
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:28,921
- Me.
- It was non-negotiable.

651
00:41:33,842 --> 00:41:35,635
Clearly, you didn't say no.

652
00:41:36,636 --> 00:41:39,098
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

653
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:44,853
I called more than once.

654
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,569
I wanted to convince myself
to refuse what he asked.

655
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:53,571
But... I couldn't do that.

656
00:41:53,653 --> 00:41:56,365
I told you it was
a mistake to go, Francis.

657
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,243
And the resolution was a mistake.
And Corrigan was a mistake.

658
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:02,580
We could tally up all our mistakes,
but we are where we are.

659
00:42:02,662 --> 00:42:06,166
I need to concentrate
on what's in front of me right now.

660
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,586
I am. I'm in front of you.

661
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,259
The Russians need to leave.
It's as simple as that.

662
00:42:15,342 --> 00:42:17,636
You want me to say this is okay.

663
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:19,012
No.

664
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:22,308
Francis, I would've preferred if you had
walked in and just told me I was fired.

665
00:42:22,391 --> 00:42:25,519
They played you, Claire.

666
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:28,730
Moryakov was not having
some crisis of conscience.

667
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:32,692
It was all so that we would
send our SEAL team in.

668
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:35,279
So that we would provoke the Israelis.

669
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:39,116
And I didn't see it,
because I trusted you too much.

670
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,660
I didn't look at it objectively...

671
00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:45,080
because you're my wife.

672
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,668
- Petrov told you that?
- Yes.

673
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:52,630
- And you believe him?
- I do.

674
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:59,345
I'll resign.

675
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:02,973
I wish it didn't have to come to this.

676
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:06,977
What do we say to the press?

677
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:14,568
That you want to focus on the campaign,
that that was your plan all along.

678
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:17,404
That I want to see
this crisis through, first.

679
00:43:17,488 --> 00:43:19,365
No one will question that.

680
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:23,661
Tell Petrov.

681
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:25,078
And I will...

682
00:43:26,913 --> 00:43:29,291
make the announcement
whenever you want me to.

683
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:31,585
Claire.

684
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:35,255
You were right.
I shouldn't have gone.

685
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:39,426
It was your decision to make.
Not mine.

686
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:42,888
Good night.

687
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:50,646
My decision.

688
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:58,362
Sometimes I think the presidency...

689
00:44:00,447 --> 00:44:02,949
is the illusion of choice.

690
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:29,268
What is it?

691
00:44:29,351 --> 00:44:31,144
I have to go to the White House.

692
00:44:31,228 --> 00:44:33,188
It's the middle of the night.

693
00:44:33,272 --> 00:44:34,898
He's the president.

694
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,169
Thank you, Meechum.

695
00:44:58,964 --> 00:45:00,132
Have a seat.

696
00:45:07,013 --> 00:45:08,432
I wake you up?

697
00:45:09,516 --> 00:45:10,892
It's fine.

698
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,687
I'm a light sleeper anyway.

699
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:16,898
If it wasn't you, it would've
been a siren or a dump truck.

700
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:22,404
I get woken up in the middle
of the night all the time.

701
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:25,031
Some crisis somewhere in the world.

702
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:32,289
Some... situation...
in the Situation Room.

703
00:45:32,372 --> 00:45:34,583
Well, that's better than a dump truck.

704
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:47,805
You reached out to Tim Corbet.

705
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:50,683
I did.

706
00:45:50,766 --> 00:45:53,059
I spoke to him a few days ago.

707
00:45:53,143 --> 00:45:56,062
He called to let me know.

708
00:45:56,146 --> 00:45:57,897
So you two are still close.

709
00:45:57,981 --> 00:45:59,733
Not anymore.

710
00:45:59,817 --> 00:46:01,985
At school we were.

711
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:05,405
I thought he might have some insight
to how you were back then.

712
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:07,324
Those are formative years.

713
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:09,785
More formative for you than for me.

714
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,788
I learned how to march and shoot a gun,
that's about it.

715
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,044
I would've been better off
in military school.

716
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:20,420
Yeah? Why's that?

717
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:25,967
You go from turning tricks
to being on the bestseller list

718
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:29,346
before you can legally drink,
it messes with you.

719
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:33,475
You told me your friend
was the one who, uh...

720
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,143
I lied.

721
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:40,482
Why? You ashamed?

722
00:46:48,574 --> 00:46:51,827
First time I did it,
I was scared out of my mind.

723
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,249
I knock on the door, it opens...

724
00:46:57,332 --> 00:46:59,376
guy's in a satin robe.

725
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:00,836
He's fat.

726
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:05,965
Stringy hair, combed over his bald spot.

727
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:09,553
Beads of sweat
rolling down his cheeks.

728
00:47:09,636 --> 00:47:11,722
I almost ran back to the elevator.

729
00:47:13,348 --> 00:47:14,892
But you didn't.

730
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,062
No.

731
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:20,272
I needed the money.

732
00:47:23,567 --> 00:47:25,778
Before I got undressed...

733
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:30,156
he tells me that his wife just died.

734
00:47:32,534 --> 00:47:34,119
Car accident.

735
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:39,666
Says they had plans
to visit Tokyo in the spring.

736
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,919
Tells me about his three kids.

737
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:45,255
The one that was born with a cleft palate.

738
00:47:45,338 --> 00:47:50,051
Describes his house in Westchester,
with a Juliet balcony in the living room.

739
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:53,263
Says how beautiful she was.

740
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:59,102
Tells me he doesn't want to die.

741
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:01,814
Never touched me once.

742
00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:11,490
Sometimes it was just sex.

743
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:13,700
But a lot of times, it wasn't.

744
00:48:17,078 --> 00:48:19,665
They would tell me everything.

745
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:21,500
These men.

746
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,336
That access.

747
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:25,712
Those stories.

748
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:29,883
It was an addiction.

749
00:48:29,967 --> 00:48:31,426
I craved it.

750
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,345
I lived for it.

751
00:48:33,428 --> 00:48:35,472
And then you wrote about it.

752
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:37,850
When I got famous...

753
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,228
I had to stop.

754
00:48:42,312 --> 00:48:44,439
I tried it once, I got recognized.

755
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:50,027
I wasn't invisible anymore.

756
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:51,864
I couldn't escape myself.

757
00:48:55,784 --> 00:48:58,203
I wish I could do that sometimes.

758
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,625
Escape myself.

759
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,794
Is it Claire?

760
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:09,046
You didn't ask me here
to talk about Tim Corbet.

761
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:14,260
What's in this for you?

762
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:17,472
I'm addicted.

763
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:19,016
To me?

764
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:28,734
I betrayed her.

765
00:49:28,817 --> 00:49:30,151
How?

766
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:37,701
I'm not asking as your biographer.

767
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:41,038
I'm asking as your friend.

768
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,011
Are we friends?

769
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:00,974
We could pretend to be.

770
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:09,399
This isn't pretend.

771
00:50:14,613 --> 00:50:16,239
I'm real.

772
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:19,701
You're hurting.

773
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:23,830
She's hurting more.

774
00:50:32,672 --> 00:50:34,257
Everyone's hurting.

775
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:58,448
Go home.

776
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:02,577
You should get some sleep.

777
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:04,245
And so should I.

778
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:20,012
Thirty years is a long time.

779
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:23,348
You've made it this far.

780
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:50,167
Okay!

781
00:51:52,752 --> 00:51:53,962
Double!

782
00:52:02,345 --> 00:52:03,805
Jesus.

783
00:52:34,419 --> 00:52:36,796
- Hey.
- Hey.

784
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,715
I didn't hear you come back.

785
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:40,257
I didn't want to wake you.

786
00:52:46,806 --> 00:52:48,265
Wow.

787
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,769
- What is it?
- Mid-East bureau.

788
00:52:50,852 --> 00:52:53,312
They say the Russians
are pulling out their troops.

789
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:57,150
Whatever he did out there
must have worked.

790
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:02,405
Mm... I wonder what it cost him.

791
00:53:09,495 --> 00:53:12,540
We ran the different looks
by a couple of focus groups.

792
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:14,751
These are the three favorites.

793
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:20,215
Not this one.

794
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,218
Uh, this one. What do you think?

795
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,719
I like it.

796
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:27,847
- The hair color as well?
- Do you mind going back to blonde?

797
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:29,975
I'd prefer it dark.

798
00:53:30,058 --> 00:53:34,146
The groups, in Iowa, in particular,
they like the blonde.

799
00:53:35,605 --> 00:53:37,523
Fine. We'll go blonde then.

800
00:53:37,607 --> 00:53:39,151
You're popular among women.

801
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:42,946
We want to push those numbers as high
as we can, and every little bit counts.

802
00:53:43,029 --> 00:53:45,115
You don't have to explain.
We'll do the color change

803
00:53:45,198 --> 00:53:47,033
after we announce the resignation.

804
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:48,118
Thanks, Abbie.

805
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:55,000
If you don't want to,
you don't have to do this.

806
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,209
It's fine.

807
00:53:56,293 --> 00:53:58,670
The nomination is not
gonna hinge on your hair.

808
00:53:58,753 --> 00:54:01,422
You heard what Abbie said.
Every little bit counts.

809
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:04,759
We'll do what we have to.
