1
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,766
With just one week to go
before the Iowa caucuses,

2
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:50,895
the latest Gallup poll has Dunbar
ahead by six points, 45 to 39,

3
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,732
with 16 percent still undecided.

4
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:57,193
That's a lot of undecideds
so close to election day.

5
00:01:57,277 --> 00:02:00,405
Dunbar has incredibly high
favorability numbers here,

6
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:04,326
much higher than President Underwood's,
but I have spoken with many Iowans

7
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,662
who have doubts
about her lack of experience

8
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:09,956
and whether she'll be able
to stand up to a Republican candidate

9
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,458
with a substantial record.

10
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,336
Even so, the fact that she's
still the frontrunner,

11
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:17,213
- having never run for office.
- It's extraordinary.

12
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:19,466
Jackie Sharp's endorsement was a big coup.

13
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,802
It really helped her numbers with women.

14
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:24,721
We want you to have a much more
active role during the events.

15
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,431
You'll go first, introduce the president,

16
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,933
stay with him the entire time,
and then participate in the Q and A.

17
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,687
I really shouldn't be answering questions.
Francis is the candidate.

18
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,564
Well, the truth is, your favorables
are double what mine are,

19
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:37,859
so let's give the people what they want.

20
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:40,320
- Well, if you think it will help.
- I know it will.

21
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,489
Do you have a speech prepared?
Do you have issue papers?

22
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,534
- Everything is in the conference room.
- Let's get started, then.

23
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,541
Have you had a chance
to go over the list...

24
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:53,916
of replacements for Remy?

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,170
Oh, I can't focus on that right now.
I need to get through Iowa first.

26
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:59,422
Well, I have a suggestion,
sir, that's not on the list.

27
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,842
- Who?
- Me.

28
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,262
Seth, you're invaluable
as a comm director.

29
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:09,516
Well, that's just it, sir.
You need a media expert at the helm.

30
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,767
We're in an election cycle.

31
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:12,477
- Everything's about perception.
- Seth--

32
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:14,437
I want to integrate the policy
and the press teams.

33
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,439
I want to work with cabinet members
and agency heads

34
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:19,484
on gearing every public statement
towards our platform.

35
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,695
Mobilize our AmWorks allies in Congress.

36
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:23,655
A commitment list
for futures legislations,

37
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,699
not just simple endorsements.

38
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:29,285
This outlines in detail what I would
like to do as your Chief of Staff.

39
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,622
All I ask is that you consider it.

40
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,791
Well, of course I will.
Thank you, Seth.

41
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,918
I appreciate you putting
so much time into this.

42
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,670
Thank you, sir.

43
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,885
Thank you.

44
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:47,136
Robert.

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,097
Sorry I'm running late.

46
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,973
We hit some weather
on the way back from Iowa.

47
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:52,768
I appreciate your coming here in person.

48
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:56,563
Especially during the... final rush.

49
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:58,648
- Anything for you, Robert.
- Have a seat.

50
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:00,066
Oh, thank you.

51
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:03,361
And, you know, it's good.
I get a few hours with the kids.

52
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:07,031
So how does it feel to be back here?

53
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:08,408
Oh...

54
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,828
I have to admit, I miss it a little.

55
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:15,415
Your dissent on Godfrey v. Kent
was brilliant, by the way.

56
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:21,003
My clerks. They wrote it.

57
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,923
Every word.

58
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,635
So it's time.

59
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:30,305
Ruth says it is,
but I knew before she said anything.

60
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:33,767
- When are you going to announce?
- Soon.

61
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,020
But I'd like you... to say yes first.

62
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:40,440
- To what?
- Replacing me.

63
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:46,404
This isn't the disease speaking.

64
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,949
I haven't forgotten
you're running for president.

65
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:54,830
But Underwood...
I'm sure he'd nominate you in a heartbeat.

66
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:57,874
I am the frontrunner, Robert.
Why would I drop out?

67
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,752
- Because this position's for life.
- Underwood is going to lose.

68
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:03,546
You think he'll go down easily?

69
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,550
And even if you get the nomination,
the Republicans...

70
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:10,804
They'll... rip you apart.

71
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,099
I'm the swing vote. My seat is important.

72
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:18,227
You can make a lasting difference here.

73
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,230
That is exactly what he said.

74
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:27,111
His motivations were atrocious, yes,
but his logic was sound.

75
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,574
Your mind seems sharp as ever, Robert.

76
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:32,909
Except...

77
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:39,457
Except for the fact that I can't
remember your name right now.

78
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,751
Heather.

79
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:45,213
Heather.

80
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:51,720
Will you continue
to do the work I've done, Heather?

81
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,596
I can't.

82
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,225
If I'm honest with myself,
it's that I want this too much.

83
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,310
I didn't realize it
before I started running.

84
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:03,481
It is not that I've changed, Robert,
that ambition has clouded anything.

85
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:07,610
It is that I was blind to this until now,
what I am meant to be.

86
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:10,864
And I am meant to be
President of the United States.

87
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:42,520
Wouldn't you all like
to hear from Claire first?

88
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:54,074
Thank you!

89
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,576
Francis and I so appreciate
you all coming out here

90
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,746
on such a cold day and
welcoming us with such warmth!

91
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,248
It's so good to be back in Iowa!

92
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,381
And I can feel it,
with your support and enthusiasm,

93
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:13,342
there is no doubt that we
are gonna take this state!

94
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,850
- Hello.
- Good evening.

95
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,060
Hi.

96
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:24,896
So pleased to have you
staying with us again, Mr. President.

97
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,940
We always love coming here.

98
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,067
It's our favorite house in all of Iowa.

99
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,653
- If you need anything...
- Thank you very much.

100
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,529
- Good night.
- Have a good evening.

101
00:07:44,373 --> 00:07:47,002
You were wonderful today.

102
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,087
They just adore you.

103
00:07:50,546 --> 00:07:52,132
Good night.

104
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,718
Good night.

105
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,666
Yes, connect me with Tom Yates, please.

106
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,045
No, I'll hold.

107
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:13,462
Mr. President?

108
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,590
Where's the rest of it?

109
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,341
- Have you read it?
- No, not yet.

110
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:18,927
Just this first chapter arrived.

111
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,846
Will you please read it first, sir?
And then let's talk.

112
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,806
Are you sick?
You sound hoarse.

113
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,683
Well, no, I'm not sick.

114
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:26,684
I haven't slept much.

115
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:28,728
All right, I'll call you tomorrow.

116
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:33,066
Sir?

117
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,901
Excuse me. Sir?

118
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,029
I forgot why I came in here.

119
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:39,530
The orange juice.

120
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,911
That'll be two twenty-five.

121
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:47,705
Yeah.

122
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:06,641
"The Fourth of July
means nothing anymore.

123
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:12,647
Overcooked hot dogs and fireworks
that always leave you disappointed.

124
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,233
Bite-size American flags made in China,

125
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:19,946
halfheartedly waved by five-year-olds
who'd rather be playing Minecraft.

126
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,243
But the third of September,
that's a date which matters.

127
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:28,246
It's the day, three decades past,

128
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,583
that a redneck from Gaffney
married a debutante from Dallas.

129
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:35,753
And the Earth's axis tilted that day,

130
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:39,632
though neither they, nor we,
knew it at the time.

131
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:47,140
Here's a woman who describes her vows as
a suicide flirting with a bridge's edge.

132
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:50,977
And a man who wears his wedding ring
as a badge of shame,

133
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,646
for the debutante deserved more.

134
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:58,234
But truly, what more could she desire?

135
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:02,488
Together, they rule
an empire without heirs.

136
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:05,992
Legacy is their only child."

137
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:14,583
Come in.

138
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,130
He sent you a copy, too?

139
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,802
I thought this was
supposed to be about you, not us.

140
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:26,762
The whole thing was a mistake.

141
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:28,597
We revealed too much, Francis.

142
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:30,390
I should've never put you
in that position.

143
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:31,851
I'll put an end to it.

144
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:36,189
- Do you think he was right?
- About what?

145
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,488
"A cold fusion of two universal elements,
identical in weight, equal in force.

146
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,617
United they stand.
A union like none other.

147
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,080
The unsplittable atom
of American politics."

148
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,999
Well, he was right about some things.

149
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:59,419
I should go speak to him
face to face, soften the blow.

150
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,968
She did an event
in Oelwein yesterday

151
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,512
and our people say you could
barely hear her with all the cheering.

152
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:09,764
How badly can she hurt us?

153
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,141
They only need a point or two
and he's in the margin of error.

154
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,475
So we need to attack her.

155
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,021
The UN stuff slid right off.
We need something new.

156
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:21,650
Let's talk to Jackie.

157
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,585
Thank you for coming.
How was your trip?

158
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:42,130
Good for me.
A little rough for my mom, though.

159
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:44,840
She's not used to seeing me
more than two days in a row.

160
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,508
She actually ran out of questions.

161
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:50,888
I'm jealous. Have a seat.
It's been nonstop here for me.

162
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,891
Full-time job here.

163
00:12:53,975 --> 00:12:57,061
Doing surrogate appearances
for Heather in California.

164
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:00,315
We could really use you, Remy.

165
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:03,609
Ah... A recruiting session?

166
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:04,986
You can't be surprised.

167
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,196
I was hoping you just
wanted to see my face.

168
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:13,161
We can't offer you
as much as you made at Glendon Hill,

169
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,997
but we can offer you a lot more
than you made at the White House.

170
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:18,707
I'm not interested.

171
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:23,629
That was fast. Even for you.

172
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:26,506
- Where'd you land?
- Nowhere.

173
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,427
I'm out, Jackie. No more politics.

174
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,262
You know you don't mean that.
It's who you are.

175
00:13:31,346 --> 00:13:33,222
That's what I thought, too,
for a long time.

176
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:35,808
I don't even know if I'll stay in DC.

177
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,230
What are you gonna do?

178
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,485
That's the best part.
I have no idea.

179
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,413
I'll save you the trouble
of trying to convince me.

180
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,750
Claire Underwood.

181
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:05,421
We need to hit her hard.

182
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:09,217
You want dirt. I don't have any.

183
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:11,677
You must.

184
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,350
If I did, I don't know
if I'd shovel it your way.

185
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:21,729
But I don't.
They never let me in the inner circle.

186
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:30,029
She pressed him, but nothing.

187
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:33,157
I find it hard to believe that we don't
have a single thing we can use.

188
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,034
Our oppo team has looked at every article,

189
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:37,453
every piece of footage
going back 25 years.

190
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:40,706
Researched acquaintances,
family, the works.

191
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:44,710
- If it's out there, we would've found it.
- Wait. There is one thing.

192
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,003
What?

193
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:03,896
Hello?

194
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:05,523
Doug. It's been a while.

195
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:08,109
- What do you want?
- The journal.

196
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,819
What would it take?

197
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:13,406
You said you would never
do that to another woman.

198
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:15,533
- How much?
- You're offering money?

199
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,201
If that's what you want.

200
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,622
Betrayal doesn't come cheap.

201
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,082
Name a figure.

202
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:31,591
What do you like to read?

203
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,637
Do you read?

204
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:40,182
Yes, I read.

205
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,607
Oh, thank you, Meechum.

206
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:54,947
- You hate it.
- I didn't say that.

207
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:58,618
You wouldn't fly back from Iowa
just to say, "Good job."

208
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,496
Well, look, you've only
turned in 21 pages,

209
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:04,499
and the book was
supposed to be finished by now.

210
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:07,418
It took me this long to figure out
what the book is really about.

211
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:10,463
And what it's about, is the two of you.

212
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,381
We have to start over.

213
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:15,009
Start over?

214
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:18,012
The book was supposed to be
about America Works.

215
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:20,722
Now, you said you wanted
to try a different approach.

216
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:23,684
I was skeptical, but then
I went along with it and now,

217
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,771
you've handed over to me
the beginning of a book...

218
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:28,897
about my marriage?

219
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:31,609
Well, do you want it fast,
or do you want it right?

220
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,861
I told you I've never written anything
in less than a year.

221
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:36,864
Yeah, and in a month's time, you're gonna
say you've come up with some new idea.

222
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:39,450
No, this is it.
You and Claire. The marriage.

223
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,828
That's the key
that unlocks everything else.

224
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,831
If I had wanted an exposé
about my personal life,

225
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:49,210
I would've hired a staff writer
from Us Weekly.

226
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:59,094
Well... hold on a minute.
This is not tabloid bullshit.

227
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,847
You said, in this room,
you wanted an original voice.

228
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,641
I am giving it to you.

229
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,476
You're not narrow-minded, Mr. President.

230
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,395
I know you can appreciate
what I'm trying to do.

231
00:17:07,478 --> 00:17:09,313
Right, but see,
that's the problem right there.

232
00:17:09,397 --> 00:17:11,315
This is about what you're trying to do.

233
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:14,652
What your needs and...
what did you call it?

234
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,362
- Your addiction.
- That's not true.

235
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:20,241
No, it is true. I hired you to do a job,
which was to get me votes.

236
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,451
Yesterday, not six months from now.

237
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:25,246
Now, look, it's no big deal.
It didn't work out.

238
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,997
But I promise you,
you will be paid in full.

239
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,123
Thank you, Tom.

240
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:30,751
This deserves to be finished,
and it deserves to be read.

241
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,170
Well, I just happen to disagree with you.

242
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:37,592
Are you afraid of what I wrote?

243
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:39,801
Afraid? No.

244
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,512
It's just no one's business.

245
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,058
Well, you can't bury it.

246
00:17:47,727 --> 00:17:49,562
I won't allow that.

247
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:06,828
You're in an intimate relationship
with Kate Baldwin, isn't that correct?

248
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:09,998
I've never said anything because
I presume that you can separate

249
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:12,710
your personal life
from our professional arrangement.

250
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,464
But before you start getting
any reckless ideas,

251
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:20,092
why don't you just remember one thing:
I own this material.

252
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:24,930
And if you attempt to share it with
anybody, and I mean one single word,

253
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:28,267
litigation will be
the least of your worries.

254
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,812
I mean, after all,
I don't think either of us

255
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:36,817
wants any controversy about
the authorship of your first book.

256
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,112
Do we?

257
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,957
Meechum, will you please
escort Mr. Yates out?

258
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,542
And good luck to you, Tom.

259
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,799
Too bad about the book.

260
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,884
- You don't really mean that.
- No, I don't.

261
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:13,437
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.

262
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,272
What was that?

263
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:18,108
Mr. Grayson is on the line, sir.
He says it's urgent.

264
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,203
He's on line one, sir.

265
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,544
Seth?

266
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:42,257
All right. I better stay in Washington.

267
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,092
Let Vaughn know.

268
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:48,556
Get me Claire.

269
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:50,641
You think the timing is strategic?

270
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,268
Well, he and Dunbar are close.

271
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:55,187
Do you have any idea
who you're going to nominate?

272
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,064
We'll go through our master list
in the morning,

273
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,774
but this'll take me
off the campaign trail.

274
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:01,318
I won't be in Iowa for a day or two.
You're okay to cover me?

275
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:04,530
Yes, of course.
I'll keep waving my pom-poms.

276
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:07,282
Well, you're a saint to do it without me,
but it's probably best.

277
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,493
They like you even better.

278
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,038
Did you speak with Tom?

279
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,542
I did. He didn't take it well,
but I made it very clear.

280
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,921
I read it again. The chapter.

281
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:23,006
Let it go. We're done with him.

282
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:25,885
Claire?

283
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:29,930
Sorry. Uh, the last event went quite long.

284
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,849
I'm fading.

285
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,768
Well, you get some sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

286
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:36,395
Okay. Good night, Francis.

287
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,355
Good night.

288
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,869
Oh. This is a nice surprise.

289
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,788
Now a bad time?

290
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,248
Not at all.
How did you get in the building?

291
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,459
- Nobody called me.
- The receptionist.

292
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:02,087
- Scorpio is her favorite book.
- Of course, it is.

293
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,756
What are you working on?

294
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,467
Covert operation in the Jordan Valley.

295
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,679
Your boy Underwood has refused to confirm
or deny, but take a look at that.

296
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:17,311
That's a letter
to the family of Justin Nix.

297
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,314
Navy SEAL who died the same day
as the covert operation.

298
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:22,274
Signed by the president.

299
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:24,151
Says it was a training exercise.

300
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,695
I just got off the phone
with a source in the DOD

301
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,490
and they said there were no
SEAL training exercises that day.

302
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:33,577
His death is the only military KIA
reported on October eighteenth.

303
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,623
Am I shattering your illusions
about the guy?

304
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,250
He fired me.

305
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,377
What? Why?

306
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:45,965
I didn't want to e-mail it to you.

307
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:49,259
- This is it?
- The first chapter.

308
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:55,098
Justice Jacobs served our nation
with duty and distinction.

309
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:56,934
And when the Court was strongly divided,

310
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,603
as it was many times
during his 23 years on the bench,

311
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:04,566
it was his swing vote that created legal
precedents that will last for centuries.

312
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,320
Now, it will not be an easy seat to fill,
but fill it I must.

313
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:10,865
Sir.

314
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:12,574
Dunbar's people just reached out to me.

315
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:15,285
She's back in Washington
and she wants to meet with you.

316
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,495
What for?

317
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:20,290
- She wants to talk about the nomination.
- She wants to propose someone.

318
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:22,960
Yes. Herself.

319
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:28,007
Find a time.
And find somewhere discreet.

320
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:30,091
I don't want anyone on staff seeing her.

321
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,239
Good morning. I'm Claire Underwood.

322
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:56,326
Uh, I just changed her diaper.
I haven't had a chance to wash my hands.

323
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,039
Oh.
What is her name? She's beautiful.

324
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:02,875
- Kayla.
- Kayla. And what's your name?

325
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,292
- Suzie.
- Hi, Suzie.

326
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:07,170
Well, I just wanted to thank you
so much for your support.

327
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,214
It means so much to my husband and me.

328
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:13,802
- I don't support him.
- I saw the signs out front.

329
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,765
Those are my husband's.
I support Heather Dunbar.

330
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:20,350
When we vetted the house,
the husband was here.

331
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:24,396
Um, would you ever consider
changing your mind?

332
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:26,899
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood,

333
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,902
I don't really want to be
on TV or in the papers.

334
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:31,278
Oh. My apologies about that.

335
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:32,988
Would you mind if I just came inside?

336
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:34,281
No cameras, just me?

337
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:37,743
I guess so.

338
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,870
We need to do a sweep
of the house first, ma'am.

339
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:41,538
No. And they stay out here.

340
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,141
Hello, Heather.

341
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:05,353
How's Robert?

342
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:07,188
He's sad.

343
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:10,233
But at least he's making his exit
with grace.

344
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:13,737
Those were some very nice things you said
about him during your press conference.

345
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:17,032
Well, what was it you said to me...

346
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:20,327
about, uh, making things palatable?

347
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,621
- The obscene.
- Ah, yes. The obscene.

348
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:28,167
Well, it is obscene,
a mind like his losing its sharpness.

349
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:31,421
I didn't expect the Oval,
but this is interesting.

350
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:36,301
This is where Petrov and I
smoked cigars during the summit.

351
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:38,929
That's where he put his out on the wall.

352
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:43,517
So, Seth tells me you want the nomination.

353
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,227
No. I just said that to get in the door.

354
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:49,148
Robert thought you'd say
yes in a heartbeat

355
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,733
if it meant me dropping out of the race.

356
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:55,112
But the decision you have to make
is whether you'll drop out or not.

357
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,572
And why would I do that?

358
00:24:57,656 --> 00:25:02,410
I know Claire lied about the abortion,
and I have the journal to prove it.

359
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:06,540
I'm giving you an opportunity
to bow out gracefully, just like Robert.

360
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,750
But you have to do it before the caucus.

361
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:11,086
I'll give you three days.

362
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:15,423
I have no idea what you're talking about.

363
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,259
The one you asked Doug to destroy.

364
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,930
I wouldn't be so certain that he did it.

365
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:24,892
So...

366
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:29,104
you're finally one of us.

367
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,939
One of who?

368
00:25:31,023 --> 00:25:35,610
The men. In their smoky back rooms.

369
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:41,408
And even if there was a journal...

370
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:44,494
you don't have it in you.

371
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:47,288
Make whatever assumption you want.

372
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:54,379
Well, Robert was right.
I would offer you the nomination.

373
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:56,924
You should take the advice of a smart man.

374
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:02,345
Three days, Mr. President.

375
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:03,931
Think about Claire.

376
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,558
Show me out, please.

377
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:12,147
She can go after me all she wants,
but she goes after Claire,

378
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,524
I'll slit her fucking throat
in broad daylight.

379
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,571
Like when he pardoned Walker,
and that other guy, the rich one.

380
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:21,364
- Raymond Tusk.
- Yeah, him.

381
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,867
I mean, those were bad people,
and he let them off the hook.

382
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,994
And then he says he's not running
and he does.

383
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:29,288
Well, it's a little more complicated
than the way you're putting it.

384
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:32,291
There's a lot of variables that go
into making decisions like that, and...

385
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:36,546
I can tell you I was right beside him
and he was agonizing.

386
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,297
I'm sorry. She's hungry.

387
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:41,176
I still breastfeed my girl.

388
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,266
- Go outside, please.
- Ma'am?

389
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,769
Just go outside.

390
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:56,024
- I can go out too, if you like.
- No, it's okay.

391
00:26:56,108 --> 00:26:57,901
As long as you don't mind
seeing some boob.

392
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:03,782
Does she have any brothers or sisters?

393
00:27:03,865 --> 00:27:05,700
No, this is the only one.

394
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:08,620
James and I have been trying for a while.

395
00:27:08,703 --> 00:27:09,830
Had some trouble getting pregnant.

396
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:12,749
- James is your husband?
- Yeah. He goes by Jim.

397
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,210
But I like James better.

398
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,713
Well, he must trust my husband.
He's supporting him.

399
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:21,258
James doesn't know
what that word means.

400
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,094
- Trust?
- Yeah. The whole town knows it.

401
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:26,763
He runs after anything in a skirt.

402
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,598
Which I don't mind so much, to be honest.

403
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:30,767
I mean, I've had a fling or two myself.

404
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,978
What I don't like is how he lies about it.

405
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:37,565
And then, when he asks me if I've been
with someone and I say yes, he flips out.

406
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:39,276
Like there's some kind of double standard.

407
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:42,279
I mean, he wants to dog Christy Mulligan
in the back of her brand new Escalade?

408
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,699
Fine. Why shouldn't I be able
to give Kyle Beckenbauer some head

409
00:27:45,782 --> 00:27:49,203
for building Kayla's crib?

410
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:50,578
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:53,915
This is what happens
when you don't sleep for three months.

412
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:56,417
You two fight?
You and your husband?

413
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,879
Every married couple fights.

414
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:01,589
I mean, really fight.
Like, the cops get called.

415
00:28:01,673 --> 00:28:04,134
Or they would, if he wasn't the president.

416
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:08,972
'Cause I mean, the sheriff is practically
a family member at this point.

417
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,183
Now we're fighting
about the damn election.

418
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,852
Like those stupid yard signs.

419
00:28:13,935 --> 00:28:16,355
Sometimes, I wish I could just
pull up stakes and leave him.

420
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:18,773
But I can't. Why not?

421
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:20,734
Because of this little one.

422
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:25,864
Last in vitro we did, I said to myself,
if this one doesn't work, I'm outta here.

423
00:28:25,947 --> 00:28:29,284
We had to double mortgage
the house to pay for it.

424
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:32,829
But it worked.
And... here I am.

425
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,752
If I was like you...
didn't have a kid...

426
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:43,215
Can I tell you a secret?

427
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:46,634
No mother will admit this,
but sometimes I fantasize,

428
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:48,970
like, like this pillow here...

429
00:28:49,054 --> 00:28:51,181
I mean, and when Kayla was in her crib.

430
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:54,351
Two minutes.
That's all it would take, and I could go.

431
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:56,895
And I wouldn't be stuck
to a man I want to leave,

432
00:28:56,978 --> 00:28:59,522
rubbing lotion on my nipples,
they're so raw.

433
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:01,608
I could start over.

434
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:09,283
Of course, I don't mean it.
I mean, I'd never to do that.

435
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:10,784
But... you have thoughts.

436
00:29:12,202 --> 00:29:14,579
You know what, Suzie, I think
I've taken up too much of your time.

437
00:29:16,206 --> 00:29:18,708
You know I'm not serious, right?

438
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,212
Of course.

439
00:29:22,296 --> 00:29:24,881
I'm sorry. I'm just...

440
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:28,093
I'm so tired.

441
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,387
You're a really good listener.

442
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,889
I wish you were running for president.

443
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:36,310
Hey, you can tell them I'm
for your husband if you want.

444
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:37,685
I probably won't even caucus.

445
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:40,981
Good luck to you, Suzie.

446
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:48,989
Mrs. Underwood, did she change her mind?

447
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:50,490
No, she stuck to her guns.

448
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:52,993
But you can't blame a woman
for having conviction.

449
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:57,872
- The president just called for you.
- I'll call him back from the car.

450
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:01,584
Listen to me. What I'm about
to say, I don't want you to panic.

451
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,087
What is it?

452
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:10,385
The journal.
Dunbar claims she has it.

453
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:14,097
- But how?
- I don't know.

454
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,765
It looks like it might have been Doug.

455
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,810
- He was supposed to--
- I know. It's hard for me to believe.

456
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:20,812
No, Francis. This can't happen.

457
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:23,731
Meechum is tracking him down now.

458
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,650
Sweetheart, listen to me.

459
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:27,194
No, the whole thing, it--
The whole thing--

460
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,988
All she did was make the threat.
That doesn't mean she actually has it.

461
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,240
Whatever you have to do.
Just fix it, Francis.

462
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:33,658
I will, I promise you that.

463
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:35,910
But in the meantime,
you have to come back here.

464
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:38,246
I need you to get to the plane.
You have to come back.

465
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,291
I don't want you there,
out on the road, if we get blindsided.

466
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:44,544
Claire? Claire.

467
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:50,175
I'll come home.

468
00:30:50,258 --> 00:30:53,303
You go straight to the plane.
We'll say you weren't feeling well.

469
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:55,930
Okay.

470
00:30:56,014 --> 00:31:00,519
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

471
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:02,937
the courage to change the things I can,

472
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:05,732
and the wisdom to know the difference.

473
00:31:05,815 --> 00:31:09,069
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

474
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,883
So?

475
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:34,969
You honestly believed he'd go for this?

476
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:37,847
Yeah.

477
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:40,767
The writing is good. And it's honest.

478
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:45,605
But what candidate in their right mind
would want something like this out there?

479
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:49,650
I need you to write about it.
That he's trying to suppress this.

480
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:52,153
- What you need is sleep.
- Do this for me, Kate.

481
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:54,239
- I can't. It's a conflict of interest.
- Come on.

482
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:56,950
The moment we slept together,
we crossed the line.

483
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:58,452
Fuck the line!

484
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,787
I'm not risking my reputation
because your book is dead.

485
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,706
Oh, no. Not dead.

486
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,333
I'm gonna finish it.

487
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,294
I'll change the names if I have to,
call it fiction.

488
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:09,546
He's the President of the United States.

489
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:12,257
- So what?
- He crushes people.

490
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,552
Let this go.
Just start something new.

491
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:18,930
"Start something new."

492
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,811
Jesus... Christ, you don't get it.

493
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,813
I do it all the time.

494
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:29,190
My editor passes on a story,
I move on to the next one.

495
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:32,319
I'm so fucking disappointed
in you right now.

496
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:33,612
Me?

497
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:36,448
I'm the one trying to save you
from your own delusions.

498
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:37,949
That's exactly what he said.

499
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:39,618
Maybe he's right.

500
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:49,919
I almost felt something for you.

501
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,568
Come in.

502
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:21,242
Let me take your coat.

503
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,917
Can I get you anything?
Something to drink?

504
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:32,504
No. No, I'm good.
Thanks.

505
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:44,140
I appreciate the home visit,
but I'm not gonna change my mind.

506
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:46,309
No, no. I didn't think you would.

507
00:33:48,645 --> 00:33:50,146
Something wrong?

508
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,901
I don't know what to do.

509
00:33:54,984 --> 00:33:57,237
I figured...

510
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,781
When I asked you to join the campaign,
I just assumed you would say yes.

511
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:03,076
That the two of us,
we would be working together.

512
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:04,536
And...

513
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:11,042
I... I...

514
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,086
I can't stop thinking about you.

515
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:16,673
You're married, Jackie.

516
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,844
For the wrong reasons.

517
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,556
I thought you loved each other.

518
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,433
Not like this.

519
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,895
I'm not the person I want to be.

520
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:34,566
You're who you need to be.
Look at what you've achieved.

521
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:36,443
But you did it.
You gave it all up.

522
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:38,778
In a heartbeat.

523
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,701
We're different people.

524
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:50,415
You should go.

525
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:54,711
Put this behind you.

526
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:16,608
I guess it was naive to think
that we could remain close.

527
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:24,741
So this is it?

528
00:35:26,367 --> 00:35:28,369
Yeah. It is.

529
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,418
Jackie?

530
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,215
Jackie...

531
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:28,513
She says she has it.

532
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:30,181
She doesn't.

533
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:33,768
How do I know there aren't other copies?

534
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:40,191
- Where do you keep your cigarettes?
- In the bowl up there.

535
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:35,914
Why didn't you destroy it
when I first asked you to?

536
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:37,998
I don't know.

537
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:41,836
Something stopped me.
Maybe I would need it one day.

538
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,131
For you. To prove my loyalty.

539
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:48,175
You told her.
I'd hardly call that loyalty.

540
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:52,096
I had to show her I was serious.
The journal was a way to do that.

541
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:54,474
I never came close
to putting it in her possession.

542
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:58,812
Anything else I should know?

543
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:01,606
I'm sober. It's been 87 days.

544
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:03,441
I meant in regards to Dunbar.

545
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:06,778
It is related. This is a tight race.

546
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:09,864
Make me your Chief of Staff.

547
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:13,868
You promised.

548
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:16,203
You promised there'd be a place
for me here when I was ready.

549
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:19,791
That was before you fell off the wagon
and walked in here with that journal.

550
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:21,167
I've made mistakes.

551
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,421
I've fallen down more than once, and
you've always been there to pick me up.

552
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:28,257
But you've been falling down
for the past year, too,

553
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,384
and you need someone
to pick you up this time.

554
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,180
It's not Remy. It's not Seth.

555
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:35,974
It's me, Frank.

556
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:44,482
And how can I know
I can ever trust you again?

557
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:48,820
Because I just lit
two million dollars on fire.

558
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:55,242
We expect higher than usual turnout,
anywhere from 180 to 220.

559
00:38:55,326 --> 00:38:58,621
The higher the turnout, the better.
We're stronger with women and students.

560
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,874
- We've got a GOTV--
- Excuse me, I have to take this.

561
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:04,585
- Doug?
- I have an update regarding the journal.

562
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:07,421
- What is it?
- A message from the president.

563
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:20,894
I have only one thing to say.

564
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,522
Go fuck yourself.

565
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:31,612
Christ, that felt good.

566
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:37,869
Start putting together a shortlist
of potential nominees for the court.

567
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:44,709
- You already...?
- I'm on it, sir.

568
00:39:58,389 --> 00:39:59,599
Claire.

569
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:04,979
Want me to have them make you something
from the downstairs kitchen?

570
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:08,441
No, I ate on the plane.
Just feeling a little warm.

571
00:40:08,524 --> 00:40:09,943
It'll pass.

572
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,740
What did Doug say?

573
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,369
It's destroyed.

574
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,872
I watched him burn the page myself.

575
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:25,499
- What about copies?
- He says there aren't any.

576
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,043
And you trust him?

577
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:30,713
He had ample opportunity
to do us real damage and he didn't.

578
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:33,758
- But he held onto it for so long--
- I believe him, Claire.

579
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:36,052
I believe him.

580
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:40,681
And I'm gonna make him my Chief of Staff.

581
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:44,060
Are you out of your mind?

582
00:40:44,143 --> 00:40:46,395
We need him, Claire.
We need him now more than ever.

583
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:49,482
He betrayed us, Francis!
He told Dunbar about me.

584
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:52,110
To gain her trust, not betray ours.

585
00:40:52,192 --> 00:40:55,738
Look, Doug is the only person
we've ever been able to trust,

586
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:59,075
and he played this very smart.
He never put us in any real danger.

587
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:01,410
The journal is gone.
She can't do anything.

588
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:03,454
Why didn't you ask me
before you brought him back?

589
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:06,707
- Bec-- We're discussing it now.
- After you hired him!

590
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,751
I know this must have been
harrowing for you,

591
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:10,419
- but listen, it is ov--
- No. I don't--

592
00:41:10,503 --> 00:41:13,297
I'm starting to question
all of it, Francis.

593
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:18,385
What any of it is worth.
What... what are we doing this for?

594
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:20,847
For this house.

595
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,932
For the presidency.

596
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:27,311
Now, look, if you need to take
a few days off, that's fine.

597
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,480
You do not have to come
with me to Iowa tomorrow.

598
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:35,069
No. Of course, I'll be there.

599
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,667
Welcome back, Doug.
Congratulations.

600
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,961
- Thank you.
- I just wanted to get a heads up

601
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:54,047
on when you'd like to make
the formal announcement.

602
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,255
Let's do it after the caucus.

603
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:57,717
I don't want to draw any attention
away from the campaign.

604
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,427
You probably shouldn't attend
the press briefing today.

605
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:02,221
No. I'll take off before then.

606
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:03,848
Here, you should see this.

607
00:42:05,558 --> 00:42:07,894
This just came out ten minutes ago.

608
00:42:10,813 --> 00:42:11,981
Have you shown the president?

609
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:15,234
I drafted up some talking points.
I figured you'd want to brief him.

610
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:16,402
I'll be in my office.

611
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:19,488
Seth.

612
00:42:20,948 --> 00:42:23,450
The president told me
you asked for the job.

613
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:27,872
Yeah, I didn't realize
that you were in contention.

614
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:29,916
I don't want you to resent me.

615
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,043
Hey, I'm a professional.

616
00:42:33,335 --> 00:42:36,380
Let me know if you want any changes made
to the talking points.

617
00:42:36,463 --> 00:42:38,591
I'm sure they're good.

618
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:40,093
You can share 'em with the president.

619
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:43,262
You don't want to look 'em over first?

620
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:46,473
No. I trust your judgment.

621
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:00,738
I can tell you
that the shortlist is coming along,

622
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:05,201
and it is my intention to nominate someone
within the next two or three weeks.

623
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:07,578
It's very important
that we do this quickly,

624
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:10,748
so that the Senate has time
for their hearings.

625
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:13,667
And we shouldn't leave that seat
empty too long anyway,

626
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:15,377
while the Court is still in session.

627
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:17,088
- Mr. President?
- Sara.

628
00:43:17,171 --> 00:43:20,174
Mr. President, would you comment
on Ms. Baldwin's article

629
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:21,926
about the Jordan Valley operation?

630
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:24,929
I think Ms. Baldwin's article is
really nothing more than speculation.

631
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:26,931
- But the evidence...
- I'm sorry?

632
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:29,225
But the evidence she presents
is convincing.

633
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:32,270
Evidence? A letter?

634
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:36,398
Unfortunately, I have to write letters
like that more often than I would like.

635
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:38,901
And I don't think it's proof
of anything more than

636
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:41,320
I reached out to the family of a young man

637
00:43:41,403 --> 00:43:46,033
who sacrificed his life for our country
and for which I am eternally grateful.

638
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:47,493
Mr. President?

639
00:43:47,576 --> 00:43:49,954
Well, Ms. Baldwin,
it is your article we're discussing.

640
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:53,124
I suppose I'd get hammered
if I didn't allow you to ask a question.

641
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:55,960
Thank you, Mr. President.
My question is very straightforward.

642
00:43:56,043 --> 00:43:57,837
You mentioned in the letter
that Lieutenant Nix

643
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,379
died in a training exercise.

644
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:01,299
You signed this letter with your own hand.

645
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:04,343
Can you tell us in all honesty
that this is how he died?

646
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:07,513
I can tell you that this is exactly
what the Pentagon reported to me.

647
00:44:07,596 --> 00:44:10,808
And beyond that, it's not the policy
of this administration

648
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:13,644
or the Department of Defense
to discuss any specifics

649
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,229
about any Special Forces deaths.

650
00:44:15,313 --> 00:44:16,314
May I ask one more, please?

651
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:18,482
I believe we're finished
with that subject now.

652
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:19,650
It's about Iowa.

653
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:22,069
Yes, all right. Go ahead.

654
00:44:22,153 --> 00:44:23,654
Your wife has been doing a lot of events.

655
00:44:23,737 --> 00:44:26,406
Did she resign her post
at the United Nations because you think

656
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,202
she's more valuable as a campaign
asset than an ambassador?

657
00:44:29,285 --> 00:44:32,371
Claire has been doing a lot of events,
that is true,

658
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:34,790
as she has in every campaign
that I have ever run.

659
00:44:34,874 --> 00:44:38,418
I'm hoping, I suppose my strategy is that
if the American people

660
00:44:38,502 --> 00:44:41,714
can see that I was smart enough to
marry an extraordinary woman like Claire,

661
00:44:41,797 --> 00:44:44,717
well, they might think I'm smart enough
to be President of the United States.

662
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,679
As for the ambassadorship, that was
entirely her decision, not mine.

663
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:51,724
She enjoys campaigning,
and I'm looking forward to getting back

664
00:44:51,807 --> 00:44:53,517
to Iowa with her a little later today.

665
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,561
Thank you all very much.

666
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:01,441
We know he's
somewhere near Caracas.

667
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:02,985
I need him back.

668
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:04,778
The Venezuelans
haven't been cooperating.

669
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,572
We have extradition.

670
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,448
Doesn't mean they'll enforce.

671
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,120
Then get me a precise location.

672
00:45:13,204 --> 00:45:15,539
- Why?
- It doesn't concern you.

673
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:17,750
It does concern me.
There are a lot of people at the agency

674
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,920
who are embarrassed that he crossed
the border without us knowing.

675
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,420
That's not my problem.

676
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:26,175
Was it you? Passport lock?

677
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:29,511
The only other agency
that could've lifted it is Homeland.

678
00:45:29,595 --> 00:45:33,182
- I know you have friends there.
- I have friends everywhere.

679
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:35,393
I'm not gonna help you
clean up your mess, Doug.

680
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:38,020
Not if you helped him escape.

681
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:40,438
This isn't a request.

682
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:42,900
I'm Chief of Staff to the president now.

683
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:45,778
- He hasn't announced anyone.
- He will.

684
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:50,866
And if you want my first official task
to be finding your replacement, so be it.

685
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,493
If not, you tell me where Gavin is.

686
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:04,130
I watched the press conference
this morning.

687
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:06,424
I think the Baldwin article
will blow over.

688
00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:08,801
A non-story. No legs.

689
00:46:08,884 --> 00:46:11,804
You said it was my decision to resign.

690
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:13,180
Well, it was, wasn't it?

691
00:46:13,264 --> 00:46:15,891
I mean, at least that's how
we presented it.

692
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:22,689
I spoke with a woman yesterday
in Iowa, who...

693
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:26,902
said she couldn't support us...

694
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:28,988
because she doesn't trust you.

695
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,782
Well, I'm not the first politician
that some people don't trust.

696
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:34,534
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.

697
00:46:34,618 --> 00:46:36,620
Of course we have.
Imagine what the voters would think

698
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:38,664
if we started telling the truth.

699
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:40,624
Not to them.

700
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:43,794
To each other.
