Owner's coming in next week.
Anybody off the books, he'll be on my ass.

If I switch some doubles with Benito,
is that okay?

00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,971
Welcome to Caracas.
The time is 3:21--

8
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,473
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.

9
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:08,599
Of course we have.

10
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:12,020
Imagine what the voters would think
if we started telling the truth.

11
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:14,314
Not to them.

12
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:16,107
To each other.

13
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:18,943
What do you mean?

14
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,571
You know what? Never mind.

15
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,490
No. How have we been lying to each other?

16
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:26,034
- We're not.
- You just said that.

17
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,831
We've begun
our final descent into Des Moines.

18
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:34,542
Please find a seat
and put your seat belts on.

19
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:45,094
Should we talk?

20
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:46,846
No. I shouldn't have said anything.

21
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,212
Where is she?

22
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,432
Tell me where she is.

23
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,017
I don't know, man.

24
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,644
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

25
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,983
Ah! Oh! God!

26
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:26,612
I'm not asking again.

27
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,456
- My computer.
- I tried that.

28
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,000
- It's locked.
- I'll give you the code.

29
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,116
- You don't have anything more?
- That's all I have.

30
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,702
- How current is this?
- She's there, I promise.

31
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,684
I found you once.
I can find you again.

32
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,937
If this information is wrong, you die.

33
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,733
You try to contact her, you die.

34
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:28,317
Frank Underwood
is a dangerous man.

35
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,905
Because power in the hands of those
who lack honesty,

36
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:35,657
lacks a moral compass.

37
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:40,371
And without a moral compass,
power runs amok.

38
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,706
Heather Dunbar can question
my husband's choices.

39
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,167
She can criticize his policies.

40
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:49,171
But to cast aspersions on his character
is proof of desperation.

41
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,925
If he will lie about the death
of a US soldier,

42
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:56,596
what else is he lying about?

43
00:08:56,678 --> 00:09:01,016
We know he already lied
about not running in 2016.

44
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,895
The people of Iowa know better.
They see the same man I see:

45
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:08,857
a strong, decisive leader
who doesn't always do what's popular,

46
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,568
but he always does what's right.

47
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:15,490
The decision you make next Tuesday
is one you'll live with for years.

48
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:18,826
For three decades,
I've stood by my husband's side.

49
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:22,079
Because I know he stands up
for people like you.

50
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:25,207
You have the power to choose.

51
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,917
Choose progress over pettiness.

52
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,379
You have the power, not him.

53
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:33,215
Choose a president over a charlatan.

54
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,261
Ladies and gentlemen, my husband,
President Frank Underwood.

55
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:50,274
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

56
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,776
I'm gonna give you one good reason

57
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,822
why Heather Dunbar
doesn't stand a chance on Tuesday.

58
00:09:56,905 --> 00:10:00,117
She doesn't have Claire Underwood
standing by her side.

59
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:06,582
I want to spend a few minutes
talking about the future

60
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,418
that we are going to build together.

61
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:12,505
And I say together,
because I can't do it alone.

62
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,964
I need your help.

63
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:29,647
Meet me out back.

64
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:45,829
- You have it?
- Yeah. How about you?

65
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:47,789
Cassie Lockhart.

66
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:50,042
Social Security card,
driver's license, birth certificate.

67
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,502
It's all legit.

68
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:03,347
Why "Cassie"?
It's not even a real first name.

69
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:05,807
I mean, if it were short
for something, like Cassandra.

70
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:08,477
- But as your legal name?
- It's all there.

71
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:19,739
Hey, Cassie,
take a hundred back if you want it.

72
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,823
My truck's right there.

73
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,326
You keep it.

74
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,162
Come on. I gave you a big discount.
Show some gratitude.

75
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:29,540
Go home to your wife... and kids.

76
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:59,737
I want you to fuck me, Francis.

77
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,703
- I'm working.
- Shut up.

78
00:12:14,794 --> 00:12:15,961
What is going on?

79
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,593
I want you to be rough with me.

80
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:26,681
- Take me.
- Claire.

81
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,934
- Now, listen.
- Do it. Now!

82
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,520
Is this what you want?

83
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:33,604
- You want this?
- Yes.

84
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,564
- Yes.
- You want it rough?

85
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,362
I want you to look at me.

86
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:42,988
Look at me while you do it.

87
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,209
That's what I thought.

88
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:24,697
Yes, I'd like to arrange a room
for the First Lady, please.

89
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:27,533
Yes, right away.

90
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,176
I think you should go back
to Washington in the morning.

91
00:13:58,146 --> 00:14:01,066
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I did a double at the store last night.

92
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,778
- No worries.
- I'll work quick.

93
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:19,877
About 200,000 miles.

94
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,880
It's not much to look at, but...
it runs well.

95
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:30,971
- How much?
- Twelve hundred.

96
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:36,435
But I don't got a title, so technically,
you're just buying it for parts.

97
00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:38,270
Have gas in the tank?

98
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:41,398
Yeah, you can drive her right out.

99
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:44,485
- You'll need plates, though.
- I got plates.

100
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,155
- Cash okay?
- It's all we take.

101
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,118
Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!

102
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,496
Underwood! Underwood!

103
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:52,135
Yes, I'm good.

104
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,221
Ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:58,433
the President of the United States,
Frank Underwood!

106
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,987
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

107
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,365
It's good to be back in Iowa City!

108
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:16,911
Claire couldn't be here today,
but she wants you to know

109
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:19,830
she's a big Hawkeyes fan.

110
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:29,256
Now here, at one of the country's
finest public universities,

111
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,761
I wanna talk to you about
Heather Dunbar's preference for--

112
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:38,075
- Hey, can you do another double tomorrow?
- Yeah, no problem.

113
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,410
- All right, have a good night.
- You, too.

114
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:15,236
Hi, I'm Cassie Lockhart.

115
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:20,075
Hello. Cassie. Hey.

116
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,663
Cassie. C-A-double-S-I-E.

117
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:28,167
Lockhart.
L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.

118
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:31,586
April 21st-- Just a second!

119
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,938
Hey. I've got rent money for you--

120
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:51,815
No, no, no, no.
I have good news.

121
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,817
Bianca got her protected status.

122
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,573
Oh, my God! That's so great!

123
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,995
She says thank you
for all your help with her paperwork.

124
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,747
- Of course.
- We're celebrating.

125
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,582
Maria got a bottle
from her Thursday house.

126
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,125
They gave it to me for the holidays.

127
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:11,210
This is nice.

128
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,923
I know, it's really terrible.

129
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:25,348
She has family in Houston.

130
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,475
They're gonna help her get
into community college.

131
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:29,352
I'm so happy for her.

132
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,856
What about you, eh?
You're not staying here forever.

133
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,904
Once I save up enough,
I want to get my own car.

134
00:19:38,987 --> 00:19:40,697
And have enough for my own place.

135
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,657
Here in Santa?

136
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:46,327
Up north, I think.
In the woods somewhere.

137
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,955
I miss the trees and the rain.

138
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,207
Someplace quiet.

139
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:53,835
Something new.

140
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,588
Yeah.

141
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:58,632
Well, you're a smart girl, Lisa.

142
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,842
I'm sure you're gonna
get everything you want.

143
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,011
If Bianca can do it, you can.

144
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:09,309
To Bianca! And her new life.

145
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:11,519
- Salud!
- Salud!

146
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,378
Sir?

147
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:39,298
Do you think she can join us tomorrow?

148
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,634
- The press are starting to ask.
- If we win, it'll be strange

149
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:45,012
if she isn't standing next to you
for your victory speech.

150
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,931
Even stranger if you have
to make a concession speech.

151
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,060
If I have to make a concession speech,

152
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:55,563
the absence of the First Lady
will be the least of our problems.

153
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm going for a run.
Can you arrange the detail, please?

154
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:09,369
- Ma'am, if you run in public, it might...
- Might what?

155
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:11,913
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'll take care of it right away.

156
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:14,875
No, if it's a problem
with me running, tell me.

157
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,628
It might highlight the fact
that you're not in Iowa.

158
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,234
Right there, please.

159
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:40,437
Quiet. Hey, hey!

160
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,405
Help! No!

161
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,080
You want me to put you out again?

162
00:23:59,164 --> 00:24:01,540
Huh?

163
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:04,378
Open your mouth. Open it.

164
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:05,879
I won't make any noise.

165
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:17,182
You make one sound, or you move an inch...

166
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:23,188
- What?
- I won't.

167
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:25,148
I won't scream or anything.

168
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:43,166
Nataly puts the ball on the 44 ya--

169
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,210
Jesus is knocking on--

170
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:49,130
Less than 24 hours to go
before the Iowa caucuses,

171
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:53,343
the Republicans have a broad field
with no clear front-runner.

172
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:57,264
For the Democrats, President Underwood
has gained momentum in the polls.

173
00:24:57,347 --> 00:25:00,434
A rise that many political experts
are attributing

174
00:25:00,517 --> 00:25:03,437
to the recent appearance
of Claire Underwood in the--

175
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,231
Every major poll has it as a dead heat,

176
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:08,649
with both candidates hovering
at 45 percent.

177
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,903
That still leaves one in ten
likely caucus-goers

178
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:14,613
who won't be making their decision
until tomorrow evening.

179
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:17,033
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is on the phone for you.

180
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:20,454
President Underwood spent the last full
day of campaigning traversing the state,

181
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:23,081
completing his tour
of all 99 Iowa counties.

182
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:24,874
- Hello?
- Listen.

183
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:29,628
No matter what happens tomorrow night,
I want you by my side.

184
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,798
Are you open to that?

185
00:25:34,342 --> 00:25:35,552
Claire?

186
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:37,845
I'll fly out in the morning.

187
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,764
No, no. You can come in the afternoon.

188
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:42,683
You don't have to do any
events or press, just...

189
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,437
be there with me when I make my speech.

190
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:49,023
- I said yes.
- Thank you.

191
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,400
Of course.

192
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,445
Last night...

193
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,740
Let's not. I'll see you tomorrow.

194
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,744
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.

195
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:21,806
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

196
00:26:24,392 --> 00:26:26,227
I wish I could take it back.

197
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,686
I told you to be quiet.

198
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:34,986
I thought I killed you.

199
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:40,534
When I heard on the news you were alive,
I felt so relieved.

200
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,952
- I doubt that.
- I mean it.

201
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:50,460
I would pray for you.

202
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:53,046
Probably sounds strange, but it's true.

203
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:56,633
I would, because I felt so bad.
You didn't deserve what I did.

204
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,219
None of this is going to change anything.

205
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:08,019
Where are we going?

206
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:10,271
Doesn't matter.

207
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,775
Is it gonna be a while?
'Cause I have to pee.

208
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,114
You can pee back there.

209
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,202
You don't want that. The smell.

210
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:26,287
It's either that or you hold it.

211
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:28,707
- It hurts.
- Too bad.

212
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,168
All right then, I'm gonna do it.

213
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,328
Mrs. Underwood.

214
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,206
Please, come sit.

215
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:22,719
Thank you for coming.

216
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,973
I'm sorry for how everything
has worked out. It's unfortunate.

217
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:30,351
I'm sure it's been difficult for you,
with all of the effort you put in.

218
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:32,479
Is this how it works?

219
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:34,813
He nixes the book, you soften the blow?

220
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:36,232
No, Tom, it's not that.

221
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:38,276
Francis doesn't even know
I asked you here.

222
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,320
Why did you ask me?

223
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:46,993
Because I was wondering if...
we could talk honestly to each other.

224
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:48,286
If you'd be open to that.

225
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:51,748
- About what?
- New Hampshire.

226
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,626
Did you let me pass out that day
on purpose?

227
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:56,043
When I was giving blood.

228
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,005
I let you keep talking.
I didn't know you'd pass out.

229
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,340
And you didn't see it coming?

230
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:02,759
You had things you wanted to say.

231
00:29:05,303 --> 00:29:09,683
And what did I say...
before I blacked out?

232
00:29:09,766 --> 00:29:12,644
Was there anything else
other than what you wrote?

233
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:14,813
You don't remember?

234
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,149
Some. But not all of it.

235
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:24,447
I'm asking for me.
Because I need to know.

236
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:29,076
Hatred.

237
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,789
For how much you and Frank
needed each other.

238
00:29:33,998 --> 00:29:35,916
I used that word? Hate?

239
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:38,586
You did.

240
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:43,424
And of all the moments...

241
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:46,177
that you spent
with Francis and myself, you...

242
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,430
You believe that we're equals?

243
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:53,142
I got fired, Mrs. Underwood.
I'm not on the clock anymore.

244
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:57,104
There's a lot more to Francis and me
than what you wrote.

245
00:29:57,188 --> 00:30:01,025
Maybe so,
but I never got a chance to ask.

246
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,319
Then ask. Whatever you want.

247
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,450
Why aren't you with him? In Iowa?

248
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,583
- I'm heading there tomorrow.
- Hm...

249
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,709
You see?

250
00:30:17,792 --> 00:30:21,546
I ask a question,
and neither of you answer them.

251
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:28,344
It's tiresome, constantly swinging
a sledgehammer at the façade,

252
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:30,889
just to get a glimpse through the cracks.

253
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:35,894
Tell me what you see.

254
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:40,648
Somebody who's lost.

255
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:45,278
But I don't know.

256
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:47,488
Maybe it's all for the best.

257
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:52,786
I'd rather imagine who you might be
than who you actually are.

258
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,338

That's enough.

- It calms me.
- Then sing it in your head.

270
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:35,179
You're gonna be able
to live with yourself?

271
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:39,308
What's the point?

272
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:41,811
I can't hurt you.

273
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:43,855
No one's ever gonna find me
or know who I am.

274
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:45,272
I'm never gonna say anything.

275
00:32:45,356 --> 00:32:46,733
Quiet.

276
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,445
If it's about punishing me,
you don't have to.

277
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:56,826
This last year, some of the things I've
had to do, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

278
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,870
I said quiet.

279
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:06,520
What did the overnight internals say?

280
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:08,856
Still a toss-up.
Less than half a point gap.

281
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,608
- Her or me?
- Doesn't matter.

282
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,027
The margin of error is four-point-five.

283
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:15,947
The last few days, the lead's
gone back and forth three times.

284
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,490
Bottom line is turnout.

285
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:19,617
- Sir?
- Yes, I'm almost ready.

286
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,243
May I speak to you
for a moment privately?

287
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:24,204
- Yes. Thank you.
- I'll be right outside.

288
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:28,084
I just got word that Mrs. Underwood
has postponed her flight here.

289
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,210
- What? Why?
- I don't know, sir.

290
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:33,339
Also, Agent Swift,
the head of her detail...

291
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:36,258
he said Tom Yates
came to the residence last night.

292
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,679
Tell Vaughn I'll be down in a few minutes.

293
00:34:39,762 --> 00:34:41,472
Yes, sir.

294
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:43,933
This is Claire.
Please leave a message.

295
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,483
This is Claire.
Please leave a message.

296
00:34:52,566 --> 00:34:55,653
It's me. When you get this message,
will you please call me?

297
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:47,663
Listen, if you breathe deeply,

298
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:49,289
you're gonna pass out right away.

299
00:35:49,373 --> 00:35:50,833
- Please.
- Then nothing's gonna hurt.

300
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,960
Doug, please. Please.

301
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:55,337
Help!

302
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:57,840
No one can hear you.
Lie down, Rachel.

303
00:35:57,924 --> 00:36:00,634
Look, Rachel's gone!

304
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:08,809
That is who I am now.

305
00:36:10,394 --> 00:36:13,189
Look, I know you
don't want to do this.

306
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,191
You-- You could--

307
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,526
You could've done it
in the parking lot last night,

308
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,946
but you didn't, you kept me alive!

309
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,533
I know this isn't who you are.

310
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,203
Please.

311
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,747
Please. Please. Please, just let me go.

312
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,665
Please.

313
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,334
Doug.

314
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:36,837
Doug, please. Please.
Please just let me go.

315
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:38,881
- Please! Doug! Please!
- Fuck!

316
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:11,956
The president is
on the line for you again.

317
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:14,000
You told him I'm not feeling well?

318
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:17,962
Yes, ma'am.
He'd still like to speak with you.

319
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:19,672
Tell him I'm sleeping.

320
00:37:23,926 --> 00:37:25,719
I'm sleeping. Please tell him.

321
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:27,305
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,061
Here.

323
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:42,213
I don't know why
you had to run that night.

324
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:46,717
All I ever tried to do was keep you safe.

325
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,720
I was afraid.
I wasn't thinking.

326
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,682
I'm sorry.

327
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,851
I know you have a good heart.

328
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,106
You're saying that
because you want me to let you go.

329
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:02,400
Look at me.

330
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,527
Look at me, Doug.

331
00:39:08,488 --> 00:39:11,117
You don't have to kill Rachel.

332
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,368
She's already dead.

333
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:15,704
She died in those woods,
and it's better that way.

334
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,374
She didn't have a very good life.

335
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:22,878
But... But if you do this, you're not
killing Rachel, you're killing Cassie.

336
00:39:22,962 --> 00:39:24,838
And...

337
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:29,009
all Cassie Lockhart wants to be
is someplace far away.

338
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,307
Someplace where nobody'll ever find her.

339
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:41,105
She likes to go to the movie theater.

340
00:39:41,188 --> 00:39:45,567
It doesn't matter what's showing, just...
she likes the smell of the popcorn.

341
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,194
She wants a dog.

342
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:50,364
A black lab.

343
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,493
And a queen-size bed.

344
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:59,332
Lots of blankets to curl up in.
She doesn't want much.

345
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:03,794
She just wants to be invisible.

346
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,551
Hey.

347
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,722
Hey, look at me.

348
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:21,937
My name is Cassie Lockhart.

349
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:23,957
Give me your ankles.

350
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,715
Give me your hands.

351
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:46,855
Come on.

352
00:41:48,357 --> 00:41:49,775
Let's go.

353
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:56,949
Some water.

354
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,418
There's a town 20 miles that way.

355
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,016
First off, I'd like to congratulate
President Underwood

356
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,185
for his victory here tonight.

357
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:33,813
It was a tight race
and he came out on top.

358
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:36,775
- Boo!
- No. No, no, no, no!

359
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:39,278
Let's not be sore losers here.

360
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:42,740
Because the truth is, we haven't lost.

361
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:46,326
We are just getting started!

362
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:55,793
I want to thank all the staff
and volunteers

363
00:44:55,877 --> 00:44:59,298
who worked so hard
over the past several months.

364
00:44:59,381 --> 00:45:00,549
We should get going.

365
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:03,302
I want to try Claire one more time.
See if she'll come out.

366
00:45:03,385 --> 00:45:06,597
That's three hours from now,
even if she left this minute.

367
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,390
But the crowd will wait.

368
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:10,058
We don't want to squander primetime.

369
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:14,104
A speech at one in the morning,
we lose major viewership.

370
00:45:14,187 --> 00:45:17,483
My children and my dear husband...

371
00:45:17,566 --> 00:45:19,777
Fine. Let's go.

372
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,112
How do you want to handle the stage
if she's not on it?

373
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:24,072
I won't need a stage.

374
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:44,092
Thank you for coming out.

375
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,927
Thank you very much. Thank you.

376
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:51,391
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:05,197
Well, Iowa has spoken.

378
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,496
And they have spoken so loud,
that I don't even need a microphone.

379
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:18,794
Listen, I wanted to come down here to our
campaign headquarters in Des Moines,

380
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:23,841
not go to some fancy hotel ballroom
like you know who,

381
00:46:23,923 --> 00:46:27,678
and say to all of you
who worked day in and day out,

382
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:31,849
on our behalf for this campaign,
in every corner of this state...

383
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:35,018
It's because of you
that we brought it home tonight!

384
00:46:40,023 --> 00:46:43,193
Now, I know you're all wondering
where Claire is.

385
00:46:43,276 --> 00:46:45,821
Some of you may know
she's been a little under the weather.

386
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:46,988
She's from Texas.

387
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:49,991
She doesn't understand
these Iowa winters you have.

388
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:54,120
But she's on the mend and
I'm flying to Washington tonight,

389
00:46:54,204 --> 00:46:56,665
so that tomorrow she and I
can get on a plane

390
00:46:56,749 --> 00:47:00,711
and fly to New Hampshire,
where we are gonna win there, too!

391
00:47:18,395 --> 00:47:19,396
Claire.

392
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,780
They told me you were down here.

393
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:32,618
I just wanted to come somewhere to think.

394
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:36,246
Well, I hope you have.

395
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:41,334
And that whatever
was clouding your mind is gone.

396
00:47:42,878 --> 00:47:46,840
Because I just had to give
a victory speech... alone.

397
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:54,180
And one way or another,
I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.

398
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:01,814
No. The desk.

399
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:03,690
Left-hand drawer.

400
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:15,285
You still have this.

401
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:18,747
Yes.

402
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:21,750
It felt wrong to throw it out,
for some reason.

403
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:36,306
When I said we were lying,
what I meant was...

404
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:44,063
For all these years,
I thought we were on this path together.

405
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:46,775
But it's not what I thought it would be.

406
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:51,822
What I convinced myself it would be,
like what Thomas wrote.

407
00:48:51,905 --> 00:48:55,826
- We're two equal parts.
- We are.

408
00:48:55,909 --> 00:48:57,703
You really believe that?

409
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:00,914
We earned this together.

410
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:05,460
I said that to your face the first day
I walked in here as president.

411
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:08,213
It's your office. Not mine.

412
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:13,802
I have not made a single major decision
without asking your opinion first.

413
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:18,640
But see, that's it.
You make the decisions.

414
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:21,226
Anything that I want, like the UN...

415
00:49:22,644 --> 00:49:25,271
It made me ill, Francis.
My stomach turned.

416
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:26,648
Why, because you had to resign?

417
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:29,275
No, because I had to ask
for your help in the first place.

418
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,320
That I couldn't get the confirmation
on my own.

419
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:35,198
And what is wrong with asking
for my help when you need it?

420
00:49:35,281 --> 00:49:37,283
The fact that I need it.

421
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:40,746
I hate that feeling. It's not me.

422
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:42,789
I don't recognize myself
when I look in the mirror.

423
00:49:42,873 --> 00:49:46,459
I do things...
like I did in the hotel in Iowa.

424
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:49,922
I can't even talk with you about it.

425
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:52,382
Instead you want me
to slap you around like some animal.

426
00:49:52,465 --> 00:49:54,885
That's what we are
when we strip everything away.

427
00:49:54,968 --> 00:49:57,554
- That I can understand!
- It was deranged,

428
00:49:57,637 --> 00:49:59,389
begging me to take you like that.

429
00:49:59,472 --> 00:50:02,267
And you couldn't even give that to me.

430
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:06,939
If you wanted a husband who proved
his manhood to you that way,

431
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:09,942
you should've stayed back
in Dallas with your mother

432
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:11,651
and married the prom king.

433
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,278
At least I would've known
where I stood.

434
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:15,906
No, you can't have it both ways.

435
00:50:15,989 --> 00:50:18,533
You want an equal partner
when it suits you?

436
00:50:18,617 --> 00:50:21,369
You want a man to take charge
when it suits you?

437
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:25,248
And I'm supposed to what,
just divine when you want which?

438
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:27,876
Stop being so selfish.
You're better than that.

439
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,920
- I'm not being selfish.
- You are.

440
00:50:30,003 --> 00:50:32,672
We're in the middle of an election,
and look at us.

441
00:50:32,756 --> 00:50:35,258
That's exactly it.
Look at us, Francis.

442
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:36,885
We used to make each other stronger.

443
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:39,012
At least I thought so, but that was a lie.

444
00:50:39,096 --> 00:50:41,765
We were making you stronger.

445
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:46,937
And now I'm just weak and small,
and I can't stand that feeling any longer.

446
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,982
All right. What do you want?

447
00:50:50,065 --> 00:50:52,567
What is the goddamn alternative?

448
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:55,779
Please, Claire, tell me,
because I don't understand.

449
00:50:55,862 --> 00:50:59,866
All I am hearing is, it's not enough.

450
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,201
That the White House is not enough.

451
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:05,162
That being First Lady is not enough.

452
00:51:05,246 --> 00:51:07,415
- Not enough!
- No.

453
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:08,792
It's you that's not enough.

454
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,705
When we lose... because of you...

455
00:51:47,873 --> 00:51:50,917
there will be nothing.

456
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:54,171
No plan. No future.

457
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:58,925
We will only be has-beens.

458
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,222
And you want to amount to something?

459
00:52:05,306 --> 00:52:09,310
Well, here is the brutal fucking truth.

460
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:14,900
And you can hate me, you can be disgusted,
you can feel whatever it is you wanna feel

461
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:17,861
because frankly, I'm beyond caring.

462
00:52:17,944 --> 00:52:22,407
But without me,
you are nothing.

463
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:27,244
You're right. This office has one chair.

464
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:32,792
And you have always known that
from the very beginning.

465
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:37,047
And if you now can't stomach that,

466
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:41,509
well, then I'm a fool for having
married you in the first place.

467
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:44,637
But I don't have time to be a fool.

468
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:48,558
I have to run this country
and win a nomination.

469
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:51,144
I'm doing my job.

470
00:52:51,228 --> 00:52:54,814
Doug is out there doing his job.

471
00:52:54,898 --> 00:53:00,695
And it's time now for you to do yours.

472
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:05,909
You want me to take charge?
Fine. I will take charge.

473
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:10,622
You will get on that plane tomorrow.
You will come to New Hampshire.

474
00:53:10,705 --> 00:53:14,793
You will smile and shake hands
and kiss babies.

475
00:53:14,876 --> 00:53:17,796
And you will stand with me on a stage.

476
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:22,134
And you will be the First Lady!

477
00:53:22,217 --> 00:53:24,510
And you do all that.

478
00:53:24,594 --> 00:53:28,514
I don't give a damn if you vomit
on your own time.

479
00:53:57,418 --> 00:53:59,420
You're scheduled to depart
in 20 minutes, sir.

480
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:02,381
Thank you. Check in with the First Lady,
make sure she's ready.

481
00:54:02,465 --> 00:54:03,800
Yes, sir.

482
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,226
So?

483
00:54:15,645 --> 00:54:17,605
Are you okay?

484
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:19,440
I'm good to go, sir.

485
00:54:27,406 --> 00:54:28,616
Yes?

486
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:33,579
Ma'am, the president wanted me
to check and see if you're ready.

487
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:37,500
Ma'am?

488
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:48,303
Francis.

489
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,561
I'm not going to New Hampshire.

490
00:54:56,644 --> 00:54:59,064
Yes, you are. I'll see you in the car.

491
00:54:59,147 --> 00:55:00,523
I'm leaving you.

492
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:09,490
Claire.
