1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,176
I've been meaning to talk with you.

2
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,054
It's terrifying, isn't it?

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,474
The president and I have a simple request.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,311
Tell us what you see.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,607
If anything in your environment
strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off,

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,359
pick up the phone.

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,155
Whether it's a package
or a person that seems out of place,

8
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,032
we'd love you to let us know.

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,785
Because there's a lot of noise
out there these days.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,081
A noisy press that's choosing
to dwell on the past

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,291
instead of what's happening right now.

12
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,419
My husband and I want to protect you.

13
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:48,090
In two weeks' time,
you will be heading to the ballot box

14
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,426
to decide what kind of country
you want to live in.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,054
It's a profound choice.

16
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:59,517
But no matter who wins this election,
we're going to need to work together,

17
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,394
watch out for each other,

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,980
and, yes, watch each other,

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,358
to keep us all safe and sound.

20
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,693
Tell us what you see.

21
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,947
My name is Claire Underwood,
and I approve this message.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,826
Should we do one more?

23
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,221
Did the Democrats show?

24
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,765
They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.

25
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,767
- Almost.
- I have a list of those who did.

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,354
My fellow congressmen,
I do not need the Washington Herald

27
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,857
to tell me that a scoundrel lives
in the White House.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,651
I can see the Democrats are here.

29
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,861
They're eager to debate.

30
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,757
I say to the gentlemen
on the other side of the aisle...

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,491
- thank you.
- Go.

32
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,743
Should we
investigate the president

33
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,454
for crimes committed
while he was vice president?

34
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,374
I say, yes. Let's debate.

35
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,920
Let's debate this miscreant
all day and all night.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,757
Madam Speaker.
Parliamentary inquiry.

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,008
The gentleman from Georgia

38
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:15,861
may state the nature
of his parliamentary inquiry.

39
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,804
Do the rules
of the House not require

40
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,056
the president be formally invited
in order to attend?

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,474
Madam Speaker, if I may...

42
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,619
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.

43
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,771
The president is wearing
his congressional pin today

44
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,857
and is thereby welcome
to any and all proceedings.

45
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,277
Madam Speaker!
Madam Speaker!

46
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,654
Rules of the House state

47
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,864
that former members are not allowed
on the floor

48
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,950
when they have interest
in the matter under debate.

49
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,452
Madam Speaker,

50
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,956
the president has no interest or opinion
on the matter being debated today.

51
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,710
The House suspend.
The House will suspend.

52
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:53,130
Madam Speaker, I still do have the floor,
and I find it hard to believe

53
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:57,302
the president wouldn't have an opinion
on the matter being discussed.

54
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,972
If the good gentleman from Florida
would yield a portion of his time,

55
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:05,643
I assure him it will satisfy his query.

56
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,482
I yield three minutes to the leader.

57
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,402
And I yield my time to the former
congressman from South Carolina

58
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,904
and the President of the United States.

59
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,327
Point of order!
Parliamentary inquiry!

60
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,829
Parliamentary inquiry!

61
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,291
Parliamentary inquiry!

62
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,502
Mr. President. This is beyond the norm.

63
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,003
I don't care.

64
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,340
I don't care.

65
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:41,388
And I also do not care
about your investigative committees.

66
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,517
No, that is not what I care about today.

67
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,771
The House will cease.

68
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,235
That is not what I care about today.

69
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:02,367
I am on my way to the funeral
of an American patriot.

70
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,788
A good man, a husband...

71
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:13,210
a father...
who was beheaded on American soil.

72
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:19,091
And this chamber chooses to debate me?

73
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,554
- The House will suspend.
- I asked to speak

74
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,599
to a full session of this chamber
and my requests were denied.

75
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,311
- Madam Speaker!
- Mr. President, you must yield the floor.

76
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,939
I will not yield, Madam Speaker.

77
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,942
Because I cannot wait.

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,532
One of the murderers...

79
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,414
One of the murderers
who killed Mr. Jim Miller...

80
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,458
is still out there.

81
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,250
At large.

82
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,631
How much more proof do you people need?

83
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,138
I demand that every member of this House
take a stand.

84
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,934
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.

85
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:12,144
I demand that this Congress

86
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:17,984
declare a formal declaration of war
against ICO, both here and abroad.

87
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,486
Motion to adjourn.

88
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,070
- Second!
- The House will adjourn.

89
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,740
- The president will cease.
- I will not cease!

90
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,200
I will never cease.

91
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,580
I demand that this Congress
declare a state of war

92
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:36,335
has existed and does exist between ICO
and the United States of America.

93
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,673
And I demand that every member
of this House stay in this chamber

94
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,553
for as long as it takes,
until you bring my request to a vote.

95
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:50,975
Or you will all go down in history
as cowards!

96
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,519
Cowards!

97
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,854
The sergeant at arms will
remove the president.

98
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,483
Madam Speaker, I repeat. I demand a vote.

99
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,276
I will not yield.

100
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,279
I will not yield.

101
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,949
I will not yield.

102
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,299
Alleged terrorist Zachary Hawthorne
was killed by the FBI,

103
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,136
but Joshua Masterson is still at large.

104
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,598
While the Miller family mourns, the hunt
for the missing terrorist continues

105
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,767
and tensions are running high.

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,727
The president may be asking for war,

107
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,272
but it seems war's already been declared
on him.

108
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,745
My fans.

109
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,373
FBI is looking into a multiple shooting
in Chattanooga.

110
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:22,126
- Reports have it gang related.
- No.

111
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,924
A private plane went down
in West Virginia. Mechanical failure.

112
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,051
A series of homes were set on fire
in Georgia,

113
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,427
most likely arson.

114
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:36,473
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina
exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.

115
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,686
- Where's the store?
- Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.

116
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,604
The cause is still under investigation.

117
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,316
- I'll make an appearance.
- Yes, ma'am.

118
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,069
Just put it on the schedule
so the media has time to mobilize.

119
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,571
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,009
I take it the president has declared war
on Joshua Masterson.

121
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,220
He never should've
kicked me off that call.

122
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,724
But this morning isn't about politics.

123
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,183
That's right.

124
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,144
We need to show some compassion
for the living.

125
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,271
And respect for the dead.

126
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,196
The family's agreed to a moment.

127
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,324
No press, no speeches,
but we should be able to pull something.

128
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,037
- Mr. President.
- Governor.

129
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,003
Do they not realize
what we've done for them already?

130
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,921
I pointed that out, sir, but...

131
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,465
the daughter's medicated
and very fragile at the moment.

132
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:52,549
All right.

133
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,344
Mrs. Miller.

134
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,974
- I'm so very sorry.
- Thank you.

135
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,893
And I promise you,

136
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,438
I will not stop until everyone responsible
for this terrible tragedy

137
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,232
is brought to justice.

138
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,153
And I swear to you,
as God is my witness...

139
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,532
no one will ever harm you
or your family ever again.

140
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,577
The nation mourns with you
and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.

141
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,206
- Thank you. If you don't mind...
- Of course.

142
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,673
Mr. President.

143
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:33,549
I'll be right along.

144
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,719
It's a busy day for you today, sir.

145
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,263
It's a sad, sad day.

146
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,266
It's a shame
things didn't turn out differently.

147
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:46,353
Yes. Well, some things are bigger
than the two of us, Will.

148
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,819
I don't want him here!

149
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,612
Calm down, Melissa. Please.

150
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,032
It's his fault. He's dead.

151
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,326
- Daddy's dead. He killed him.
- Please.

152
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,494
Give me a minute.

153
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,333
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes. Okay? Yes.

154
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,584
Yes!

155
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:15,299
You do. You think about what
you would say on a day like today.

156
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,260
If a day like today were to happen.

157
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,597
But you let it pass...

158
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,934
because you know you have
so much more left ahead of you.

159
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,687
So much to do together.

160
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,276
You think...
You think 40 minutes...

161
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,905
If we were late 40 minutes...

162
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,282
Or two, or one...

163
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,495
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...

164
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,626
But to dwell in the past,
to live in what-ifs...

165
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,171
That wasn't my husband.

166
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,508
That wasn't us...

167
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,677
- Honey...
- Please.

168
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,722
Okay. Come on.

169
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,020
I need to...

170
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,484
I wanted to say about my father...

171
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,991
He was so strong... so brave.

172
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,830
My father was taking us to...

173
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,501
My father...

174
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,588
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- My father...

175
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,801
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.

176
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,344
Melissa...

177
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,474
It's all right, Melissa. We understand.

178
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,687
I hope you die
and she becomes president.

179
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,586
What did the girl say to you?

180
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,633
She said she hopes I die
and that you become the president.

181
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:34,271
Mr. Macallan, this is
Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.

182
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,067
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.

183
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,573
There's been raids as far up
as New York and down to the panhandle.

184
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,656
As of now,

185
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,495
Green's focusing in on the border
between Virginia and North Carolina.

186
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,378
Seth has a statement ready
for this afternoon.

187
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,207
No. The best statement is no statement.

188
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,293
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice
on this until we're ready.

189
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,920
Yes, sir.

190
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:01,673
- Quite a crowd out there.
- Well, we better bring Birch in first.

191
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,967
Yes, sir.

192
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,427
Congressman Birch.

193
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,180
Bob.

194
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,433
Well, that was a little bit of history
this morning, wasn't it?

195
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,810
- It certainly was.
- I couldn't see it any other way.

196
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,354
No disagreement from here.

197
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,023
Well, you know how the Republicans are.

198
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,565
Anything but a decision.

199
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,401
They mistake complaint for leadership.

200
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,237
Well, instead of a committee
to investigate you,

201
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,364
you got one to discuss your declaration.

202
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,408
All the way to election day.

203
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,451
Even if there's only
a handful of Republicans

204
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,495
with the grit and spit to put up a fight,

205
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:32,914
we can control the conversation.

206
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,000
Get them talking about anything
but that goddamn article.

207
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,793
All right.
Now, who from our side

208
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,628
do we need to massage?
- Womack.

209
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,007
The declaration caught him off guard.
Had to keep him out of it.

210
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,759
It's his constituents
that actually fight the damn thing.

211
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:48,637
Well, let's call in the honorable
gentleman from Missouri.

212
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,765
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

213
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:01,901
- A stunt. Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
- Charlie, if I may...

214
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,029
Tom, please, what are you implying?

215
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:09,992
This request for a declaration of war
is yet another distraction.

216
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,828
And I've never been prouder
of the president than I am today.

217
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,622
I'm not denying what happened
to the Millers. It was a tragedy.

218
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,459
No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.

219
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,086
This is a pattern.

220
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,046
Your husband's administration,
Mrs. Underwood,

221
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,631
continues to operate in the shadows.
- Tom...

222
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,635
I understand you believe
in the importance of your article.

223
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,098
And I agreed to come here today
and talk with you about it.

224
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,517
But we're fighting
to keep this country safe.

225
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,232
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has
yet to release one piece of information

226
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,236
about the attempted capture
of those domestic terrorists.

227
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,862
ICO terrorists, yes.

228
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,742
Reports from a few hours ago
are saying North Carolina or Virginia.

229
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,078
But that's all we have.

230
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,580
Well, we are circling in,
we're getting closer.

231
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,207
I will tell you,

232
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,335
our intelligence community,
they are the real heroes.

233
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,421
Charlie, if we could get back to my point,
my sources confirmed...

234
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,756
Tom.

235
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,635
Heather Dunbar,
no friend of mine or my husband's,

236
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,763
looked into these charges,
and cleared the president.

237
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,931
Cleared? Please.

238
00:16:15,682 --> 00:16:19,103
The White House has not had
a single press briefing

239
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,562
since the Herald ran my article.

240
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,190
You keep saying the White House
isn't speaking about this.

241
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,276
I am sitting right here talking to you.

242
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,570
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.

243
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,114
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.

244
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,200
- What?
- Excuse me. Lucas Goodwin, meaning?

245
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,369
I'm saying, me. I'm here.

246
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,208
And I don't know how many more times
we have to go over this.

247
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,086
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt
article used to be

248
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,923
the first thing I would look for
when I opened the Washington Herald.

249
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,592
The Underwoods
are no longer campaigning.

250
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,761
They can call it what they want.

251
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:55,847
Well, if you think about
the last few days, what's in the air...

252
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:00,102
It might not be such a bad idea for us
to take it one handshake at a time.

253
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,895
Or call it for what it is.

254
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,356
"Home and abroad."

255
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,775
The president is essentially
asking for permission

256
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,403
to fight a war on our soil.
- We can't push back too hard.

257
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,922
We can't afford to look soft on terror.

258
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,032
We can't look
the other way, either.

259
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,452
You of all people
know where this kind of talk leads.

260
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,330
...ICO
and the United States of America.

261
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,600
Make sure the committee dealing
with the declaration of war

262
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,210
never gets to a vote.

263
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,589
We're not against war, we're against his.

264
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,359
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker

265
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,303
and find out who she's putting
on that committee.

266
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,555
We need to get back
to the president's crimes.

267
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,183
That's the story. It's the only story.

268
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,436
Anything else?

269
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,021
I have my script.

270
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,691
I will not yield!

271
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,276
I will not...

272
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,620
Harry...

273
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,291
I want to know what he says
and when he says it.

274
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,335
Our general isn't used to taking orders.

275
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,670
Will, one more thing.

276
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:12,758
- What?
- Your wife.

277
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,886
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign
on Pollyhop,

278
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,723
but it might be time to close it down...
or at least be more careful.

279
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,643
Well, what did they find out?

280
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:26,188
The home of the mother of the terrorist,
you know, the one they're looking for,

281
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,981
was vandalized last night.

282
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:31,318
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.

283
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,487
And, uh, Hannah...

284
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,115
well... she posted.

285
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,284
She was defending the mother online.

286
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,580
- When?
- This afternoon.

287
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,250
The timing is not good on this.

288
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,295
- I can show you.
- Not now.

289
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,883
Thank you.

290
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:57,636
Governor Conway and I are honored
to be here

291
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,847
with the Miller family
and their closest friends.

292
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,768
I know the VFW was a big part
of Jim's life here in Knoxville.

293
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,563
With the help of Homeland and our hotline,

294
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,649
we think that Masterson has crossed
into the southwest corner of Virginia.

295
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,568
Scott or Washington.

296
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,112
- And?
- And...

297
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,032
Assistant Director Green?

298
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,454
We're relying on aerial support,
sightings and local law enforcement.

299
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,580
But we're fairly confident

300
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,998
we can have him pinned down
in the next 24 hours.

301
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,460
The president wants us to be
absolutely sure.

302
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,088
We can't have him getting away again.
Careers are at stake.

303
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,384
Everyone around this table is fully aware
of the gravity of the situation.

304
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,596
Good. The president will be happy
to hear that.

305
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,005
Okay.
What kind of kiss do you want?

306
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,716
- Eskimo.
- In...

307
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,428
and out.

308
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,514
I'll be right back.

309
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,651
- You're angry.
- I am.

310
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,614
I was asked a question
and I answered.

311
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,325
That's the least of it.

312
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,329
Okay, well, I don't want
to talk about it right now.

313
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,164
Are you trying to lose this election?
Are you?

314
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,874
Oh, Will, stop it.

315
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,588
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.

316
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,255
And he's still out there somewhere.

317
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,380
- Do you understand what this looks like?
- Stop it.

318
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,345
Do you want to know
why our son can't sleep?

319
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,472
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.

320
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,140
Because he's having nightmares.

321
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,770
Because he thinks there's a big black dog
running around the hotel.

322
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,105
- Dog?
- Yes.

323
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,983
He closes his eyes,
and he can hear it growling.

324
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,026
He's scared, Will.

325
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,828
I said what I said
because that woman is a victim.

326
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,288
We all are.

327
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,750
And it has to stop.

328
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,798
I want you to win.

329
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,678
Get yourself a drink. I'll be right back.

330
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,114
That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.

331
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,619
She's not a criminal and should not
be punished for the sins of her son.

332
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,539
We all, I know, reject the rhetoric

333
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,958
and actions of these damaged,
troubled young men.

334
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,128
What I mean is,
this is a time for reflection,

335
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:01,212
not aggression...

336
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,215
So she's not condoning it,
but it is sympathetic.

337
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,979
Plays into the idea
that Joshua and Zachary

338
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,429
were just a pair of troubled kids
looking for a cause,

339
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,722
no different than some school shooter.

340
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,267
The post has been shared
over 100,000 times.

341
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,563
I want to talk with her.

342
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,607
- Hannah?
- The mother.

343
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,528
We've been very careful
about where you appear.

344
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,906
- LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
- Of course.

345
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,666
We need to dial up the terror.

346
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,460
And the mother can help us with that.

347
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,463
But that also means
we have to locate Masterson.

348
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,339
Soon.

349
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,971
Tom is waiting for me.

350
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,098
Well, you go on.

351
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,190
Francis...

352
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,487
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.

353
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,282
- No, it played beautifully.
- Not for me.

354
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,663
Come with me.

355
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,125
Come on. Just tell him you'll be late.

356
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,760
- Mr. President.
- It's all right, Officer.

357
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
Ma'am.

358
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,098
May I have your scope?

359
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:38,143
Scope on your gun.
I promise I'll give it back.

360
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,483
Thank you. Come here.

361
00:24:57,453 --> 00:25:00,916
Now, if you just hold the scope
a little a ways from your face...

362
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:06,212
and look down, straight down,
across the lawn... right to the gate.

363
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,679
- You see them?
- Hmm.

364
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:19,309
Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.

365
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,814
And they're looking back across the lawn,
toward this house and these windows...

366
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,900
and they're thinking,

367
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,821
"I wonder what the president
and the First Lady are doing tonight.

368
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,199
And will they be able to protect us?"

369
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,829
I should have been there.

370
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,497
Where?

371
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,960
When you got shot. I wish I was there.

372
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,544
Maybe I could've...

373
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,214
protected you.

374
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,262
You see, all those people want...

375
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:01,101
is someone to keep them
from what they're afraid to know.

376
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,735
And what are the president and First Lady
doing tonight, Francis?

377
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,988
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.

378
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,033
Thank you, sir.

379
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,204
I'll see you in the morning.

380
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,793
Do you have a smoke?

381
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,134
Thank you.

382
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,059
# I know what my people
Are thinking tonight #

383
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,690
# As home through the shadows
They wander #

384
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,236
# Everyone smiling in secret delight #

385
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,907
# As they stare at the castle and ponder #

386
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,869
# And whenever the wind blows this way #

387
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,372
# You can almost hear everyone say #

388
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,210
# I wonder what the king
Is doing tonight #

389
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,554
I've been looking for you.

390
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:21,848
I got hungry.

391
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,225
So I went down to the main kitchen.

392
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,062
That's a lovely group of people
you have down there.

393
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,898
If there's anything you need,
it can be brought up.

394
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,318
I didn't know what I needed
until I was eating it.

395
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,321
I heard the president's declaration.

396
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:38,699
Very compelling.

397
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,288
What did you really think?

398
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,208
It was almost like the real thing.

399
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,813
The NSA has good people.
Very good.

400
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,190
- Too good.
- Not as good as you.

401
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,984
Good enough to find my algorithms.

402
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,361
That doesn't mean they knew
what we were using them for.

403
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,779
No, no.

404
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,073
One second, they send me home,
and then the next,

405
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,950
they tell me, "Come back!"

406
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,996
- They'll been watching me. This is a trap.
- Or the only way out.

407
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,330
God damn it.

408
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:29,374
- You want out?
- Don't you?

409
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:33,669
LeAnn...

410
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,925
we have done some illegal things here.

411
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,511
There are other campaigns.

412
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,723
- If you can get into the NSA...
- That's not possible.

413
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,892
...into their system, you can fix this.

414
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,643
- You're not listening to me.
- I am.

415
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,063
I know the Underwoods.

416
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,526
The only way
that we are gonna survive this...

417
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,861
is if they win.

418
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,990
You can help them win.

419
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,242
I know you can.

420
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,340
I got on the paper
right around the time you left.

421
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,760
Did you start in Style?

422
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,136
Metro desk.

423
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,430
But then I did this piece,
a street fashion,

424
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,932
kids on the street thing.

425
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,601
I'm surprised you asked for me.

426
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,521
Some people are being moved around
and off the team.

427
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:39,152
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"

428
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,284
Were you ever interested
in investigative journalism?

429
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,829
If you ask me, if it's not investigating,
it's not journalism.

430
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,169
Word around here is
you can get anybody to talk to you.

431
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,382
After 8:00, with a drink in their hands...

432
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,468
yeah.

433
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,980
She's the one they say you called a...

434
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:17,983
you know.

435
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,279
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

436
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:27,367
You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?

437
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,204
It'd be an honor to work with you
in any capacity.

438
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,457
To be part of this.

439
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,339
Did you find him? Did you?

440
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,383
It'll only be another moment.

441
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,760
Because I've done all I can.

442
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,471
Everything you told me to. You know that.

443
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,057
They know that, don't they?

444
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,770
Mrs. Underwood.

445
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,901
I was hoping
to speak to Ms. Masterson.

446
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:04,070
Just the two of us.

447
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,552
Is there a problem?

448
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,930
It is a bit extreme.

449
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,059
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.

450
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:38,396
The restrictions on visas alone is
unprecedented. How do we justify?

451
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,999
The White House counsel's
been all through that.

452
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,566
It's there in black and white.

453
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,944
We're virtually closing down our borders

454
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,779
without any hard evidence to back it up.
- It's coming.

455
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,033
A lot of innocent people
are trying to get into this country.

456
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,867
They could be hurt by this.

457
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,833
A change in policy this big,
I want it done right.

458
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,087
I want you to let the world know

459
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,506
that if they want to continue
coming to this country for our hospitals,

460
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,510
our colleges, our golf courses
and God knows what else...

461
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,057
they're going to have to deliver more than
my head on the end of a burning stick.

462
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:19,229
Now look, Cathy, I know you have
well-earned relationships out there.

463
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,396
Long-standing.

464
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,066
I'm not holding back, Francis.
I have reached out.

465
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,611
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.

466
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,779
I want to know where ICO is,
or at the very least,

467
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,865
that everyone's out there looking.

468
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,325
Are we clear?

469
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,409
We're clear.

470
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,578
Thank you, Cathy.
I know you won't let me down.

471
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,631
He's dead.

472
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:50,343
- Is that why you're here?
- We're still looking for him...

473
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,763
Because if he's dead, I want to see him.
To touch him.

474
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,142
I'm trying to help...

475
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,519
- Ms. Masterson, please.
...but he hasn't contacted me.

476
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,147
- I wish he would.
- I understand. Calm down.

477
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,153
He's not a monster like they all say.

478
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,782
- I lost him somewhere.
- But he's not...

479
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,745
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?

480
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,544
I want my lawyer.

481
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,838
What for?

482
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,137
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

483
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,722
I don't know why I say anything anymore.

484
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,604
I wanted to see you...
to ask you a simple question.

485
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,026
Didn't you know
what was going on in your home?

486
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,946
- Excuse me?
- You knew...

487
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,074
even before he went to Pakistan.

488
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,701
- I mean, you raised him.
- No.

489
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:01,081
No. He had some problems. He got lost.

490
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:05,335
- But no, nothing like this.
- But you saw what he did, didn't you?

491
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,382
- No.
- Would you like to see it?

492
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,094
We can show it to you, if you like.

493
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,845
No. Please don't.

494
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:27,148
What he did to that family, to that man...

495
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,361
What sort of person would do such a thing?

496
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,865
He's my son.

497
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,371
Oh, God.

498
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,750
I know. It's awful, isn't it?

499
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,462
Thank you.

500
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,553
When you leave today,

501
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:02,517
there will be some reporters,
some cameramen out there.

502
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,935
But you don't need to say very much.

503
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:10,233
You just need to ask Josh
to turn himself in.

504
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,116
There are so many hardworking mothers
and fathers out there.

505
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,243
This could've happened to any of them.

506
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,705
We are close to capturing
your son, Ms. Masterson,

507
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,458
and I will do my best to have you see him.

508
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:31,129
I want to go.

509
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,673
No one's keeping you.

510
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,528
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?

511
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,432
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.

512
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,769
We're two weeks out.
It's hard to say no to war.

513
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,441
You and I have some things in common.

514
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,986
- We both dislike the president.
- No. I'm still a Democrat.

515
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,072
Who leans to the right.

516
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,950
Alex, you do actually lean
a little to the right.

517
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,702
Look, he's the commander in chief.

518
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,830
He's got all the authority he needs
to fight them where they are.

519
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,499
Well, there's one here.
Out there, right now, as we speak.

520
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,710
Well, I'm a big fan
of American law enforcement.

521
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,920
They'll find him soon enough.

522
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,715
We can't just let Francis Underwood
turn us into a nation

523
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,426
that's always looking over their shoulder.

524
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:22,856
If you can get yourself
onto that committee,

525
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:26,642
I got a feeling the Chair will give you
all the time you need.

526
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,564
My driver will take you back to your car.
But, Congressman...

527
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:34,525
this is your chance.

528
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,320
And I think you know it.

529
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,544
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.

530
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,256
Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.

531
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,930
Just go away!

532
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,483
You have no idea
what is happening in your own homes.

533
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,361
Have you any idea where he is,
Mrs. Masterson?

534
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:21,572
Josh, please...

535
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,035
please, please turn yourself in.

536
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,331
This has all got to stop. No, no.

537
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,787
...this after ten years with Treasury,
he was waiting for it.

538
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,247
Yeah...

539
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,394
Mrs. Underwood!

540
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,354
Mrs. Underwood!

541
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,065
Does the administration believe
that the explosion was connected

542
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:46,569
with Joshua Masterson somehow?
- We're not sure yet.

543
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,279
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.

544
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,657
The owner of the establishment
was foreign-born.

545
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,284
Any connection to ICO overseas?

546
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:58,831
I think our Deputy Director Clark here
is better equipped to answer that.

547
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,084
We're looking into it.
In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.

548
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:04,855
- If anyone in the community has any...
- And if the Republican candidate

549
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,089
and the rest of his party
refuse to acknowledge

550
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,967
the seriousness of the threat
made here at home...

551
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,636
know that we will.

552
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,265
The FBI is currently gathering
a list of words and images.

553
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,895
If they appear on your children's
or your coworkers' devices, please...

554
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,188
War whore!

555
00:41:24,189 --> 00:41:25,691
- Move!
- Car!

556
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,662
It was just paint.
She's all right.

557
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,249
And what else? Spit it out, Doug.
It won't taste so bad.

558
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,670
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.

559
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,005
But Director Green and his team
have a location

560
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,608
for the takedown and they're ready to act.

561
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,466
And they're positive
it's the right location?

562
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,552
- Adamant.
- When?

563
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:54,679
Hours.

564
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,444
We can coordinate
out of the Situation Room.

565
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,394
Oh, no. I'm gonna meet him in person.

566
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,897
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

567
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,775
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.

568
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:09,777
Yes, sir.

569
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,416
It's amazing how ready people are
to be afraid.

570
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:26,752
History would prove them right.

571
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,342
You're lucky this is coming off
with water.

572
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,635
Could've been worse.

573
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,055
Some found its way behind your ear.

574
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:44,103
- Should I be afraid?
- Don't be smart.

575
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,188
I should, shouldn't I?

576
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,775
I stole something from you.

577
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,611
What?

578
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,405
What it is, doesn't matter.

579
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,993
I just wanted something that was yours.

580
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,745
Well, put it back.

581
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,333
Waterfalls.

582
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,504
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits
as waterfalls.

583
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,464
What can they get us into?

584
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:16,927
We can backdoor
into some very popular social media.

585
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,723
I can insert anything your imagination
can think of into those sites.

586
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,018
Underwoods or otherwise.

587
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,104
...reports coming in
from a variety of sources

588
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,857
stating that local police enforcement
and FBI agents

589
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,567
are currently on the ground.

590
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,694
We're receiving reports
that there's a great deal

591
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,529
of police activity on the Virginia border.

592
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,322
We cannot confirm at this time,

593
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,950
but we believe this is connected
to the manhunt

594
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,119
for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.

595
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,222
The capture of Joshua Masterson
may be close at hand.

596
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,310
The FBI is still not commenting,
but if you look at this aerial view,

597
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:09,939
you can see heavily-armed men
making their way through this wooded area.

598
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,556
Sir, he's not here.

599
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,394
All we have are some loose
domestic connections.

600
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,732
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.

601
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,318
He refuses to confirm
any wide-ranging homegrown network.

602
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,115
Our interrogators are confident
the asset is no longer valuable.

603
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,076
And risk to reward no longer tenable.

604
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,373
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.

605
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:17,339
Did you think I didn't already have him?

606
00:45:17,422 --> 00:45:19,800
That I would have left him
out there somewhere?

607
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,719
And I thought you knew me.

608
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,086
Josh.

609
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,882
Joshua.

610
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,314
Do you want to live?

611
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,694
Tell us what we want.

612
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,199
Tell us what we want to hear.

613
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,079
You're no martyr, are you?

614
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,664
Look at you.

615
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,918
No, you're not a martyr.

616
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:42,424
No one will remember what you've done,
either here on Earth or in your heaven.

617
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:52,977
So why did you pick the Millers?

618
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,189
Why?

619
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,774
What did you see?

620
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,739
Was it the girl?

621
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:10,660
Did you see her first?

622
00:47:12,537 --> 00:47:14,289
What did you see?

623
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,087
Or did she see you first?

624
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,800
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?
She saw you.

625
00:47:27,552 --> 00:47:31,723
She looked right through you, didn't she?

626
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:36,603
I don't need to see this person anymore.

627
00:47:37,812 --> 00:47:40,357
- Get rid of the asset.
- Sir.

628
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,112
He's an animal,
but he's still an American citizen.

629
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,366
We are at war.
And he is an enemy combatant.

630
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,203
And he lost whatever rights
he might have had as an American

631
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,123
when he cut that poor man's head off.

632
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,293
So don't give me
your pride or your position.

633
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,586
Because none of this would have happened

634
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,173
if you'd done what you were told
in the first place.

635
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,050
I'll take care of it.

636
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,261
Yes, you will,
and you will do so willingly.

637
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,350
And I want you to get
some good, usable footage...

638
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,936
of his killing.

639
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,397
And then destroy everything else.

640
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:42,461
We will be releasing footage
of Joshua Masterson's killing.

641
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,464
The administration
and the intelligence community

642
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,342
were hoping to take him alive.

643
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,509
But I would like to commend

644
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,304
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism,
Nathan Green.

645
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,547
And of course all of the work

646
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,475
that Secretary Durant has done
behind the scenes on all of this.

647
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,687
The information the investigation
has gathered so far

648
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,565
points to Joshua Masterson
and Zachary Hawthorne

649
00:49:03,648 --> 00:49:08,903
having strong connections to ICO abroad
and ICO's growing network domestically.

650
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,657
And so I would like to say this
to ICO directly.

651
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,037
You will not infect the mind
of one more of our young people,

652
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,874
because I will not stop until I find you.

653
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,169
And I say that
for the grieving Miller family,

654
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,589
whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.

655
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:29,674
I also urge Congress

656
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:34,263
to accelerate the process and vote
on my request for a declaration of war.

657
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,931
- Mr. President?
- I will not be answering questions.

658
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:38,767
Seth will take it from here.

659
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,196
It's hard to see,
but I think that was the killshot.

660
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,823
Now, please remember,
these reports are unconfirmed

661
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,451
and we're waiting on a statement
from the White House.

662
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,788
- What we can report is a great deal...
- Why are you watching this?

663
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,832
...this wooded area.
And shots being fired, both by and...

664
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:03,916
Hello?

665
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:06,211
Hello.
This is Francis Underwood.

666
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,757
It's him.

667
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,178
The committee is looking
for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.

668
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,197
What do either of them have to do
with ICO or the war?

669
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,473
The talk up on the Hill is
they're going to invite you

670
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,642
and the rest of your staff to testify.

671
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,913
They're gonna use
the Declaration of War to investigate.

672
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,105
That's right.

673
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:30,319
They're gonna use the committee
Frank asked for to investigate him.

674
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,945
- Fuck.
- That's right, Doug.

675
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,488
"Fuck."

676
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,706
It's difficult to underst...

677
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:46,835
Well, perhaps if you could
just calm down for a moment.

678
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,170
Please stop it.

679
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,590
I thought this news
would bring you some relief.

680
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,900
The president called Mrs. Miller.

681
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,843
I promised you and your daughter
that I would...

682
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,220
Leave her alone.

683
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,014
Well, perhaps we should speak when
you're feeling a little more up to it.

684
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,767
I don't want to hear you. Or from you.

685
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,437
- What you did to my family...
- What?

686
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,607
Leave us out of it.
And do not use my husband's name.

687
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,234
Listen, Mrs...

688
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,487
