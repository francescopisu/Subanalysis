1
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,447
I don't have the right words
for what happened that day.

2
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,949
But he was a hero, no question.

3
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,411
Captain Conway's conduct was heroic.

4
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,578
A hero.

5
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,248
Army Captain Craig Squire
had been captured by the Taliban,

6
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,500
held hostage in the Kandahar province.

7
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,294
We realized the intel was bad.

8
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,629
By the time we found him,
we'd started taking fire.

9
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,716
It was like a death garden or something.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,928
Captain Conway got out of the plane
and got Squire out.

11
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,095
Don't even ask me how.

12
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,723
This election is too important.

13
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,978
You have a choice between
Francis Underwood and a real hero.

14
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,774
This is what happens
when you throw around a word like "war."

15
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,443
All hell breaks loose.

16
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,364
He saved Squire. He saved all of us.

17
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,033
War is real.

18
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,952
Paid for by Americans for Truth.

19
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,722
I don't know how many times
I have to go through this,

20
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,433
but my campaign
had nothing to do with that ad.

21
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:46,749
That was a super PAC.

22
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,085
- I know, but...
- But those soldiers, though.

23
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,253
They're the ones.

24
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,839
This country owes them a lot.

25
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,650
- But that ad is on all the time.
- You wanna know why?

26
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,885
Because Frank Underwood
has failed to keep this country safe.

27
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,095
The death of James Miller,

28
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,974
the so-called ICO attack
at Capital East Telecom network...

29
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,393
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you saying ICO wasn't responsible?

30
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,644
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

31
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,439
The Internet went down
on the president's watch.

32
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,649
- Don't you think ICO was...
- Now listen, Fred...

33
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,777
- No, ICO is a real threat.
- There's a lot of people waiting

34
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,196
and I promised one question per person.

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,117
It was great talking to you,
and please don't forget to vote tomorrow.

36
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,537
Now, how long have we been going, anyway?

37
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,540
- Four hours.
- Four hours.

38
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,251
That means we got 20 hours to go

39
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,894
and I haven't even had the chance
to thank my friends at Pollyhop

40
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,172
for making this all possible
and live streaming this event.

41
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,591
Benjamin Grant and his crew.

42
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,594
All right.
What's the next question?

43
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,972
Annie? Annie from Maine.
What's on your mind?

44
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,349
Was Fred one of ours?

45
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,309
I think so.
We're gonna keep hitting the ad.

46
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,438
LeAnn's got callers lined up.
Are you there yet?

47
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,107
Almost. Then back on the plane.

48
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,318
- I'm about to go on.
- Ohio, still?

49
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,363
Oh, yeah. And how's he looking? Conway?

50
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,698
Well, he's only four hours in.
It's not sustainable.

51
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,368
- But is he commanding?
- He's arrogant, Francis.

52
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,537
- Mr. President?
- I have to go.

53
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,539
Okay. See you in Gettysburg.

54
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,668
You're saying it doesn't matter
if Underwood knew about pay-for-play?

55
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,004
Well, I'm saying it's bad either way.

56
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,633
He either stole the presidency
from his own party,

57
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,262
or he was vice president
in a corrupt administration.

58
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,432
But it's important
that we let the committee do its job.

59
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,600
So thanks for your call, Annie.

60
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,770
Arthur Capo from Del Rey Beach, Hawaii.
Arthur, how you doing?

61
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,980
Why did they want to talk to you?

62
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,359
I'm sorry, who?
Uh, what's your question, Arthur?

63
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,403
Josh Masterson and Zachary...

64
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,865
I forget his last name.
But the terrorists who killed Jim Miller.

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,242
Right. Uh, well...

66
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,953
All I know is what they said

67
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,580
in their list of demands.

68
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,333
And they believed
I would be elected president.

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,336
But really, why? Why you?

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,381
I successfully negotiated the release
of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

71
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,426
- But not Jim Miller.
- I wasn't given the chance.

72
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,306
What's your read on him,
the way he answers those questions?

73
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,393
- He's hiding something.
- Right.

74
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,812
But it doesn't matter.

75
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,442
He's modern.
He makes the presidency accessible.

76
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,738
I mean, don't you want to see
the candidate stay up all night?

77
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,662
Are you calling Francis old?

78
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,635
I appreciate the applause,
ladies and gentlemen,

79
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:48,097
but I imagine it's for the woman
you really came to see.

80
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,895
"These are dangerous times."

81
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,355
These are dangerous times.

82
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,149
...of the United States,

83
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,110
Claire Underwood.

84
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,989
He's only a couple years
older than me, you know.

85
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,463
Thank you. Thank you, Nevada!

86
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:29,514
I really appreciate
you all coming out here this morning.

87
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:36,896
No substitute for retail politics.
Especially her brand.

88
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,523
Thank you.

89
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,693
Could you get me
some water, please?

90
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,653
Hello, everyone.

91
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,155
Thank you so much.

92
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,199
Thank you very much.
That's very kind.

93
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,578
Oh, thanks so much.

94
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,497
Oh, now stop that. Stop it, stop it.
Enough, enough, enough. Enough.

95
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,083
It's embarrassing, all of that adulation.

96
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,961
Hello, nice to see you.
Thank you so much for coming out.

97
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,378
Much appreciated.

98
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,632
- Jack!
- Great speech, Mr. President.

99
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,068
It's like you're saying what I'm thinking.

100
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,512
Well, that is the idea.
Thank you.

101
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,931
Uh, I'm a little worried
about the Conway thing, though.

102
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,101
- Bringing up a lot of questions.
- But not a lot of answers.

103
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,413
Yeah, and we don't need
to keep hearing about that article

104
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,372
the day before the election.
What are we doing about it?

105
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,483
Well, we're here, Jack.

106
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,819
We are fighting back
one handshake at a time.

107
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,740
Gwendolyn, you look absolutely stunning.
May I get a photograph, please, Steve?

108
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,576
Could you do this, please?
Make sure you cut him out.

109
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,080
We have Jeff from Corpus Christi, Texas.
How are you doing today, Jeff?

110
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:38,500
We saw the ad. About the rescue.

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,961
You know, Jeff, I feel like
we have been through this already.

112
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,630
You saved my brother's life, sir.

113
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,923
Craig Squire.

114
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,887
Captain Squire.
That's... that's your brother?

115
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,558
Captain.

116
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,522
Remember me?

117
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,775
I do remember. Of course I remember.

118
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,943
I didn't think
you wanted talk about it.

119
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,113
We lived through it.
That's enough, isn't it?

120
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:11,991
I never got to thank you and tell you...

121
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,161
Captain Squire,
you would've done the same.

122
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,623
I don't know. I was in there.

123
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,751
They were tossing bodies on top of me,
one after the other...

124
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,002
I was already dead.

125
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,840
That's not right.
It's like I've been dead once already.

126
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,635
But the bodies...
the way they were stuck together.

127
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,428
And the heat and the smell...

128
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,552
But you know when you were
pulling me out, remember?

129
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:39,769
I... I don't remember much, actually.
It all happened pretty quick.

130
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,937
I know you heard it.

131
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,939
You have to get him
out of this question.

132
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,833
He doesn't like talking about this.
You know that.

133
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,276
- Hannah, let's talk.
- Come on, man. I know you did.

134
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,487
I was just trying to
get us out of there as fast as I could.

135
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,074
Craig, we're here.

136
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,786
- We made it.
- Yeah, but...

137
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,914
- You gotta live your life.
- Thanks for taking our call.

138
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,373
Thank you.

139
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,341
He didn't call him out enough.
He didn't get Conway to...

140
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,094
Look... he did what he could.

141
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,223
What did he hear?
What did he mean by that?

142
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,906
I don't know. It's between Will and him.

143
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,353
He's wanted Will to come clean about it
for a long time, but...

144
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,646
it didn't happen.

145
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,692
Which is why, for Craig's sake,
we need to get them back on the phone.

146
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,696
Miss Harvey, you've been on us for months.

147
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,116
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
If this means the deal's off, okay.

148
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,743
We can always find a place to go.

149
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,066
Just let me talk to him again.
We wouldn't want him to...

150
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,247
Jesus Christ!
My brother has been through enough.

151
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,582
We're done.

152
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,251
I need you to leave.

153
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,473
He's doing great.

154
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,601
Is he?

155
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,728
That ad's playing for us.

156
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,067
Look, I... I agreed to this.

157
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,569
- But I know my husband.
- I know you do.

158
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,615
And those questions
were to be expected, yes?

159
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,909
It's a good thing
Squire changed his mind.

160
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,163
We can pull some tape
and put something together tonight.

161
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,165
Hit some markets in the morning.

162
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,292
When it's time to vote...

163
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,753
Will saved his life.

164
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,505
This is too much.

165
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,223
I don't want any more questions
about the war.

166
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,093
That's not gonna work.

167
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,637
Look, I can show you numbers,

168
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,847
I can show you
how well it's all playing for us.

169
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:44,018
- What I'm saying, Mark, is that this...
- I've been at this a long time, Hannah.

170
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,270
You know, when Marshall told me
you were available...

171
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:50,107
Marshall and I go way back.
The timing is right for all of us, right?

172
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,421
- We're very grateful.
- He will tell you, I don't get involved,

173
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:58,240
not this late in the game,
unless I know I can make a difference.

174
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,454
So whatever happened to Will
with Squire, whatever...

175
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,415
- It's not...
- I don't wanna know. I don't need to know.

176
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,627
But whatever pain he's carrying
about what happened...

177
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,505
it's working for us.

178
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,801
So, this is what I need from you.

179
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:21,806
To go back out there and just make sure
he makes it through until morning.

180
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,312
Hey.

181
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,399
He has a chance to be a fine president.

182
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,862
A great president.

183
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,242
Even better.

184
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,745
Because we could use one.

185
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,002
There's a reason
that Squire didn't appear in that ad.

186
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,962
I'm just nailing down the specifics.

187
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,886
- Let's bring Doug in on this.
- He's on his way to Philly.

188
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,888
And with all due respect, sir,

189
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,140
his skill set
doesn't necessarily apply here.

190
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,227
Do you know how long
Doug has worked for me, LeAnn?

191
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,311
Not exactly, no.

192
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,481
Well, it's just this side of forever.
I know everything about him.

193
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:15,317
His strengths, his weaknesses,
his skill set

194
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,112
and the contents of his soul.

195
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,409
I hope you're not questioning my loyalty.

196
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,830
I just like to know about the people
who work for me, LeAnn.

197
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,793
- I'm pretty straightforward.
- I don't believe that for a second.

198
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,795
The first time I sat down with Doug,

199
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,505
it was more of a confession
than a conversation.

200
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,927
He told me about his drinking, his past.
He was completely open with me.

201
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,471
I don't think we can rely on Craig Squire.

202
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,515
Then why am I still talking to you?

203
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,561
I'm not hiding
the contents of my soul, sir.

204
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,857
- Reach out to Vanessa Morrison.
- I already reached out to the director.

205
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,986
Yes, but Doug hasn't. So have him do it
and then you come up with something else

206
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,864
before Conway is done
with his little sideshow.

207
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,782
And in terms of what comes next,

208
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,828
I adjusted the opening remarks
and cut some from the stump.

209
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,287
The stump is just fine.

210
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,580
Thank you very much.

211
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,500
Get me the First Lady, please.

212
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,878
Well, the... the short answer is

213
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,880
in a democracy,
everyone has the same rights...

214
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,049
...the same opportunities.

215
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,468
Hello.

216
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,096
Do the people around us
understand what it takes?

217
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,599
Look, I know Conway's getting a bump,

218
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,560
but it doesn't mean
we can't surmount it in the next 24 hours.

219
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:35,356
Do they know what we have done
to get this far?

220
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,525
Tom is sitting across from me right now.

221
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,945
I don't care
who you're sitting next to, Claire.

222
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,117
We're all doing everything we can
as fast as we can.

223
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,788
I don't like it.
I don't like chasing this.

224
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,666
What's your next stop?

225
00:13:55,584 --> 00:14:00,506
- We, uh... We're in Scranton in 20.
- You need to save your voice.

226
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,302
I'll see you on the battlefield.

227
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,980
How's the president doing?

228
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,443
He's acting like he's still 30 years old.

229
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,116
We both are.

230
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,413
Is that good... or bad?

231
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,126
That depends on if we win or lose.

232
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:43,090
Because I'm a vet and I'm still not clear
on exactly what happened.

233
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,510
You know, I think everything has been said
by the soldiers who were there.

234
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:51,223
No. 'Cause your plane, was it shot down
or was it a planned rescue?

235
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,475
Planned, yes.

236
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,478
Until the plan had to change.

237
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,024
- I think you get the idea.
- No, I don't get it, sir.

238
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,943
- You were a pilot, right?
- Yes.

239
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,278
So why were your boots
even on the ground?

240
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,405
Our intel was flawed.

241
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:13,037
Our intel was flawed and I...
I had to step in. I had to.

242
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,250
Hi, Mike.

243
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,795
My husband is a humble man.

244
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:25,049
You're never going to get the details
of his bravery that day.

245
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,675
At least, not from him.

246
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,845
To me, his comrades say it all.

247
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,640
Will is a man who is equipped
to deal with whatever comes at him.

248
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,602
And now, I'd like to put in a word
on a more practical matter,

249
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,562
these new centralized voting centers.

250
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,815
Because we've had
lots of calls and questions.

251
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:46,570
Whichever candidate you support,
it's essential that you get out to vote.

252
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:50,866
Ask a neighbor for a ride
or call your local party office.

253
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,370
This race is too close for complacency.

254
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,346
You got my vote!

255
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:20,771
- Underwood!
- Thank you so much.

256
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,151
Thank you. Thank you.

257
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,322
Thank you so much. Thank you.

258
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,534
Oh, thank you.

259
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,953
Could you also get me
a tea with honey, please?

260
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,890
- Are you gonna be all right to speak?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

261
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,000
- Listen to your voice, Francis.
- Stop.

262
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,002
You have been running yourself
into the ground,

263
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,795
you haven't slept for days.

264
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,589
Why don't you kick off the speech,

265
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,550
let me take over,
and then I will explain to...

266
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,303
That the president's lost his voice?
No, you're not gonna say that.

267
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,946
We're not gonna have that headline
as we enter the final stretch.

268
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,767
Especially since Sir Lancelot is out there
yapping all day long.

269
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,437
I'm not really sure
that Conway's a Sir Lancelot.

270
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,440
Oh, really?
Then who would you assign that role to?

271
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,786
God, I hate to waste that.
Excuse me.

272
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,746
There was a young man in line,

273
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,683
on the other side,
sort of against that second door.

274
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,125
Six foot tall...

275
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,962
- Maybe just give us a moment.
- Sure.

276
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,173
Can you see if you can get
some contact information?

277
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,175
Or pull him out if you can. Thank you.

278
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:37,223
I didn't mean take over.
I just meant let's appear as a ticket.

279
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,725
- "Are we united or are we divided?"
- Francis...

280
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,018
"Here at Gettysburg,
one of the bloodiest battles..."

281
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,354
I know your speech.

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,066
But can you finish?
You have to know how to finish, Claire.

283
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,026
I have the distinct honor
of introducing you to,

284
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,029
God-willing and the creek don't rise,

285
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,493
the current and next President
of the United States of America,

286
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,412
Francis Underwood!

287
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,885
Thank you.
Thank you, Congressman Winters,

288
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,596
and thank you, Pennsylvania.

289
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,480
And my running mate, my wife,

290
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,442
and my friend and my partner,
Claire Underwood.

291
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,662
I've always got a few minutes
for Doug Stamper.

292
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:47,793
Again, sorry to keep you waiting.
You sure I can't offer you something?

293
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,295
I don't drink, Governor.

294
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,048
Well, I got club soda, tonic...

295
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,592
You said you were going to
establish voting centers.

296
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,011
I was. I tried.

297
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:01,014
I got pushback from the precinct captains
like you wouldn't believe.

298
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:05,436
- You said you were gonna deploy troops.
- I tried that, too.

299
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,689
I floated the order past Roger Frank
at the ACLU.

300
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,108
He mentioned it to Barney Leonard
at the Black Coalition.

301
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,778
And within two hours,
I got eight angry phone calls

302
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:17,531
telling me exactly what would happen

303
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,617
if I chose to protect exurban areas
instead of Philly.

304
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,164
You don't want to lie to me, Governor.

305
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,292
I just came from Barney Leonard's office.

306
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,420
- You wanna change your story?
- Please.

307
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,981
Barney's gonna tell you
that he threatened a fucking race riot.

308
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:38,885
You fucking lied, straight up,
to the President of the United States.

309
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,389
Doug.

310
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,766
Doug.

311
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,895
- Barney Leonard's office, please.
- Put the phone down.

312
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,565
It's Doug Stamper.

313
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:54,693
Yes, I need him one more time.

314
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,203
Fine. Hang it up.

315
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,501
I'll get you your troops.

316
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,546
You want the truth?

317
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,385
Not interested. I had that coming in.

318
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,095
It's over.

319
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,682
Underwood's gonna lose tomorrow.
He's done.

320
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,810
And when he's done, you're done.

321
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,941
You'll have nothing left.
And then, you'll just disappear.

322
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,281
Thank you for your time, Governor.

323
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,803
What would it take to federalize
the National Guard in Pennsylvania?

324
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,538
The president asked me to get him
some information about Eric Rawlings.

325
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,749
- Who?
- From the Gettysburg event.

326
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,210
Ah, I'll give it to him.

327
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,153
Muhammed Kalabi,
34, Syrian national.

328
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,991
Local assets confirm his ID
with high confidence.

329
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,744
Kalabi has strong connections to ICO.

330
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,913
Bombing in Beirut last fall.

331
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,086
A month before Beirut,
with Ahmadi, in Cairo.

332
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,135
Currently, sir, there are four
Muhammed Kalabis in the United States.

333
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:29,055
Two are approximately the same age
as the ICO Kalabi,

334
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,350
and one entered the United States
three weeks ago

335
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,145
from Afghanistan by way of Canada.

336
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,232
He's visiting his girlfriend in Tennessee
who works at a Knoxville bookstore.

337
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,239
So why are you bringing me all this?

338
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,411
You asked for options, sir.

339
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,913
To arrest Muhammed Kalabi on election day?

340
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,166
Cathy, what's gonna happen when he tells
the authorities he's the wrong one?

341
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,959
But that would be after the election...

342
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,021
Well, that might have played
three or four days ago, Cathy,

343
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,422
but now it's too late.

344
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:09,179
- Did you have this three or four days ago?
- I would have brought it to you, sir.

345
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,850
All right, well,
let's leave it at that.

346
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,101
Send in Doug.

347
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,853
The secretary is just leaving.

348
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,995
That's all we have on the Squire rescue.
It's not enough, unfortunately.

349
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,249
Sir...

350
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,325
when it comes to Matthews,
I don't believe he'll deliver.

351
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:50,220
Let's take this from his hands.
We need to protect the polls.

352
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,597
The request won't come from you.

353
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,491
The way this thing is built,
you're nowhere near it.

354
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,933
Hold on a second.

355
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:58,186
How are the numbers in Pennsylvania?

356
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,356
They're good, but they're
well within the margin of error, sir.

357
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,000
So we don't want
to look like we're shoving

358
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,570
an armed unit of National Guards
down Jim Matthews' throat, right?

359
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,406
- Right.
- So, I got a call from Barney Leonard.

360
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,618
You pushed too hard, Doug.

361
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:23,545
But look, we'll have four years
to take care of Matthews, and we will.

362
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,384
But what if there was another way?

363
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,805
I don't think anybody,
if they're honest with themselves,

364
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,225
can say they truly trust
President Underwood.

365
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,269
Why should they?

366
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,312
With so many threats to our country,

367
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,691
now it's more important than ever
to elect...

368
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,541
...four years
of misguided priorities,

369
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:05,336
backing the GOP into soliciting
private and special interests.

370
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,255
You know what?

371
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,382
What?

372
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,431
- I wanna be that person.
- What person?

373
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,687
The person that does this for, like,
an hour and then leaves.

374
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,689
That's not what this...

375
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,108
Doug, I've been having sex
for as long as you have.

376
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,028
And when you called me,
that's what it sounded like.

377
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,740
And I thought, "Great."
But I'm here now. Where are you?

378
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,880
I should take you home.

379
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,801
No.

380
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,554
- You don't have to.
- Come on.

381
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,641
- I'll take a cab.
- I'm taking you home.

382
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,728
What is going on with you?

383
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,566
You're right. I shouldn't have called.

384
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,026
I gotta get back to work.

385
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,575
Reports are pouring in
of protests being staged

386
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,662
outside of many
of our newly established voting centers.

387
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,373
Which begs the question,
are Americans fed up

388
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:27,127
with our politicians' seemingly
unquenchable thirst for conflict?

389
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,714
- Between Underwood's call for a formal...
- Make a decision?

390
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:34,635
...and the strong military ticket
on the Republican side?

391
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,096
- Basil Hayden's, double, neat.
- Basil Hayden?

392
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,683
You're killing me, buddy.

393
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,233
- What do you got?
- Bulleit's as good as it gets in here.

394
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,155
I'll have that.

395
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,335
- Woman?
- Work.

396
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,714
Yeah, well, nothing's forever, man.

397
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,109
Those two down there, and anyone else
who comes in here until that's gone.

398
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,862
That's for you.

399
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,421
I couldn't sleep.

400
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,430
Is it your throat?

401
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,227
Is it enough?

402
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,147
What we're doing?

403
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,279
I...

404
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,408
Yes.

405
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,372
Then why aren't we farther ahead?

406
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:12,667
- Most of the polls have us...
- Oh, I don't trust the polls.

407
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,130
With few exceptions,
I don't trust anyone or anything.

408
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,470
We won't know for sure
until the vote's begun.

409
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,142
But turnout for their side
is sure to be down.

410
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,855
We almost had Conway today.

411
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,359
And we did some damage.

412
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,780
And maybe we don't know what he's hiding,

413
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,699
but the public knows
there's something out there.

414
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:50,371
Hmm.

415
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,882
He hums in his sleep sometimes.

416
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,260
Hums?

417
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,138
Like what?

418
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,063
I don't know.

419
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,816
Nothing recognizable.

420
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,820
Does he do it often?

421
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,281
Sometimes.

422
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,288
Do it for me. What's it sound like?

423
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,044
- Let's get you something for your throat.
- No, I'm fine. You go back to sleep.

424
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,722
We're gonna get there tomorrow, Francis.

425
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,470
So, I'm...
I'm at this fundraiser.

426
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,598
It's a beautiful house
on the beach in Amagansett,

427
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:37,938
and I've been dancing all night
with this incredible girl,

428
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,898
way out of my league.

429
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,734
But it's late, very late,

430
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,655
and I'm a very responsible
young man, so...

431
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:50,241
I sneak upstairs to get my jacket.

432
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,038
But lo and behold...

433
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,748
she's following me.

434
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,837
And I see my reflection
in the hallway mirror and...

435
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,049
I'm just sweating like a pig.

436
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,635
My heart's racing.

437
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,847
And she walks up behind me.

438
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,478
And as I turn...

439
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,482
I see the moonlight on her face...

440
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,902
and everything just slows down.

441
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,576
And that's how we met.

442
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,705
Me and Hannah.

443
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,253
Well, I'm glad to hear
I'm not the only one up this late.

444
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,339
Mr. President,
do you have a question for me?

445
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,175
No, I don't.
But I thought I would give you the chance

446
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,012
to ask me a question. Just one.

447
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,098
I'm not sure I have any questions for you.

448
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,433
Oh, don't be shy, Will.

449
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,602
I mean, after all,
this is a rare opportunity.

450
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:01,980
Just between you and me.

451
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,899
It's just you and me
and all the other Americans out there

452
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,210
having trouble sleeping tonight.

453
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:10,655
Well, that's because they know that
tomorrow's vote will decide their future.

454
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,740
So that's the question then, isn't it?

455
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,285
Who does the future belong to?

456
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,121
Well, I don't think anyone
but God can answer that one.

457
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,624
All we can do is make a case
for ourselves while we're here.

458
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,253
Okay.

459
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,714
Here's my question.

460
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:35,638
I successfully negotiated the release
of Caroline and Melissa Miller.

461
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:37,432
Then you stepped in.

462
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:41,852
You didn't let me finish the job. Why?

463
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,773
Do you really want me
to answer that question, Will?

464
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:49,027
- Because I'm not sure you do.
- Oh, I do.

465
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,159
Because they knew they could take
advantage of you. They saw it.

466
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,287
- How's that, sir?
- They felt it.

467
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,331
Whatever happened to you overseas,

468
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,459
there's no reason to feel
guilty or ashamed.

469
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,796
I served my country. I did what I did...

470
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,716
because it's what I had to do.

471
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,719
Not like some others.

472
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,724
I've been in public office
my entire adult life, Will.

473
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,645
The truth is,
I went to school with guys like you.

474
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,690
Good looking guys with good intentions...

475
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,693
just like you.

476
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,403
And I mean that sincerely.

477
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,616
And I want you to know
that whatever happens tomorrow,

478
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,659
I never doubted your intentions.

479
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,375
Must be late for you, Mr. President.
Get some sleep.

480
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,504
Oh, I doubt either of us
will be getting much sleep tonight.

481
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,549
- But thank you for taking my call.
- Well, thank you for calling.

482
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,229
Now, there's only one more question,
and it's a big one.

483
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,148
And you're gonna have
to answer it yourselves.

484
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,942
Who's gonna be the next President
of the United States?

485
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,245
I know who I'm voting for.

486
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,791
I'd like to thank everyone who made
the last 24 hours possible.

487
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,918
All the... the technicians and crew.

488
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,464
And if we all work together
the way they have, then I promise,

489
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,677
we will truly make this
the first of many, many new days

490
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,012
for the greatest country in the world.

491
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,935
Good morning, America.
God bless America, and thank you.

492
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,524
And we're out. Okay, guys.

493
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,242
You did great.

494
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:03,869
- You did it.
- Yeah.

495
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,914
Everyone is so pleased.

496
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,674
I know it was tough,
but you got through it.

497
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:23,306
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you.

498
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,106
Just some questions
that I needed to answer.

499
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:36,194
I know. But you did it. You did it.

500
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,912
- Great job. Great.
- That was great.

501
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,373
- Amazing.
- Thank you.

502
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,258
Testing, testing. One, two, three.

503
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,802
Testing. One, two, three.

504
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,681
Uh, a little more gain.
A skosh more reverb.

505
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,355
Uh, testing, testing, testing.
That's good. That's good. Mmm.

506
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:18,152
I would like to thank the American people
for their overwhelming support tonight.

507
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,239
As your next president,
I do not take this mandate lightly.

508
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,075
In fact... it is heavy as hell.

509
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,495
You got a better chance
than Underwood does.

510
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,878
Those are very high heels, Bridget.

511
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,215
When Underwood loses,
the committee goes away.

512
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,718
You're breaking my heart.

513
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,265
I was looking forward to hearing
what you had to say about Doug Stamper.

514
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,988
Yeah, I was looking forward to saying it.

515
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,603
I came here to thank you.

516
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,024
I took it down... off the Internet.

517
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,280
It's weird, talking to you about this.
I mean...

518
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,366
uh, you saw it.

519
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,456
- My brother could've seen that.
- Do I remind you of your brother?

520
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,795
- He's a little more present.
- Well, it's my job to look ahead.

521
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,798
Hmm. Good luck with that.

522
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,903
- Thank you so very much.
- Thank you, sir.

523
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,988
Oh.

524
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,501
- We have the overnight numbers.
- Give me the outliers.

525
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,463
Minus two in New York.
Plus two in New Hampshire. Both not bad.

526
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,049
"Half-empty, half-full" is an expression
I have never cared for.

527
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,885
The call you made last night,
it's helping.

528
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,321
We grabbed the headlines this morning.

529
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,638
- Doug?
- Yes, sir.

530
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,266
I want you to reach out to Sally Ann back
in Gaffney and get me the turnout so far.

531
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,101
I can get you the numbers
for the state.

532
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,855
No, I don't want that.
I want the Gaffney turnout.

533
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:20,358
State numbers come in,
you give them to us as they come.

534
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,241
Anything out of the ordinary,
you let us know.

535
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,987
Other than that, we're done.
Oh, and, Doug?

536
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,366
- Yes, sir.
- You'll know where to find us.

537
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,706
You're worried
about the crowd we just saw.

538
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,628
Not the size. Their enthusiasm.

539
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,220
I don't think so.

540
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,141
Jerry, I'm gonna have to call you back.

541
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,645
This is 9:00 a.m. turnout
in our base precincts or swing?

542
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,188
Base.

543
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,606
Shit.

544
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,045
I've got different numbers.
You're gonna need...

545
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,071
I did confirm. Twice.

546
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,412
Doug, it's me.
Call me as soon as you get this.

547
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,459
You handle just automobile insurance
or all kinds?

548
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,462
All kinds.
Fire, earthquake, theft, public liability.

549
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,590
Group insurance, industrial stuff,
and so on right down the line.

550
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,841
Accident insurance?

551
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,384
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

552
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,823
Wish you'd tell me what's engraved
on that anklet.

553
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,182
- Just my name.
- As for instance?

554
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,520
- Phyllis.
- Phyllis, huh? I think I like that.

555
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,439
Let's do this one.

556
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,274
I'd drive it around the block
a couple of times.

557
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,820
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by tomorrow
evening around 8:30? He'll be in then.

558
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,280
- Who?
- My husband.

559
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,092
You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

560
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,159
Yeah, I was. But, uh...

561
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,555
I'm sort of getting over the idea,
if you know what I mean.

562
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,706
There's a speed limit
in this state, Mr. Neff.

563
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,165
Forty-five miles an hour.

564
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,544
- How fast was I going, Officer?
- I'd say around 90.

565
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,963
Suppose you get off that motorcycle
and give me a ticket.

566
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,090
So I'd let you off
with a warning this time.

567
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:09,884
Suppose it doesn't take.

568
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,767
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

569
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,746
Suppose I burst out crying
and put my head on your shoulder.

570
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,590
Suppose you try putting that
on my husband's shoulders.

571
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,810
That tears it.

572
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,899
I'm just not in the mood...

573
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,210
Oh, no. Come on, it's tradition.
If Doug needs us, he'll call.

574
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,154
Yes, but it's different this time.
There's so much going on...

575
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,757
- I know, but call me superstitious.
- We're in here.

576
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,742
But we have done this
every election we have ever won.

577
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,286
- Come on.
- I wonder if I know what you mean.

578
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,288
I wonder if you wonder.

579
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,126
It was a hot afternoon,

580
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:47,547
and I still remember the smell
of honeysuckle all down that street.

581
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,941
How could I have known that murder...

582
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,718
Can sometimes smell
like honeysuckle?

583
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,082
Maybe you would've known, Keyes,

584
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,739
the minute she mentioned
accident insurance.

585
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,183
But I didn't. I felt like a million.

586
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,434
Yes.

587
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,437
I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.

588
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:06,356
Well, what do you mean they don't match?

589
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,193
In my home state?

590
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:15,575
Well, you and LeAnn
better get over here right now.

591
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,242
What's the matter?

592
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,471
There's something wrong
with the numbers in the precincts

593
00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:22,873
that we're getting from this morning.
They don't match up.

594
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,543
It's never happened
before in South Carolina.

595
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,717
- Well, you have nothing to say about that?
- Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.

596
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,802
Oh, you don't believe that for a second.

597
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,723
I can't win with you.

598
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,476
No matter what I say.

599
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,606
How many times did you walk me home?

600
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,065
What?

601
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,738
Oh, I don't know. Probably a handful.

602
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:58,868
No, it wasn't a handful.
It was 18... in a month.

603
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,333
It was on my way home.

604
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,170
- And what are you saying?
- Nothing. It was on my way home.

605
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,922
No, it wasn't just on your way home.

606
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,593
We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.
It was closed. It was freezing that day.

607
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,552
- Yeah.
- And this was on in your room.

608
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,723
- It was.
- And I asked you to kiss me.

609
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,726
- I made you kiss me.
- No, you didn't make me kiss you.

610
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,394
I wanted to kiss you.

611
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,734
And anyway, I knew we were gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

612
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,278
And we are.

613
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,238
No regrets, no matter what.

614
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,035
What does that mean? What do you
mean by that, "no matter what"?

615
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,120
- You think we're gonna lose?
- No!

616
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,415
No.

617
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:58,427
- Are we together?
- Yes, we're together. No matter what...

618
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,471
No, not "no matter what."
Are we together?

619
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,225
We're together, Francis.

620
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,270
Then don't ever bring up losing
around me again.

621
00:44:08,353 --> 00:44:11,774
- That's the boy.
- Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

622
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,321
What kind of an outfit is this, anyway?

623
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,966
Are we an insurance company
or just a bunch of dim-witted amateurs

624
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,259
to write a policy on a mug like that?

625
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,886
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

626
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,245
The turnout in Philly
is lower than they're saying.

627
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,957
- How much lower?
- 30% in our key precincts.

628
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,875
Thirty? How?

629
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,770
It's not just Pennsylvania.
People aren't voting.

630
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,920
Their people, our people.

631
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,756
Wait. If Conway's got Pennsylvania,
then he's got Ohio.

632
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,842
If he's got Ohio, then we lose.

633
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,593
- How did this happen?
- I'll tell them.

634
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,595
That is one thing you are not doing.

635
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,475
That was all there was to it.

636
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,228
Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.

637
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,646
There was nothing to give us away.

638
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:55,275
And yet, Keyes, as I was
walking down the street to the drugstore,

639
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,863
suddenly it came over me
that everything would go wrong.

640
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,991
It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.

641
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,284
I couldn't hear my own footsteps.

642
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,915
It was the walk of a dead man.

643
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:16,046
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes.

644
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,841
And the next day was worse
when the story broke in the papers.

645
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,011
They started talking
about it at the office.

646
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,180
And the day after that,
when you started digging into it.

647
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,268
I kept my hands in my pockets because
I thought they were shaking.

648
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,686
I put on dark glasses
so people couldn't see my eyes,

649
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:35,524
then I took them off again so they
wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.

650
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,652
- I tried to hold myself together but...
- Thank you.

651
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,571
...I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.

652
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,456
Get me Sally Ann in the Cherokee County
clerk's office in South Carolina.

653
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,875
I'll hold.

654
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:59,631
They overestimated the turnouts
in Pennsylvania by 30%.

655
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,345
Hi! Hi, y'all.

656
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,389
Well, now, do not call me "sir."

657
00:46:07,472 --> 00:46:11,018
This is Francis Underwood.
We've known each other too long for that.

658
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,772
So, Sally, how was turnout today?

659
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,943
Well, I was just really actually
looking for Cherokee County.

660
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:23,780
Yes, I just wanted to hear it for myself.

661
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,701
Great. Thank you.

662
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,787
And we send our love
to Henry and the boys.

663
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,372
Goodbye.

664
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,546
- It's low.
- What do you mean, "low"?

665
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,470
Low.

666
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,569
- I was thinking about that anklet.
- And what are you thinking about now?

667
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:08,945
I'm all through thinking, baby.

668
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,368
- I just came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye? Where are you going?

669
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,911
You're the one
that's going, baby. Not me.

670
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,539
I'm getting off the trolley car
right at this corner.

671
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,167
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:26,338
All right, I'll tell you.
Friend of mine's got a funny theory...

673
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,423
You know what this means, don't you?

674
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,218
This is our house.

675
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,471
We are not leaving.

676
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,552
The last stop's a cemetery.
