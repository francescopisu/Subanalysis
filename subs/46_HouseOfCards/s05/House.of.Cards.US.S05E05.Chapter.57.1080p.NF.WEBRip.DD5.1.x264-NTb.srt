1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,592
Not my president!
Not my president!

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,512
- Not my president!
- Not my president!

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,557
- Not my president!
- Not my president!

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,940
The people are angry.

5
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,651
Nine weeks ago,
we had an election in this country,

6
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,446
but because two states refused to certify,

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,741
neither Conway nor myself
received the 270 electoral votes

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,410
required for victory.

9
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:40,290
So they gather here every morning
to exercise their magnificent right,

10
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,792
guaranteed by the First Amendment...

11
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,879
to let their angry voices be heard.

12
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:54,179
And so, Thanksgiving, Christmas,
and half of January have come and gone,

13
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,307
and all three branches of government
are in crisis.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,101
The Congress is in disarray,

15
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,019
the Supreme Court is down a justice
and doomed to deadlock,

16
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,190
and the executive branch
is without a boss.

17
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,528
You see, my feeling is, I think
the Founding Fathers, they just got tired.

18
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,823
And really, can you blame them?
I mean, you can't think of everything.

19
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,700
Black swans, Murphy's Law.

20
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:17,511
I mean, at a certain point,
you just have to sign off

21
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,081
and cross your goddamn fingers
and hope for the best.

22
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,916
Or adopt "flipism,"

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,003
a pseudo-philosophy of life
in which the most important decisions

24
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,714
are made by the flipping of a coin.

25
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,550
It was first introduced
in the Disney comic book

26
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,427
Flip Decision, one of my favorites,

27
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,597
in which Donald Duck
is persuaded by Professor Batty

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,601
to make all the most important decisions
based on the flipping of a coin.

29
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,980
"Life is but a gamble.
Let flipism guide your ramble."

30
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,318
We've had this sort of trouble before.

31
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,696
The election of 1800,
Jefferson versus Burr.

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,533
They wound up in a tie.
73 electoral votes each.

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,827
That was the number required then,
and that's when Congress

34
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,748
tried to address what the Founding Fathers
just couldn't imagine.

35
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:07,043
And, poof, the Twelfth Amendment was born.

36
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,880
And it says
that if the states don't certify,

37
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:13,175
it's the House that chooses the president

38
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,427
and the Senate that chooses
the vice president.

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,820
Now the House is a bit of a mess,

40
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:19,639
but the Senate is rather democratic
in how they choose the VP.

41
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,558
One person, one vote.

42
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,436
But if there's a tie...

43
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,523
and this is where Donald Duck comes in,
it's resolved...

44
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,024
by the toss of a coin.

45
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,652
A solution that's elegant as hell.

46
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,113
But then there's no elegance
in modern politics. It's mostly hell.

47
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:42,412
The identity of the next President
of these United States

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,498
is once again in the hands
of a bunch of self-serving,

49
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,126
money-hungry, boot-licking,
power-seeking politicians

50
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,548
who can be seduced or sucker punched
or blackmailed into submission.

51
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,802
And all I need is just one more vote
than the other guy.

52
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,808
As you can see,
the Founding Fathers didn't plan for this.

53
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,103
But I did.

54
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,820
Meet your new daddy.

55
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,433
Right.

56
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,603
You can feel it, right?
It's like you're there.

57
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,524
Doesn't that look just like it?

58
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,068
To me, it is that place.

59
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,955
- You okay, man?

60
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,416
Huh? Yeah. Of course.

61
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,210
It really helps. Very effective.

62
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:39,464
Yeah. I'd be happy to help you
find more funding for it.

63
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,635
If you're feeling a little worked up...

64
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,761
What?

65
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,390
Little worked up?

66
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,935
I was elected President
of the United States over two months ago.

67
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,522
But somehow,
Congress is now deciding the election.

68
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,482
So forgive me for being a little...

69
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,733
- Will...
- ...worked up.

70
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,861
I don't think Tony was implying anything.

71
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,739
Of course. Good.

72
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,867
I'm gonna get myself ready.

73
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,762
I don't want to go to the event
looking like this.

74
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,203
Right.

75
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,998
Thanks, Tony.

76
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,841
Romero's chief of staff
insists he's not in town.

77
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,718
- And do you believe her?
- No.

78
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,054
But she's been in D.C. longer than he has.

79
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,698
At some point she'll take care of herself.

80
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,534
Well, did you tell her
I have no interest in discussing

81
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,643
the Declaration of War Committee with him?

82
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,938
I expressed our desire for a civil and
productive meeting with the Congressman.

83
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,941
Well, find him. If he wants to hide
from me, he can do it to my face.

84
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,443
Yes, sir.

85
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,277
Oh, and, Doug.

86
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,074
How many protestors are out there today?

87
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,576
More than yesterday.

88
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,421
But they're doing their best to divert
them away from the White House.

89
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,582
I don't know what's worse...

90
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,045
the sound of their chanting
or the sound of silence when they're not.

91
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,341
I'll get to work, sir.

92
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:32,827
Good morning, Augustus.

93
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,038
Well, Eric, I...

94
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.
They told me to sit, but, uh...

95
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,586
Oh, no, no, no. It's perfectly fine. I...

96
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,963
I can't imagine anyone else who would...

97
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,676
well, enjoy this more than you.

98
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,181
You know, I only started it
after you and I met in Spotsylvania.

99
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,309
The attention to detail is... It's just...

100
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,645
It is, yes.

101
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,733
I've got...

102
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,902
I mean, I...

103
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:12,324
I'm sorry, I'm a...
a little overwhelmed by the moment.

104
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,910
It's just...

105
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,705
I have this feeling, as if, uh...

106
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,374
I've imagined this somehow.

107
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,586
I know that sounds, uh...

108
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,342
Uh, you've even got the button
on his haversack.

109
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,511
Yes.

110
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,389
I think people underestimate...

111
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,977
the importance of detail...

112
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,980
to the overall impact.

113
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:48,360
Yeah.

114
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,239
The Bloody Angle experts
would be very impressed.

115
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,328
When we met in Spotsylvania,
how did you know...

116
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:02,166
so many specific things
about Augustus, uh...

117
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,003
about Augustus Underwood's death?
I mean, the very spot where he died?

118
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,881
The... the fact that his skull
had been crushed with a rock?

119
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,426
That they buried him in an unmarked grave?
I mean...

120
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,262
the detail of all that.

121
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,600
Hope you'll forgive me, uh...

122
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:20,517
For?

123
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,772
I was meeting
Vice President Francis Underwood.

124
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,150
I... thought he deserved a good story.

125
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,825
Oh...
Wait, wait a minute. You...

126
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,580
- you made all that up?
- Well...

127
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,458
- I took some liberties.

128
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,340
But, well, I don't know, once it started,
it came to me so clearly...

129
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,682
- It's Eric, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

130
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,151
The crowd?

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,824
Yes. I'm sorry,
what were you about to say?

132
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,454
I don't mean to overstep, sir...

133
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,042
but the people out there...

134
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,794
I don't care what they're saying.

135
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,756
And the way I see it,
a person's destiny is, you know...

136
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,050
sealed.

137
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,178
We are in uncharted territory here.

138
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,597
All right. But, Donny,
do me a favor, okay?

139
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,241
- Let the Constitution...
- Can I finish?

140
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,684
Hold on.
Just let the Constitution do its job.

141
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,162
Okay, Joe, Joe, I'm gonna finish for once.

142
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,897
You've got voters
filing individual suits...

143
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,708
- Right. That's fine.
- ...in Tennessee and Ohio,

144
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,251
and they are jammed up
in the Supreme Court.

145
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,612
Like everything else, the day-to-day
workings of this country are on hold.

146
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,490
Okay, they may be on hold, but guess what?
Last time I checked,

147
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,242
everybody was still getting
their Social Security checks.

148
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,055
- Yeah, but if the debt limit is reached?
- Oh, come on. Let me finish now.

149
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,498
Again, it's why we have a Constitution.

150
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,044
I know it looks messy. Democracy's messy.
But guess what?

151
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,505
There is a method
to that madness.

152
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,816
I don't know, Joe.
It's more madness than method right now.

153
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,318
I mean, if the government does shut down,

154
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,469
those Social Security checks,
they might not go out.

155
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,014
If the government shuts down, who knows
if Congress can even pick a president?

156
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,183
Each state in the House
just gets one vote.

157
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,977
So if smaller states
like Delaware and Rhode Island

158
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,521
can't reach a consensus...

159
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,731
- Right.
- No, it's true. I mean, if one or two

160
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,942
of these really stubborn
members of Congress

161
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,753
decides they're going to hold this up,
it could be months.

162
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,780
Look, that's what I'm saying.
The road to 26 votes is not an easy one.

163
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,950
All right. Strange days indeed, Mika.

164
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,290
So are these the start to short stories?

165
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,251
Mmm-hmm.

166
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,712
They're nothing yet. Fragments.

167
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,173
Pieces.

168
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,928
I mean, clearly, this is about me.

169
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,139
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, this is my mother.

170
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,100
- Mmm-hmm.
- And this is us.

171
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,603
- You can't write...
- I'm writing.

172
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,149
It's what I do. I'm a writer.

173
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,912
- I know you're frustrated, Tom, but...
- I wouldn't say frustrated.

174
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,486
Well, it's invasive.

175
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,699
- Write about your own experiences.
- This is my experience.

176
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,118
Listen, Tom,

177
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,620
just because we've decided
Francis and I need to stay here,

178
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:27,704
doesn't mean you have to.

179
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,433
So if you have things you need to do,
you should go ahead and do them.

180
00:12:30,457 --> 00:12:33,544
I'll be spending my day
convincing the Senate to vote for me,

181
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,379
so there's no speeches necessary.

182
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,090
Yeah, okay.

183
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,426
You know what?
I do have some things to do.

184
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,845
Some people I need to check in with. So...

185
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,388
Tom.

186
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,016
- Yeah?

187
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,184
Yes?

188
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,812
...You ready, Mrs. Underwood?

189
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,402
I'll have a car waiting for you.

190
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,289
So do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

191
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,707
Always the bad.

192
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,002
The president's approvals are down to 19%.

193
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,504
And the good?

194
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,424
They're worse for Congress.
And you're at 30.

195
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,721
Well, thankfully it's Congress
we have to convince now, not the public.

196
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,266
These are the remaining senators
we'll target before the vote.

197
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,517
All women, by the way.

198
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,897
The biggest challenges will be
Indiana's freshman senator Susan Newman.

199
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,858
Mmm. The constitutional lawyer?

200
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,901
Uh-huh. And Hawaii's Kerry Kuilima,

201
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,154
who seems to be enjoying
getting to wield a little power for once.

202
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,368
I need to tell you,
there is a lot of pushback on the Hill

203
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,912
about the simultaneous vote
for president and VP.

204
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,741
The country is terrified it'll lead
to a split ticket.

205
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:54,876
There's threats of a filibuster.

206
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,420
Well, the Dems won the Senate,
and they want to vote when the House does.

207
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,922
That decision's been made.

208
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,593
And the vice president
won't allow a filibuster of any kind

209
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,387
onto the floor.

210
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,056
Ma'am, have you contemplated
how it could possibly work,

211
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,142
you as vice president to President Conway?

212
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,852
That's not going to happen.

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,732
Of course.

214
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,698
I did learn one true thing
about Augustus Underwood.

215
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,075
What?

216
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,620
He was dead. Cold.

217
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,208
They put him on a cart...
bunch of dead bodies to bury.

218
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,545
Then, after a full day and night...

219
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,132
he woke up.

220
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,634
What?

221
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,972
Someone stole his shoes
and the buttons off his uniform, but...

222
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,558
he lived.

223
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,937
Few days later,
he caught up to his regiment.

224
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,066
Really?

225
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,826
I have to get back to the madness.

226
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,329
I hope I get to see you again,
Mr. President.

227
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:29,095
Eric... what do you do
when you're not, uh... reenacting?

228
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,846
I'm an actor.

229
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,490
Uh, sometimes. I mean,
I'd do a lot more if someone would let me.

230
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,394
So, right now,
I'm mostly a personal trainer.

231
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,730
- A personal trainer?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,820
- You know where to find me.
- Uh, and, sir...

233
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,824
no matter how dire things look...

234
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,785
you're gonna come out of this alive.

235
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,664
You're an Underwood, after all.

236
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,968
No, don't...
don't "chief-of-staff" me, Eleanor.

237
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,553
No, don't give me his schedule.
I don't want to hear

238
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,348
about how Congressman Romero
is meeting with his constituents

239
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,558
- or stuck on an Acela train.

240
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,773
You know, it's Fazio, right?
The pronunciation?

241
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,608
Eleanor Fazio?

242
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,318
I... I just want to be sure.

243
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,862
Because when the president wins,
and he is going to win,

244
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,531
I will remember your name.

245
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,910
I still need you to review this release.

246
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,830
Now, obviously, the goal is to combat
the "hiding out" narrative,

247
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,748
emphasizing the work that they're doing.

248
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,629
- Is it a personal matter?
- Business. It's always business.

249
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,381
I'll e-mail you my sign off.

250
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,926
Wait a second. I need an update
on their schedule for tomorrow.

251
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,762
- We're almost there.
- I want to know how you found out.

252
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:56,449
If he needs help, that can happen
after he makes it to the White House.

253
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,033
Mark, you're not answering my question.

254
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,912
If word of treatment,
any kind of treatment, got out...

255
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,979
His friend was showing him
the therapy. That's it.

256
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,692
- Please don't insult me.
- Who do you think you are?

257
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,236
Inserting yourself
into every aspect of our lives.

258
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,697
Your husband's campaign needed help.
Help arrived.

259
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,033
- Yes, but...
- Help that you, most of all, pushed for.

260
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,784
...Yes?

261
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,329
- Who told you about the VR therapy?
- He did.

262
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,748
Let's go.

263
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,042
What's going on?

264
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,796
I was just telling Mark
how much I miss having Marshall around.

265
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:28,964
Well, he's still around.

266
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,764
Where are you going?

267
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,183
I forgot my bag.

268
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,767
It's right here.

269
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,396
Hello. Yeah.

270
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,190
Yes, sir, he's right here.

271
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,901
- It's him.
- Ah.

272
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,697
Congressman.

273
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,244
- You have no idea how bad this could get.
- We don't wanna be late.

274
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,329
Well, I couldn't agree more.

275
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:09,796
She might have gone to Santa Fe.

276
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,928
You don't believe me, do you?

277
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,932
I would need to see something, Lisa.
Something concrete.

278
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,727
I have a photo. I have one, but...

279
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
Listen.

280
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,317
Look at me.

281
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,113
You're not the first person
to come here making false claims

282
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,299
- about Underwood and his cronies.
- But I'm telling the truth.

283
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,260
Everything you're saying
you could've read in the paper.

284
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,744
That's how I realized who he was.
His picture in the paper.

285
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:44,080
Which makes your story harder to prove.
We're talking in circles.

286
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,559
What about Doug Stamper driving me home
when my car broke down,

287
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,461
telling me his name was Peter
and that he sold insurance?

288
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,505
- No one can corroborate that story.
- Rachel!

289
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,300
Rachel could.

290
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,308
- You should finish that.
- I'm not hungry.

291
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,059
Maybe I am. I don't know.

292
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,854
I want to thank you for reaching out.

293
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,448
I am not saying I don't believe you.

294
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,285
But there's already enough evidence
out there to take the president down.

295
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,912
And now, with this election,
he'll be accountable for even more.

296
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,081
- I'm certain of it.
- I don't care.

297
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,378
I don't care about Underwood.
I want you to talk to Doug Stamper.

298
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,630
I want you to find out
what happened to my...

299
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,967
Whatever, forget it.

300
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,428
- Uh. Hold on.
- Thanks for the sandwich.

301
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,308
All right. Hold on.

302
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,988
There's a story
that I love about LBJ.

303
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,242
Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.

304
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,953
A congressman was ducking him...
and he came back to his office

305
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:07,873
to find the president
sitting in his chair...

306
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,082
waiting for him.

307
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:14,546
The president expects to see you
within the hour.

308
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:19,134
Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.

309
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,764
- He was wearing his cowboy hat.
- What?

310
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,977
President Johnson.
You left out the best part of the story.

311
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,043
We closed the place down last night.
Thanks for the invite.

312
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,046
Bunch of us are headed back to
the same spot tonight, if you wanna come.

313
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,716
Cool. Uh, he has a late lunch today.
Won't be back till 4:00.

314
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,760
- Oh, I just needed to drop this for him.
- Sure.

315
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,763
Next time, just ask.

316
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,890
See you tonight.

317
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,152
You gambled and you lost.

318
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,698
Actually, my bloc gained seats
more than eight weeks ago.

319
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,201
- Which I suspect is why I'm here.
- Don't overestimate your position.

320
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,119
Or underestimate mine.

321
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,931
You still haven't been
elected president, sir.

322
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,626
Yeah, but the presidency won't matter once
the party turns its back on you, will it?

323
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,172
When Bob Birch puts all the rest
of your sheep in line,

324
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:42,008
you'll be begging
to come in from the cold.

325
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,928
And two years from now,
you'll be back in Phoenix

326
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:48,474
replaying this very moment
over and over again in your mind

327
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,352
and realizing
it was the beginning of the end.

328
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,812
Patricia Whittaker
and the Democratic Party

329
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,522
will wipe their hands of you.

330
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,649
- I'm loyal to the party.
- As you should be.

331
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,318
As you should say.

332
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,695
But really...

333
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,865
what's your leverage?

334
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:10,286
The committee? That's done.
You see, you've already put out, Alex,

335
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,623
and Will Conway
is not taking you to the prom.

336
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,251
My conversations with the governor and
any position that I may or may not have...

337
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,587
Oh, listen to yourself.
Do you even believe you?

338
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,840
You are awfully confident for someone
who's already lost the election once.

339
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,012
Do me a favor.
Forget the presidency for just a moment.

340
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,472
You don't have...

341
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:35,061
the capital to build on the congressional
revolution that you've started,

342
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,499
- politically or otherwise.
- Our movement wants to explode things...

343
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,859
Oh, please.
Spare me your progressive PR bullshit.

344
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,488
You want what they all want.

345
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,117
Access. A better seat at the table.

346
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,870
Your name before the rest.

347
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,958
And that is something that I can give you.

348
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,960
And how many votes
do you want in exchange?

349
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,672
Just three from your ever-growing bloc

350
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,758
would assure me the win
in key delegations.

351
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,427
Specifically?

352
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,638
Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire
are still in play.

353
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,182
All three?

354
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,231
I believe in you, Congressman.
Do you wanna know why?

355
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,316
Tell me.

356
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,487
- Because I trust ambition.

357
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:30,366
- So this is a straight-up bribe.
- Oh, no, Congressman.

358
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,994
A bribe is something you can refuse.

359
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,668
Now, since you haven't been around
the block as many times as I have,

360
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,228
let me walk you through how this works.

361
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,839
Excuse me, Mr. President,
but I do know how this is done.

362
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,381
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

363
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,970
I'll start with Maine.
She owes me.

364
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,308
You know, we did meet
once before, Mr. President.

365
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,811
At a dinner, during the 2012 convention.

366
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,689
- I tried to introduce myself to you...
- And?

367
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,068
- You don't remember, do you?
- Why would I?

368
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,867
Why is the moderator
so interested in Brockhart's opinion?

369
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,510
Has everyone suddenly forgotten
now I'm at the top of the ticket?

370
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,787
No, of course not.

371
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,082
Are we done here?

372
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,668
Yeah. We should talk about
tomorrow's schedule.

373
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,631
Uh, vote's looking good now.

374
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,592
We still need to talk to as many
congressmen as we can.

375
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,355
Well, you figure it out
and give us a call.

376
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:33,054
And, uh, enough with the events
targeting the Armed Services.

377
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,516
We got as many Congress people
as we could get out of this.

378
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,144
No offense, General, but we need
to divide and conquer. Okay?

379
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,730
Will, I was speaking with Mark...

380
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,525
- Yeah.
- ...and I want you to know,

381
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,318
if you need to talk about anything,
I'm available.

382
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,494
The only support I need, General...

383
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,290
is that of a vice president
to his president. Okay?

384
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,137
Senator Talbert's priorities
are affordable housing

385
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,098
and closing corporate tax loopholes.

386
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,685
And access to higher education especially.

387
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,853
- The call is in ten.
- Mmm.

388
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,022
Why did Aidan Macallan run away?

389
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,859
What?

390
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,654
Why did Macallan run away?

391
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,656
I wish I could tell you.

392
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:36,492
Clock's ticking.

393
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,171
Yes, give me Tom Yates'
driver's number, please.

394
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,144
Yes.

395
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,856
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,149
New York.

397
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,944
You drove all the way to New York?

398
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,112
Where?

399
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,573
Who's he with?

400
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,952
I don't know. A woman. Older.

401
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,539
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.

402
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,210
Yes. Yes, I'll try.

403
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,596
No, I understand your concern, Senator.

404
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,976
Student loan reform is a priority for you,

405
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,603
so it will be a priority
for the president and me.

406
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,440
Yes. Yes, I do.

407
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,113
Well, Louise,
you as a pillar of the party,

408
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,449
it will be much appreciated
if I can get your help tomorrow.

409
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,119
And it'll just be you and me
and a couple of your...

410
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,455
female colleagues in the Senate.

411
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,460
Okay, well, I look forward
to a productive dialogue.

412
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,403
- Better late than never.
- Sorry I missed dinner.

413
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,911
...Why the back?

414
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,706
I'm pretending you're an Uber.
Just help me out.

415
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,750
My sister-in-law.
She came when you couldn't.

416
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,654
Do you think the dead judge us?

417
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,249
No.

418
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,926
What did he do
that you liked the most?

419
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:26,056
Here... in bed.

420
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,316
Sitting up was the best.

421
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,987
Legs around each other.

422
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:48,954
He'd run his right hand up the back
of my neck into my hair and pull it.

423
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,122
My hair and my head back...

424
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,461
And?

425
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,552
And with the other hand,
he'd pull me in and out.

426
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,891
Always looking at me.

427
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,769
Seeing me.

428
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,945
You want me to do that?

429
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,076
Yeah.

430
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,258
It's so nice in here.
You can hardly hear them.

431
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,177
Oh, trust me, I can hear them.

432
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,848
With New Hampshire, it's what?

433
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,684
Twenty-four. With Maine, 25.

434
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,730
- Twenty-six if we get Wisconsin.
- Where's Tom?

435
00:30:57,813 --> 00:30:59,815
He needed to get some air.

436
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,028
- Wisconsin is being stubborn.
- Then who else?

437
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,491
Iowa, maybe Colorado, 24, 25.

438
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,538
How was your
great-great-great-grandfather Augustus?

439
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,082
He goes by Eric.

440
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,044
Eric.

441
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,838
He admired my craftsmanship.

442
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,261
- We should make a play for North Dakota.
- Agreed.

443
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,806
In the Senate, I think you can
swing some votes from Missouri.

444
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,268
Did you ask LeAnn about Macallan?

445
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,687
She didn't know anything. I believe her.

446
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:41,482
We have to quit again.

447
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,029
Otherwise, they'll kill us.

448
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,085
No Macallan.
He was there, though. Left his belongings.

449
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,379
Anything from the National Police?

450
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:08,301
No. CIA's man in the palace
isn't even sure he's still in Jakarta.

451
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,803
They'll find him, LeAnn.
That's all I can give you.

452
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:11,930
I appreciate your help.

453
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,246
Kerry, Susan, what can I get you?

454
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,872
- I'm fine, thanks.
- I'm good with water.

455
00:32:20,896 --> 00:32:23,399
- What about you, Louise?
- What are you having?

456
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,321
- Splash of vodka on ice.
- Make it two.

457
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,283
Susan and I were talking
on the way over, Claire.

458
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,996
This election mess has left us all
facing some scary possibilities.

459
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,748
- Conway wins in the House...
- Which is far from inevitable.

460
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,042
But if a split ticket were to happen...

461
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,835
it would be
bad for this country.

462
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,588
No, Conway is what
would be bad for this country.

463
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,635
Let's hope the House does the right thing.
But as far as the Senate,

464
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,513
I am very grateful that we have
Donald Blythe steering that ship.

465
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:58,309
Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this,
but no matter what you're offering here,

466
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:03,939
I can't support the president.
And, by extension, I can't support you.

467
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,109
It's not you, Claire. It's him.

468
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,570
Susan and I
are on the same page about this.

469
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,740
What if this isn't about
Francis Underwood, huh?

470
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,995
It's Claire Underwood
who has the promising future.

471
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,541
I want a woman in the White House.

472
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,627
And if she has to start
as a vice president, fine.

473
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,920
But it's time.

474
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:32,843
- It's time.
- I hear that, Louise, but I'll say it...

475
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,138
A vote for you
is a vote for Frank Underwood.

476
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,725
Listen, I understand your concerns
about Francis' record. I do.

477
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,021
If Conway wins,

478
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,107
wouldn't you want a Democrat
to keep him in check?

479
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:52,488
And what if a vote for me
isn't necessarily a vote for Francis?

480
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:56,492
Twenty-one promised for you, sir.

481
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,995
Twenty-three for Conway. Two deadlocked.
Four unknown.

482
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,623
But I think things will shift
once they caucus.

483
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,709
- All right, let's bring him in.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,220
- Have a seat.
- I won't be long.

485
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,890
Well, then, stand like a man
who doesn't know whether to sit or not.

486
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,311
Congressman Romero,
do you have good news for me?

487
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,689
Have your progressives seen the light?

488
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:29,734
I did what I could, Mr. President.
I couldn't sway the bloc.

489
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,034
Couldn't... or wouldn't?

490
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,869
Maine and New Hampshire are noncommittal.

491
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,539
Congressman Wolcott
is turning Wisconsin for Conway.

492
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,547
Tell me a different truth.

493
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,509
They aren't listening to me.

494
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,886
They believe supporting you
would do more damage

495
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,223
to the Democratic Party and the country
than a Conway presidency.

496
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:07,147
Well, I am sorry that it has come to this.

497
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,318
As am I.
I'm sure we'll meet again, sir.

498
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,614
Yes, but before you go,
just take a look around this room.

499
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,410
Study every detail, every aspect.

500
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:26,791
Because this is the last time
you will ever step foot in here.

501
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,461
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

502
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,838
And to think you
could have made yourself memorable

503
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,757
in so many other ways.

504
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,561
I'll make sure
he never sees another committee, sir.

505
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,815
Oh, no. He wants us to put up a fight,
make him feel bigger.

506
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,318
He's just read some polls
and thinks I'm in trouble.

507
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,613
That's why he's coming after me.
All right, we have 48 hours.

508
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,241
I have to work Colorado
and shore up Tennessee.

509
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:06,080
But Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire
must be turned by any means necessary.

510
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,583
All caucusing will end
by noon on Thursday,

511
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,962
and then the vote in both the House
and the Senate is scheduled for 2:00.

512
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,257
Well... I don't make the decisions, Chuck.
I just relay them.

513
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,136
No. No, there will not be
a statement at this time.

514
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,515
Well, because there's nothing
to state until after the vote.

515
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,058
Close the door.

516
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,936
Right. Yes.

517
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,023
Yes.

518
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,610
Yeah, please don't make me say yes again.
Mmm-hmm.

519
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,489
Crazy days in these United States.

520
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,743
So you wanna tell me
what was so important

521
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,288
- I had to get you through the gates?
- Girl named Lisa Williams came in.

522
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,916
Says she was Rachel Posner's girlfriend.

523
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,461
...Said Doug Stamper knew Rachel.

524
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,672
Feels like maybe he was involved
in her disappearance.

525
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,883
And she said the words "Doug Stamper"?

526
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,676
Rachel Posner went missing around the time

527
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,680
Stamper was carjacked
and had his head bashed in.

528
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,223
And this Lisa thinks...

529
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,975
Well, she's not sure exactly.

530
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,812
- Well, can she prove a connection?
- It's all instinct at this point.

531
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,814
Come on.

532
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,984
You want a tour of the White House,
you could just straight up ask me for one.

533
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,531
- Hammerschmidt.
- Is he making anything of it?

534
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,117
Not yet. But the information about her
is on the top of his desk.

535
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,869
Lisa Williams.

536
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,384
Mr. Grayson,
you have a call on line three.

537
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,166
Well, I gotta get back to it.

538
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,252
If Tom follows up on her, let me know.

539
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,047
- Thanks for the pass.
- It's temporary.

540
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,219
Okay.

541
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,193
- LeAnn Harvey.
- Always burning the midnight oil.

542
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,862
- Aidan?
- You ready to join me?

543
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,492
Do you have any idea
how much jeopardy you have put me in?

544
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,578
You should've gotten out
when you had the chance.

545
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,663
You think you're out?

546
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:14,041
- Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
- Where are you?

547
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:19,004
Get the FBI, CIA, and whoever else
is looking for me to stop, now.

548
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,006
Okay, Aidan, you know, just...

549
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,593
come back here,
and we will figure this out together.

550
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:27,888
If they keep coming after me, I will start
leaking things about the Underwoods.

551
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,849
You don't wanna do that.

552
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,768
You have no idea
who you're working for, LeAnn.

553
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,063
God damn it.

554
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,878
You have an update for the president?

555
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,570
I've been juggling senators
most of the day.

556
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,029
And your congressman from Maine?

557
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:47,408
Is still my friend's father
and is still too busy to meet.

558
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,077
So was Wisconsin and New Hampshire,
until I forced them to.

559
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,912
You have your style, I have mine.

560
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,796
The president doesn't care
about style, LeAnn.

561
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,417
Just get the congressman
by the vote on Thursday.

562
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,768
Will just walked in.

563
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,852
Yeah.

564
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,105
Okay.

565
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,107
Talk soon. Bye.

566
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,783
- That your mom?
- Yeah. She sends her best.

567
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,117
Yeah, okay.

568
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,954
- Where's Charlie?
- In the living room.

569
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,294
Lily's playing in the den.

570
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,046
- Where are you going?
- I should change.

571
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,965
- You keep walking away from me, Hannah.
- Oh, please.

572
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:47,760
Why would you invite him here?

573
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,095
Now?

574
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,347
He's a friend. He's your friend.

575
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:57,687
And I thought maybe... it'd be something
that you'd be interested in looking at.

576
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,314
...I'm doing all I can.

577
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,524
- All you can?
- Yes.

578
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,420
Like doubt me? Like think that you know
better what's in my mind than I do?

579
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,837
You know, you're the one who told Mark.

580
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,988
I had to deny
I had anything to do with it.

581
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:12,326
See, these people, Hannah...
Usher and Marshall...

582
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,871
they're hired hands.
They can't be trusted.

583
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,517
And Brockhart, he's in it for himself.

584
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,670
But... but you, my darling, my love...

585
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,714
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

586
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,342
What are you gonna do?
Take the kids and go to your mom?

587
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,720
As if you would.

588
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,014
You already picked out
the White House china.

589
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,768
You want this more than anything.
To be president.

590
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,356
Don't you dare judge me
now that I want it, too.

591
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:54,660
Yes, Congressman,
but flights are considered bribes.

592
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:59,624
Yes, Congressman,
it's not your DUIs that concern us,

593
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,291
it's your daughter's.

594
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:07,172
Well, you should've done a better job
hiding the payouts. I mean, really.

595
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,595
Yes, I'm sure you are...
but how old was he again?

596
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,348
Yes, and he was in the choir,
is that right?

597
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:22,187
But you can never erase an e-mail,
even my dead aunt knows that.

598
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,107
Well, get back to me as soon as you can.

599
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,612
- So?
- Maine finally looks solid, sir.

600
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,406
New Hampshire doesn't, though.

601
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,495
I've been sitting in here for hours
busting my ass, getting some results.

602
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,915
We should have secured New Hampshire.
How did LeAnn get Maine?

603
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,583
She cashed in a favor.

604
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,752
Well, why couldn't you
do the same goddamn thing?

605
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,796
It doesn't make sense.

606
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,549
I thought I had him. I mean...

607
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,569
And it's not just New Hampshire.
Wisconsin should've folded.

608
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,928
Should have?

609
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,973
What's going on, Doug?
What's happening?

610
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:02,812
Is there some issue with your commitment?
Your loyalty?

611
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:03,896
What?

612
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,524
Perhaps you
just aren't worthy of my trust.

613
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,984
I have given everything to you.

614
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,487
Almost the entirety
of my professional life, Frank.

615
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,615
You watch your tone.

616
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,243
The things I've done...

617
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,889
The things that I have done
to help keep you here,

618
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,873
and you're gonna question my loyalty?

619
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:28,212
Well, if we can't win, we have to
make sure that Conway doesn't either.

620
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,716
Maine coming over
only means he won't get to 26.

621
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,009
A deadlock isn't a win. But at least...

622
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,556
I'm sorry, Doug. I was out of line.

623
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,603
Let's get back to work.

624
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,364
It's not just what he did
with all the data.

625
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,491
Aidan had access to everything.

626
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,952
We need to get
the CIA and FBI off his trail,

627
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,454
- and I need your help.
- You're causing problems, LeAnn,

628
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:04,749
which is the last thing
that we can afford right now.

629
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,961
- Macallan sealed his own fate.
- I delivered Maine, Doug,

630
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,296
which is more than you can say
about New Hampshire.

631
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,178
I'll owe you.

632
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,598
Not enough.

633
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:25,102
Has the president spoken to you
about Aidan at all?

634
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,186
No.

635
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,982
Is he on a kill list?

636
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,818
The United States of America
doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.

637
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,783
I am the only thing preventing Mac
from releasing what he has.

638
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,411
And my guess is, whatever it is,
it'll implicate you, too.

639
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,455
Am I wrong, Doug?

640
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,351
Someone close to Senator Mitchell
woke me up with the news.

641
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,871
Get me the vice president
on the phone.

642
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,938
That is not going to help.

643
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,023
Well, how do you
intend on dealing with it?

644
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:23,828
Donald.

645
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,873
- Don't do it.
- Claire...

646
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,876
I know what you and Senator Mitchell
were planning.

647
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,753
Do what you were supposed to do.

648
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,090
Move the anti-filibuster measure forward
so the Senate can vote

649
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,342
- and elect me vice president.
- No.

650
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,469
- No?
- All voices should be heard

651
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,763
out of respect for the American people

652
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,015
and the gravity of the vote
before the Senate today,

653
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,768
the first like this since 1825.

654
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,395
The House is about to vote, Donald.
What is going on?

655
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,564
Let's get this done so you can go home.

656
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,901
It looks like Conway is going to win.

657
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,488
And no matter what people have told you,
the Senate is voting for Brockhart.

658
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,991
- It's country over party, Claire.
- Are you flexing?

659
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:06,954
I'm stalling until the House vote happens
and then the Senate votes accordingly.

660
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,082
You'd do that to the party to which
you've devoted your entire career?

661
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,753
The country needs clarity and resolution.
That's the most important thing.

662
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,255
There'll be another election
in four years.

663
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,132
But look...

664
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,885
I saw you when Francis was in the coma.

665
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,513
What you're capable of
when given the opportunity.

666
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,894
You still have a shot
down the road. I'd vote for you.

667
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,730
Whatever you think,
I know I have the numbers.

668
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,190
I don't think so.

669
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,985
But come on.

670
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,573
You're not like him. Be patient.

671
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,704
You're a fool, Donald.
You always were.

672
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:54,084
You and your dumb, dead wife
that you never, ever shut up about.

673
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,503
Principled? Idealistic?

674
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:59,714
A champion for the people?
What did you ever actually do?

675
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,967
Nothing.

676
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:05,387
The great crusader?
I don't think so.

677
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,058
You just liked the position
of the bumbling idiot that you are.

678
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,020
The optimist. The idealist.

679
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,856
You loved it so much
that you couldn't even make a deal

680
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,900
or move a single thing forward.

681
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,319
You have a legacy of nothing.

682
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,989
Sign the measure,
get the Republicans off the floor,

683
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,866
start the vote now.

684
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:30,579
Do you know what I just realized?

685
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,082
Your initials...

686
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,710
they're missing an "n" and a "t".

687
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,332
The vote is inconclusive, Mr. President.

688
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,128
Neither you nor Conway to 26.

689
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,881
Still alive. What about Claire?

690
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,510
This is impossible.

691
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,096
I'm as surprised as you are.

692
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,806
Maine. There was no heads-up on that.

693
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,186
Look, I know this is frustrating.
It should be over.

694
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,188
I... I'm the president.

695
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,608
I don't care what they say, I...

696
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,819
I'm fucking
President of the United States.

697
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:45,946
No, you're not.

698
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,240
The vice president
will be acting president

699
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,700
for as long as it takes
the House to decide.

700
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,746
I should make some calls.
