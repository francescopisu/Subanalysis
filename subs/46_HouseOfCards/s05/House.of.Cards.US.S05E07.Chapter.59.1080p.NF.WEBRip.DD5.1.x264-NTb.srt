1
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,053
If we give him what he wants...

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:15,182
If we give Usher what he says,
his justice, that is it.

3
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,267
It's over. He owns us.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,228
- Don't exaggerate.
- I wish I were.

5
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,440
- You've made a thousand deals.
- Yeah, well, this one is different.

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,484
- Why?
- Because I can feel it right here.

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,820
- Do you hear yourself?
- Yeah, loud and clear.

8
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,865
I'm a little confused
that you don't seem to hear me at all.

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,867
Once we're solidly back in power,

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,869
we will regain our position...
- That is naive.

11
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,871
Naive is new for you.

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,748
Realistic. Not naive.

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,959
Everything we've worked for,
we can kiss it goodbye.

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,503
We agreed to Usher's pick.
It's non-negotiable.

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,341
That's exactly right.
It's his pick. It's his justice.

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,594
He's trying to control our house.
The White House.

17
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,055
I gave him my word, Francis.

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,432
Your word?

19
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,187
Your word? This conversation is pointless.

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,521
Grow up!

21
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,815
Who do you think you are?

22
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:09,527
I think I am a temporary president
trying to get you back in office.

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,614
And if you don't think that
we're at a critical juncture in the road,

24
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,075
you are pathetically mistaken.

25
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,619
Wake up, Claire! Wake up!

26
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,864
Recorded this morning EET
in the Yarmouk neighborhood of Damascus.

27
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,997
Seems he developed a taste for chocolate
while at Cambridge.

28
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,918
Smiling for the camera is Ahmed Al Ahmadi,
Yusuf's brother.

29
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,297
Are you sure?

30
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:39,093
I had a long conversation with
Yusuf Al Ahmadi. They look nothing alike.

31
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,303
It's him.

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,224
Is Ahmed still in our sights?

33
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,893
- He is.
- This is a rare opportunity.

34
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,996
We should seize the moment
and make a targeted strike.

35
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,897
- Director, please.
- Madam President...

36
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,608
Is there some issue, General?

37
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,113
Ahmed Al Ahmadi didn't travel all the way

38
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,658
from his compound to Damascus
to buy a candy bar.

39
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,785
He's meeting with someone.
Let's find out who.

40
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,996
Unless we're detected,
and he disappears for good.

41
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,542
But if we wait, there's a huge potential
to learn more about ICO.

42
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,628
Its members, contacts, habits, tactics.

43
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,299
You know, you're sounding
uncharacteristically dovish

44
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,758
this morning, General.

45
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,095
I agree with General Braegher.

46
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,015
While a successful air strike
against Ahmadi

47
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,379
would play well...
- This isn't about the election, Cathy.

48
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:32,439
No, of course not.
I mean, if we do this correctly,

49
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,317
we can begin the process
of dismantling ICO's network.

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Take him out.

51
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,823
If the president agrees, I think
it's the best thing for the country.

52
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,493
Well, I think it would send
a very clear message to ICO.

53
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:49,664
- In the short term, yes, but...
- No other term is relevant.

54
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,921
I think we have been operating
under the shadow of terror for too long.

55
00:04:57,004 --> 00:04:59,757
For the sake of the American people,
we need to act now.

56
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,133
What's the timetable, General?

57
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,971
For an actionable location,
most likely a number of hours.

58
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,639
Thank you.

59
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,018
You're wasting our time.

60
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,480
We're being selective
about where and how he appears.

61
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,873
Soon he won't be at any events at all.

62
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,233
We're just trying to land him
and you in the White House.

63
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,613
And it's not Brockhart-Conway, Mark.
It's the opposite.

64
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,533
- He won't put up with this much longer.
- I'm sure it's hard on him.

65
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,703
- I have to take this. I'm sorry.
- What happens after he gets there?

66
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,039
- To Will? What happens?
- We'll be there for him.

67
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,125
- You and General Brockhart?
- Yes.

68
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,462
What will Will's role be?

69
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,173
I will continue to support your husband.

70
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,802
Give me a real answer. You owe me that.

71
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,056
His role will be
President of the United States.

72
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,854
Hey.

73
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,692
The mic was still hot
and Brockhart just kept talking.

74
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,861
- That's what she said.
- Insubordination?

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,657
- That's the word she used?
- It's what it sounded like to her.

76
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,993
He was talking about soldiers
and he said, quote,

77
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,328
"I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen."

78
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,457
- Can she get her hands on the actual clip?
- For a price.

79
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,626
- I thought she was a friend.
- Yeah, a smart friend.

80
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,505
- It's a nice 30-second spot, post-debate.
- If there is a debate.

81
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,802
Hits them at their strength.
Takes the military credibility away.

82
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,889
This is the kind of thing
that can turn an election.

83
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,270
Whatever this costs... it's worth it.

84
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,317
Let's secure it and then verify it.

85
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,032
Recess appointment of Judge Benson or no,

86
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,786
people need to stay focused
on the revote in Tennessee and Ohio

87
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,120
and how the hell we got here.

88
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,831
All right.

89
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,167
I'll have my assistant Angela reach out

90
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,753
to confirm what time
you need me at the studio.

91
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,174
All right. Yep. Yeah.

92
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,305
I collected everything I could find
about the day Doug Stamper was carjacked.

93
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,890
Good.

94
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,642
All right, so...

95
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,562
where was that?

96
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,273
Where that happened?

97
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,068
In Maryland.

98
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,115
Right around, um...

99
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,159
Yeah, I grew up
about a half an hour from there...

100
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,120
It's here.

101
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,459
And Rachel Posner's...

102
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,588
last known address.

103
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,898
I'd say they were
about 15 minutes apart.

104
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,491
I'm not sure why I need
to explain myself to you.

105
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,825
Why would you go to the NSA?

106
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,746
I was inquiring into the well-being
of an American citizen.

107
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,626
- He's just a disgruntled hacker.
- Then why are you so interested in him?

108
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,588
How did he look?

109
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,882
I'm asking for me.

110
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,053
I've known Aidan since I was 13 years old.
He and my mom dated for several years.

111
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,363
Was a long time ago, obviously.

112
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,223
But as far as the NSA job,
he didn't want it.

113
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,767
I made him take it.

114
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,940
I don't understand how they got him
or why he's there.

115
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,108
I need to know that he is safe.

116
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,653
He looked fine.

117
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,657
What does he know, LeAnn?

118
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,367
Probably about the same as you and me,

119
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,038
which is why we need to keep him
out of any serious trouble.

120
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,089
I don't want to get involved
in your personal life, LeAnn.

121
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,383
- I'm here to see the president.
- Of course.

122
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:14,470
But when you think about it, Cathy,
we're all sort of involved here.

123
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:18,683
If he is in any kind of danger,
he is not built for it.

124
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,017
Hi, Cathy.

125
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,979
Jane.

126
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,025
LeAnn Harvey, Jane Davis.
Jane is under secretary...

127
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,739
Deputy under secretary of commerce
for international trade. It's a mouthful.

128
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,502
Yeah, it's good to put a face
to the voice.

129
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,993
Uh, do you have any ibuprofen?

130
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,953
- Oh, I might have some aspirin.
- No.

131
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,999
- I'm allergic. Gives me hives.
- We may have some.

132
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,838
You're the Harveys
of the tire company, yes?

133
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,719
My father and uncle
sold the business 20 years ago.

134
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,638
And the treads
haven't been the same since.

135
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,934
But it's great. You finally landed in D.C.

136
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,820
I'll let the president know
you're both here.

137
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,522
Uh, thank you for this.

138
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:16,573
Uh, let's just reverse those two sentences
and it's there. It's to the point.

139
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:20,494
- Pithy.
- Yes, pithy.

140
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,331
Your meeting is here.

141
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,127
Thank you.

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,255
And Justice Benson is en route
to the White House for the announcement.

143
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,965
I'll have her wait in the Yellow Oval.

144
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,927
Uh, great.
Can you send the others in, please?

145
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,178
Of course.

146
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,641
Is the former president meeting us
in the Rose Garden?

147
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,309
Francis will not be there.

148
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,020
He's not needed.

149
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,111
Miss Davis.

150
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,863
Secretary Durant.

151
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,327
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, where was that?

152
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,580
A think tank in Aspen, early 2000.

153
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,458
Oh, there was a lot of thinking
happening back then.

154
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,419
- Mmm. I'm glad we put a stop to that.

155
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,503
Please, have a seat.

156
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,256
So, I've gone over the numbers

157
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,218
of the proposed agreement
of steel with Beijing

158
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,386
and I have a couple of questions for you.

159
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,305
Madam President,
we need to evacuate you now.

160
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,408
- What's going on?
- Please, Madam President. It's urgent.

161
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,475
Ma'am.

162
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,187
Where are you taking me?

163
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,647
- We're moving you to the PEOC.
- Why?

164
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,943
- They'll brief you down below, ma'am.
- Where's Francis?

165
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,301
- Where's Doug Stamper? And Mr. Yates?
- We're following protocol, ma'am.

166
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,221
National Security Advisor Cafferty
is on her way.

167
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,682
- Ma'am?
- No, we'll wait for Francis.

168
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,683
He'll meet you inside.

169
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,727
We will wait for Francis. That's an order.

170
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,705
- Madam President.
- Miss Cafferty, what's going on?

171
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,898
Nothing's confirmed yet,

172
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,650
but a truck carrying radioactive material
has gone missing.

173
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,907
- Is this real?
- We have to talk to Green.

174
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,658
Let's head inside.

175
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,071
Yes.

176
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,617
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,996
I see. Thank you.

178
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,250
Homeland received word from CYBERCOM

179
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,587
that a truck carrying
three cesium-137 irradiators

180
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,796
missed two checkpoints.

181
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,756
It was supposed to be
traveling from Atlanta

182
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,884
back to the manufacturer in Baltimore.

183
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,846
- Where do we think the truck is now?
- Truck's GPS is offline.

184
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,448
How the hell
does a thing like that happen?

185
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,616
- We'll have to reevaluate.
- You're damn right we will.

186
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,184
But we need to make some decisions.

187
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,854
We should notify Metro PD
and Virginia State Police.

188
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,563
Are we gonna evacuate the public?

189
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,292
No. Before we do anything, I wanna speak
to the head of counterterrorism.

190
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,068
Get Assistant Director Green on the line.

191
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,278
- Ma'am, Homeland is over...
- The president is right.

192
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,865
Ma'am?

193
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,783
This is President Underwood.

194
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,995
At this time,
we have no idea who's responsible.

195
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,998
Perhaps it's better I patch you
into the whole room. One second.

196
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,295
The driver's been unreachable
since his shift began.

197
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,049
There's enough radiation on that truck
to impact a 30-mile radius.

198
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,468
Even if it's not weaponized,
it would be in the air,

199
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:07,304
in the water, children, people...

200
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:12,559
General, I can hear the wheels
grinding from here.

201
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,311
I'd rather not speculate, sir.

202
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,356
Oh, please do.

203
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,486
Over the past several days,
there has been increased ICO chatter,

204
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:24,280
but that is the new normal.

205
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:29,160
We've sent over stats and maps
of potentially affected areas.

206
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,551
I don't know what's worse.
A dirty bomb about to go off

207
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,238
or what'll happen to the city
when they know we're looking for one.

208
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,933
- Who do we have left upstairs?
- Seth and LeAnn.

209
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,559
You stay in touch with Green.

210
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,898
If this is a dirty bomb,
then we've just entered a different world.

211
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,024
Yes, sir.

212
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,820
All right, we need to stay focused
on our contingency plan for an evacuation

213
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,114
without the appearance of doing so.

214
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,215
We need to be ready
to implement one way...

215
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,247
We need to get the cleanup team
from the Energy...

216
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,874
...whose jurisdiction it is
to get the security cams...

217
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,882
Yes. Whenever it happens, this appointment
would break the court's deadlock.

218
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,260
And we would get this election
going again.

219
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,554
But let's step back a minute.

220
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:33,682
Tennessee is out of the equation.

221
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,978
Whoever wins that state, it's not enough.

222
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,814
It's come down to one state. Ohio.

223
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:47,321
One state is about to choose
the next President of these United States.

224
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,198
How did we let this happen?

225
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,825
And it keeps happening.

226
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:55,496
This is an administration
that operates behind closed doors,

227
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,789
out of the public eye.

228
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:03,004
Today's sudden postponement is typical.
With no announcement in the Rose Garden,

229
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,507
and literally zero news
coming from the White House,

230
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,426
one has to wonder
what is going on behind the scenes

231
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,138
to cause this unexpected delay.

232
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,931
The silence is deafening.

233
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:20,229
After such a protracted, confusing
and, frankly, chaotic election,

234
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,439
we deserve clarity.

235
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,151
Instead, here we are again...

236
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,737
left out of the loop
and on the edge of our seats.

237
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,158
I just hope America
isn't getting used to this.

238
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,704
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

239
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,955
Doug?

240
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,332
Why wasn't I read in?

241
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,710
- To what?
- Whatever's going on.

242
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,713
If this is gonna play for us,
the president in the bunker,

243
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,215
I need to know how to play it.

244
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,510
There's a truck carrying
radioactive material that's gone missing.

245
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,514
Okay.
Should Seth and I prepare a statement?

246
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,475
- Where are we saying the truck is?
- We don't know.

247
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,978
- When are we gonna find it?
- We don't know.

248
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,691
Wait, is something really happening?

249
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,693
Probably not.

250
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,284
- Hello?
- Probably not?

251
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,577
What am I supposed to do?

252
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,704
- Is that Doug?
- Yeah.

253
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,331
Can I talk to him?

254
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,541
- Hey, what can you tell us?
- Act normal.

255
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,711
Stay on point.
Comment only on the ongoing campaign.

256
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,594
I've already postponed
their scheduled events.

257
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,965
Look, are we in danger here or what?

258
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,301
I can't answer.

259
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,886
Because I don't know.

260
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,931
Await further instructions from Homeland.

261
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,015
All right.

262
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,728
Doug, should we be here?

263
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,439
He hung up.

264
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,236
What are we doing?

265
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,663
Nora thinks we need to notify
Speaker McCarthy.

266
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,827
I think it's too soon
for a continuity of government.

267
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,394
If we're planning an evacuation,
Congress needs to be notified...

268
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,962
I said, I believe it is a bit too early.

269
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,132
Madam President,
Director Morrison thinks that...

270
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,859
Wait a minute.
Where is Director Morrison? Why...

271
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,552
She opted to stay at ODNI.
She's monitoring from there.

272
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,388
Well, at least let's get her on the phone.

273
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,449
We should have wiped out ICO
when we had the chance.

274
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,058
We didn't ask
for your personal opinion, General.

275
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,021
What we need is an update
on the Ahmed Al Ahmadi situation.

276
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,149
Yes, ma'am.
I'll check with Director Morrison now.

277
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,367
I have contacts, you know.

278
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,371
Private contractors in the region
that might be of help.

279
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,750
Are you suggesting that your contacts
know more than the Bureau, the NSA...

280
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,502
I'm not suggesting anything.

281
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,255
I'm telling you.

282
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,508
I know third parties
that have negotiated with ICO in the past.

283
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,638
Hostages and whatnot...
who may know something.

284
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,307
But I need a line.

285
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,726
Just a... a secure one.

286
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,856
I can barely breathe in here.

287
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,402
I'm gonna go get us a cup of coffee.

288
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:23,078
How does Miss Davis have
this level of clearance?

289
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
That's a good question.

290
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,220
- Did we bring this on ourselves?
- What?

291
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,556
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Listen to me.

292
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,810
Everything we've done, everything,
is exactly what we had to do.

293
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,064
We don't even know if this is real.

294
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,431
I get these in Hong Kong.

295
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,060
The best instant coffee
comes out of the Pacific Rim.

296
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,025
- Would you like one?
- If you can spare it.

297
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,237
Oh, I always have
three or four in my bag.

298
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,162
I wonder how long
we'll be down here.

299
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,873
The situation's still unclear.

300
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,837
I shouldn't be drinking coffee.
I still feel a little shaky.

301
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,760
You don't look it.

302
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,522
Feel my pulse.

303
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,862
You seem very much in control to me.

304
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,037
So do you.

305
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,041
What does that say about the two of us?

306
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,973
Hmm.

307
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes, thank you.

308
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,777
The SEAL team is on the trail
of Ahmed Al Ahmadi,

309
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,197
but National Intelligence believes
he's discovered we're following him

310
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,408
and the truck is a countermeasure.

311
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,120
ICO wants to see Ahmadi
walking out of Damascus in one piece.

312
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,373
If we strike, they will hit back.

313
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,249
Evacuation procedures
need to be initiated...

314
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,060
- Just hold on!
- No, the public is our priority...

315
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,420
Hold on! I want to know
how close we are to a strike

316
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,423
and where this goddamn truck is
before we make any final decisions.

317
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,426
- "We make any decisions"?
- Yes, I am still in a position to make...

318
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,845
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you are not in a position...

319
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,973
Nora. The enemy isn't in here.

320
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:40,692
Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.
But it's the general who's on my mind.

321
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,278
Miss Cafferty.

322
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,657
I was entirely out of line.
Please accept my apology.

323
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,204
I spoke with Davis.

324
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,625
- And?
- Nothing. She was just flexing.

325
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,921
Cathy.

326
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,349
Who called a meeting with Claire today?
You or Miss Davis?

327
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,518
Jane did.

328
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,020
Thank you very much, Cathy.

329
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,689
- Was that all?
- Yes, thank you.

330
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,982
Oh, sorry, one more thing.

331
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:25,153
When did Braegher get his fourth star?
Which administration?

332
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,863
A couple back.

333
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,699
So he and Brockhart together?

334
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,285
And a few others who were elevated
around the same time, yes.

335
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,120
Thank you, Cathy.

336
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,547
That Brockhart spot we talked about.
You have it?

337
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,674
Is it verified?

338
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,134
Hold on.

339
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,390
...Ready.

340
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:57,435
I swear to God,

341
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,239
if Underwood puts soldiers
on those borders,

342
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,565
I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen.

343
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,776
If the President of the United States
gives orders like that,

344
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,612
you put him out of his misery.

345
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,489
That's it. That's all I have.

346
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,366
No, that's good.

347
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,993
If we survive the day.

348
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,995
Is Seth still in the office with you?

349
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:18,790
I'm in the Oval,
sitting behind the Resolute desk.

350
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,292
That's not you.

351
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:26,131
You know, you keep deciding who I am
and you keep reading me wrong.

352
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,550
Are there rumors
about what's going on down here?

353
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,677
Yes, but we're deflecting.

354
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,930
- Has the Conway campaign reached out?
- Not yet.

355
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,726
The general's on a stump in Ohio
and the governor's off the grid.

356
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,937
- Okay. Stay on him.
- I will.

357
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,857
Unless it's the end of the world
and it doesn't matter.

358
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,068
Goodbye, Doug Stamper.

359
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,577
Are you sure
you should be in there, Goldilocks?

360
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,077
Are you all right?

361
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,749
Honestly, I was thinking about
how far down we are

362
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,250
and how it's not my favorite thing.

363
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,129
I... I'm sorry.
Do... do you need to be in here?

364
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,505
No. No, no. It's fine.

365
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,594
I used to have a fear of flying,
but I got over it.

366
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,429
Doesn't bother me at all anymore.

367
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,391
But the pendulum seems
to have swung the other way.

368
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,812
If I think too hard,
I start to feel buried.

369
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,398
Forgive me. It's the recirculated air,
makes things worse.

370
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,446
Miss Davis, why are you here?

371
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,907
- This is where the Secret Service led me.
- No.

372
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:19,953
Access list or not,
you have to choose to be here.

373
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,248
- I always choose the safest place.
- Why are you here?

374
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,169
It felt like an opportunity.

375
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,632
A chance for a meeting,
not quite on the books.

376
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,760
I just got off the phone, Madam President.

377
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,179
I have information from abroad,
from private contractors...

378
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,641
Ahmadi is in Damascus.

379
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,102
And a number of parties
were racing to capture him,

380
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,730
including, of course, the United States.

381
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,189
But no one...

382
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,818
will be capturing him today.

383
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,362
Or before the election.

384
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,032
I've made a career...

385
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,786
out of dealing with
problematic parts of the world.

386
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,584
It's kind of my vocation
to imagine the unimaginable.

387
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,507
Excuse me.

388
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,224
- Pardon me.
- I'm sorry.

389
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,351
- It's all right.
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

390
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:35,528
I had the distinct feeling
she was offering Ahmadi to us.

391
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,780
Meaning?

392
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,532
She said there are a number of groups
looking to capture him,

393
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:43,494
but that no one will.
Not today or before the election.

394
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,873
We brought this on ourselves.

395
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,210
- We pushed too hard.
- We've survived.

396
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,463
- We isolated ourselves, Francis.
- So what?

397
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,424
We both know something the rest
of the world refuses to acknowledge.

398
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,594
There is no justice, only conquest.

399
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,263
And let me tell you,
we let them evacuate D.C.,

400
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,850
we are done, Claire. We've lost.

401
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,434
...Yes?

402
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:14,442
I just spoke to LeAnn.
You need to hear this.

403
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:15,902
I swear to God,

404
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,738
if Underwood puts soldiers
on those borders,

405
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,948
I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen.

406
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,034
If the President of the United States
gives orders like that,

407
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,786
you put him out of his misery.

408
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,293
Let me out.

409
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,796
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm not allowed...
- Open the door.

410
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,173
- My orders are to...
- I am no longer the president.

411
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,426
I have no responsibilities or obligations.
Isn't that correct?

412
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,279
We can't send you above
until the threat is contained...

413
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,181
- Open this door.
- Let him out.

414
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,893
- Ma'am?
- Let the president out.

415
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,229
Open the door.

416
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,108
Open it.

417
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,113
Ma'am.

418
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:28,076
- We need to initiate evacuation now.
- No, General. We'll do it when I say so.

419
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,459
I'm really sorry.

420
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:39,545
I know I agreed to do this,
but I have to go pick up my kids.

421
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,173
Okay. Well, what if
I just rode in the car with you?

422
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,134
You know, parents are texting one another.

423
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:48,471
One of them works at the NSA and
he thinks there's a terror threat, so...

424
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,766
I mean, this has happened before,
but you just... You never know.

425
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,103
My mom died of kidney failure last month.

426
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,272
Oh, I'm so sorry.

427
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:02,610
- Uh, was she on the donor list?
- Yeah, but not close enough to the top.

428
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,781
Do you mind?
You could talk while we walk out of here.

429
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,869
Um... sure. Yeah.

430
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,081
...Uh, how long was Anthony sick for?

431
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,627
Uh... about two years.

432
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,591
And he fought it hard.
So hard. The entire way.

433
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,558
This unit, if they pay cash,
I don't ask questions.

434
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,602
- But you remember these young women?
- Yeah, of course.

435
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,023
They were very close,
if you know what I mean.

436
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,691
But they were sweet.

437
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,654
And did you ever see... this man?

438
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,700
Look, I don't know what was going on here.

439
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,452
But you recognize him?

440
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,831
Yeah. Okay?

441
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,835
Someone looking like him paid the rent.
Three months, up-front.

442
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,046
But like I said, I don't judge.

443
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:12,013
I'm not sure what you're asking,
Mr. President.

444
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,473
Oh, please.

445
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,852
Someone or someones...

446
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,438
tried to make my wife and I
lose the election

447
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,191
by keeping us underground today.

448
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,611
And I would like to know
what you know about that.

449
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,906
We've all been responding in real time
to a potential terrorist attack.

450
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:34,535
But you chose to stay here.
Why weren't you in the bunker with us?

451
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,829
I chose to remain in my office

452
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:39,749
to oversee the capture
or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.

453
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,334
Mmm.

454
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,628
And yet there was great tension
this morning

455
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,421
between you and General Braegher.

456
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,257
Difference in approach.

457
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,843
We are not going to evacuate
the District of Columbia.

458
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:54,347
I want you to understand that.
Come what may.

459
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,645
And I promise you this... Vanessa.

460
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:07,610
When I find out exactly what has happened,
I'm going to remember this conversation,

461
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:10,488
when you chose to withhold information.

462
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,327
General Braegher is a strong supporter
of General Brockhart.

463
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,957
Did they conspire?

464
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:30,466
Did they use... terror...

465
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:36,347
and this evacuation
to cost me this election?

466
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,060
I'm not a fan of the general...

467
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,815
but... that's a strong charge,
and there's no proof to support it.

468
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:51,279
You know, what you people
protect best is each other.

469
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:57,118
We lost Ahmadi a short time ago
and believe he is no longer in Damascus.

470
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,788
Of course.

471
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,749
Of course.

472
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,923
Now you listen to me...

473
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:18,013
This was nothing more or less
than an attempted coup, plain and simple.

474
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,935
And I do not know to what degree
you have been directly involved.

475
00:34:23,018 --> 00:34:25,730
But you will resolve it.

476
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,607
Now.

477
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,277
Do I make myself clear?

478
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,116
Yes, sir.

479
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,923
The truck's been found.

480
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,594
Now we can't know for sure, but it looks
as though ICO wasn't involved.

481
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,097
The irradiators and cesium
were accounted for.

482
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,726
The truck was accidentally parked
at a medical device factory in Durham.

483
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,396
The plant foreman never reported it.

484
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,898
So we can relax for now, at least.

485
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,651
I just wanna thank you all
for your efforts. Thank you.

486
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,575
Madam President.
You'll have my resignation in the morning.

487
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,161
Nora...

488
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,747
these were extraordinary
circumstances today.

489
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:29,127
What would our administration be if
we didn't allow for some human failings?

490
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,221
Get the presser going.
We're coming up now.

491
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,223
Concerning Ahmadi...

492
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,892
We didn't find him.

493
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:47,019
You will. You can.

494
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:50,064
- What are you offering?
- Help.

495
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,692
If you'd like it, Madam President.

496
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,661
Can you elaborate
on the drill earlier today?

497
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,413
Well, drills happen all the time.

498
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,456
It's part of the administration's
ongoing efforts to keep the country safe.

499
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,252
- Yes, but there's usually a warning.
- What's the point of that?

500
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,797
- Who's next?

501
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,894
Did you look at the file?

502
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,231
I didn't have to.

503
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,653
I'll expect your signature
on the resignation letter within the hour.

504
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:42,492
Unless you choose to implicate
whoever else was involved.

505
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,587
You don't deserve to be
in the White House.

506
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,798
Neither you nor your husband.

507
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,266
I'd wish you the best,
but I don't think you'll need it.

508
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,894
I'm fairly certain you'll do very well
in the private sector.

509
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,155
I've scheduled a meeting with Jane Davis
for the end of the week.

510
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,240
Good.

511
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,074
Also, I was going to mention this earlier,

512
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:28,078
but Cathy's been very curious
about Aidan Macallan.

513
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,039
I've thrown her off the scent, but...

514
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:34,126
Cathy's not the problem.
The problem is Macallan,

515
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:37,422
and the person who allowed Macallan
to become the problem.

516
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,555
The foundation's raised over 80K.

517
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:49,309
Anthony became status one
on the donor list on March 15th, 2016.

518
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,270
Moretti talked about it as, uh,
the last day of her life

519
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,497
before she corrected herself.

520
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,064
Spent every spare second
with the kids.

521
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,501
They were building a go-kart.
They were pretty close to done.

522
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,526
- Okay.
- I got more.

523
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,903
- No, I got it.
- What were you looking for?

524
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:02,322
It's nothing.

525
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,286
- Okay.
- What?

526
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,597
You wanna tell me what happened
in the White House today?

527
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,207
- No, I don't.

528
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,609
All right,
I've been waiting to say something,

529
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,052
but I've waited
and I don't want to wait anymore.

530
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,930
Consider me for a job at the White House,
in comms.

531
00:38:31,266 --> 00:38:34,354
"Go get this. Find me that.
I need this." I'm tired of it.

532
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,082
If you don't ask, you get asked.
That's what I'm starting to realize.

533
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,190
I'll put a word in.

534
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,835
Yeah? Well, what does that mean?

535
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,487
It means that when the moment is right,
I'll mention you.

536
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,202
Yes, whenever it happens...

537
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,955
this appointment would break
the court's deadlock

538
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:55,375
and we would get this election
going again.

539
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,835
- But let's step back a minute...

540
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,254
- Tennessee...
- Where's your salt?

541
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,424
- Whoever wins that state...
- Right side of the sink.

542
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,261
It's come down to one state:

543
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,471
Ohio.

544
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:13,601
One state is about to choose
the next President of these United States.

545
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,311
- Was it really a drill?
- Hmm.

546
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,940
This is an administration
that operates behind closed doors.

547
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:22,527
You know, with everything
that was happening today,

548
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,862
this reporter from the Herald came by.

549
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,864
What?

550
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,659
Wants to do a story on Tony
and the foundation.

551
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,624
What was his name?

552
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,321
Davis implied she could help us
track down Ahmadi.

553
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,074
I think we should hear
what she has to say.

554
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,119
She's got a quality about her,
doesn't she?

555
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,247
Attractive and terrifying.

556
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,586
Like the urge to pet a red tail fox.

557
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,009
The general offered his letter?

558
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:33,055
Uh, he did.
And refused to implicate anyone.

559
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,605
You were right, Claire.
We need to sit down with Usher.

560
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:45,985
Just so happens, he's going to
Northern California this weekend

561
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:49,154
to meet with a group of men

562
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,950
to discuss the crisis
and the future of our country.

563
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,746
- Well, you need to be invited to that.
- Yes, let's get him in.

564
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,712
I know it's obvious,
but it always strikes me.

565
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,921
No women.

566
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,216
Well, it was a different time.

567
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,303
Terrible.

568
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,599
The war or the restrictions of the era?

569
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,726
Both.

570
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,895
Well, you know my position.

571
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,064
I'm all for women in combat.

572
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:10,295
False alarm... hmm?

573
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:17,970
I was worried about you.

574
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,828
I worry about you all the time, Claire.

575
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,671
But I know that's not the kind of thing
you like to hear.

576
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,485
Mark. Come in.

577
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,572
- We have much to discuss.
- Madam President.

578
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,366
Uh, Mr. President.

579
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,661
As I believe you know,

580
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,957
yesterday we had something of a drill
here in the White House.

581
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,459
I know people are wondering
what that was about.

582
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,003
Yes. Everyone except you.

583
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,256
The announcement of the recess
appointment of Judge Benson

584
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,425
has been rescheduled
for tomorrow morning.

585
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:40,260
Good. So...

586
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,888
we have an election.

587
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:47,977
Which you will not be able to win
with another so-called October surprise.

588
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,231
- Well, we are way past October.
- We certainly are.

589
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:56,861
I understand Ahmed Al Ahmadi
is still a threat?

590
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,906
Yes, but he's so elusive, as you know.

591
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,283
It's a shame you weren't able
to capture him.

592
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,994
Well...

593
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:09,623
I believe that the opportunity
will present itself to the next president,

594
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,458
whomever he may be.

595
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,044
If Will Conway wins the office,

596
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,463
I can assure you
that'll be a top priority.

597
00:45:16,546 --> 00:45:17,547
Hmm.

598
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,134
This terror has got to stop.

599
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,681
I've taken enough of your time.

600
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:32,271
Oh, Mark, I just want to play something
for you. It'll only take a moment.

601
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,774
I swear to God,

602
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,817
if Underwood puts soldiers
on those borders,

603
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,944
I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen.

604
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,322
If the President of the United States
gives orders like that,

605
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,323
you put him out of his...

606
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,659
Okay. I don't need to hear anymore.

607
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,161
Oh, but, Mark...

608
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,204
it gets so much better.
