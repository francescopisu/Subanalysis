1
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:09,301
Garrett Walker's testimony
couldn't be more damning.

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,595
Francis Underwood is front and center
in a scheme that had

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,765
Chinese money influencing
an American election.

4
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:19,019
Testimony from a disgraced
and disgruntled former president.

5
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,978
Why is he just speaking up now?

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,106
Well, are you suggesting
that they shouldn't...

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,567
take what Walker said seriously?
I mean...

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,128
If it's true, why stay silent so long?

9
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,571
Which is a question
I'm sure the Judiciary Committee

10
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,656
- will ask once it's up and going.

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,701
My sources say articles of impeachment
could be voted on

12
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,928
as early as the end of the week.

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,495
Now as if the House is that efficient.

14
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,915
Look, President Walker is the one
who should be scrutinized here.

15
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:42,875
He's talking out of
both sides of his mouth.

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,630
And let's not forget, he has had some
emotional problems in the past.

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,443
Underwood has disrespected the presidency
since before he was thought of

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,695
for Secretary of State...
- You seem blinded by this crusade.

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,759
...when he was House Whip.

20
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,640
You guys, wait.
If Underwood is impeached, then...

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,160
That's a hypothetical. It's dangerous.

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,477
Fair. Well...

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,396
Tom, where would impeachment leave
Vice President Claire Underwood?

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,607
In the Oval, as president.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,361
What their arrangement would be,
in that case, is anybody's guess.

26
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,406
Seth, what is this like right now
for the first couple?

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,742
They're avoiding all of this distraction.

28
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,703
They're continuing to do the work
of the American people.

29
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,557
- Censure.
- No.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,683
I see Mark's point.

31
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,644
There is no way to stop the Republicans
in the House.

32
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,020
Walker's not a reliable witness.

33
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,981
Is what he said verifiable?

34
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,191
So, impeachment is inevitable.

35
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,694
Well, that's...
that's a presumption.

36
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,571
The Democratic Senate

37
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,449
will not be inclined to remove
a Democratic president.

38
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,867
But they need political cover.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,660
Censure will help them with that.

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,456
I mean,
they might propose other penalties,

41
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,916
a fine, a statement of condemnation

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,753
but they'll stop short
of finding criminal wrongdoing.

43
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,547
And if it happens quickly,
everyone can move on.

44
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,966
Did you two get together
on this privately?

45
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,092
No.

46
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,348
Francis, this is one way
to salvage your first term.

47
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,950
Walker was supposed to plead the Fifth.

48
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,559
Well, things took an unexpected turn.

49
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,480
Yes. He went back on his deal,
because he's as pliable as his testimony.

50
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,651
Mark, I will not be impeached in the House
and it will never get to the Senate.

51
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,529
We will destroy
Garrett Walker's credibility

52
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,698
and the case will fall apart.

53
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,908
Okay.

54
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,962
Can I get immunity?

55
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,548
Depends on what you give them.

56
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,511
I'll reach out to a ranking member,
but you're not gonna get anonymity...

57
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,844
- Cathy.

58
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,555
- Jane.
- Hello?

59
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,267
You've been on my mind.
Can you believe what's going on?

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,185
Excuse me for a moment.

61
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,855
As my mother used to say,
"It's a red hot mess."

62
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,692
Frank Underwood's demise
doesn't have to be yours.

63
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,153
There are non-profits, NGOs
that would be dying to work with you.

64
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,656
Well, as far as I know,
I still have a job.

65
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,199
No, of course.

66
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,452
But who knows who they'll come after next?

67
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,787
I was never part of their inner circle.

68
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,582
You were smart to go with Maureen.
She's a good lawyer.

69
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,959
If someone can find you an exit, it's her.

70
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:57,505
Well, I'm not gonna go away easily,
so thank you for your concern, Jane.

71
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,673
It is concern.

72
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,425
Uh...

73
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:05,054
do you think the vice president had
any knowledge of this stuff?

74
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,808
Well, as I said, I have no idea.

75
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,106
If... if Claire survives this
and becomes president,

76
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,149
where does that leave you?

77
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,696
Well, I've been at this
for 30 years, Jane,

78
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,239
so I think I can survive.

79
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,117
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to alarm you.

80
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,828
I'm not alarmed.

81
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,372
All I'm trying to say,

82
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,499
I'm on your side.

83
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,634
If it's the difference in being
in office or being out,

84
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,051
we can work around that.

85
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,845
Working in handcuffs.

86
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,347
Censure is a setback. It's not a loss.

87
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,725
You're very confident and very insistent.

88
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:54,103
- We can come out of this, Francis.
- No, you mean you can.

89
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,187
Can you, for once,

90
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,816
just take something at face value
instead of fighting it?

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,153
As if I can be washed clean of past sins.

92
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,363
- How long have you known me?
- Forever.

93
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,740
How well do you know me?

94
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,743
How, in your wildest imagination,
could you, Claire Underwood,

95
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,413
think I would be okay with this?

96
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,081
Think about it, please.

97
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:17,794
This is the fate of my presidency!

98
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,338
The people want to forgive you.

99
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,632
Let them.

100
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,641
Come out here already.
Give me the rest of it.

101
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:35,186
Hammerschmidt is a straight-up workaholic.

102
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,772
- But... he's getting close.

103
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,148
Putting the pieces together.

104
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,711
What's he still grinding so hard for?

105
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,069
Looks like Walker's gonna bring
Underwood down.

106
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,910
I don't wanna do this anymore.

107
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,081
- Zoe Barnes. Rachel Posner.
- Sean, please, I...

108
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,249
I was the one trying
to get him back on that.

109
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,836
- That's what got me fired.
- Can we stop talking about this?

110
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,548
- Where's my drink?
- Don't do that. Look at me. Look.

111
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,844
This is me... not talking.

112
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,680
Hmm.

113
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,349
- Come here. Come here.

114
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,437
But if I can be of any help,
you let me know.

115
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,190
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

116
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,609
...You're gonna get it.

117
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,527
- Give me a taste of that.
- Mmm! Mm-hmm.

118
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,368
Slow down.

119
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,373
- Pull over!

120
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,379
You're going pretty hard,
Mr. President. You okay?

121
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,965
Well enough for a man whose fate
is hanging in the balance.

122
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,049
No.

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,094
- Your fate is sealed.
- Oh, how's that?

124
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:51,846
You have a vision for me, Eric?

125
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:55,391
Even if you're impeached and convicted...
you still make history.

126
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,655
Augustus Underwood was
just another redneck

127
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,648
who died fighting for the wrong side,
forgotten by everyone but you and me.

128
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,984
But if Francis Underwood
is removed from office?

129
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,195
Your legacy won't die.
It'll be solidified.

130
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,698
You'll be infamous.

131
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,618
Legacy and infamy are not the same thing.

132
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,787
You'll be remembered.
Who cares why?

133
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,163
I have to get back.

134
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,831
Hey, hold up. Let me explain.

135
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,167
Francis.

136
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,505
...Hey!

137
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,941
Francis.

138
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,778
Francis?

139
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,755
Just to be clear, it's not that
I haven't always known you were there.

140
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,091
It's that I have mixed feelings about you.

141
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,469
I question your intentions...

142
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,639
and I'm ambivalent about attention.

143
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,393
But don't take it personally.
It's how I feel about most everybody.

144
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,855
How can we trust anything he says?

145
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,442
Garrett Walker was medicated while
he was in office. We all know that.

146
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,863
No, it's not a talking point.
It's the truth.

147
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,117
We don't know exactly what he was taking.

148
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,998
Off the record...

149
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,835
can you tell me what
Tom Hammerschmidt's working on?

150
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,048
Come on, you two don't
cross paths over there?

151
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,262
He reached out to me on a story.
I never heard back.

152
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,225
Okay. Thank you.

153
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,797
You can believe
what he's saying or not.

154
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,175
...Garrett Walker was taking medication...

155
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,429
Never... never put an unknown flash drive
into a networked computer. Never.

156
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,724
You don't have to keep telling me.
I called you, remember?

157
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,809
Yeah.

158
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,145
Okay. Do your worst.

159
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,566
...Okay. So far so good.

160
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,819
There is something.

161
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,339
Thank you.

162
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,056
I have to go.

163
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,349
Everything okay?

164
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,392
- Not now.
- See you tonight?

165
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,519
I'll call you when I'm done.

166
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,491
Hey. I think there's a leak.
In the Underwood Administration.

167
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,122
Uh, no idea.

168
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:52,879
Well, no, that's a little premature.
This isn't Watergate... yet.

169
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,549
Yeah.

170
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,927
Okay.

171
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:11,856
Alex.

172
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,611
So... judiciary won't be happening
for you.

173
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,572
Just the few slots for Democrats.

174
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:24,076
Leadership just filled those
with a couple of old blue dogs. Sorry.

175
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,744
Well, you were right about one thing.

176
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,830
Garrett's testimony did not
make me any friends.

177
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,915
Not in your party, no.

178
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,500
Well, as of this morning,
I'm officially an independent.

179
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,170
I think the GOP can find me
a place on judiciary.

180
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,547
- Okay, Alex.
- It's a good move.

181
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,692
Four years from now, I think an outsider's
what the voter will be looking for.

182
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:43,345
Yeah, third-party candidate is the future,
and always will be.

183
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,224
Why did Garrett Walker change his mind?

184
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,351
It wasn't me who made that happen.

185
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,687
I don't know.

186
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,981
Sometimes things happen
without us knowing why.

187
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,365
They arrested someone
they knew was innocent.

188
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,910
- Governor Scanlon denies it.
- Of course he does.

189
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,495
- And the NSA has no comment.
- As a rule.

190
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,040
- No, out. Get out.
- Five minutes, please.

191
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,374
Thank you.

192
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,128
The FBI confirms
that they arrested Kalabi

193
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,422
and that he's awaiting trial,
but that's all.

194
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,924
That's right, that's all.

195
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:24,971
But there are agents in the FBI who were
not happy with the way this went down.

196
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,724
And not one of them will let us
use their name on the record.

197
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,309
We can't confirm the story.

198
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,604
Tom, we can't run a story this big
without a source.

199
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,790
- No. I know. I know.
- This paper has never done that.

200
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,691
- I know.
- Who knows who sent you this?

201
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:38,817
I know. I know.

202
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,608
I need you to float something out for me.
Give it to Slugline.

203
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,652
- What do you want me to say?

204
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,572
You picked it up here in the office.
It's not confirmed...

205
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,117
but it seems like a story.

206
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,495
Go ahead and print it.

207
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,042
And I had no idea you're doing this.

208
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,924
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

209
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,428
Well, it looks to me like

210
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,139
the Underwood campaign
had a Muslim visiting the US

211
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,559
wrongly arrested in order to
influence the vote on Election Day.

212
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,726
And if you believe that,

213
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,438
then you have to ask some questions
about the impact this had

214
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,814
on the results in Tennessee,

215
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,650
where President Underwood
was predicted to lose.

216
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:05,654
We all know that ICO is a real threat.
Nobody is denying that, and I...

217
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,286
No calls get through to me, not today.

218
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,829
And if you get pressed,

219
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,539
the White House has no comment.

220
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:16,790
Yes, sir.

221
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:18,750
Close the door behind you, please.

222
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,257
What do you know about this?

223
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,861
First of all, what are you getting at?

224
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,596
And secondly, if I had any information,
I wouldn't be keeping it to myself.

225
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,933
Seth, I am asking you straight up.

226
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,393
If you know anything, you tell me now.

227
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,146
- Don't make me find out.
- Or what?

228
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,858
What are you gonna do, Doug?

229
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,819
You gonna suffocate me
with a White House mug?

230
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,031
The shit is hitting the fan

231
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,451
and we're all going to be covered in it
if we don't get to work.

232
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,871
Now... can I please get back to it?

233
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,629
Shit.

234
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,883
We're essentially turning on
an apparatus that's already in place.

235
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,177
We'll enable audio capabilities.

236
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,514
All calls, e-mails, messages
in and out of the White House

237
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,557
will be monitored and archived.

238
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,269
Every phone call will be recorded
as we search for the leak.

239
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,437
Video surveillance?

240
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,817
- We can install additional devices, but...
- We use what's already there.

241
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,903
It enables us to look and listen in
on every computer

242
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,281
and every cell phone
of everyone working for us.

243
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,076
We'll set up a satellite office
limited to Mr. Stamper and myself.

244
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,804
Assistant Director Green and I will bring
whatever is valuable forward.

245
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,414
I want direct access.

246
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,915
Live streaming.

247
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,639
I assure you, Mr. President,
we'll bring you anything of substance.

248
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,796
Do it.

249
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,258
And needless to say...

250
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,343
I report only to you, sir.

251
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,602
- I wanna know who did this to me.
- I'm on it, sir.

252
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,392
You're having doubts about Doug?

253
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,824
- Why? Are you?
- No, I'm just...

254
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,744
I'm questioning everything,
I guess.

255
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,084
Until this is resolved, you and I should
be very careful about what we say or do.

256
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,295
And our personal needs
have to be put aside.

257
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,382
You know people.
You know them for years.

258
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,678
And then... suddenly they're like
strangers in your kitchen.

259
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,765
Familiar can turn foreign on a dime.

260
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:49,360
- Is there anything I can do?
- You can be quiet.

261
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,196
Doug, I am not the leak here.
You know that.

262
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
- I'll be in touch.
- Don't hang up.

263
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,369
Do I need to make a list of the risks
I've taken for this administration?

264
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,579
Things I have never done before.

265
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,748
Let's just talk in person, okay?

266
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,427
Yes?

267
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,429
LeAnn Harvey, please.

268
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,515
- Who is it?
- FBI.

269
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,364
If you think of anything,
that's my cell at the bottom of the card.

270
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,783
Was it a suicide?

271
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,910
Barrel of the gun was pressed
against his eye, so...

272
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,872
You were his contact.
Would he do something like that?

273
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,833
I don't think so.

274
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,959
Well, maybe he didn't.

275
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,131
- And the gun?
- That's the thing. It's not there.

276
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,302
Maybe someone staying at the hotel
or working there took it.

277
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,099
You'll let me know?

278
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,976
Yeah. Sure.

279
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,492
Mark...

280
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:24,830
the vice president and I
have discussed it and...

281
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,998
we've come around to your position.

282
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,209
Very good.

283
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,962
Uh, considering the news that's breaking,
it's not going to be quite as easy.

284
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,298
Any idea where this story came from?

285
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,633
No, not yet. But I will soon.

286
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,637
I'll let it be known that
you're open to censure.

287
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,053
And you should be aware.

288
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,930
It's not surprising.

289
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,933
Romero is moving over
to the Judiciary Committee.

290
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,602
Well, why wouldn't he?

291
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,830
He wants to see this through.
He's still coming after me.

292
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,566
Hmm, well, I imagine leadership
from both parties has had enough of him.

293
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,737
Yeah, I don't want to diminish this.
We are in damage control.

294
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,614
Claire, I think...

295
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,284
it might be best for you
to stay out of this as much as possible.

296
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,662
No, I... I will defend the president.

297
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,749
Vice presidential business as usual
is the way to play it, I think.

298
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,085
You need to trust my instincts
on this one.

299
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,629
- Okay.
- Thank you, Mark.

300
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,796
Thank you.

301
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,804
You may not always agree with him,
but you like him.

302
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,889
I like his clarity.

303
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,392
Let's just not forget, his candidate lost.

304
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,643
And now he works for you.

305
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,604
No, I think he's really working for you,
isn't he?

306
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,063
Don't get paranoid, Francis.

307
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,982
If not now, when?

308
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,299
You have to go.

309
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,053
I what?

310
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,971
You need to leave.

311
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,686
What's happened?

312
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,942
There's just no place for you
here anymore.

313
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:22,406
Have you been thinking about this?

314
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:24,450
Yes.

315
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,751
I don't agree.

316
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm completely clear about it.

317
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,600
You can finish your coffee.

318
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,688
Wow.

319
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,612
How do you do that?

320
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,329
Just... turn off like that?

321
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,959
Please go, Tom.

322
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,964
Go.

323
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,760
Okay.

324
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,640
If that's what you choose.

325
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,245
Join us?

326
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:55,081
No, I'm trying not to wear out
the new model.

327
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,334
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

328
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,504
Well, I'll get right to it, Frank. Um...

329
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:05,300
Well, for once,
the House Republicans...

330
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,719
are getting something done.

331
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,097
And the bad news is,
is that thing is impeaching you.

332
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,851
Oh, I think the judiciary is a long way
from making any sort of decision.

333
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,312
They're sending articles
of impeachment to the House

334
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,189
in the next few days, I'm told.

335
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,443
And that news this morning is
just adding fuel to the fire.

336
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,736
Jesus Christ.

337
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,865
And I'm here to ask if you...

338
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,749
Would you consider resigning instead
of dragging this through the Senate?

339
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,962
Have the two of you lost your minds?

340
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,923
And you, Terry,
you're under investigation yourself

341
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,676
and you dare come here and ask me this?

342
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,595
I've often hated your guts,

343
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,013
but I have to admit, I'll miss you.

344
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,308
Oh, Bob, in case you've forgotten,
the Senate is Democratic.

345
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,894
- I won't be leaving anytime soon.
- Oh, not you.

346
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,396
Me. I'm getting too old for this.

347
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,565
What?

348
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,527
A House without Bob Birch?
It will be unrecognizable.

349
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,029
I feel like it already is. God...

350
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,741
Was it always this dirty?

351
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,035
That's impossible.

352
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,580
Were the men before us any more moral?

353
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:21,084
Any more worthy of the power and position
that they had found themselves in?

354
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,838
Any more capable of doing
a single goddamn thing for the public?

355
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,673
Well, yes and no.

356
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,760
History has a way
of looking better than it was.

357
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:34,472
Or perhaps Shakespeare was right.
We're all just madmen leading the blind.

358
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,911
Ms. Lee. This is Seth Grayson,
from the White House.

359
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,456
Yeah, thank you for taking my call.

360
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,711
Uh... I just had a question.

361
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,379
There, uh... there was a reporter.

362
00:25:06,462 --> 00:25:08,674
Give me a second.
Let me just check my notes.

363
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,719
Um... name's Sean Jeffries.

364
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,140
Yeah, he's working on a story
about the donor list,

365
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:19,851
around the time
of the president's transplant.

366
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:26,024
I was wondering if you could come in
and we can coordinate our response.

367
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,819
Ms. Lee,

368
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:33,198
we don't want people to think that
the president got preferential treatment.

369
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,258
Jesus.

370
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,597
What the hell did you give me, Mac?

371
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,831
- Jesus.

372
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,041
What the hell did you give me, Mac?

373
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,514
I had a tip on where
that Slugline story came from.

374
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:40,682
You should have called me.

375
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,100
That wouldn't have stopped it.

376
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,436
- Is that why you're here?
- No, I got something else.

377
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,938
Tell me.

378
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,357
I'd like to talk to the vice president
about it.

379
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,942
That's not possible.

380
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,653
Everything goes through me.

381
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:56,948
Well, I didn't have a chance
to explain myself.

382
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:58,950
...That's too bad.

383
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,202
What's she like?

384
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:05,916
She doesn't suffer fools
and she doesn't give second chances.

385
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,669
Well, if you can't
get me in to talk to her again,

386
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,753
I'll find some other way.

387
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,504
You're in over your head.

388
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,590
Tell me what you know or move along.

389
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,302
No.

390
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,102
We don't,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

391
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,522
Whatever information you have...

392
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,736
Don't call me again.

393
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,928
I was concerned
I was out of line the other night.

394
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,179
You might have been.

395
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,157
I'm sorry. I don't even know
what I'm saying sometimes.

396
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,390
Forget it.

397
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,576
- Hey, hang on a second.
- Hey.

398
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,440
I need to tell you how I'm feeling.
The nation needs you, Mr. President.

399
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,914
- We all need you.
- We're done for today.

400
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,939
- No.
- No?

401
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,000
Why don't you want to hear
what I'm trying to tell you?

402
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,067
Listen. You... enough.

403
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,194
I love you. You need to know that.

404
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,947
- I'm only here to protect you.
- You need to calm down.

405
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,424
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you wanna hear

406
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,259
what I'm telling you?
- There is nothing wrong with me.

407
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,701
But you need to go home.

408
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,038
You reached out to me.
You brought me in. I...

409
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,331
Enough.

410
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,467
- I'm sorry.
- He's out.

411
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,676
I'll come back later.

412
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,553
Whatever it is, I can give it to him.

413
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,225
You can trust me to hand it over, Doug.

414
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,365
- You weren't directed to follow Tom Yates.
- Yes, I was.

415
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,244
According to the president,
everyone needs to be watched.

416
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,205
Tom's not even here anymore.

417
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,582
Francis asked you to follow him?

418
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,261
I'm concerned about someone.

419
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,389
Laura Moretti.

420
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,645
I know about her... and her husband.

421
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,024
Your behavior shows poor judgment, Doug,

422
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,526
and could be a liability
for the president.

423
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,029
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,490
Give these to Francis when he gets back.

425
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,547
I can get you immunity.

426
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,549
You just need to tell the truth.

427
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,053
Confirm that all
of Walker's testimony is true.

428
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,554
You don't have to do it.

429
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:09,933
No, Maureen, I want this on the record.

430
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,560
How dare you betray
the Underwoods like this?

431
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,855
We're done here, Congressman.

432
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,023
Well, thank you for your time.

433
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,900
So you're prepared,

434
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,278
a subpoena will be coming soon
from the Judiciary Committee.

435
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,868
Madam Secretary.

436
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,611
Do you wanna come in?

437
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,870
I'm the reason your husband's dead.

438
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,709
I forced the Secretary
of Health and Human Services...

439
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,548
to put Francis Underwood
in front of him on the donor list.

440
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,891
I understand if you think I'm a monster.

441
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,562
But I'd do it again.

442
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,318
To save the president, I'd do anything.

443
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,076
You really think that I didn't know, Doug?

444
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,165
The timing gave it away.

445
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,752
Come on. Come on in.

446
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:09,135
What did you think was going on here?

447
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:11,762
Huh?

448
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,268
I'm not fucking you because I like you.
I'm fucking you because I hate you.

449
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,396
Get out.

450
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,941
Get out of my car.

451
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,193
Get the fuck out of my car.

452
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,820
Get out!

453
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,692
What did Macallan give you?

454
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,821
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I heard you.

455
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,783
You got something from him.

456
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,577
What do you mean you heard me?

457
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,085
Oh.

458
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,341
Were you watching me, too?

459
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,468
Who was he to you?

460
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,767
Want a drink?

461
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,398
I don't drink.

462
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,275
Oh, right.

463
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,077
I was with him.

464
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:01,372
When I was young
and shouldn't have been with him.

465
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:15,470
What gets you off, Doug?

466
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,930
Anything?

467
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,010
If Macallan gave you something,
we should hand it over.

468
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,859
Did you like it?

469
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,945
What?

470
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,157
Watching me.

471
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,207
Yes.

472
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,422
You liked what you saw?

473
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,178
That why you came here?

474
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,151
Well, then.

475
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,402
Going to the gym.
Run off some of this stress.

476
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:57,238
Where's your trainer?

477
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:01,409
Oh, he won't be coming around for a while.

478
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,414
He did have a facial expression
I won't miss.

479
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,125
Is that so?

480
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,587
Hmm. Sort of perma-smile.
It was creepy.

481
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,298
Maybe he's just happy.

482
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,302
Happiness isn't my concern.

483
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,846
Not now, not ever.

484
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,397
It's a tragic situation, Claire.

485
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,899
- I know.
- I could show you what's happening.

486
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,401
I've seen the images.

487
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:39,530
It's important people know
what's going on in Homs.

488
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:43,326
- Are you having second thoughts?
- It's just the timing isn't right yet.

489
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,995
Because your husband
doesn't have the support.

490
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,288
We need to make a case.

491
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,540
Prepare the world
for when you make a statement.

492
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,960
I think Francis needs to be
front and center on this.

493
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,590
You never found out
what Macallan told Petrov?

494
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,427
My sources say
he never gave him anything concrete.

495
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,472
- Well, he gave LeAnn something.
- Well, that was our hope.

496
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,642
Maybe it's time to invite her back in.

497
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,271
Maybe.
I need to get back upstairs.

498
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,189
The next time we meet
will be in my office.

499
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,069
I... I don't think your husband should be
front and center.

500
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,073
I think it should be you.

501
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,953
- I didn't ask you what you think.
- You need to be armed, Claire.

502
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,417
It's important that you can walk away
from anything that happens to him.

503
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,470
They can kiss my ass.

504
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,889
I got an offer from Senator Westervelt.

505
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:50,810
I'm looking, too. But it's getting
harder and harder to get off this ship.

506
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,033
Where is my wife?

507
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,661
Where has she gone?

508
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,457
If she was your wife, wouldn't you wonder?

509
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,021
Yes, Mrs. Underwood.

510
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,131
Hey.

511
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,551
...Don't worry. This never happened.

512
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,346
You don't have to tell me.

513
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:14,560
- Doug.
- Shit.

514
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,187
Should I come in?

515
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,692
No. Not until you give me what you've got.

516
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,366
Mr. President.

517
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,745
"A source
deep within the White House...

518
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:39,419
confirms President Underwood used
questionable intelligence

519
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:45,007
to justify voting center closures,
which threw the election into chaos."

520
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,053
Who do you think it is?

521
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,140
Green, probably.

522
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,976
- We overestimated his loyalty.
- I see.

523
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,397
I mean...

524
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,857
who else could it be?

525
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,319
How can I help?

526
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,323
We need to save ourselves here.

527
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,868
- It's as much your head as mine, Cathy.
- I understand.

528
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:35,015
I need you to create additional documents
that justify going after Kalabi.

529
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,309
A paper trail that will

530
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:41,063
support our actions that we took
on Election Day in Tennessee.

531
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,108
I'm not sure...

532
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,444
what those documents would be.

533
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,172
Well, but you're smart, Cathy, aren't you?
I mean, you can figure it out.

534
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,824
Why don't you just show me
how smart you are.

535
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,538
- Of course, Mr. President.
- And the presentation at the UN.

536
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,583
- With Syria?
- It needs to happen.

537
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,628
- Very well.
- There's a possibility of talks,

538
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:08,340
but we need to get all
the interested parties back to the table.

539
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:09,592
Of course.

540
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,764
You're a good diplomat, Cathy.

541
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,850
Thank you, Mr. President.

542
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,894
And where is Claire?

543
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,104
She needed a little distance right now.

544
00:41:22,187 --> 00:41:24,815
Till we find out what's happening with me.

545
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:29,570
That's why I need
to rely on you, Cathy. Now.

546
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:36,035
Well, I'm glad you feel that way, Francis.

547
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,856
Yes. I'm ready to meet.

548
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,400
I wanna meet now. Right now.

549
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,339
After a tumultuous election,

550
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,633
the likes of which have never been seen,

551
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,944
America faces more questions...

552
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,321
Shit is insane right now.
I don't have any more time for you.

553
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,764
If the recent leaks coming out
of the White House

554
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,534
prove to be true,
the president could face...

555
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,184
A White House ID?
Where did you get that?

556
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:45,437
- I thought this came from you.
- What the hell are you talking about?

557
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,941
- I'm deputy press secretary.
- The fuck you are.

558
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,587
I got a call from the vice president's
office, asking me to come in.

559
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,403
And when I got here,
this was waiting for me.

560
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,698
I just spent the last hour
doing my paperwork.

561
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,950
I don't have time for this.

562
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,870
President Garrett Walker's
bombshell testimony, which...

563
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,665
I have Secretary Durant's resignation.
I believe she was the leak,

564
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,127
and might have to take responsibility
for whatever happened on election night.

565
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,756
Sir, the judiciary could issue
a resolution for impeachment any day now.

566
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,340
We need to be realistic

567
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:16,135
about damage to the president
even if the Senate doesn't convict.

568
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,511
You promised us censure.

569
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,972
Well, Durant's leak took care of that,
didn't it?

570
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,849
So, we have a plan for the Senate.

571
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,351
I suggest we work on protecting
the vice president.

572
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,064
Make sure she exits
this whole process unscathed.

573
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,608
And how do we do that?

574
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:35,529
Plead ignorance. The vice president wasn't
read into anything.

575
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,406
Didn't know anything.

576
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,283
- Didn't do anything.
- That won't play.

577
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,244
She'll look uninformed,
and the people know she isn't.

578
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:44,496
Oh, the distance will help her
look innocent.

579
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,208
Innocent, guilty,
capable, incompetent, whatever it is...

580
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,378
the public is going to think the opposite.

581
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,131
So, really there is no winning.

582
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,550
Whatever you think is best.

583
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,136
You're gonna have four years
to prove yourself

584
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,097
on the inside if I'm acquitted.
Hopefully, eight.

585
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,224
But what happens if I'm not acquitted?

586
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,535
We don't have to deal with that right now.

587
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,412
No, I want to hear a plan.
That's why you're here.

588
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,854
To give me the cold, hard facts.

589
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,523
Oh, your calculus is as good as mine,
Mr. President.

590
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:13,067
There is no plan.

591
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,321
Except slow down judiciary,
secure the Senate.

592
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,377
I'm concerned about someone.

593
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,671
Laura Moretti.

594
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,673
Why did you include this?

595
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,134
You and Claire talking
about a Laura Moretti?

596
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,805
I wanted you to know, sir, that she knows.

597
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,600
I jumped you on the list.

598
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,643
To receive a donor liver.

599
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,271
I forced the HHS Secretary to move you up.

600
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,024
- That's not possible.
- I threatened her, sir.

601
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:58,738
It was an unprecedented ethical violation.
But I don't regret it.

602
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,118
I kept it to myself, so that you would...

603
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,037
have plausible deniability
if anyone found out.

604
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,082
I didn't tell Mrs. Underwood either.

605
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,209
She learned another way.

606
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,295
She knew and didn't tell me.

607
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,297
Seems so.

608
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,596
And how did she react
to the Yates surveillance?

609
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:23,345
What did she say about that?

610
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,973
She didn't show her feelings to me, sir.

611
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,478
Hmm.

612
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,150
You saved my life.

613
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,654
I'm here for you, sir.

614
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,489
Always.

615
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:49,830
Do you have concerns about Mrs. Underwood?

616
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,332
- Do you?
- I would never say that.

617
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,628
I want to show you something.

618
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,302
There's 45 minutes where I can't
account for her whereabouts.

619
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,846
I don't know where she went
or who she saw.

620
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,598
But she lied to me.

621
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,030
I, uh... I think you should
get some rest, sir.

622
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,883
The president didn't read me in.

623
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:45,344
I wasn't in the room.

624
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,848
The president didn't read me in.

625
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,265
I wasn't in the room.

626
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:53,102
I didn't know anything about it.

627
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,897
The president didn't read me in.

628
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,942
I wasn't in the room.

629
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,111
I didn't know anything about it.

630
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,907
How's that, Francis?

631
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:22,047
This is just in.
Secretary of State Catherine Durant

632
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,009
to appear in front
of the House Judiciary Committee.

633
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,845
This comes as yet another surprise
in the already dramatic...

634
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,848
- When did it come in?
- A short while ago.

635
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,600
It's not Cathy Durant.

636
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,852
Are we sure?

637
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,271
She negotiated immunity.

638
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,732
And she's going on record with everything
she knows when she testifies.

639
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:48,365
Do we have any idea?

640
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,534
No.

641
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,125
Good.

642
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,418
Thanks.
