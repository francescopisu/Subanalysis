1
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,735
The general talked about
killing the president.

2
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:53,155
That, along with Conway's outburst
on the plane...

3
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,824
- That sounds worse than it was.
- No, that sounds exactly as bad as it was.

4
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,576
What's surprising to me is...

5
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,471
the campaign couldn't get
their hands around this.

6
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,598
I mean, Harry Marshall is as good
as they come, but...

7
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,333
First they denied,
and then they equivocated...

8
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,937
I mean, that's just, like, ridiculous.

9
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,421
You just come out,
"I apologize. We misspoke."

10
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,648
Everybody knows the drill here.

11
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,312
And it's not like the Republicans
rushed in to save the day either.

12
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,178
- Uh, off message throughout.
- They got quiet.

13
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,596
Which I will never understand.

14
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,225
Will Conway was a rising star
in the party.

15
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,187
Look, it's hard to compete
with the Underwood machine.

16
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,273
Oh, God. Let's not do the whole
"black helicopters" crazy stuff.

17
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:29,399
...It's ridiculous.

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,109
Look, we need to accept
Underwood won the election.

19
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,994
People need to accept the outcome
and move on.

20
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,572
I'm gonna agree with Van.

21
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,075
I think we need to take a moment
to appreciate the Constitution.

22
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,078
- It bent, but it never broke.
- That's right.

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,665
And in the end, as we all know,
it came down to the Electoral College.

24
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,419
You don't have to say the words, Governor.

25
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,923
I think I do.

26
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,929
Congratulations, Mr. President Elect.

27
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,268
- There's no script for this one?
- Country first, sir.

28
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,229
I'm glad to hear you say that, Will.

29
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:11,274
I want to start to help the country
heal again.

30
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,734
Are we done?

31
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,070
We are done. But Will...

32
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,370
I would very much like to show the country
that our two parties can work together.

33
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:29,876
So I was hoping that you might consider
becoming my transportation secretary.

34
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,589
I think it would send a powerful message
if you agreed to join my cabinet.

35
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:41,095
You think I'd... make a good...
transportation secretary?

36
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,139
Oh, yes.

37
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,808
That's what you give
the congressman from nowhere.

38
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,809
I'll be declining.

39
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,688
Well, I'm so sorry to hear that, Will.
And I wanted to wish you the very best.

40
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,566
You and your wishes
can go fuck yourselves!

41
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,830
What do I do now?

42
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,182
...everyone thought
it would happen.

43
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,086
No one thought that
Underwood would win again...

44
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,336
I don't know.

45
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,052
Acknowledging defeat
is never easy.

46
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,264
Doing it in public
is a living hell.

47
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,560
- Well, at least the cameras like him.

48
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,320
Do I look satisfied?

49
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,573
You look somewhat satisfied.

50
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,785
- Good.
- Not good. Francis, enjoy this moment.

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:49,372
- You deserve it.
- You mean "we."

52
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,792
We made it to the other side.

53
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,586
Yes.

54
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,839
But what is on the other side?

55
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,174
Victory.

56
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,927
With a whiff of defeat.

57
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:08,641
It's taken a long time to get here,
but we're here. Cheers, Francis.

58
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,520
Everything gets easier from now on.

59
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,522
Mmm.

60
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,120
They're ready for you.

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,043
- Hannah.
- I don't want to go.

62
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,227
- Hey.
- No.

63
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,611
Fine.

64
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,489
I'll do it on my own.

65
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,618
I'm gonna say, this is a crucial moment.
For both of you. How you handle tonight.

66
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,038
The party abandoned me. Your party.

67
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,207
I'm not the Republican Party, Will.

68
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,335
I work for candidates.

69
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:20,672
I worked for you.

70
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,758
Listen, you lost.

71
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,429
But more than half the country
still considers you their president.

72
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,764
This is what's required.
Go down there, give your speech.

73
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,644
Concede.

74
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,767
As I accept all of your letters
of resignation

75
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,810
and dissolve my old cabinet,

76
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,189
I wanna welcome each and every one of you
to my new cabinet.

77
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,321
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Cathy.

78
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,533
And I especially wanna thank my wife.

79
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,036
Madam Vice President...

80
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,541
thank you for your unending
and unwavering support.

81
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:24,003
Your steady hand kept this country
running this past month.

82
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:29,425
I owe her more than I can possibly fathom.
And she owes me.

83
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,388
Not true. You were with me all the way.

84
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:40,603
I would like to make my first 100 days
as the duly elected president

85
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:44,481
as productive as possible.
Of course, there are many challenges.

86
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,110
Shoring up the economy,
securing our nation from ICO

87
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,864
and reducing unemployment.
But the biggest challenge that we face,

88
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,367
and the one that I'm going to need
all of your help on,

89
00:08:55,451 --> 00:09:00,497
is reuniting a country that has never been
more divided than it is today.

90
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,918
I believe we can meet this challenge,

91
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,295
and that's where I'm gonna need
all of your help.

92
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:11,926
So let's let the healing begin today
and let's make history together.

93
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,428
I thank you all
for your continued service.

94
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,138
Now let's get back to work.

95
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,824
I need a minute.

96
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,037
I think we should see what we can do
about making Usher persona non grata.

97
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,290
I don't think that's wise to start a war.
We've just won the White House.

98
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,627
This is exactly when we should strike.

99
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,437
This is a moment
that we have the political capital...

100
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,464
Usher needs to be managed carefully.

101
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:52,049
Mr. President?

102
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,427
Take a breath, Doug.
We've only just landed on our feet here.

103
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,221
Sir, Madam Vice President,

104
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:59,974
this is the type of person
that we used to crucify in the House.

105
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,226
Yes, but we're not in the House now.
We're here.

106
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,022
We have a full term ahead of us.
There's gonna be a great deal

107
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,305
that we're gonna be able to accomplish,
the three of us.

108
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,402
I appreciate that, sir.

109
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,905
But Mark Usher will become a problem.

110
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,491
Well, everyone becomes a problem,
eventually.

111
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,204
...LeAnn's out.

112
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,081
What?

113
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,919
Why?

114
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,466
She screwed up.

115
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,261
Well, is it something
I need to get ready for?

116
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:39,806
The Underwoods want this
handled indirectly.

117
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,224
So what exactly are we saying?

118
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,310
She's being pushed out.

119
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:48,272
Okay, but the campaign's over.
Is it necessary to say anything?

120
00:10:48,355 --> 00:10:53,319
We need to distance this administration
from her and her work. Her tactics.

121
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,405
So it needs to be a leak.

122
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,992
Reach out to the people who don't like us.
They'll be prime to go with it.

123
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,161
Okay, so when we respond...

124
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,163
- On the record or...
- On.

125
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,209
What did she do?

126
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,378
She showed some very poor judgment.

127
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,090
I'm trusting you to be discreet.

128
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,677
We won, Seth. Changes need to be made.

129
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:24,308
You know I'm off politics.
Surprised you reached out to me.

130
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,936
You're a highly-respected
journalist.

131
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,938
Just here for the inauguration
and the parties.

132
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,022
Hmm.

133
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,401
So I imagine you've heard
that I'm on the outs.

134
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,445
They're not telling the whole story.

135
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,031
So what happened?

136
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,119
An acquaintance of mine stole
classified documents from the NSA

137
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,703
and took off to Russia.

138
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,749
They're blaming me for it.

139
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,753
What did this acquaintance take?

140
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:55,798
That's just the thing.
I have no idea.

141
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,843
If you could find him, talk to him,

142
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,096
he would tell you
that I had nothing to do with this.

143
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,062
Who is he? What's his name?

144
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,274
Aidan Macallan.

145
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,277
He'll talk to you.
He respects you.

146
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,614
Tell him that I'm okay.

147
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,617
That I'm going to be okay.

148
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,871
I'm a firm believer
in boots on the ground.

149
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,165
Well, we're there for the oil.
Let's not pretend.

150
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,751
Oh, I'm not denying how crucial it is
to protect the oil supply.

151
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,255
But it's in the world's best interest
that we're the ones keeping an eye on it.

152
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,133
- On the world or the oil?
- Both.

153
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,054
Oh. Well, that explains
your strong interest in Antarctica.

154
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,640
I do focus on things and people.

155
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:50,394
I tend to get attached, but I think
it makes me better at what I do.

156
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,022
And what are you focused on now?

157
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,609
Petrov. Ahmed Al Ahmadi. To begin with.

158
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,033
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

159
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,497
I just...
Uh... I'll run this by you tomorrow.

160
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,375
Yes, tomorrow.

161
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,213
Sorry for the interruption.

162
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,550
He's one of our speechwriters.

163
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,761
Tom Yates has quite a reputation.

164
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,641
Well, if his books are any indication,
he has lived quite a life.

165
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,311
My father wore striped socks.

166
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,234
Do you think the president will be
sympathetic to our agenda?

167
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,988
"Our agenda"? That's very presumptuous.

168
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,158
Well, there are regions in the world that
are important to our national security

169
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,952
and they have to be protected.

170
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,287
Would you like to join us
at the inaugural ball?

171
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,497
Oh, no, I can't.

172
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,917
Something terrible always happens
when I go to a party.

173
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:01,632
Uh, by the way,
my husband is not managed by anyone.

174
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,426
- That's not what I'm asking.
- Isn't it?

175
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,931
I'm asking for your help,
Madam Vice President. That is all.

176
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,104
Evening.

177
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,275
Oh, my God. Come in.
I'm sorry. Sit down, sit down.

178
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,567
Aren't we working out tonight?

179
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,570
Oh, I just don't think
I'm gonna have the time for it.

180
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,782
- But come sit for a minute.
- If you're too busy, I understand...

181
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,201
No, no. Join me for a minute.
I want you to hear something.

182
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,547
"This is the dawn of a new era.

183
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,840
It's a time for peace.

184
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,470
A time to respect the past
and embrace the future.

185
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,805
A time..."

186
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,481
Time to what?

187
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,069
"A time to hear all the voices.

188
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,988
For there is nothing more lonely...

189
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,658
or terrifying...

190
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,246
than feeling unheard."

191
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,753
- What do you think?
- It's interesting. I like it.

192
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,299
- This is for...
- My inauguration, yes.

193
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,195
Where does it go from there?
What do you say?

194
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,887
Uh, uh...

195
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,683
"America, I hear you.

196
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:39,939
Whether you voted for me or not,
I hear all of you."

197
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,651
Now, what do you think
my great-great-great-grandfather

198
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,403
would think of all this?

199
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,076
- Awesome.

200
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,412
- In the original sense of the word.
- Yeah.

201
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,125
How long you in town for?

202
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,752
Leaving tonight, actually.

203
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,629
I thought you were here
for the inauguration.

204
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,299
- I got a tip I have to move on.
- Mmm. What's the tip?

205
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,093
- Mmm-mmm.

206
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,470
We used to have a rule about shoptalk.

207
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,763
- Did we?
- Mmm-hmm.

208
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,348
Fair enough.

209
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,521
What's your read on LeAnn Harvey?

210
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,984
That she's hard to read.
That's what I like about her.

211
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,111
- You trust her?

212
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:29,863
Kate, come on.

213
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,039
You look tired.

214
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,582
I'm working eight days a week.

215
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,837
I mean, you always looked tired, but now
you look tired in a... not sexy way.

216
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,216
Sorry to disappoint.

217
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,260
I actually have to get back there
in a minute.

218
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,138
Oh, it's little late
to head back to the office, right?

219
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,893
I've been there since last Tuesday.

220
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,646
Honestly...

221
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,232
I know this sounds weird...

222
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,444
There's no place I'd rather be.

223
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:16,452
The way you say that sounds so... rote.

224
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,620
I don't know...

225
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,167
What am I supposed to say to that?

226
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,090
I just want to know how you're doing,
that's all.

227
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,218
I'm just asking about you,
this person I'm sitting with.

228
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,061
Where'd you go, Tom Yates?

229
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,616
- Hi.
- I was looking for you.

230
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,077
Not very hard, then.

231
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,246
I need to talk to you.

232
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,415
Okay.

233
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,376
I'm done.

234
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,922
With the speechwriting,
I don't want to do it anymore.

235
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,343
I want to get back to some other stuff
I was working on.

236
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,555
No offense. I mean,
I know writing speeches is writing...

237
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,267
but it's not what I really wanna do.

238
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,980
Okay.

239
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,442
You sure?

240
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,154
Yes.

241
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,533
We'll transition you out.

242
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,495
But you'll need to have a reason
to be here.

243
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,880
Special advisor? Are you kidding me?

244
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,526
- There's speculation that he's already...
- It's not speculation, Seth.

245
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,178
People know that Mark Usher
is working for us in some capacity.

246
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,346
- I mean, isn't that enough?
- Clean up this release.

247
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,848
Uh, reaching across party lines,
that sort of thing.

248
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,535
- And get it ready, just in case.
- Of course.

249
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,560
That's it.

250
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,399
I know you're not happy about this.

251
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,461
- What has he done to earn the title?
- This is not about him earning anything.

252
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,198
He's already getting classified memos.
Why does she want this?

253
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,908
"She"?

254
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,164
I'm sorry. The vice president.

255
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,917
What she wants is
for this administration to succeed.

256
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,713
And what I want is for you
to befriend him. Get to know him.

257
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,467
We want him to think he's managing us
while we're busy managing him.

258
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,055
She has been pursuing Francis Underwood
for a long time.

259
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,308
- I don't wanna talk to her.
- Aidan...

260
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,851
How does she even know I'm here?

261
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,144
Miss Baldwin is a very good journalist.

262
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,773
Yeah, going public
will not help you, or me.

263
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,361
You'll tell her how you manipulated
the American mood, hmm?

264
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,530
- How you helped steal an election.
- That would be it for me.

265
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,075
You're a valued guest
of the Russian state.

266
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,245
I want my passport back.

267
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,163
An American passport is the last thing
that will keep you safe.

268
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,790
I'll take my chances.

269
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,257
This will make you famous, hmm?
A whistle-blower.

270
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,549
I don't wanna be famous.

271
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,637
But you do want to be free.

272
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,399
You spent $15,000 at The Capital Grille?
What the fuck are you eating?

273
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,068
- This is Romero using the House Ethics...
- It's a liability.

274
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,778
And you should know better.

275
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,113
How did you not disclose this, Terry?

276
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,366
I want to pull him off
his committee assignments.

277
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,951
Put him on Science.
See how he likes NASA briefings.

278
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,745
I'd like to hold off on that.

279
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,623
Romero's about to become
an ally to the president.

280
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,376
And why's that?

281
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,629
Because he was able
to find out about your tab.

282
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,923
It's because he's relentless.

283
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:02,177
Because in four years,
35% of the vote in Arizona will be Latino.

284
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,472
Because he's the future.

285
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,894
This is how it starts.

286
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,606
I gotta get back to the Hill.

287
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,025
You know, Doug...

288
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:21,488
you and I, we've been around long enough
to see the guard change.

289
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,158
And it changes because the people
at the top forget how they got there.

290
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,995
Romero's trying to change the guard, Doug.

291
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,872
And we are the guard.

292
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,131
If Congressman Womack has nothing to hide,
he has nothing to fear.

293
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,802
We all have something to hide,
Congressman Romero.

294
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,513
It's time for a change in the leadership.

295
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,892
The president would like
to be a friend to you,

296
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,978
but you're making it very difficult.

297
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,985
We can guarantee the immigration ban
will be lifted in the next week.

298
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,112
Come on. Are we doing this again?

299
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,114
You offer me some racist gesture.

300
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,159
And I, what? I'm a friend forever?
Ban isn't even sustainable.

301
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,495
What matters to you?

302
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,222
- The president's attention.
- You have it.

303
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,665
- His full attention...
- You know, that's enough.

304
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,881
What is it that you really want?

305
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,092
I want Medicare coverage
bumped up to where it was.

306
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:28,263
There are retirees in my district.

307
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,307
We're here now
because you want a bump in Medicare?

308
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,018
Come on, Congressman.

309
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:35,979
And two seats to the inauguration.

310
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:38,399
- We are two days out.
- On the dais.

311
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,942
You are going about this entirely wrong.

312
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,406
You came here. You asked me.

313
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,907
I'm telling you.

314
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,325
I want to be there
when Francis Underwood says to me

315
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,369
that there will be an increase
in Medicare.

316
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,121
He does that, I'm his friend.

317
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:56,708
Well, I think I speak for the president
when I say that's not going to happen.

318
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,961
Mr. Stamper, I really appreciate
all the work you do for him,

319
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:04,007
but you and I know
that my bloc is growing.

320
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,968
All I'm looking for is a line
in his address.

321
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,972
Two seats and a line.

322
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,561
- The balls on him.
- I told him it was highly doubtful.

323
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,897
- I can get back to him with a firm no.
- Or you could give him a line.

324
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,191
His promises are unreliable.

325
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,570
Look, I know Alex.
We met on Conway's campaign.

326
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,904
Once he's in, he's in.

327
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,115
Sir, we have to be very careful
with what we're giving away.

328
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,160
He's capable of giving this administration
an enormous amount of grief.

329
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,370
He's asking for a gesture.

330
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,582
Oh, I'd say it's a little more than that.

331
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,417
I completely agree. He's going after
the people who got us here.

332
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,961
He's not wrong, is he?

333
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,325
There are some in leadership
whose time has come and gone.

334
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,635
Look... I'm just here to make sure
your four years turn into eight, but...

335
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,386
it's up to you, of course.

336
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:55,726
But we're talking about two seats...
one line...

337
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,980
Give him what he wants.

338
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,739
Alex.

339
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,867
Tilda. It's lovely to see you.

340
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,827
- How are you, Congressman?
- Oh, I'm fine.

341
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,121
It's good of you all to be here.
It's a big day.

342
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,790
Listen, why don't the two of you
take my seats?

343
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,518
Oh, thanks,
but we're already on the aisle.

344
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,960
I insist.

345
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,403
You'll be right in the president's
line of vision when he...

346
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,256
says what you want to hear.

347
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,175
Please. I can be anywhere.

348
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,344
Okay.

349
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,264
- Thank you, Mark.
- Sure.

350
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:42,648
I, Francis J. Underwood,
do solemnly swear...

351
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,859
I, Francis J. Underwood,
do solemnly swear...

352
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,403
That I will faithfully execute...

353
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,488
That I will faithfully execute...

354
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,491
The office
of President of the United States.

355
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,120
The office of Pres...
Yes, here we go again.

356
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,581
Secretary of State. That's what I wanted.

357
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,918
That's all I wanted.
That's what I was promised.

358
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:08,715
And now, here I am,
President of these United States.

359
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:14,470
You made this bed, America.
You voted for me.

360
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,642
Are you confused?

361
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,644
Are you afraid?

362
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,939
Because what you thought
you wanted is now here.

363
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:29,235
And there you are, staring back,
slack-jawed, bewildered,

364
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,322
wondering if this is what
you actually asked for.

365
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:37,410
This democracy,
your democracy, elected me.

366
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,639
And if you think it was hard getting here,

367
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,749
you're beginning to understand
what I'm willing to do to stay.

368
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,211
I look across at this crowd gathered today

369
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,714
and I know that
these are not my supporters.

370
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,717
I'm looking at people who are waiting,

371
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,511
with a smile on their face,
for their turn.

372
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,180
And the most vicious among them

373
00:25:57,263 --> 00:26:00,601
are the ones who are smiling
and clapping the hardest.

374
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,520
Power is a lot like real estate. Remember?

375
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,398
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

376
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,005
America, I hear you.

377
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,341
I hear all your voices.

378
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:37,053
I hear your struggles, your concerns,

379
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,642
but most of all, I hear your hope.

380
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:45,520
Opportunity and security is
what we all want.

381
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:49,482
And in my first 100 days,
I will reach across party lines

382
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:53,904
and devote my administration,
your government, to securing them.

383
00:26:53,987 --> 00:27:00,451
For too long we have ignored our seniors
and the healthcare they depend on.

384
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,416
That is why I am committed
to fixing Medicare

385
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,753
before I devote one more dime
to the program.

386
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,923
AmWorks was only the beginning.

387
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,426
We have to learn to live
without entitlements,

388
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:20,221
because we are not an entitled people.

389
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:25,435
I believe in your sweat.
I believe in your hard work.

390
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,230
And a job,
that's what I'll promise you today.

391
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,238
You couldn't give him one line?

392
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,657
We give no quarter
to those that are disloyal.

393
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,410
The message sent today
wasn't just for him.

394
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:45,538
- Alex feeds off of retribution.
- So do I.

395
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:48,083
- Is he worth the fight?
- There is no neutrality.

396
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,127
I expect total loyalty
or you are an enemy.

397
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,464
Understood, Mr. President.

398
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,678
What are you thinking?

399
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,559
# Let mortal tongues awake #

400
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,396
# Let all that breathe partake #

401
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,400
# Let rocks their silent break #

402
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,446
I have a soft spot
for that patriotic stuff.

403
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:31,209
Please spread your arms and legs.

404
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,585
Excuse me?

405
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:34,921
Otherwise, there is no interview.

406
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,054
And if you would please
take off your jacket.

407
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,725
- I'm a journalist.
- I know.

408
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,368
I read you when I was living in London.

409
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,687
- So I'm not a spy.
- I know you're not a spy.

410
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,024
Does anyone even use that word anymore?

411
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,987
So the interview won't be happening here.

412
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,948
- Uh, we agreed...
- We need to move you to another location.

413
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,993
Oh, and I'm sorry,
you cannot use your own crew.

414
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,747
- That's unacceptable.
- Then the interview will have to wait.

415
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,706
We cannot trust your people.

416
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,877
And you wouldn't want to endanger
Mr. Macallan, would you?

417
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,964
Are you coming, Miss Baldwin?

418
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,807
And your cell phone needs to stay here.

419
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,976
...Thank you.

420
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,445
You have a lot of support out there,

421
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,114
no matter what the president did
or didn't say.

422
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,241
There are people eager to work with you.

423
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,786
I should tell you...

424
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,790
I'm encouraging the Republicans to
restart the Declaration of War Committee,

425
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,792
to investigate the president.

426
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,252
That's bold.

427
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,297
- I'm not trying to impress you with that.
- It's risky.

428
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,301
You don't want an enemy
in the White House.

429
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,805
- But you're in the White House now.

430
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,140
And you're what to me?

431
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:13,353
Why don't you let me help you?

432
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,483
Everybody doesn't have to lose
for you to win, right?

433
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,488
Is Sean Jeffries there?

434
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:27,117
- Who's calling?
- Who's this?

435
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,160
I work for Tom Hammerschmidt.

436
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,496
I don't understand
why I was transferred to you.

437
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,625
The receptionist is a friend of mine.
I know him. She knows him.

438
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,086
Well, I've been trying
to reach him all day.

439
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,005
I can take a message.

440
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:44,009
- No, I'll try him later.
- Look, he doesn't work here anymore, so...

441
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,929
- I'm his girlfriend.
- That's all right.

442
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,766
- Who is this?
- Don't worry about it.

443
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:02,777
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.
I've got something for you.

444
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,155
LeAnn Harvey, she's being pushed out.

445
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,949
Yeah, she's out.

446
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:13,704
Yeah, well, you're the only one
that's got me telling you at this point.

447
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,833
Okay. I'm writing the release right now.

448
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,127
All right, bye.

449
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,052
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.

450
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,553
Yeah, I got something for you.

451
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:38,354
Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go,
but the FSB replaced the crew.

452
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,650
You have something on your tooth.

453
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,867
Do we know where they were going?

454
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,245
No, but they're still being tracked.

455
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,456
Kate Baldwin was never
supposed to talk to him.

456
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,600
- This interview cannot happen.
- We still have time.

457
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:00,418
No, we don't.

458
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:02,337
We need to go in.

459
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,422
And there might be some
unforeseen consequences.

460
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:13,181
I don't think Aidan would reveal anything
that would endanger me... or anyone else.

461
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,517
How far back do you and he go?

462
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,143
Far.

463
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,481
That's all.

464
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,609
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

465
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,445
I don't need your sympathy.

466
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,580
You almost ready?

467
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:44,879
God damn it. I can't find my "F."
Someone must have stolen it.

468
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,548
I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.

469
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,926
Tom, you look very handsome in a tuxedo.

470
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,596
I act like a man that can wear a tuxedo

471
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,599
and suddenly I'm a man
who can wear a tuxedo.

472
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:58,977
...This should do for now.

473
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,105
- I just saw that Eric Rawlings arrived.
- Yes.

474
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,900
Tom, we'll meet you downstairs
in just a few minutes.

475
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,110
Sure.

476
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:13,324
Stamper tells me that we'll have a bead
on Macallan's location

477
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,993
in about an hour or so.

478
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:19,289
I just spoke to Jane Davis.
Her contacts are ready and waiting.

479
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,043
- We'll have distance, Francis.
- We'll owe her.

480
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,134
You look very beautiful. Presidential.

481
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,971
You look beautiful. Vice Presidential.

482
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,526
Here we are.
The night of Zoe's death.

483
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,115
Who does that look like to you?

484
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,285
Just another white guy
waiting for the train.

485
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,912
Look closer.

486
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,796
I know who you think it might be, but...
I'm really not sure.

487
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,436
Yeah, shut that door.

488
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:31,069
Gerald Ford's son used to sneak up
these stairs to go to the roof,

489
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,987
play Led Zeppelin to his friends.

490
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,157
Teenagers are teenagers,
doesn't matter where.

491
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:41,871
And this... is where Viktor Petrov
put out his cigar.

492
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,629
- That guy seems like a real piece of work.
- Oh, believe me, he is.

493
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,007
So are you.

494
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,801
No, I don't know about that.

495
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,697
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

496
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,625
And what are you sorry about?

497
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,048
I thought you wanted something
that you don't.

498
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,844
So what is it that you think I wanted?

499
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,972
We can go back up. I'm...
I'm really s...

500
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,313
You know, they say the most vulnerable
part of the human body...

501
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,982
is the throat...

502
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,364
and that you never really know
how you feel about somebody...

503
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:04,495
until they have their hands
around your throat.

504
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,543
So tell me.

505
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,130
How do you feel now?

506
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,021
Congratulations, Mr. President.

507
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,460
Before I forget,
LeAnn Harvey wanted me to say hello.

508
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,588
How is she?

509
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,964
Well, she wanted me to tell you

510
00:36:57,047 --> 00:37:00,092
that she's... she's all right.
She's gonna be all right.

511
00:37:02,177 --> 00:37:03,846
What does that mean?

512
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,727
She's, um, taking a leave of absence.
Well, that's what they're calling it,

513
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,981
but it... it seems that she's being
pushed out of the administration.

514
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,151
- Mmm-hmm.
- She's the one who told me you were here.

515
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,694
Suggested I talk to you.

516
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:23,241
LeAnn hired you, isn't that right?

517
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,617
Friend of the family?

518
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,037
Uh...

519
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,917
Yeah, um,
are we starting the interview now?

520
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,421
No, no. We're just talking.
But we should be ready soon.

521
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,756
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,303
Can I, uh... Can I just have a second
before we start?

523
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,597
- I think so. Sure. Um...
- Okay.

524
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,435
Um... Yeah. I'm...
I'm gonna need some air.

525
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,737
No, I just... I just need a second, okay?

526
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,449
Of course. Get some air.

527
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,533
Okay.

528
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,997
Hey, hey, hey. I want your phone.

529
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,125
I need your phone. Take this.

530
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,169
One call.

531
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,089
One.

532
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,771
Hello?

533
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,356
LeAnn, it's me.

534
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:22,693
My God, Aidan.

535
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,446
I know you're in trouble.
Here's the plan.

536
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,448
All right. Get a pen.
Write down this number.

537
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,950
He... he's a lawyer.
He can get you out of the country.

538
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,370
Once you're in Russia, I can protect you.

539
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,705
I'm sorry.

540
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,416
Why?

541
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,881
Oh.

542
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,969
How long do I have
before they come and get me?

543
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,390
They're right outside.

544
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,808
And if I run?

545
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,062
Uh, people will get hurt.
You don't want to do that.

546
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,195
I like Texas.

547
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,155
Maybe it's the sun or the dust,

548
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:10,991
but people kind of squint
when they say hello.

549
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,535
I always liked that.

550
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,788
I never should've left.

551
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,958
You've always been very good to me.

552
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,710
I liked your mother.

553
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,171
I liked her a lot.

554
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,424
I'm really sorry.

555
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,675
Don't be.

556
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,886
There's a guard
on the second floor working with us.

557
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,598
He'll escort you to a corner
where a cab will be waiting.

558
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,390
Someone will open the door. Just...

559
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,977
get in.

560
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,394
So you don't miss Texas?

561
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,981
No, I do.

562
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,278
I'm trying
to find some peace with this

563
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,363
and you're not helping.

564
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,074
- Just a couple more questions.
- I'm moving, you know.

565
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,994
- I got a new job...
- Mr. Barnes?

566
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,455
They ruled your daughter's death
an accident.

567
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,914
I am starting to doubt that.

568
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:03,085
- Could we just go over one or two more...
- You know what?

569
00:41:03,168 --> 00:41:05,170
I just can't keep doing this.

570
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,381
- Stop calling me, please.

571
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,433
The interview
will not be happening.

572
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,435
Someone will escort you
back to your hotel.

573
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,865
Mr. President.

574
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,552
I hope I'm not too late to the party.

575
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:38,496
I'd say you were just in time
to make your grand entrance.

576
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,206
Well, when all this started,
I don't think I imagined myself

577
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,168
- standing here with you tonight.

578
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,312
- Congratulations, Mr. President. Again.
- Oh, thank you.

579
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:48,380
...Um, should I wait for you?

580
00:41:48,463 --> 00:41:50,633
No, no. I'll see you inside the party.

581
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,763
So... how's Romero?

582
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,015
Well, Romero wants to get the Republicans

583
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,726
to restart
the Declaration of War Committee.

584
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,229
What a lovely inauguration gift.
Don't tell me you're surprised.

585
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,815
I'm not.

586
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,067
I'll see you inside. Get a drink.

587
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,033
Well, don't you look stunning.

588
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,411
It's been a long night, Frank.

589
00:42:19,494 --> 00:42:22,832
- I need to get home.
- Oh, come on. Do me the honor.

590
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,001
Not tonight.

591
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,703
No, absolutely.

592
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,251
- Doug! Don't you look good.
- Thank you, Madam Vice President.

593
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:51,921
- Have you seen Francis?
- Not for a little while, no, ma'am.

594
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,840
Well, the party's breaking up.
I want him to say goodbye to people.

595
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,842
- Yes, ma'am. I'll let him know.
- Um, Doug?

596
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,638
I have a question for you.
Just a small thing.

597
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,224
- What is it?
- Why weren't you at the beheading?

598
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,144
- What?
- The night James Miller was beheaded.

599
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,105
We were all there, the four of us.

600
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,150
Francis, Tom, LeAnn and myself.

601
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,484
Why not you?

602
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,656
You see Francis,
tell him I'm looking for him.

603
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,990
Yes, ma'am.

604
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:40,510
- I thought you got lost.
- No. I just needed a break.

605
00:44:41,636 --> 00:44:45,099
- Shall we bid our guests farewell?
- No, the night is young.

606
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,518
Look what I found.

607
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,656
They're restarting the committee.

608
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,619
I thought we killed that committee.

609
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,372
Nothing ever really dies
in the House.

610
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:13,127
It just plays in front of a smaller
and smaller audience.

611
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,258
- This is serious.
- I know.

612
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,137
But let's enjoy the rest of the party.

613
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,953
Hey.

614
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,958
What do you do here?

615
00:45:54,459 --> 00:45:55,752
I work for them.

616
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,509
The president asked me to make sure
that you get home safely.

617
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:05,637
- I have a car for you.
- I thought I'd stay a little while longer.

618
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,307
The president has
an early morning tomorrow. Right this way.

619
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,456
The tour guide?

620
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:38,128
- What?
- Yes.

621
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,716
WTF. What am I supposed to do
about the tour guide?

622
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,762
The press briefing room, Tom, really?

623
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,477
I didn't think anyone would care.

624
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,731
Well, should I... keep her on
or let her go?

625
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:01,318
I mean, it was rather unprofessional
on her part.

626
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,115
She's good at her job.

627
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:10,744
Tom...

628
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,123
don't cheat on my wife.

629
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,189
Mr. Barnes?

630
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,946
Do you want to get a coffee
somewhere away from this?

631
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,449
I keep thinking about what you said.

632
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,081
I found this with her things.

633
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,335
It was Father's Day...

634
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,337
the last time I heard from her.

635
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,964
We weren't close.

636
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,800
I was surprised she called.

637
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,095
I mean, I was happy, of course, but...

638
00:48:11,596 --> 00:48:13,223
Can I hold on to this?

639
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,563
I didn't know...

640
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,275
that she was in trouble.

641
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:29,656
When the police asked if I thought
she was suicidal, I said, "Maybe."

642
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,163
I didn't know her, really.

643
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,749
Neither did I.

644
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,878
I'll look into this.

645
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,424
Okay.

646
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,843
Thank you.

647
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,276
Politico. Five minutes on Morning Joe.

648
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,654
- Was a press release really necessary?
- You're taking a leave.

649
00:49:10,905 --> 00:49:12,633
The press release said
that you were taking a leave

650
00:49:12,657 --> 00:49:14,659
to consider your career options.

651
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,121
This has to look real. You know that.

652
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,664
What if they need to meet with me?

653
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,252
Then they'll meet with you.

654
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,888
I could have security escort you out.

655
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:47,484
So since Usher is special advisor now,
where does that leave you?

656
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,865
Like I said,
they'll call you if they need you.

657
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,790
I can be a friend to you, you know.

658
00:50:02,957 --> 00:50:06,002
- It doesn't have to be like this.
- I don't have any friends.

659
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:26,065
I landed him
at the Jordanian Embassy in Paris.

660
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,942
When do we plan to get him out?

661
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,862
Well, as I understand it,
you don't yet know

662
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,782
what Mr. Macallan may have told
President Petrov.

663
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:39,369
I want Macallan back here
sooner rather than later.

664
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,414
It's better if these things don't happen
on American soil.

665
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:47,336
- Yes, but I make those decisions.
- Of course, Mr. President.

666
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,796
And rest assured,

667
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,757
neither of your fingerprints
are anywhere near this.

668
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,684
So what do we do about LeAnn?

669
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:09,649
She's been involved in election fraud,
for Christ's sake.

670
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,986
She's made a lot of mistakes.

671
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:19,075
- Yes, but lots of people have.
- Yes, but some people run their course.

672
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,456
It's hard to know who to trust these days.

673
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,500
Isn't it?
