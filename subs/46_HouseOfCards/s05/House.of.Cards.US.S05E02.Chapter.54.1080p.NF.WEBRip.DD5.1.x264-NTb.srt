1
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,101
Why do you keep playing with that?

2
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,687
Because I'm skeptical.

3
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,605
Do you think this really works?

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,858
Oh, it's just about
making the candidate seem familiar,

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,195
so that the voter sees herself in him.

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,822
But... you've gone too far.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,159
There.

8
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,912
Congratulations, Francis.
You have my vote.

9
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,125
- When do you leave for New York?
- Now.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,254
- Then I'm back for the event with Cathy.
- Mmm.

11
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,548
It's very risky, what Macallan is doing.

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,303
Do you think it's worth it?

13
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,090
- Danton and Sharp just lawyered up.
- They don't want to testify?

14
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,609
And there's no way subpoenas get them

15
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,902
in front of the committee
before the election.

16
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,846
There's a rumor the committee's trying
to make a deal with Garrett Walker.

17
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:03,015
No, Walker doesn't want
to do damage to the party.

18
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,809
So why did Jim Matthews agree to appear?

19
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:06,972
I'm already getting pummeled
with questions about it.

20
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,106
- Does he have anything to say?
- Uh, even if he pleads the Fifth,

21
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,484
they get a perp walk
that implicates the president.

22
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,153
I didn't know anyone actually ate those.

23
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,906
I look forward to this stuff all year.

24
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,703
Do we have anything
on the committee members?

25
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,705
Nothing too juicy yet, I'm afraid.

26
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,625
Vice chairman had an affair
with a young male staffer

27
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,878
before he came out to his wife. Old news.

28
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,048
Committee chairman's squeaky clean
other than a minor back-tax issue.

29
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,886
I did find some revenge porn
on the chairman's chief of staff,

30
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,430
but I don't think it's worth much.

31
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,890
Is it enough to scare her?

32
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:48,686
Embarrass her, probably.
More than that, probably not.

33
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,618
I gotta say, they look
a lot better on you, Mrs. Underwood,

34
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,287
than they would on Governor Conway.

35
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,123
Maybe that's why
he didn't wanna pay for it.

36
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:15,255
These masks will be distributed
to all MTA engineers,

37
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,632
conductors and maintenance workers.

38
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,511
And this model is highly effective
in case of a chemical attack.

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,971
And I believe Mayor Adalardi would like
to say a few words.

40
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,181
Absolutely.

41
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,603
Safety in all branches
of the public transportation system

42
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,480
is my number one priority.
- Ken?

43
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,401
- That means subways, that means buses...
- It's fine, I know him.

44
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,611
What are you doing here?

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,197
- What? This is my stop.
- Oh.

46
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
- Well, you look well.
- Well, I can't complain.

47
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:48,830
Can't complain, except...
Well, I'm sure you heard about Tim.

48
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,332
Corbet? No.

49
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,710
- Beth didn't call?
- No.

50
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,879
Oh, man.
I hate to be the one to tell you this.

51
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:02,344
Tim went out on the Arkansas River.
He's been missing for two days now.

52
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:06,013
I thought for sure
the president would have heard.

53
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,558
I mean, I can't imagine
how Frank's gonna take this.

54
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,143
Oh, my goodness!
Beth and the kids must be so distraught.

55
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:15,022
Sure. But Frank and Tim's relationship
was special.

56
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,736
It's great to see you, Claire.

57
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,196
Would you ask Frank to give me a call?

58
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,866
- Mrs. Underwood?
- Uh, just one moment.

59
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,539
See that gentleman I was speaking to?
Go ask him to wait for me, please.

60
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,542
Governors,
we are running out of time.

61
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,547
The fact that you are here at this
emergency meeting on such short notice

62
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:44,552
tells the American people that you are
as concerned about their safety as I am.

63
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,888
Terror is unacceptable.

64
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,681
I do not accept it.

65
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,310
But we will not be deterred
by Washington's failure to address it.

66
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:58,483
We will work together,
side by side, fighting back.

67
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,654
State by state, city by city,
neighborhood by neighborhood.

68
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:09,452
Because, make no mistake...
we are engaged in the battle of our time.

69
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,705
The question of what it is
to be an American,

70
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,417
the very essence of American-ness,

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,755
how we choose to lead our lives,
open and free, is on the line.

72
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,676
Fear is un-American.

73
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:30,097
And yes, the irony of saying those words
to you on Halloween, of all days,

74
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,224
is not lost on me.

75
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:37,939
But although we may choose, as Americans,
to scare ourselves once a year for fun...

76
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:44,236
no one else tells any American when
to shake in their boots at any other time.

77
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,073
So I am issuing an executive order,

78
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:51,703
by virtue of the authority vested in me
as President of the United States

79
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,163
and commander in chief
of the armed forces.

80
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:57,374
By our Constitution
and the laws of our land,

81
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,837
including Section Blah-Blah
of the Blah-Blah Act

82
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,300
and Section Blah-Blah of Title Blah-Blah,
Paragraph Bullshit-Bullshit.

83
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:07,986
In case you have no idea what's going on,

84
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm swelling these states'
National Guard troops

85
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,559
to create secure public spaces
on Election Day.

86
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,312
I'm urging these governors
to consolidate their polling sites

87
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,774
and create quote, unquote "voting centers"

88
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,276
so that people feel safe
to come out and vote.

89
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,406
I'm commending Governor Sally Morrison
of the great state of Arizona,

90
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,160
for giving us all such a good example
of voting centers

91
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,872
as used in their recent primary.

92
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:41,586
But what I'm really doing is
seducing the governors of five key states.

93
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,716
New Jersey, Nevada, Illinois,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.

94
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:51,554
Messrs. Harcourt, NuÃ±ez, Gallinard,

95
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:56,017
Olmstead and Matthews.

96
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,269
Oh, you remember Matthews, don't you?

97
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,689
Former vice president
to President Garrett Walker.

98
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,610
Nothing but a provincial
and petty pen-stealer.

99
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,322
But I need him.

100
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,243
I need all five on my side
if I'm gonna win this election.

101
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:18,790
Matthews, in our history,
he's the biggest known unknown.

102
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,251
Oh, and I almost forgot.
The boy wonder is here.

103
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:26,964
My worthy opponent.
Out of his element and stuck in mine.

104
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,426
But, you see, in politics,
stature is everything.

105
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:35,807
And wouldn't you say that
Willy C is getting shorter by the minute?

106
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,145
These border restrictions
the president is proposing...

107
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,981
should the military play a role
in enforcing them, General?

108
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,567
I think we need to take a step back

109
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,152
and look at
our national security priorities.

110
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:52,281
And what constitutes appropriate
deployment of our serving men and women.

111
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:56,619
As veterans, this issue is a personal one
for Governor Conway and me.

112
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,346
- Would you and...
- I'll tell you something else.

113
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,848
You won't hear this
from the governor himself,

114
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,376
but his military career is distinguished
by exceptional acts of bravery.

115
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,173
In particular, the incident for which he
was awarded the Purple Heart stands out.

116
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,009
Speaks to the kind of commander in chief
he will be.

117
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,137
Demonstrates what I call fearless wisdom.

118
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,015
Someday soon, America needs
to hear the full story of that day.

119
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,351
Thank you for your time,
General Brockhart.

120
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,477
Glad to talk to you.

121
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,688
Coming up next on Special Report,
we take a look at...

122
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,691
I swear to God, if Underwood puts soldiers
on those borders,

123
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,276
I'll be the first to tell them
not to listen.

124
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,655
In terms of allocation of funds,

125
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:35,199
it's our water supply
that keeps me up at night.

126
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,119
Roger, are you talking about
protecting the infrastructure?

127
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,079
Infrastructure and water sources.

128
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,290
Reservoirs, the dams,
the tunnel delivery systems...

129
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,416
All of it, yes.

130
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,504
Protection from terrorism, sure,
but the voters see even greater dangers.

131
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,757
Structural, environmental,
toxins from algae.

132
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,258
Algae's quite a problem for us.

133
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,803
The big question here,
are the feds doing all they can do?

134
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,429
Well, the feds want to do even more.

135
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,324
That's the reason
that we're all meeting here today.

136
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,808
Now, look, gentlemen, all I can see

137
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,745
is that we're in violent agreement
with each other.

138
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,854
I mean, Roger,
how long have we known each other?

139
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,105
How far do we go back?

140
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,982
You knew me when I had hair,
Mr. President.

141
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,253
It doesn't change the fact
that my constituents are saying,

142
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,029
"Give me a bridge, not a war zone."

143
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,030
All I'm saying is that

144
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,699
we need to anticipate threats
when we can and thwart them.

145
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,743
I'm saying that we're days away
from an election,

146
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,329
and I don't wanna upset the apple cart.
- Excuse me for just a moment.

147
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,042
Will, have you seen this?

148
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,088
All right.
I'll deal with him later.

149
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,510
- Tell me exactly what she said.
- Just that she heard it from Ken Caswell.

150
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,518
I checked with the local authorities
in Salida, sir.

151
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,270
It doesn't look good.

152
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,398
- The chances of...
- Amp up the search.

153
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:53,277
Whatever materials and personnel they need
in addition to what they have, give them.

154
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,155
And reach out to Beth Corbet.
I'd like to speak to her directly.

155
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,699
Yes, sir.

156
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,289
I haven't slept
a good night's sleep since 2012.

157
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:09,669
But I guess elected officials don't sleep
so our constituents can.

158
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:13,005
The proof of success in fighting terror...

159
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,050
is something the public never hears about.

160
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:21,180
A certain city in my state wears
the biggest target in the nation.

161
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,809
The city and state of New York...

162
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,937
has scored silent wins for 15 years...

163
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,732
without a declaration of war.

164
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,234
Now...

165
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,527
in most cases...

166
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:39,531
I would argue
the states can take care of themselves.

167
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,785
- Mr. President!
- Well, by all means, continue, Governor.

168
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,913
What... what was that part
you were talking about? Insomnia?

169
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,082
My point is,

170
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,668
we're all Americans in this room,
and we all love this country.

171
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,153
And I'd like to thank the president

172
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,632
for the opportunity
to discuss this very important topic,

173
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,427
and apologize for, uh,
being on such a tight schedule.

174
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,138
Well, we are enormously grateful

175
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,266
that the governor took the time
to come and join us today.

176
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,435
I'm just trying to understand.

177
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,024
Claire, if I said anything
to offend you, it was entirely...

178
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:16,152
I mean, you know me. No filter.

179
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,112
And that's what worries me.

180
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,157
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.

181
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,828
- Did you come down here with an agenda?
- No. I mean...

182
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,873
I have been trying to reach Frank,
but today was just...

183
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,877
I saw that you were appearing at an event
and I showed up to say hi.

184
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,755
I... I really do work around here,
on a street called "Wall," you know?

185
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,967
But then you made reference to something
about two very close friends

186
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,719
that's nobody's business, including yours.

187
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,766
And you even said so yourself, Ken,
that you have an awfully big mouth.

188
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,811
I...

189
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,771
I lost a dear friend.

190
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,399
I loved Tim. Everybody did.

191
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:58,610
And you implied Francis especially.

192
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,738
Well, yeah. I mean...
That was a whole other thing.

193
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,823
In what way?

194
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,954
In...
What do you want me to say?

195
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,915
I'm sure
I don't know anything you don't.

196
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,961
I'm just very interested
in your perspective.

197
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:19,423
Frank worshipped Tim,
would have done anything for him.

198
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,844
I don't know.

199
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,098
If the world were a different place
back then... who knows?

200
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:35,231
That was a long time ago.
And then he met you.

201
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,732
And lucky him.

202
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:42,154
Look, in terms of my firm and...
and trying to get the president's ear...

203
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,740
I mean, yeah, it's a little embarrassing

204
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:49,453
that my friend of 30-whatever years
didn't have time to pick up the phone.

205
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,333
He should have called you back.

206
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,213
Francis and Tim were very good friends.

207
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:06,888
But, you know, Ken, the older I get,
I learn that assumptions are dangerous.

208
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,641
Sure. Okay.

209
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,353
It was great to see you.

210
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,798
So where is she?

211
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,885
Change of plans.
She needed to stay in New York.

212
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,055
She asked me
to put something together for this.

213
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,472
Yeah? Well, something came up.

214
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,356
The vice president will be
filling in for her.

215
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh, my...

216
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,149
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

217
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,987
Uh, we played in a terrible band
together back in the day.

218
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,490
Before adulthood and alimony
came crashing down.

219
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,703
- Two exes? Wow.
- Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

220
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,040
So, uh, where's the First Lady?

221
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,418
- Something came up.
- Hmm.

222
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,755
I'd love to ask you a few questions
about working on the campaign.

223
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm just a speechwriter.

224
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,467
Exactly.
How the hell did that happen?

225
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,802
Welcome to
the Council on Foreign Relations

226
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:32,639
and this special event
on Crossing Borders: The Way Forward.

227
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,436
I smell a swing state party.

228
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,232
Tone, Rick.

229
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,693
You didn't have to round up dozens of
governors just to talk to the five of us.

230
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,279
You're here because
there have been concerning threats

231
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,531
in exurban counties
in each of your states.

232
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,283
Could you be more specific?

233
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,870
We're keeping an eye on Hunterdon,
Elko, Jefferson counties.

234
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,748
Also Chester and McHenry.

235
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,671
Which is why it's crucial that we work
with your states' administrations

236
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,669
leading up to the election.

237
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,548
Every one of those precincts is
a typically Republican stronghold.

238
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,968
This isn't about party affiliation.

239
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,887
As the president said,
this is about security.

240
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,849
Now, we believe this course of action,

241
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,310
the voting centers
with the added law enforcement,

242
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,936
will give us everything that we need

243
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,772
to protect the integrity
of the ballot box.

244
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,317
Okay, but speaking for Governor Olmstead
and maybe all of our bosses,

245
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,628
how can we be sure that these measures

246
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,113
won't discourage everyone
from getting to the polls?

247
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,366
- I.e., Democrats.
- It's a chance we have to take.

248
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,469
But we don't believe
it'll play out that way.

249
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,079
We're in an extremely close race in Ohio.

250
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,582
Preventing further acts of terrorism
is just about all that matters, Tanya.

251
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,878
Now, I do realize
with these heightened threats

252
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:47,714
comes an additional strain
on the governors of your states.

253
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,799
So...

254
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,719
I say to each and every one of you...

255
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,847
tell me how we can help.

256
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,060
Putting aside
the very real moral questions,

257
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,521
how is shutting down the borders
even feasible?

258
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,485
I know this policy is going to hurt
some people,

259
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,280
but let me explain why it's necessary.

260
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,454
And the vice president should
feel free to jump in.

261
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,125
But is it fun?

262
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,003
- Putting words in the Underwoods' mouths?
- That's not what I do.

263
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,381
It's more like the opposite.

264
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,677
I just try and articulate...

265
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,056
what's on their minds and in their hearts.

266
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,765
That's how you see your job?

267
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,854
Basically, my job is to remain invisible.

268
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,335
Were you with them that night?
The night Jim Miller was killed?

269
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,362
I'm not gonna answer that.

270
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,365
- I'll take that as a "yes."
- Don't.

271
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,843
I'm just trying to understand
what you do.

272
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,120
Then you're missing the point.

273
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,747
I'm not the story, Steve. I'm just not.

274
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,215
You make yourself sound replaceable.

275
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,218
I am.

276
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,764
- I serve at the pleasure of the president.
- And the First Lady?

277
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,933
The Democratic
vice presidential candidate...

278
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,060
Yeah. Her, too.

279
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,147
But you write speeches for both of them?

280
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,441
Most often for Mrs. Underwood.

281
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,944
Articulating what's on her mind
and in her heart?

282
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,155
Mmm-hmm.

283
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,283
- I'm just a mouthpiece.
- Mmm.

284
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,703
Has she put you in charge
of any other parts?

285
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,291
Wow.

286
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,043
You're still an asshole, man.

287
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,173
Good luck with the alimony.

288
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,063
- That was rough.
- It went fine.

289
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,816
It's not sustainable.

290
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,568
I mean, what do you think?

291
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,948
- About what?
- About the president's rush to war.

292
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,034
At least half the Beltway seems to think
it's outrageous.

293
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:22,244
It is outrageous.

294
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:28,875
We could resign our posts,
you know, in protest.

295
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,837
I bet we can convince others
of the cabinet to do the same thing.

296
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,342
Outrageous by design, I was going to say.
It's smart, what the president's doing.

297
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,428
- It's serving him in the polls.
- Donald.

298
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,641
Let's... take a step back for a moment.

299
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,478
I underestimated you. I did.

300
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,272
When you were acting president,
my faith was less than full.

301
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,360
But now, I understand
the terrible box you were in, the forces...

302
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,778
Cathy, I'm gonna... I'm gonna stop you.

303
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,073
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

304
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:05,078
Are you telling me your plan is just
to phone it in until January 20th?

305
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,959
Come on, Donald. What's happened to you?

306
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,545
Back in the day,

307
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,382
you and Marjorie were at the forefront
of every progressive cause,

308
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,592
literally fighting the good fight.

309
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,051
These people...

310
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,972
can we really let them do this?

311
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,975
You wanna walk down memory lane,
Cathy? Okay.

312
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,729
Remember the convention?
Remember the Politico article?

313
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,898
I offered you an out.

314
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,360
You should've taken that opportunity
to resign, then and there.

315
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:40,406
- Circumstances were nothing like this.
- Sure they were.

316
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,115
You just didn't want to see it.

317
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,701
And, just so you know,

318
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,204
right before her mind was truly gone,
Marjorie called it.

319
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,999
She saw the unholy alliance
you were making with Frank Underwood.

320
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,919
She called it.

321
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,937
So this meeting
between our bosses today...

322
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,832
The president is looking forward

323
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,793
to a productive discussion
with Governor Matthews.

324
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,902
There's no one else here.
Can we cut the crap?

325
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,029
You want us to engage
in voter suppression.

326
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,206
It's not a phrase I'd ever use.

327
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,917
Fine. Call it "motor depression"
for all I care.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,838
We get it. White people are the problem.
Republicans. Understood.

329
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,299
But my boss doesn't happen to be
up for reelection.

330
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:43,302
I'm listening.

331
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,930
I have two words for you. "Slag heap."

332
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,558
Matthews wants the EPA
to name a slag heap

333
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,102
on the outskirts of Philadelphia
as a Superfund site.

334
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,771
I seriously doubt
that can happen before the election.

335
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,148
I think you should battle
your doubts, Doug.

336
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,776
The governor is willing
to let the past stay in the past.

337
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,696
But unless the Underwood administration
is bearing top-tier gifts,

338
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,492
you've got a lot of fucking nerve
asking for favors from the former VP.

339
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,578
On the other hand,
if you make things right,

340
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,497
Matthews will do his part.

341
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,584
Don't you always feel sorry
for the horse?

342
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,830
Who's in the conference room?

343
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,542
- You mean the lady brigade?
- What?

344
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,127
That's what they call
the NSA forensic auditors.

345
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:04,174
Yeah, I... I didn't know
they were scheduled for today.

346
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,926
That's their routine. They just show up.

347
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,345
Welcome to the NSA.

348
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,476
Hey, boss.

349
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,853
Oh.

350
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,792
May I, Mr. President?

351
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,627
Well, that's what
they're there for.

352
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,715
I won't take up much of your time.
I know you have a busy afternoon.

353
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,468
- Well, I've got a little time.
- I'm curious.

354
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,763
Why do you think the committee
decided to call you first?

355
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,600
Because I asked them to.

356
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,898
Well, this emergency governors' conference
of yours came up and, uh...

357
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,025
I'm sure you recall,
I don't much like DC,

358
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,571
so I figured why not make it
one-stop shopping?

359
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,739
Yes.

360
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,743
But, of course,
we both know that executive privilege

361
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,079
could've negated your having to appear
at one of those shops.

362
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,333
Jim?

363
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:26,047
I'm going to help you with your slag heap.
I hope that means that I can count on you.

364
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,259
Of course that's what it means.

365
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:33,471
We're members of a tiny brotherhood,
you and I, of ex-VPs.

366
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,393
When, and if, Garrett Walker appears
before this committee,

367
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,186
do you think he'll...

368
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,566
betray the party?
- You mean you?

369
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,361
Well, that would be the same thing.

370
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,699
Now, I don't know what really happened

371
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,326
on your journey to replace me
as vice president

372
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,162
and then Garrett as president.

373
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,373
I only know what my gut tells me.

374
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,710
But I'm willing to say fuck my gut.

375
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:14,512
Bottom line is I can help you
with this committee or I can hurt you.

376
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,935
Now, I can say that I know nothing...

377
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,773
and that what I saw in Garrett Walker
was a troubled man.

378
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,151
And I can leave it at that.

379
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,157
What do you think?

380
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:39,162
Oh, I can't tell you what to do, Jim.

381
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:44,000
But I can say, as one ex-VP to another,

382
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,002
that this cleanup in Pennsylvania

383
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,715
is gonna be worth about
$300 million and 10,000 jobs.

384
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,593
And that's not bad
for an afternoon's work.

385
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,931
I like the new rug.

386
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,894
Oh, thank you.
I didn't have much to do with it.

387
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,102
It was really Claire's design.

388
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,605
- Good to see you, Mr. President.
- You, too.

389
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,115
Governor Scanlon.

390
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,743
Mr. President.

391
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,912
You've been on my mind.

392
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,667
I wanna talk to your boss
about the Declaration of War Committee.

393
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:30,922
So... if you're hoping to intimidate him
because of the back taxes,

394
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,633
you can save your breath.

395
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,885
His closet is back to being clean.

396
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,973
What about yours?

397
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,440
- You're a pig.
- Hey, I didn't watch it.

398
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,609
I'm just the messenger.

399
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,612
- Be mad at the dude who posted it.
- I am.

400
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,061
There are ways to get rid of it.

401
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,411
It's a goodwill gift.
To let you know I'm serious.

402
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,875
Look, I'm guessing, sooner or later,
I get called.

403
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:11,129
And if that happens,
I could plead the Fifth.

404
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,549
I could press-secretary them all day long.

405
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,761
But I'd like to have another option
on the table.

406
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,389
Yeah, I can't be
a public witness myself...

407
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:25,310
but if you offer me
anonymity and immunity...

408
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,021
I can testify privately.

409
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:32,025
Tell the committee
where the bodies are buried, so to speak.

410
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,069
But, just to be clear, you're telling me

411
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,072
you have evidence the president engaged
in criminal activity?

412
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,365
Not evidence regarding the president, no.

413
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,660
I have a lot of information
about his chief of staff.

414
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,788
Doug Stamper.

415
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,584
Talk to your boss. Let me know.

416
00:27:55,423 --> 00:28:00,595
Uh, Bridget, total non sequitur...
You have a very elegant neck.

417
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,916
Mr. Grayson?

418
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:34,004
Sean Jeffries. I'm with the Herald.

419
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,671
Sorry, I don't have a free hand.

420
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,510
- How long have you been with the paper?
- Thirteen months. Style section.

421
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,429
Oh, that would explain
why I don't know you.

422
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,934
Man's tie is a window into his soul.
We just ran a piece on it.

423
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,522
Oh, yeah?
So, uh, what does my tie say about me?

424
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,566
It says you're a dedicated civil servant
with the bank account to prove it.

425
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:58,737
Anyway, recognized you,
just wanted to say hi.

426
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,947
I mean, unless we can buy you a drink.

427
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,658
You know, uh, Cam Lawder?
Lobbyist for Mercedes-Benz?

428
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,120
Next to him is, uh, Kim Feldshuk,
works at the DoD.

429
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:12,125
And that's Randy Beauford.
Personal trainer for fat Washington fucks.

430
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,669
We're going old school this afternoon.

431
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,963
Come on, join us for a quick one.

432
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,889
"Mouthpiece"?

433
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,242
I don't know why he was talking
to the press in the first place.

434
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,977
An unfortunate choice of word
for Tom, no doubt.

435
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,854
But still, it'll play itself out.

436
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:36,357
But what I want to know is,
what do you see?

437
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,276
Why don't you like Yates?

438
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,963
Uh, Tom is an important part of the team.
His speeches have been...

439
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,281
Oh, look.
He has more responsibilities than that.

440
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,700
You know it. So that bothers you.

441
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:51,747
I... just wouldn't want anyone to infer
a personal investment on his part

442
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,542
that isn't useful to the campaign.

443
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,295
I suppose all I'm saying is that

444
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,590
I won't let anything happen
to the First Lady or you, Mr. President.

445
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,467
I appreciate that, LeAnn.

446
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,847
We are fucked, Mr. President.
Pardon my French.

447
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,640
I don't care about your French.
Why am I even talking to you?

448
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,392
Well, the NSA
has sent in auditors.

449
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,644
If I don't erase my files,
cover my tracks...

450
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,456
We're a week away from the election,
Mr. Macallan.

451
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,160
- Cover your tracks.
- Okay. In which case,

452
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:23,113
I need to let hackers temporarily invade
a Capital East Telecom switching center.

453
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,196
Meaning what?

454
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,909
Well, the center covers
most of the US government cyber traffic.

455
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,953
But if I'm in and out in 20 minutes,

456
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,663
I think the damage will
look mischief-level.

457
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,375
Messed-up connections, that sort of thing.

458
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,668
- What if it takes you longer?
- Uh, it won't,

459
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,963
because another ten, 20 minutes and...

460
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,922
Do it.

461
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,593
All right.
Well, I'll start it at 4:00 p.m.

462
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:46,761
Uh, as soon as I'm done,

463
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,680
I'll anonymously send out
a fix to the problem.

464
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,474
- No.
- Sir?

465
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,977
LeAnn will contact you
about when to send out the fix.

466
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,454
- You'll wait for her.
- Okay, but just to be...

467
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,812
She'll let you know.

468
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:03,694
Oh.

469
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:08,033
I just saw the Haines article.

470
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,493
I have no idea what Tom was thinking.

471
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,204
Yes.

472
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,956
It was sloppy.

473
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,458
Agreed. I'll talk to him.

474
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,712
Are you all right?

475
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:25,091
How was New York?

476
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,844
My events went well.

477
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:36,269
And? What aren't you telling me?

478
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,982
I bumped into Ken Caswell.

479
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,609
- Does he know any more?
- No, um...

480
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,530
- Why didn't you call him back?
- What?

481
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:50,033
His Treasury business.
The oversight legislation.

482
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,994
I understand you don't care about it.
Fine.

483
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:56,706
But you can't ignore loose ends like that.
You owed him your ear.

484
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,543
Well, I didn't realize it was gonna
become so personal.

485
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:03,314
I am the President of the United States,
for Christ's sake. I'm a bit busy.

486
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,757
The past doesn't disappear
on command, Francis.

487
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,884
Not even for presidents.

488
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,262
What did he say to you?

489
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:15,350
Ken's got a big mouth.

490
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,904
I'm sorry about Tim. I'm sorry he's gone.

491
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,950
I know how you felt about him.

492
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,494
Or, I can imagine.

493
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:36,997
Listen to me.

494
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,043
You know you're the only person
I've ever truly loved.

495
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,794
You know that, right?

496
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:57,225
And listen.

497
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,686
Something else is about to happen.

498
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,695
Welcome back.

499
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,199
Reception is sketchy. Good trip?

500
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,286
I just came back to get changed.
I need to get back to Francis.

501
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,083
You mad at me?

502
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,626
You shouldn't have said that.

503
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,298
I know. I know we need to be careful.

504
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,804
Careful is far too small a word
for what we need to be.

505
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,513
Okay.

506
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:26,231
But don't you get tired of being
far bigger than careful all the time?

507
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,569
- I don't know what's going on.
- Me neither.

508
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,946
Seems to be some kind of
network disturbance.

509
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:35,615
I lost connection on my server.

510
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,147
You know what I'm tired of?
This role. First Lady.

511
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,023
'Cause it's never felt right.

512
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,985
It's only eight more days
to the vice presidency.

513
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:16,489
- Mmm-hmm. What's my role?
- What?

514
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,411
What am I to you, anyway? Or you, to me?

515
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,664
I mean, are you my girlfriend?

516
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,250
And when you win...

517
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:31,629
does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?

518
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:34,840
First Concubine?

519
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,597
About that article... I'm sorry.

520
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,184
I hate apologies.

521
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:51,857
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,785
I looked over at you.
I watched you watching.

523
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:09,250
- When?
- Did it even affect you?

524
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,793
The beheading?

525
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,840
- Why would you ask that?
- I had no sense of what you were thinking.

526
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,842
None.

527
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,595
Of what I was thinking? I wasn't thinking.

528
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,597
I was thinking, "Don't think."

529
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,772
And I'll tell you something else.
I never said I like being careful.

530
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,153
- God damn it.
- What's wrong?

531
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,948
The GPS thinks
we're back at the White House.

532
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:44,994
- Did you reach the campaign office?
- Trying. I can't get a signal.

533
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,787
Oh, wait. Here we go.

534
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,790
I can't miss this flight.

535
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,543
- It's ringing.
- Good.

536
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,380
- How long do you think?
- Now it stopped.

537
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,299
There's a pile-up on the highway.
I'm doing the best I can.

538
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,555
Hello?

539
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,558
Hello!

540
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,896
- Tanya, let me try your phone.
- I'm having the same issues.

541
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,149
- Can you get through to the office?
- No, Governor, I can't.

542
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,360
Garrett is a good man.

543
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:20,363
- A trustworthy man?
- Absolutely, Mr. Romero.

544
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,739
And is he the kind of man

545
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,492
who would knowingly participate
in campaign finance fraud?

546
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,369
I wouldn't say that, exactly. No.

547
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,038
How well do you know
President Underwood, sir?

548
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,082
I've known the president four years.

549
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,084
Isn't it a fact
that it was Francis Underwood

550
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,796
and not President Walker who first
suggested you should resign?

551
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,844
To the best of my recollection, no.

552
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,139
And isn't it true that the source
of campaign funds you received

553
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,700
as the president's running mate
was connected

554
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,353
to a pay-for-play scheme that reached
all the way from Missouri to China?

555
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,481
To the best of my knowledge, no.

556
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:59,860
Did you receive any campaign donations
through Raymond Tusk's firm, Clayton West?

557
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,697
Not to the best of my recollection.

558
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,840
Do you think your recollection

559
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,624
or knowledge will improve
as the day goes on?

560
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,992
Excuse me?

561
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,505
Beth.

562
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,092
I want you to promise me
that you'll call me

563
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,219
anytime you need anything.

564
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,390
You were the love of Tim's life,
you know that.

565
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,103
Well, I should probably...

566
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,524
Yes. You, too.

567
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,569
Goodbye.

568
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,990
Thank you, Felix.

569
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,033
Uh, would you like me
to prepare it for you, sir?

570
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,035
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

571
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:16,186
The first question to ask yourself...
"Is the damper open?"

572
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,899
Never allow yourself
to be overcome with smoke.

573
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:23,528
Conflagration relies on airflow.
That's what the grate is for.

574
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,406
Now, I like a one-inch base of ash.

575
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,242
It's helpful, but of course they clean up
around here too soon to do that.

576
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:34,955
Now, as for the architecture of the logs,
I prefer the upside-down method.

577
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,459
Largest logs right along the base.

578
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,504
Then medium-size logs after that.

579
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,217
Small logs.

580
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,349
And then finally, kindling...

581
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,728
and tinder.

582
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,399
Now, of course, back home,
dead palmetto fronds are ideal.

583
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,275
But, of course, here in Washington,

584
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,446
we have to use whatever garbage
we find lying around.

585
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:12,326
But then, if a man cannot use
what's right in...

586
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,542
God damn it, Tim.

587
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,845
If a man is not smart enough to be able
to use whatever is in front of him

588
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,888
and still make it work...

589
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:39,061
well, then...
that's just a failure of the imagination.

590
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,998
...right here. And I'm thinking...

591
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,791
"Wait, do I tell him? Do..."

592
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,085
Uh, I gotta take this.

593
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:05,170
Hey.

594
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,881
Your testimony can't be private.

595
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,968
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Just wanted to let you know.

596
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:23,481
What's a "flash blood warning"?
It's coming up on everybody's phones.

597
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,859
Thanks for the drinks.

598
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,501
Tom, stop. No. I... I have to get back.

599
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,003
Come on.

600
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,131
No.

601
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,968
Tom!

602
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,858
And, finally,
you strike your match...

603
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,443
you ignite your kindling...

604
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,746
and then you blow.

605
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:12,131
It's happening, sir.

606
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:21,056
Citizens should be advised,

607
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,225
a wave of disruptions is
currently affecting

608
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:26,103
Internet and cellular service
in the DC area.

609
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,688
Expect traffic and travel delays

610
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:31,651
as authorities are still trying
to determine the scope of the problem.

611
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,361
- Are we gonna make this flight?
- I don't know.

612
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,030
Unconfirmed reports speculate

613
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,573
the disruptions may be connected
to a cyber-attack

614
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:39,909
with possible ties to ICO.

615
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,244
- My God.
- What?

616
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:43,327
Maybe they were right.

617
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,306
Maybe we should have said yes
to the offer of those troops.

618
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,626
National Guard on patrol makes us look
weak right before an election. Forget it.

619
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,753
- But, Governor...
- I made my decision, Tanya.

620
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,132
Not yet.

621
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,101
They're patching through the heads
of all the carriers, sir.

622
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,896
Gentlemen and ladies, can you hear me?

623
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,272
Yes, Mr. President.

624
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,609
Good. Then tell me how in God's name
this has happened.

625
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:58,821
Uh, we don't know yet, sir.
We're still working on the problem.

626
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,824
We're reaching out
to as many people as we...

627
00:45:03,658 --> 00:45:05,035
Did we just lose them?

628
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,537
Is this a joke?

629
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:11,101
The Ohio governor is calling
from a payphone.

630
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,608
This is the president.

631
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,569
Mr. President, I've changed my mind.

632
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,946
If the offer's still open,

633
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,990
I'd like to accept additional troops
for the state of Ohio.

634
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,868
Just say the word, Roger.
Whatever you need.

635
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,917
My fellow Americans, the facts are these.

636
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,212
The greater District of Columbia area
and the immediate region beyond

637
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,798
have undergone what we suspect is
an ICO-sponsored cyber-attack.

638
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,719
The attack was aimed at the district's
main telecom switching center.

639
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,197
In addition to intermittent outages,

640
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,932
a considerable amount of havoc
has been wreaked.

641
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:54,186
Traffic lights have been disabled.
One area train has been derailed.

642
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:57,564
The system that maintains our sewers
has been tampered with.

643
00:46:57,647 --> 00:46:59,816
The perpetrators were
targeting the government

644
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,944
and their ultimate purpose, though foiled,

645
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:05,865
was to disrupt all
mid-Atlantic transportation networks.

646
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:09,618
Events like these underscore the urgency
of my request to Congress

647
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,453
for a declaration of war.

648
00:47:11,536 --> 00:47:15,582
Tonight, I can only suspect Congress will
spend a dark night of the soul,

649
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:19,879
after which they will reconsider
their paralysis and choose to act.

650
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,546
Capital East Telecom has informed me

651
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,049
that it's repairing the network
as fast as possible,

652
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,761
but that it will take at least
a couple more days to be fully restored.

653
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,430
It is an unfortunate but undeniable fact

654
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,558
that we will continue
to experience attacks until ICO

655
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:38,147
and other terrorist groups like it
are eliminated swiftly and completely.

656
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,649
Thank you. May God bless you.

657
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,235
And may God bless
the United States of America.

658
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,285
We off?

659
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,420
- Good evening, Ted.
- Hi, Hannah.

660
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,714
I saw your interview.

661
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,718
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
bring up the details of my combat record.

662
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,513
You were a hero that day.
You should use it, Will.

663
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,414
Governor,
aren't you worried about

664
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,232
bringing your kids out
in the middle of a terrorist attack?

665
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,778
It'd be scarier to keep the kids at home.
The streets are safe. Life goes on.

666
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,409
You've got to be kidding me.

667
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,083
What's on your mind, Governor?

668
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,465
What's on my mind?
I mean, you see what's going on here.

669
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:50,260
This is all him.
It's a man who's never served.

670
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,156
Wouldn't know what a real war was
if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.

671
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,848
I mean, a declaration of war?

672
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:58,102
He's putting American lives in danger.

673
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,980
- War is real!
- Nightcap?

00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,108
- You don't screw around with it.
- Why not?

675
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,027
This is what happens.

676
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,863
This is what happens
when you throw around a word like "war."

677
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,323
All hell breaks loose.
