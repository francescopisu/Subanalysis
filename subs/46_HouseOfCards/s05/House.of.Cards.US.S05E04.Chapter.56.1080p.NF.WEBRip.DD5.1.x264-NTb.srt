1
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,545
I don't understand
why the numbers are so low.

2
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,755
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Turnout's bad.

3
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,509
I hear at Politico, they're concentrating
mostly on Conway art.

4
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,094
Shut up or you're fired.

5
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,430
...division rivals.

6
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,515
...The fighting was quite a spectacle

7
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,934
but, unfortunately for hockey fans,

8
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:09,481
that was just about the only action
to be seen in last night's game.

9
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,441
Will, Mark's here.

10
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,486
- Mmm.
- Hope you got some sleep.

11
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,238
No, not really.

12
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,532
Even went for a run, but...

13
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,284
You hungry?

14
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:25,372
Um, I just wanted to connect
before the rest of this day kicks in.

15
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,706
I spoke to Marshall.

16
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,790
No, I told him.

17
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,542
Things are looking good.

18
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,545
Very good.

19
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,215
I really want to thank you for everything.
I mean, the ad and...

20
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,841
I had nothing to do with that ad.

21
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,635
No, of course, but...

22
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,553
to thank you for your support.

23
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,679
This is all you.

24
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,890
Listen...

25
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,436
I'm... choosing my words
very carefully here.

26
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,813
You need to get ready.

27
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,107
Today's gonna be a good day.

28
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,835
You can sleep
when you get to the White House.

29
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,111
...Or maybe not.

30
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:01,366
Get yourself together, Will.
I'll see you in a bit.

31
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,126
Are you ready...

32
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,217
to catch me?

33
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,479
Doug, LeAnn...
do you have a moment?

34
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,618
Reporting live
from the Piedmont Hotel,

35
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,829
the excitement is definitely...

36
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,373
Better not let them see
the name on your credentials.

37
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,125
Those folks out there love
their president.

38
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,212
I love pound cake.

39
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
- Doesn't mean it's good for me.

40
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,716
How are you doing, Seth?

41
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,928
- You got some foundation right here.
- Oh, jeez.

42
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,557
And we call it the news.

43
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,809
...I'm doing commentary.

44
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,520
Which means eventually
someone gets to ask me

45
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,523
if my articles
affected the president's loss.

46
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,400
Or his win.

47
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,821
I wish you the best, Seth.

48
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,073
You'll land somewhere.

49
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,825
You're that type.

50
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,329
We're going to have a great night tonight.

51
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:31,748
You don't have to spin me.

52
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,125
How shall I say this?

53
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,296
When I was single,
I always picked the loser's party.

54
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,925
I met the last Mrs. Hammerschmidt
drowning in tequila shots

55
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,386
at the Bob Dole ballroom.

56
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,305
And here I am... single again.

57
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,283
- You're not in Texas anymore.
- Doug, please.

58
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,802
- Please what?
- Don't think you know me.

59
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,429
Look, I just want to be sure
that you're ready for...

60
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,163
Macallan will do what he has to.

61
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,583
I like to win.

62
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,461
Trophies, medals, staring contests.
You name it.

63
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,422
You understand that, you understand me.

64
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,096
Hello, everyone.

65
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,183
Well, it's still early.

66
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,602
There's a lot more election
to be had today.

67
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,230
And we just want to apologize that,
because we have a little more work to do,

68
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,792
we're not gonna be able to get over
to the ballroom

69
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,193
as early as we would like to.
But once we do get there,

70
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,987
we are going to shake the hand
of each and every one of you,

71
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,701
to thank you for all the extraordinary
work that you've done for us.

72
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,203
That's right, a round of applause
all the way around.

73
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,500
And we'll see you all
at the party a little later.

74
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,254
Better?

75
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,257
- Yeah, a little.

76
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,261
First time I've fucked a president.

77
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,222
- Oh, don't say that.
- Marshall said...

78
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,642
I'm not a president yet.

79
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:57,519
Almost.

80
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,988
I got to put on a suit.

81
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,866
- People will be here soon.
- Will...

82
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,995
can't you let yourself feel it?

83
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,381
Almost.

84
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,057
- Ready when you are, sir.
- Put the governor on, please.

85
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,975
- Hello.
- Mitch, this is the president.

86
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,393
I understand you've been briefed.

87
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,312
Oh, Mr. President...

88
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,773
this is catching us all
off guard over here.

89
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,192
State, local, we had no idea.

90
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,276
I understand.

91
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,588
I'm with the vice president,
the secretary of state Durant,

92
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,074
and on the line with us
is Counterterrorism Director Green.

93
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,660
Governor, sir, I'm sorry,
but we needed to act.

94
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,079
I contacted
local law enforcement directly.

95
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,872
Well, it took a while to get to me.

96
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,391
Mitch, the counterterrorism director

97
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,894
will be sharing information
that we must keep amongst ourselves.

98
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,964
We do not want to do anything
that affects today's voting.

99
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,131
Forty-five minutes ago,

100
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,176
we raided the home
of Muhammed Kalabi, sir.

101
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,344
On Deaderick Ave.

102
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,055
- Yes.
- It's near the Coliseum.

103
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:20,101
The suspect was not in his apartment,
but we did find bomb-making material.

104
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,064
- Jesus, uh...
- Now, Mitch...

105
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,483
the last thing we want
is for you to panic.

106
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,363
You must know that you have the full
support of the federal government here.

107
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,241
Um, it...
Well, what... what's next?

108
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,661
We believe his target is
one of the voting centers.

109
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,105
We know
you have soldiers in place,

110
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,290
security measures and checkpoints.
Director Green is on his way to you.

111
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,293
There will be a command center
out of the FBI office in Knoxville

112
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,503
where we will coordinate.

113
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,089
My family voted
at the Coliseum this morning.

114
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:54,135
Mitch, listen to me.
Whatever you need, we will provide.

115
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,056
How are the Ohio numbers?

116
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,308
It's hard to gauge
with turnout this low.

117
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,602
That was kind of the point.

118
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,646
For the other side, not Democrats.

119
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,231
The governor's worried.
Do you have any numbers?

120
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:09,191
No, just what we gave you.

121
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,029
I would think that the president might
have access to some numbers that we don't.

122
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,488
When I get them, you'll get them.

123
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,949
- We're worried.
- Hang in there.

124
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,451
I'll touch base with you
after the three o'clock wave.

125
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,372
If you could all just give me
a moment, please. Thank you.

126
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,584
You better head over to the ballroom.
One of us should make an appearance.

127
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,461
Sir, the day has finally arrived.

128
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,423
Yes, and let's see
just how long this day lasts.

129
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:42,349
Imagine my surprise when the NSA called me
about Muhammed Kalabi just...

130
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,101
moments before you did.

131
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,146
Situation is still unfolding.

132
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,731
On Election Day?

133
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,780
Francis...

134
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,866
it's been quite a journey
working with you.

135
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,538
Kalabi slipped into the country,

136
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:09,085
and he's planning a terrorist attack
against a voting center in Tennessee.

137
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,047
And that is a terrifying proposition.

138
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,426
Well, I may need you to stay around
the White House a bit longer, Cathy,

139
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,428
until this situation is resolved.

140
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,889
Of course.

141
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,559
I was only saying...

142
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,312
it's been a good run.

143
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,661
As if she could ever get under my skin.

144
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,164
I don't need to get to the party just yet.

145
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,877
Sweaty palms,
eager to pay me their last respects.

146
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,420
When what they really want to do
to show their respect

147
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,924
is to empty their bullets in my body,
just to make sure that I'm dead.

148
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,054
Patti, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

149
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,783
Miss Harvey was just telling me that
there's been a change in the schedule.

150
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,351
Yes, unfortunately,
we're in a bit of an emergency.

151
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:10,271
Uh, but I hope it will be resolved soon.

152
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,064
Tom, hello.

153
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,527
- You know Mr. Yates, don't you?
- Yes, we met at the convention.

154
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,237
So LeAnn will be at the hotel.

155
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,908
She can reach me if you feel I need
to be there sooner rather than later.

156
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,162
Uh, in case it's later...

157
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,372
I want you to think
four years down the road.

158
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,250
- I'm sorry?
- They trust you.

159
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,963
Four years is no time.

160
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,883
We have a car waiting.

161
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
So we're shaking hands today?

162
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,068
I think it's best we keep it like that.

163
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,198
Well, shake it like you mean it.

164
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,625
How's that?

165
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,594
So you want me to just head
over to the ballroom?

166
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,306
No.

167
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,391
No.

168
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,979
I do like looking at you
across a large room.

169
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:42,654
Victory.

170
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,160
This is for when you win.

171
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,043
I wrote a concession speech as well.

172
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,276
With increased security
at polling places across the country,

173
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,279
will fewer Americans
vote for the president this year

174
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,364
than in any election in recent memory?

175
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,575
Particular attention is being paid
to typical battleground states,

176
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,369
Ohio and Pennsylvania,

177
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,829
where voter turnout
has become a central issue

178
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,624
that could make all the difference
in this historic election.

179
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,170
You know,
if turnout is low in Philadelphia...

180
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
the Underwoods are going under.

181
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,632
You need a better in than that.

182
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,720
You look like you've been chewed up
and shit out twice today.

183
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,058
Seems like you're having trouble focusing.
You ever see a doctor about that?

184
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,560
Um, what?

185
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,643
Oh, 'cause I feel pretty comfortable
diagnosing you

186
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:59,690
- with too much on your fucking mind.

187
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,734
Hey, let me get you something real.
I'm celebrating.

188
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,404
Two Oban.

189
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,407
Celebrating what?

190
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,493
Oh, you know Tom Hammerschmidt's
long lead team?

191
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,288
You're looking at the newest member.

192
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,665
That guy never gives up.

193
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:20,627
Mmm. I tell you what he's up to,
feed him things from you.

194
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:25,632
Don't you think it's a little late
for quid pro quo?

195
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,801
Oh, the Underwoods could still win.

196
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,054
We'll see.

197
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:34,141
Either way,
you still have a couple more months.

198
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
Yeah.

199
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,230
- I'll land somewhere.

200
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,152
...Your phone.

201
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:49,240
Can somebody give me
a second today, you know?

202
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,243
Shit. Excuse me.

203
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,578
Hello?

204
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,330
...while reports are coming in

205
00:15:56,413 --> 00:16:00,042
of a possible attack
at a Knoxville voting center.

206
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,502
Now, let's take a live look...

207
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,255
Tennessee?
What's going on in Tennessee?

208
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,298
...it's a very chaotic scene
at the moment.

209
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,383
What?

210
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,301
...there's a lot happening right now.

211
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,347
Police are... are, of course, trying
to keep everyone calm and safe here.

212
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,640
And we will bring you...

213
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,227
Where the hell were you?

214
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,163
Tennessee.
What the hell's going on in Tennessee?

215
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,107
Muhammed Kalabi, the ICO guy
from Syria who burned the effigy.

216
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,233
What's the plan?

217
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,029
I stand before you this evening
as vice presidential candidate,

218
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
as the First Lady of the United States,

219
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,410
and most of all...
as a citizen of this great country.

220
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,540
Despite the violent incident
at the voting center in Knoxville,

221
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,543
which the president
is attending to as we speak,

222
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:46,505
we want to assure anyone
who's considering not voting

223
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:50,634
that it is not only safe to vote,
it is your duty to do so.

224
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:54,805
It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat.
It doesn't matter if you're a Republican.

225
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,516
Our nation needs you to vote today.

226
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,851
Violence cannot beget apathy.

227
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,771
We must make our voices heard.

228
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,732
Seth!

229
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,277
Witnesses report
an FBI and Homeland presence

230
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,071
at the Knoxville voting center.

231
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,613
Do you believe this is ICO-related?

232
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
Seth, please! Come on.

233
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,159
- And the FBI isn't talking.
- Neither are you, Gina.

234
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,179
This isn't a presser,
because I didn't schedule one.

235
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,181
- We're just trying to find out...
- That's two, Gina.

236
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,998
If you're looking for a strikeout,
I'm happy to oblige.

237
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,959
No? Good.

238
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,754
There's no questions at this time.
The First Lady's statement stands as is.

239
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,382
I will have updates for you
on Tennessee as I get them.

240
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,218
Is everyone clear?
Thank you.

241
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,802
Seth!

242
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,894
I'm told everything just went wrong.

243
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,789
- The FBI had the bomb guys there...
- But, Mitch...

244
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,065
...for crying out loud!

245
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,875
...injuries didn't go
beyond scrapes and bruises.

246
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,486
Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.

247
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,571
Twelve people were taken to the hospital.

248
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,701
Look, is there any status
on Green's ETA?

249
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:59,721
- Secretary Stewart and I...
- Yes. Just a moment, sir.

250
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,224
...cannot make a determination without...
- You need to take this.

251
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,749
What? What?

252
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,210
What the hell is this?

253
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,464
Hello.

254
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,883
Governor. Mark Usher here.

255
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,885
I think we met at the conference
in Sun Valley.

256
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,137
Yes, that's right.

257
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,639
Well, I wish I were calling
under better circumstances.

258
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,974
I wanted to know
what you're going to need.

259
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:23,495
I can get some excellent people
down there fast in case you...

260
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,979
you're feeling like you need
the extra security or...

261
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:27,189
You there?

262
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,690
I'm right here, yeah.

263
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,234
I spoke to Shawna a few minutes ago,

264
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,529
and we agreed that we
absolutely cannot disrupt this election.

265
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,614
You called my secretary of state?

266
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,241
Well, she called me.

267
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,369
She is a leader of the party
in Tennessee. As are you.

268
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,875
Do I need to remind you, sir,
that yours is a red state,

269
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,686
and every Republican in it
is counting on you?

270
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,172
- Thank you, Mr. Usher.
- Now, hold on.

271
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,525
Shawna just wanted to ask
what can be done and what can't be done.

272
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,343
She's like the rest of us,
trying to figure this thing out.

273
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,473
Because of the scale of a possible threat

274
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,434
which we're still trying to determine,

275
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:07,020
and because of the importance
of these, uh, voting centers,

276
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,814
we're asking the governor to declare

277
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,057
- a state of emergency...
- Will, could you please sit?

278
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,277
I don't like it.

279
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,488
Three o'clock wave said Tennessee's
locked up, no matter what.

280
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,616
Love, no one can see.

281
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,329
What the hell?

282
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,832
...be potentially disturbing.

283
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,504
They don't bark
when there's a bomb.

284
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,130
What do you mean, "They don't bark"?

285
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,843
The canine units don't bark
when there's a bomb, Mr. President.

286
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,511
Yeah, but the whole building heard it.

287
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,930
They're trained to sit down
when they detect a bomb.

288
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,015
- So did they sit down?
- No.

289
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,476
Then there was no bomb.

290
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,394
We think the barking was provoked.

291
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,198
Provoked?
Director Green, that'll be enough.

292
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,815
These dogs are
our last line of defense, sir.

293
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:54,360
I think ICO got in there today.

294
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,083
And thank God they didn't get a bomb off,

295
00:19:56,152 --> 00:20:00,115
but whatever operative they got in there,
I think, was used to provoke the riot.

296
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,283
I said that is enough.

297
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,135
You think ICO
got all the way in that building

298
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,871
and then just decided
not to set off a bomb?

299
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,707
- Well, there are...
- We are not going to disrupt the voting.

300
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,142
Mitch, would you please
talk some sense into him?

301
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,627
- I...
- If we don't suspend,

302
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,421
the Bureau cannot guarantee
the safety of these centers.

303
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,798
Unacceptable. Find Kalabi.

304
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,427
The governor does not wanna have to
institute a curfew this late in the game.

305
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,096
- And, Mitch...
- Uh, yes, sir.

306
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,641
...you are not closing the polls.

307
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:39,029
You think we should?

308
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,198
I can't weigh in on this.

309
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,970
I need to talk to Shawna.

310
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,100
...How many scandals should the public

311
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,562
be expected to endure
before they say, "Enough"?

312
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,855
Before they say, "I'm staying home"?

313
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,150
Before they lose complete faith
in this democratic republic?

314
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:21,988
This is a trend that dates back
at least to when Nixon avoided jail time.

315
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,283
...Okay, we're out.

316
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,792
- You're good.
- I don't need fans, Sean.

317
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,086
Just genuine appreciation.

318
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,005
Would you like a drink?
One is brown and one is not.

319
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,675
- It's gonna be a long night.
- That's not what I hear.

320
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,635
So, Tennessee...

321
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,761
Is the question.

322
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,929
And?

323
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,431
My date knew nothing.

324
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,890
Are you making the rounds?

325
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,101
Crowd's a little older
than I'm used to, but...

326
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,146
yes, they're a talkative bunch...
that don't say much.

327
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,941
I'll take the brown one.

328
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,696
That's Patricia Whittaker over there.
Chairperson of the DNC.

329
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,531
She slapped me once in a bar in Omaha.

330
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,255
For the life of me, I can't tell you why.

331
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:13,081
There's something wrong with Tennessee.

332
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,042
Your date is either lying or denying.

333
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:40,526
What did you mean by this?

334
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,404
On the back of the speech?

335
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,324
Nothing. Forget it.

336
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,121
"There's still time"?

337
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,792
There's still time for what?

338
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,672
What are you doing?

339
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,299
You and your husband.

340
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,260
Getting ready to win an election.

341
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,305
I see the way you're acting.

342
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:26,196
Do you realize we have
every intention of winning today?

343
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,824
Sure.

344
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,993
But then what?

345
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,430
I used to go to this cabin... up in Maine.

346
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,018
The windows don't close properly.

347
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,566
You can smell the ocean all summer long.

348
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,127
I do think it's better
you go to the ballroom.

349
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:40,020
If you have not voted, I assure you,
you will get the chance.

350
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,648
But I cannot, in good conscience,

351
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,943
allow balloting to continue
until I am satisfied that it is safe.

352
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,988
To that end, as nightfall approaches,

353
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:55,285
I am announcing an enforced,
state-wide curfew, effective tonight.

354
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:59,122
If you are not in your home
by 8:30 p.m. central time,

355
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:02,876
or by 9:30 in the eastern parts
of this state,

356
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,880
you will be subject to detention
and possible arrest.

357
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,674
What the hell's going on?

358
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,843
What's going on is we're gonna win
Pennsylvania and Ohio.

359
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,554
That puts you over 270.

360
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,597
The polls are still open.
People are still voting.

361
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,309
My gut says they're ours.
That's 272 without Tennessee.

362
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,227
That asshole's
suspending the vote.

363
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,980
That's up to his secretary of state,
and she's on our side.

364
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,417
- She's gonna have a choice after this?
- Governor, listen to me.

365
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,835
I mean, how long
do we let Francis Underwood

366
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,820
get away with this kind of shit?
Huh? How long?

367
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,321
He won't get away with it.

368
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,531
...He won't.

369
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,241
That was Tennessee governor...

370
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,201
Trust me.

371
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,536
Bullshit.

372
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,083
Voting centers
all across the state are being shut down,

373
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,500
and anyone not in their homes

374
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,588
by 8:30 central time, or 9:30...

375
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:51,174
Five o'clock wave from Philly.
I think we're home.

376
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,552
...detention and possible arrest.
This announcement...

377
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,268
That Tennessee shit is crazy.

378
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,175
Crazy shit happens all the time.

379
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,065
This convenient?

380
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,737
Spare me the conspiracy talk.

381
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,572
The government's not that powerful...
or competent.

382
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:18,576
A man can ask.

383
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,169
We're looking at
255 Underwood, 245 Conway.

384
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,462
Pennsylvania and Ohio?

385
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,673
Still too close,
but it's almost six o' clock.

386
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,301
When we change Tennessee
from Conway to undecided...

387
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,989
- That brings Conway down to...
- Two thirty-four. Still way too close.

388
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,682
Yes, but we don't yet know
that he's locked in the western states.

389
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,409
Those states have been locked up
for ten years.

390
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:45,687
Red, red, red and they'll be red again
by the end of the night.

391
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,731
It's gonna come down
to Pennsylvania and Ohio.

392
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,525
Conway needs both.
You only need one.

393
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,609
Matthews?

394
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,946
He'll push back.
He might even go public.

395
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,698
What about the other five states in play?

396
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:57,949
The lawyers are waiting.

397
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,969
We can generate lawsuits,
argue suppression, but...

398
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,161
Still not enough.

399
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,373
Olmstead's losing in Ohio,
and he's not taking it well.

400
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,536
I spoke with his chief of staff,
Tanya, this morning.

401
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,687
He's getting clobbered
in the northern part of the state.

402
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,314
Low turnout in Cleveland's not helping.
But he could still pull it out.

403
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,675
He's not going to win and he knows it.

404
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:17,593
How much time do we have?

405
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,972
Ohio closes in two hours.
And most people voted this morning.

406
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,528
Some of these states are baked in already.

407
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,663
Claire and I need the room for a moment.

408
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,524
Yes, sir.

409
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:33,985
- LeAnn, we'll call you back.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,581
Why did you ask him to leave?

411
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,840
Because I just wanted
to look in your eyes one more time

412
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,800
before we do this.

413
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,136
Francis...

414
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,930
we're doing this.

415
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,109
He can't save us.
He invented term limits.

416
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:17,695
Doug!

417
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,826
...Get me LeAnn Harvey back on the phone.

418
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,952
Yes, sir.

419
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,954
Do what you have to do with Ohio.

420
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,705
- I'm on it.

421
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,751
LeAnn, get the lawyers ready.

422
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,338
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

423
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:38,591
- No, no, no, no, no!
- And it needs to be done quickly.

424
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,468
It's too sloppy.

425
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,303
Why are you here if LeAnn called me?

426
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,431
Do I really have to explain to you
what will happen if you don't do this?

427
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,768
I don't care if he loses.

428
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,854
I'm not talking about the election.
I'm talking about you.

429
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,982
What will happen to you?

430
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,529
You have everything you need.
The Pastebin link was sent to you.

431
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,617
Where's LeAnn?

432
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,494
She's not here,
and I'm short on time.

433
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,566
Governor, I'm sorry,
but there's only one way to play this.

434
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,711
We need you to pull your poll workers and
your machines from those three counties.

435
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,822
The Republicans would crucify me.
They own that area.

436
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,033
But those are the precincts
that are most likely to be threatened.

437
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,243
"Likely to be"?
Hey, what are you...

438
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,162
What are we talking about here?

439
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,330
Terrorist chatter.

440
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,915
Related to Tennessee?

441
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,249
Yes, sir.

442
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,811
Well, I'm gonna need
more than your word on that.

443
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,420
Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence
is classified, Governor.

444
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:59,047
Then read me in.

445
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,549
'Cause I'm not doing this
without seeing tangible proof

446
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,152
with my own eyes.
You can tell Francis.

447
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,054
The other thing is,
with Ohio turnout so low,

448
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,431
people could accuse you
of engaging in voter suppression.

449
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:09,515
What?

450
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,478
The voting centers and the troops
were the president's idea.

451
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,439
But you signed on to them,
and that's what matters.

452
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,985
You're losing your election, sir.
The signs are clear.

453
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,363
That'd be a real shame
for the Democrats to be down a governor.

454
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,324
But here we have
this confluence of events.

455
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,411
Your disappointing returns on one hand
and the chatter on the other.

456
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,999
I need proof.
Otherwise, people will think...

457
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,835
That you shut down voting
in Republican precincts

458
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,169
to guarantee your own win.

459
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,216
Now I'd say it's a good thing that the NSA
just picked up on some credible chatter.

460
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,010
This dangerous world left you no choice.

461
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,639
Oh... thank you.

462
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,227
Governor, I was just handed
the classified intel.

463
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:56,938
Are you on a secure server?

464
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,024
- Yes, I am.
- Please hold.

465
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,864
I'm sending the files over right now.

466
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,549
You're doing the right thing, sir.
We don't want blood on our hands.

467
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,930
I don't care where they're taking
the voting machines.

468
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,014
Just stay...

469
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,892
You chain yourself to one of them
if you have to.

470
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,851
Good.
I'm gonna find an Ohio judge.

471
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,689
Voting centers in Ohio
have been closed for almost two hours.

472
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,983
And Conway's got a judge.
He's petitioning to reopen.

473
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,777
But even if they stay closed,
would Ohio get us there?

474
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,446
Other states might be in play.

475
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,781
Rumblings of suppression
are out there, although...

476
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:51,409
- Well, what else do we have?
- Voter intimidation in Idaho.

477
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,932
What do you think? Should I call them back
and have them file?

478
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,413
I like it.

479
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,958
It has the most resonance
with what's happened in Tennessee.

480
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,501
I also like an assemblyman
we have in Georgia.

481
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,045
There's a congressman in Maryland.

482
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,422
That's one of the states
that didn't request the troops.

483
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,483
But wait. Don't we need something
coming from a voter?

484
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:10,386
There's a voter in Mississippi.
Said she was too scared to vote.

485
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,055
That TV essentially told her not to go.

486
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,818
Well, that sounds like a bit of a stretch.

487
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,810
That could be a plus for us, sir.
Really open things up.

488
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:20,855
If Ohio stays shut,
there could be a ripple effect.

489
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,024
This is all uncharted territory.

490
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,276
All right, let's put a pin
in Georgia and Maryland,

491
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,862
and let's keep
the Ohio voting centers shut down,

492
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,405
and see where that gets us.

493
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,117
Pennsylvania has gone to Conway.

494
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,910
Even if Ohio is still too close to call

495
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:38,081
and the president does well
in the Northwest,

496
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,833
he can't counter
Conway's gains in the South,

497
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,211
in what would typically be
Underwood territory.

498
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,920
The people have spoken.

499
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,798
I can't believe this.

500
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,551
The president apologizes
that he couldn't be here tonight,

501
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,846
but he wanted me to let you know
that concession is inevitable.

502
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,932
All the states haven't been called yet.

503
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,737
The president still has time if he needs...

504
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,979
Guys, we fought a good fight.

505
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,274
But, unfortunately,
this is the reality of the situation.

506
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,859
- Jesus.

507
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,154
Well, I guess that's that.

508
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,326
...Yeah, this is Will.

509
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,245
I wanted to be
the first to tell you

510
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,830
congratulations, Mr. President-elect.

511
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,084
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

512
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,961
Oh, what? You think I learned
nothing from Al Gore?

513
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:29,963
We kept them on the edge
of their seats, didn't we?

514
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,262
I guess that means the system is working.

515
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,014
I guess it does.

516
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,284
You're about as tough an opponent
as they come, Francis.

517
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,767
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

518
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,188
Now, you be sure to give my regards
to Hannah and the children.

519
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,980
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm...

520
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,734
sure I'll be calling on you
for advice in the very near future.

521
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,403
Well, I look forward to that.

522
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,915
He conceded?

523
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,173
- Yeah.

524
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,927
...We did it.

525
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,514
We did it.

526
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,559
Excuse me, sir.

527
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,603
General Brockhart
is on his way over to the suite.

528
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,687
Thank you.

529
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,115
Sources are telling us
that Francis Underwood

530
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,574
conceded to Governor Conway

531
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,160
- on the phone only a short time ago.

532
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,996
I suspect their numbers
are matching up with ours,

533
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,790
which would put Ohio
in the Republican column.

534
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:49,462
Enough to make William Conway
the next president of the United States.

535
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,847
- Hello?
- Tanya, put him on the line.

536
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,075
Hang on, let me see if I can get him.

537
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,518
He's my secretary of state,
and he has the power to do it.

538
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,246
Well, then you need
to tell him what to do.

539
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,938
He says he can reopen
and extend the voting day into tomorrow.

540
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,274
Tell him it's not safe.

541
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,942
I've done that, Doug!
Obviously, he doesn't seem to care.

542
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,736
Underwood conceded already.

543
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:17,323
Do not trot out your secretary of state.

544
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,574
Voting cannot resume.

545
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,076
Now, if you have any doubt,
you swallow it right now.

546
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,430
I'm worried about the party.
What this could do to the party.

547
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,415
Roger, this is so much bigger
than the party.

548
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,668
I feel like I'm risking
my entire career here.

549
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,085
You are.

550
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,631
And if you don't do what I'm telling you,
it's over for sure.

551
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,471
What?

552
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:51,191
How many hours is it gonna take him
to spit out the fucking words in public?

553
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,484
Hey, screw this. Screw protocol.
I'm heading down there.

554
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,421
- No, you're not.
- It's already tomorrow, Mark.

555
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,487
I mean, this is insane.

556
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,365
- I want to make my speech!
- Ohio is still in play.

557
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,491
What?

558
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,828
What are you talking about?

559
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,955
...fear from continued terrorist threats

560
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:09,041
and the disturbing news
coming out of Tennessee...

561
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,172
I was forced to close
a number of our polling places.

562
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,927
Fuck me.

563
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,640
And in accordance
with the Ohio secretary of state,

564
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,602
the vote is suspended
until further notice.

565
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,359
Now, I know this may put
our electorates in question...

566
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,445
...but I had no choice.

567
00:36:41,156 --> 00:36:44,910
New Jersey might not certify.
There's been a variety of irregularities.

568
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,789
Same with Illinois.
Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.

569
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,545
I'm having déjà vu.
You ever get that?

570
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,924
Are you seriously asking me
about déjà vu?

571
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,261
Never mind.
It's gone.

572
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,681
You never get déjà vu?
Everybody does.

573
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
I don't.

574
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,729
Don't look so worried, Doug.
You just felt familiar for a second.

575
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,274
It's over.

576
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,192
Now, the presidency
hangs in the balance.

577
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,195
At least six states
will not have certified vote totals

578
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,365
on Election Night 2016.

579
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,535
Good evening.

580
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,204
I guess I should say good morning. Um...

581
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,585
Will wishes he could be here himself...

582
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,838
but we've been advised
that goes against protocol.

583
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,425
I know...

584
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,135
you're disappointed.

585
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,431
Are you okay with the word disappointed?

586
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,519
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?

587
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,187
I'd say we should tread lightly.

588
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,440
For now, we're just asking
for their patience.

589
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,650
Okay, let's do it.

590
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,529
Never a dull moment
in this country.

591
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,949
Will wishes he could be here himself,

592
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,369
but we've been advised
that would go against protocol.

593
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,624
I know you're disappointed
that the change you were hoping for...

594
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,751
...that you voted for,

595
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,712
has to wait a little longer.

596
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,358
And, finally,
a night of electoral indecision,

597
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,235
with lawsuits being filed
in nearly every state,

598
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,448
has ended with the mayor of Honolulu,
in the last state to close its polls,

599
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:49,369
refusing to honor the results
of the election and filing a lawsuit.

600
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,329
...Was Hawaii one of ours?

601
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,498
No, I don't think so.

602
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,670
Claire,
could you do me a little favor?

603
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,342
I have a splitting headache.
Could you rub my temples for a moment?

604
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,677
Of course.

605
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,601
No, actually the pain
is right behind my eyes.

606
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,104
Could you just...
rub my eyes for me?

607
00:39:18,313 --> 00:39:20,190
But you hate that.

608
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,610
I know,
but I think I'll like it this time.

609
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,665
You can do it harder.

610
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,586
Even harder than that.

611
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:56,185
There's no coming back from this.

612
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,481
Oh, I know exactly what we're about to do.

613
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,902
If we fail, it's on both of us.
I won't be able to protect you.

614
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,073
And what a relief that will be...

615
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,492
for both of us.

616
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,083
The American people
don't know what's best for them.

617
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,167
I do.

618
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,338
I know exactly what they need.

619
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,426
They're like little children, Claire.

620
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,178
Children we never had.

621
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,142
We have to hold their sticky fingers
and wipe their filthy mouths.

622
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,269
Teach them right from wrong.

623
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,397
Tell them what to think
and how to feel and what to want.

624
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,694
They even need help
writing their wildest dreams,

625
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,029
crafting their worst fears.

626
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,451
Lucky for them...

627
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,328
they have me...

628
00:40:58,163 --> 00:40:59,624
they have you.

629
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,669
Underwood.

630
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,006
Underwood.

631
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,675
2016.

632
00:41:13,428 --> 00:41:14,680
2020.

633
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,685
2024.

634
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,148
2028.

635
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,568
2032.

636
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,739
2036.

637
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,828
One nation...

638
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,539
Underwood.

639
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,432
Doug, LeAnn...
do you have a moment?
