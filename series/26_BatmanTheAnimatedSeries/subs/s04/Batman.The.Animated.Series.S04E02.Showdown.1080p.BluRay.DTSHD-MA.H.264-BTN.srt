1
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,145
You can put those away.
They will sleep for hours.

2
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:46,022
BATMAN: But I won't.

3
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,364
- What did he want?
- I'm not sure.

4
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,538
But it appears he left us a present.

5
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,958
He's moving toward the airfield.

6
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,045
That autogyro he's using
isn't a long-range craft.

7
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,006
He must be planning on rendezvousing
with a bigger plane.

8
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,136
- There.
- BATMAN: "Lazarus."

9
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,889
It's too easy. He wants us to find him.

10
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,599
Let's check this out.

11
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:08,813
RA'S: <i>I anticipated meeting you
tonight, Detective.</i>

12
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,734
<i>I hope the story I have to tell you may
cause you to reconsider your pursuit.</i>

13
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:17,196
<i>The year was 1883.</i>

14
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,866
<i>Your government
was ruthlessly expanding westward.</i>

15
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,710
What will it be, stranger?

16
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,422
Water, ma'am, in a clean glass.

17
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,552
Horse done give out on me 10 miles back,

18
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,638
and I'm hotter than
a shaved coyote with a heat rash.

19
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,434
Another thing, ma'am.
You by any chance seen this feller?

20
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,104
You a bounty hunter?

21
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,273
Just to pay for my piano lessons.

22
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,484
I know that two-bit skunk.

23
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,694
He hurt one of my girls real bad.

24
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,239
If you could point me in his
general direction, I'd appreciate it.

25
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:46,911
That I can and will.
And this one's on the house.

26
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,081
SHERIFF: Well, well.

27
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,626
Jonah Hex, his own bad self.

28
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:57,713
Been here five minutes and you ain't
killed nobody nor set nothing on fire.

29
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,507
Slipping, ain't you?

30
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,342
I'm still a little bushed.

31
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:07,306
Fact is, you look a little past it, Hex.
Not tired, just all used up.

32
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,725
Well, if I get pushed,

33
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,686
I can still shoot a fly out
from between its wings,

34
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,772
provided the light's right, of course.

35
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,858
And it's a big, plump fly.

36
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,283
I ain't got nothing on you, Hex. Yet.

37
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,954
Just remember them wanted posters say,
"Dead or alive."

38
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,290
You might try "alive" this time.

39
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,459
First time for everything.

40
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,550
Be back here around midnight.
I can help you then.

41
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,354
Duvall comes into town now and then,
starts fights, bothers my girls,

42
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,314
challenges men to duels.

43
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,149
I'm aware of his habits, missy.

44
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,318
What I ain't aware of is
where he's holed up.

45
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,028
Strange thing, that.

46
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:06,448
He ain't staying at the hotel,
and the next town's 50 miles away.

47
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,119
Sounds like he likes to sleep on
the ground with the rest of the snakes.

48
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:13,414
He ain't the type.
More the clean-sheet sort.

49
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,915
And he first showed up in town

50
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,710
about the time folks started seeing
the sky monster.

51
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,044
The what?

52
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,671
No one knows what it is,

53
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:23,591
and the sheriff's too yellow
to investigate.

54
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:28,095
It only comes out at night,
like a big boat or a log in the sky.

55
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,472
About the same time it showed,

56
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,433
folks started seeing lights in the-

57
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,268
Get down.

58
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:43,694
Way I figure, that glow might some way
tie in with the sky monster and Duvall.

59
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,571
Reckon so.

60
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,532
I think you'd better
start back now, missy.

61
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,827
Got a feeling things might get loud
and busy soon.

62
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,749
Good luck, Jonah Hex.

63
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,084
Right nice sentiment, ma'am.

64
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,881
But I never cottoned much to luck.
I like to make my own.

65
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,259
I'll remember that when I see you next.

66
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,458
All right, hurry up
with that crane up there.

67
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,547
All right, a little lower,
a little lower.

68
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:19,873
Work, you lazy good-for-nothing!

69
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:26,630
I've told you repeatedly,
this is not how I do things!

70
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:28,882
I beg your pardon, sir.

71
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:32,261
I was hoping to expedite
the completion of the airship.

72
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:37,099
Commendable, but not at the expense
of my workforce.

73
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,310
Good men are hard to find
in these parts,

74
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,021
and there is still much to be done.

75
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,315
The government's western expansion
is destroying this land.

76
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:48,777
Drastic steps must be taken
to preserve the wilderness.

77
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:52,114
And Ra's al Ghul is the one to do it.

78
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,366
Who better than I?

79
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,953
I'll destroy the railroad and bomb
other railroad junctions

80
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,622
as I move eastward toward Washington.

81
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:02,416
Once Washington is in flames,

82
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,710
I'll force the United States government

83
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,088
to declare me master of America!

84
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,884
Whatever you say.

85
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:31,028
It would appear we have ourselves
a government spy.

86
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:35,365
A rather disreputable-looking one
at that.

87
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:37,409
Well, Mr. Spy,

88
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,872
I'd say your plan has failed
and the railroad is doomed.

89
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,874
I ain't no spy.

90
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,753
I'm Jonah Hex, and I don't give
a tinker's cuss about no railroad.

91
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,964
I've come to get you, Arkady Duvall,

92
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,259
on account of what you done
to that girl back east.

93
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,428
You mean to say

94
00:09:56,595 --> 00:10:00,307
you've tracked me
across 12 states because of that?

95
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,977
Well, there's also the matter
of a $200 reward.

96
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,355
That part don't hurt my feelings none.

97
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:09,274
You're either a liar or a fool.

98
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,485
I've been known to be foolish,

99
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,655
but ain't nobody calls me a liar
and goes to bed happy.

100
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,699
Give him a lead bath.

101
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,050
Perhaps we can make both sides match.

102
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,301
Stop!

103
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,096
You are becoming quite bold, Arkady.

104
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:43,267
Whipping my men, disposing
of interlopers without consulting me.

105
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:46,311
He's a spy, sir, a railroad spy.

106
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,649
He looks more like a saddle burn to me.

107
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,235
Imprison him. I will question him later.

108
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,574
And you, Arkady, will make no more
decisions without my approval.

109
00:10:58,657 --> 00:10:59,825
Understood?

110
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,783
What?

111
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,709
GOVERNOR: Today on this momentous period
in history,

112
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,754
we link our great western lands
with the east.

113
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:41,051
Before this great enterprise,
envisioned by myself,

114
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,428
there was nothing here but wilderness.

115
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,556
And from it, with bare hands,

116
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,393
hard work and dedication,

117
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:53,188
we have hewn a civilized land.

118
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,407
And so it gives me great pleasure
as the territorial governor

119
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,867
to drive the golden spike
which will connect

120
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,037
these two great sections
of the North American continent.

121
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:34,563
RA'S: <i>Run, if you value your lives!</i>

122
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,444
Clear the area! Maintain at your peril!

123
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:02,507
Fire!

124
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,439
Run for your lives!

125
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,336
Don't shoot, you fool!

126
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,213
This ship is full of hydrogen gas!

127
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,173
Do you want to blow us all to atoms?

128
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,494
You! I don't believe it!

129
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,913
Guess I'm just a bad penny.

130
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,332
Why are you doing this?

131
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,377
Because I don't like you or your kind.

132
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,671
Excuse me.

133
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,842
No! The hydrogen cells!

134
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,893
What happened?

135
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,687
It was that scarred man.

136
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,647
He turned our own cannons on us.

137
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:33,158
Now, let's you and me dance.

138
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,119
You cannot defeat me.

139
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:38,955
I am a Heidelberg fencing champion.

140
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,166
My heart's all aflutter.

141
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:54,179
I'll chop you to pieces.

142
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:56,973
Talk, talk, talk.

143
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,445
Order the men to abandon ship.

144
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,656
Aye, sir. But what about Duvall?

145
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,783
Leave that fool to his fate.

146
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,221
5000 in gold.
Take it. Leave me be.

147
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,640
It ain't about money, boy.

148
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:24,352
It's about justice,
and I aim to serve you some.

149
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,563
Let me live. Please.

150
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,899
I will, only because
it's too much trouble

151
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,277
to haul your stinking carcass back east.

152
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,454
I'm getting too old for this.

153
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,921
Great story. But what's it got to do
with that rest home?

154
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,882
I think I know.

155
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,733
I assume you listened
to my account, Detective.

156
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:12,942
Yes.

157
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:17,489
Duvall.

158
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,200
It can't be. He'd be over 100 years old.

159
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,703
He was sentenced to 50 years
of hard labor.

160
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,539
Of course, no one expected him
to live out that sentence.

161
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,333
No one but me.

162
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,959
The Lazarus pit.

163
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:31,878
When he was a young man,

164
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,756
though even its powers cannot
restore him now.

165
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,968
When his sentence was completed,
Arkady simply wandered away.

166
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,931
The privations he had suffered
had left his mind shattered.

167
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:46,184
I had lost track of him until he
turned up in that rest home.

168
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,229
You left Duvall to his fate
a century ago.

169
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:51,272
Why come back for him now?

170
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,943
Did you really think, Detective,
that in my 600 years of life,

171
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:58,279
I would've sired only one offspring?

172
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,326
Even before the Phoenix debacle,
I had come to realize

173
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,540
that Arkady was too unbalanced and cruel
to wisely rule my empire.
