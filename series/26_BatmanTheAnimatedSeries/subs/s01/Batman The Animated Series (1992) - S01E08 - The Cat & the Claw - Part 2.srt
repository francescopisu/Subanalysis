(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

183
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,788
These will certainly
enhance the resort's brochure.

184
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,754
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

I didn't think you cared.

BATMAN: Come on!

188
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,974
You've got to get out of here.

CATWOMAN: Me? What about you?

190
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,978
There's something I have to pick up.

191
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,276
Welcome to my little resort.

192
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,573
Plan on a short stay.

It's never dull, is it, Batman?

195
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:07,883
You may be surprised to know

196
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:11,303
these accommodations
are courtesy of your government.

197
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,892
They built this top-secret facility
to shelter high officials

198
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,311
in case of a nuclear incident.

199
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,648
Since you wanted
the plague so badly, Batman,

200
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,319
we've decided to give it to you.

201
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,824
What will you use to blackmail Gotham
if you waste it on us?

202
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,161
Why risk carrying such deadly contents,

203
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:38,330
when a placebo will do?

204
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,709
By the time they realize
the vial is a fake,

205
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,671
we'll be miles away
with their billion dollars.

207
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,259
The acid should eat through
in a matter of minutes.

208
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:55,263
Sound evacuation,
and begin sealing the compound.

209
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:59,518
We wouldn't want the plague
to harm the precious wildlife,

210
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:01,686
just the vermin in here.

211
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,360
Ugh. Would I like to
get my claws into them.

212
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,196
If I could just get some slack...

213
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,783

is a woman's touch.

You've got to get out of here.

Not without you.

221
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,986
I'll be right behind you.

222
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
But first,
I've got to destroy the plague.

223
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,906
Now go!

224
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,744

<i>Give yourselves up.</i>

232

Right where Batman said they'd be.

For years, I've fought
to build my network.

Thank you, friend.

you found your cat burglar?
