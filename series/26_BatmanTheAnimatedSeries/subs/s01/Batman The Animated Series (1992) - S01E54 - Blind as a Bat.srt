(CHUCKLES MENACINGLY)

175
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,196
(SHOTS FIRING)

176
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:14,824
(GRUNTS)

177
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,794
Argh!

178
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,434
(GROANS)

179
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,645
I'll handle him.

180
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,801
(BATMAN YELLS)

181
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,985
What's the matter, Bat...

182
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,069
(GRUNTS) Ahhh!

183
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,202

185
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,662
(CLANGING)

186
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:30,794
Your aim appears to be
a little off today, Batman.

187
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,715
I don't think you can hit
the broad side of a barn,

188
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,385
let alone the broad side of this bird.

189
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,929
You're blind as a bat.

190
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,931
Sightless and helpless.

191
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,558
(GRUNTS)

192
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,727
You got one right.

(PENGUIN LAUGHING)

194
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,700
(EVIL LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

195
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,751
PENGUIN:
And where do you think you're going?

196
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,007
You've hit a dead end, rodent.

197
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,854
You're only prolonging the inevitable.

198
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,168
(COUGHING)

199
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,254
(COUGHING CONTINUES)

200
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,390
(PENGUIN GRUNTING IN PAIN)

201
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,976
Not possible.

202
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,313
You're supposed to be
helpless. Helpless!

203
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:19,402
I'd feel a lot better about this
if you'd listened to me.

204
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,661
ALFRED: Master Bruce?

205
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:30,747
Well?

206
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:35,502
My word, sir. Surely, you're not...

207
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,171
No, Alfred. I can see just fine.

208
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:41,382
And right now,
I've never seen anything prettier.

209
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,267
