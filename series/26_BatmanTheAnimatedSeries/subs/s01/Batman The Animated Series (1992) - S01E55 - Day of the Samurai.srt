00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,257

I believe I will have that tea, Alfred.

36
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,104
Once upon a time, Alfred,
500 years ago to be exact,

37
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,775
<i>there was a fighting master who learned</i>
<i>how to manipulate the</i> ki <i>lines,</i>

38
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,986
<i>the currents of life force.</i>

39
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,283
<i>He called the art</i> kiba-no-hoko <i>,</i>
<i>"The Way of the Fang.</i>"

40
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,496
<i>It was such an efficient
and terrible fighting art</i>

41
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,541
<i>that the master decided it was
too dangerous to teach.</i>

42
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:23,215
<i>A mere touch could render
a man unconscious, or cripple him.</i>

43
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:26,635
<i>There was even a touch that was fatal.</i>

44
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:37,271
<i>So the master hid the only copy of</i>
<i>the instruction scroll for</i> kiba-no-hoko

45
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,191
<i>in one of the thousand caves
on the slopes of Mount Kajiiki.</i>

46
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,986
<i>He told no one but his eldest son.</i>

47
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:52,328
<i>The location has been kept
a family secret for 500 years.</i>

48
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,664
ALFRED: And Yoru Sensei?

49
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,000
BRUCE: Is the great-great-great-grandson

50
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,252
of the man who created
that forbidden art.

51
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,882
And the only man who knows
the location of the scroll.

52
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,635
Yoru Sensei has no sons.

53
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:12,348
When he leaves this world,
the secret leaves with him.

54
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,808
And the kidnapped girl?

55
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,477
Yoru's star student.

56
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,438
Kyodai wants to trade her
for the knowledge of the fang.

57
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,607
ALFRED: To use against you, I expect.

58
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,028
Well, perhaps our cowled friend
can persuade him otherwise.

59
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:27,821
It's not that easy, Alfred.

60
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,408
He's after Batman as well.

61
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:32,910
But why?

62
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,038
He fought Bruce Wayne and Batman.

63
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,290
Fighting styles are like fingerprints.

64
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,170
Kyodai knows that we are the same man.

65
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,601
That was Kyodai Ken.

66
00:07:57,893 --> 00:07:59,913
BRUCE: Did he give you
instructions for the exchange?

67
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,232
YORU: Yes. In the Uramachi district
after dark.

68
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,944

a place of thieves and the Yakuza.

70

he wouldn't know the difference.

71

True, but I would know.

72

of the young lady

100

and the destruction of the scroll,
your chores here were finished.

101
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:21,842
Kyodai has the part of the scroll
that describes the <i>o-nemuri</i> touch.

102
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:25,262
I'm afraid my Japanese is
a bit rusty, Master Bruce.

103
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,347

I cannot tell you
where the fatal point lies, Wayne-san.

108

I never allowed myself
to read the scroll,

109
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:29,451
for fear I might someday be tempted
to use the forbidden knowledge.

110
