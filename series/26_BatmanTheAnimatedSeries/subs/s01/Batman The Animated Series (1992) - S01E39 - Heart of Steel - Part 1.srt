a decoy file here last night.

180
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,678
The real design specs file
is at my house.

181
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,640
<i>- Randa.</i>
- Yes?

182
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:04,684
<i>The information I need
was not in that file.</i>

183
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,935
<i>Search the house.</i>

184
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,147
<i>My databanks of Rossum's memories
indicate that Bruce Wayne</i>

185
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,900
<i>always kept important backups at home.</i>

186
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,276
I'll do it right now.

187
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,076
I heard your voice, Ms. Duane,
and thought Master Bruce had returned.

188
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,119
I thought you might enjoy a spot of tea.

189
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,372
(GROANS)

190
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,505
I think it's time Ms. Duane
answered some questions.

191
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,678
(RINGING)

192
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:48,937
Something wrong?

193
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,980
No answer at the house.

194
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,190
I better get back there.

195
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:53,608
See you later, Lucius.

196
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,562
HARDAC, I've definitely found something.

197
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,564
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

198
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:35,775
<i>Intriguing. This data
may be useful later.</i>

199
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,069
<i>There must be a central computer.</i>

200
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>It will have the data I need.</i>

201
00:20:40,196 --> 00:20:42,449
I see it. Prepare for interface
in one minute.

202
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:52,083
<i>I will take it from here, Randa.
You come home.</i>

203
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,090
Alfred? Randa?

204
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:03,428
Alfred!

205
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,513
Alfred?

206
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,057
Master Bruce.

207
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,935
Alfred, what happened?
Where's Ms. Duane?

208
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,271
Forgive me, Master Bruce.

209
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:16,649
I can't imagine how would I...
I must've dozed off.

210
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,569
I assume Ms. Duane has left.

211
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,072
I assume nothing at this point.

212
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,958
Computer, scan Batcave for...

213
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:39,672
What?

214
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,598
(SCREAMS)

215
