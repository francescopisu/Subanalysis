"Boo!"

185
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,264
Hey, is this some kind of joke?

186
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,351
It's no joke, I assure you.

187
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:58,146
It's the fear of victory
and the agony of...

188
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,690
The Scarecrow!

190
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:08,281
So, now you understand step one
in how I fix an athletic contest.

191
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,243
I shall proceed to step two.

192
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:14,413
No! No! Get away!

He's gonna get me!

195
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,766
That's how we found him.
Scared as a rat at a cat convention.

196
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,852
I've never seen anything like it.

197
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,788
BATMAN: You haven't been watching
the sports channel.

198
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,938
Sports?

199
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,357
Oh, you mean those athletes?

200
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:46,236
- What's that got to do with...
- Put two and two together, Commissioner.

201
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,072
That goon in there
works for Leon the bookie.

202
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,323
And word has it,

203
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,617
he's been taking it on the chin lately.

204
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,996
You're telling me
that that walking pile of straw

205
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,081
scares the stuffing out of sports stars,

206
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,417
and then bets against their teams?

207
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,543
Exactly.

208
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:05,297
A perfect way to scare up
some quick cash for his sick schemes.

209
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,013
Steady, Dick.

210
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:14,764
You can do it.

211
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,185
No!

212
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,352
I'm not afraid!

213
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,730
I'm not afraid!

214
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,940
I'm not... No!

(GASPS)

216
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,575
I learned to walk on a high wire.

217
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,703
Now I can't stand
on a step stool without freaking.

218
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:37,871
I'm...

219
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,539
I'm no good to you anymore.

220
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,418
BATMAN: Easy, Dick.
It's bound to wear off.

221
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,587
But, in the meantime,
you've got to fight it.

222
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,297
Regain control.

223
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,798
Come on.

ROBIN: Where?

225
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,720
BATMAN: I thought we'd
catch a game tonight.

226
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:58,058
The Gotham Knights are favored 4-1,
thanks to their quarterback, Mitch Nole.

227
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,062
ROBIN: You think he's
gonna get a telegram?

228
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:04,356
I'd say it's a good bet.

230
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,277
I'll only get in the way.

231
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,697
You can be my extra set of eyes. Get in.

232
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,617
I'll drive real slow.

233
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,728
Okay, Robin.

234
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,689
Get it together.

235
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,032
Telegram for Mitch Nole. Oh!

236
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,119
What? What's wrong?
All I did was double-park!

237
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,745

Four hundred yards passing,
and the game's not over yet.

that gambling is illegal in Gotham?

00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,348
I need the money, Batman.

255
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,975
You know the cost
of chemicals these days.

256
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,896
And it'll take much more than this
to bring every pathetic person in Gotham

to their knees, kissing my feet!

you won't follow me?

I'd prefer a little insurance
