And you hear things I don't.

180
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,447
I want Red Claw.

181
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:09,282
And until I get him,

182
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,203
I'm going to lean extra hard on you,
and all the other mob bosses.

183
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:17,249
If you think
I've been bad news before...

184
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:20,377
I get the picture.
I'll see what I can do.

185
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,309
If Stern won't admit
what's going on,

186
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,437
we'll have to find out for ourselves.

187
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,074
Despite our loss of arms,

188
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,827
thanks to Batman's interference,

189
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,663
we're going to proceed
according to plan.

191
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,799
Tomorrow at 2300 hours,

192
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:11,344
a train under military escort
will pass through Gotham.

193
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,890
It will be transporting
a strain of viral plague

194
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:18,560
that Interpol confiscated
from our eastern laboratories.

195
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:22,898
I cannot overemphasize the importance
of that plague to our cause.

198
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,037
I believe Beethoven's
<i>Ode to Joy</i> will do the trick.

(PLAYING TUNE)

200
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,132

Outstanding.

205
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:11,613
We'll hit the train
outside the city, at this point.

207

What is that?

208
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,124
A cat at the end of its nine lives.

209

(DOOR RATTLES)

213
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,794
She's in the ventilation system.

214
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,719
I think we're in over our heads.

215
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:33,820
Ow, ow, ow!

My hero.

225
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,047
That was for saving my cat.

226
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,924
Is that all it was for?

227
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,343
- Maybe not.
- I heard gunfire.

228

Occupational hazard.

No.

Let's keep the mystery.

231
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,685
If I don't unmask you, the police will.

Don't be silly.

You can't deny
there's something between us.

I'm sorry.

It had its ups and downs.

244

But I did get pictures
of the fun family-resort site.

It looks like there's some kind of

abandoned military facility,
underground.
