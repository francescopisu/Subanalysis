00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,382
"Where tracks and golf balls roll
and wind."

00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:37,597
"Round colored banners of all kind."

00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,102
"Here, new instructions you will find."

00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,105
MAN: (ON PA) <i>You've come</i>
<i>to the right place, Mr. McWhirter.</i>

6
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,608
<i>You won't be able to find me.</i>

7
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,360
Just follow the sound of my voice.

8
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,907
Who the devil are you?

9
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,788
Well, for a diplomatic courier,
you're not very diplomatic, are you?

10
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,958
If you're my contact,
what's the countersign?

11
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,711
(TUTTING) Patience, patience.

12
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,023
<i>All your questions will be answered,
dear boy,</i>

13
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,258
<i>if you'll simply follow
the running lights.</i>

14
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,772
Okay, I'm here. Now what?

15
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,193

17
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,326
<i>Now then, about that
collection of bearer bonds</i>

18
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>you're supposed to transport,</i>

19
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,497
if you'll just tell me
where I can find them,

20
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>you might get out of here alive.</i>

21
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,046
(STRAINING)

22
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,471
All right! All right, I'll tell you!

23
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,474
<i>Good call. Now, hurry up.</i>

24
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,770
I hate it when people talk
with their mouth full. (CHUCKLING)

25
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,906
All we know is this, last night,
the International Relief Consortium

26
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:21,826
was supposed to receive a delivery
from one of their couriers.

27
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,079
This guy. Name's McWhirter.

28
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,541
He's lucky to be alive.

29
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,460
He was supposed to pick up
and deliver a donation.

30
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,089
A diplomatic pouch containing
$750,000 in bearer bonds

31
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,258
earmarked for humanitarian aid...

32
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,678
To starving refugees in Eastern Europe.
Yeah, I know.

33
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,597
Only McWhirter never showed up.

34
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:46,517
Somebody else got to the bonds
before he did.

35
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,977
And now they're missing.

36
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:52,022
The same somebody who lured him into
that quicksand trap you mentioned?

37
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:55,568
You know who that sounds like,
don't you? Wormwood.

38
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:56,861
The Interrogator.

39
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,113
The guy who specializes in
using deathtraps

40
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:01,532
to pry information out of his victims?

41
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,910
Terrific. Look up "slippery"
in the dictionary,

42
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,787
and you get Josiah Wormwood.

43
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,498
Well, I guess if anyone can
pin something on him

44
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,500
and make it stick, you can.

45
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:15,796
Maybe. Right now, though,
we're not even sure he's in town.

46
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,592
But I think I know which one
of Wormwood's associates

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,844
might be able to give me
that information.

48
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,559
Oh, yeah, I remember this clown.

49
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,935
Nothing but a two-bit con man.

50
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,521
But a continental type, a real smoothie,

51
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,732
<i>the kind who'll do anything
for a free meal.</i>

52
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,193
<i>Calls himself "The Baron."</i>

53
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,241
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest speaker this evening

54
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,869
Baron Waclaw Jozek.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

56
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,385
Madam President, honored guests,

57
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,888
this is a rare pleasure for me.

58
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,975
Unaccustomed as I am to being
sought after...

59
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,477

JOZEK: No, no, no!

63
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:20,986
(WAILING)

64
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:25,032
No, no, no!

65
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,957
How dare you manhandle me.

66
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,835
I want information from you.

67
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,880
By the way,
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

68
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,137
(SCREAMING)

69
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:50,766
(SOBBING)

70
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,936
BATMAN: That's all you have on
your friend Wormwood?

71
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,272
I've told you all I know.

72
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,527
What more do you want?
Let me down. (WHIMPERING)

73
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,196
Just one more thing, Baron.

74
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,366
I suggest that for your health

75
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:13,706
you take a vacation,
somewhere far away from Gotham City.

76
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,423
(GROWLING)

77
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,016
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

78
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,183
Come in.

79
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,615
(SIGHS) This had better
be important, Waclaw.

80
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,493
It is, to me.

81
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,632
I want the Batman's cape and cowl.

82
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,092
And I want you to get them for me.

83
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,764
Hmm. Humble the legendary Batman?

84
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,808
I must admit,
it is an intriguing challenge.

85
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,436
But I'm afraid I can't contain
my curiosity.

86
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:21,023
I must know, what do you want them for?

87
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,070
I will be glad to tell you that,
dear Wormwood,

88
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,240
if you'll tell me how you got
those bearer bonds

89
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,285
away from
the International Relief Consortium.

90
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,664
I don't know what you're talking about.

91
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,709
(LAUGHING) Have it your way.

92
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:43,003
In that case, I will say

93
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:47,466
only that you will be very well paid
to do as I request

94
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,261
without further questions.

95
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,520
All right, I'll get you
the Batman's cape and cowl.

96
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,397
That won't be difficult.

97
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:05,484
He is only human, after all.

98
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,217
Got a new toy, I see.

99
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,928
I figure it might come in handy.

100
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,973
It might get you in trouble
with the mayor.

101
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,725
Let me worry about the mayor.

102
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,852
Here, have a look at this.

103
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,445
"Where iron horses go to rot
and children toot their horns a lot..."

104
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,948
"A damsel's pleas shall come to naught."

105
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,700
Do you know what it means?

106
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,375
Don't you?

107
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,172
Looking for someone, Batman?

108
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>Sorry, you won't find me in there.</i>

109
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,469
<i>However, you will find</i>

110
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:56,929
<i>a trap!</i>

111
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,682

113
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,943
<i>Now then, you have approximately
one minute to save that young woman.</i>

(SCREAMING)

115
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:24,748
But I'll remove her from jeopardy

116
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,877
if you simply surrender
your cape and cowl.

117
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:32,422
<i>You can push it through the little
opening at the base of the engine door.</i>

118
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:35,008
<i>Thirty seconds left, Batman.</i>

(GRUNTING)

120
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,723
Fifteen seconds.

124
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,490
<i>One second left.</i>

125
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,454
A hologram?

126
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,931
(ENGINE STARTING)

127
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,500
JOZEK: (ON PHONE) <i>Do you have the items?</i>

128
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,234
Uh, no.

129
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,278
Uh, the first apparatus...

130
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,239
<i>The trap at the old railway exhibit?</i>

131
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:41,658
<i>Yes. He beat it.</i>

132
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:44,161
So there will have to be others?

133
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,833
Only one. And this time,
I shall put the man himself in jeopardy.

134
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,587
I have a facility at
De Larues Wax Museum

135
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,548
that will serve our purposes nicely.

136
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,593
Just see that you succeed.

137
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:04,431
Oh, I will. And once you have what
you want, you must tell me why...

138
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,058
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)
- Well!

139
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,148
BATMAN:
"Where Washington and young Babe Ruth"

140
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,776
"stand side by side
with John Wilkes Booth"

141
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:19,279
"Batman will find a plan uncouth."

142
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,907
Well, what do you think this one means?

143
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,744
Those famous figures standing
around together?

144
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,080
De Larues Wax Museum, what else?

145
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,374
Oh. Of course.

146
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,732
WORMWOOD: (ON PA) <i>Over here, Batman.</i>

147
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,404
<i>That's it. Come right in.</i>

148

Now, if I might call your attention

149
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:15,585
to the panel sliding open
along the ceiling.

150
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,840
<i>It's uncovering
a 20,000-watt halogen bulb.</i>

<i>I don't actually know how hot
20,000 watts make a room,</i>

<i>but I do know that it melts wax.</i>

153
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,070
And eventually, it will melt you.

00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:10,140
Of course, you can save yourself simply
by giving me your cape and cowl.

157
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,311
<i>After all, it looks like your weapons
are covered with wax.</i>

158

No hurry. I'll wait. (CHUCKLING)

<i>Oh, very inventive.
Do you suppose it will work?</i>

<i>Congratulations. But don't breathe
too deeply, Batman.</i>

163

<i>It seems that when you shattered
the lamp,</i>

<i>you triggered the release of a toxic

00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,690
Now, your cape and cowl, please.

Actually, no.

neatly over here, by the light.

00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,372
<i>A second mask?</i>

177
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:02,752
<i>Not as confident as we'd seem then,</i>
<i>are we?</i> (CHUCKLING)

178
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:07,757
<i>Hmm. Well, keep your silly identity.
These are all I require.</i>

179
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:22,856
(GROWLING)

180
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,569
WORMWOOD: Stop stalling, Jozek.

181
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,573
I've got the goods.

182
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,867
Have you got my certified check?

183
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,411
I have indeed.

184
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,582
Ah, but first,
let us drink to our success.

185
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,668
(CHUCKLING) On one condition.

186
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:49,049
Will you tell me why you wanted
Batman's cape and cowl, finally?

187
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:54,930
Ah, but you know my condition.
You must tell me your secret.

188
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,849
Then I will tell you mine.

189
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,355
What did you do
with those bonds? (CHUCKLING)

190
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,445
And who commissioned their theft?

191
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,493
(SIGHING) If you really want to know,

192
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,956
an agent of the Quirian Emirates
will get the bonds

193
00:17:21,122 --> 00:17:25,085
from a locker
at Pan-Europa Airways tomorrow

194
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:28,505
when I meet him there to give him
this key.

195
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:35,845
Now, what will you do
with the cape and cowl?

196
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,977
(LAUGHING)

197
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,230
I am going to wear them.

198
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,440
(GASPS)

199
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,903
You're not Jozek?

200
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:59,202
You were playing. Playing me for a fool.

201
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,497
BATMAN:
From the day you first walked in here.

202
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,673
It was you I was dealing with all along!

203
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,091
BATMAN: Give me the key.

204
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,968
(GRUNTING)

205
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,557
(WHIMPERING)

206
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:19,574
(GRUNTING)

207
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,705
(YELLING)

208
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,797
(GRUNTS)

209
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:36,883
(GRUNTS)

210
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,641
(GASPS)

211
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:52,857
(GRUNTS)

212
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,745
(YELLING)

213
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,415
(SHRIEKING)

214
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,215
(WHIMPERING)

215
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,226
(YELLS)

216
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,581
WORMWOOD: (ON TAPE)
<i>If you really want to know,</i>

217
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,120
<i>an agent of the Quirian Emirates...</i>

218
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,165
The bugs in the room picked up
the whole story on tape.

219
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:52,667
<i>At Pan-Europa Airways tomorrow.</i>

220
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,005
- Thank you, Commissioner.
- Thank you.

221
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:03,386
And thank Jozek for the use of the hall,
if he ever returns from Europe.

222
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:10,643
When we collared the Quirian agent
at the airport, he sang like a bird.

223
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,772
And he fingered you as the guy
who was gonna sell him the bonds.

224
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,691
Oh, I almost forgot.

225
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,943
This came for you.

226
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:28,411
"Confinement will speed your reform.
But long, cold nights will be the norm.

227
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,790
"So here's a thing to keep you warm"?

228
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,667
Well.

229
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,213
(GASPS)

230
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,966
