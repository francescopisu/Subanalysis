1
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,747
Bring it out.

2
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,878
Phew.

3
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,806
Take it easy.

4
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,315
Well, well, well.

5
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,108
Look who's here.

6
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,944
Up to your old tricks already,
huh, Nygma?

7
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,572
Whatever are you talking about, Batman?

8
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:38,297
The last time you delivered
one of these,

9
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,676
it almost killed Commissioner Gordon.

10
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,701
What's your point?

11
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:43,621
- What's in the box?
- None of your business.

12
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:46,290
- I'm making it my business.
- Stop!

13
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,542
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,880
Don't worry, sir, we've got him.

15
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:56,092
His name is Edward Nygma,
otherwise known as the Riddler.

16
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,552
I know who he is, you young fool.

17
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,805
It's all right, C.B.

18
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,807
These are two old friends of mine.

19
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:05,226
Before you louts
sink your fists into me,

20
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:08,604
I'd like you to meet my new partner,
Charles Baxter,

21
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:12,566
president of the multimillion-dollar
Wacko Toy Corporation,

22
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,695
and the man who has licensed
my Riddler persona

23
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:19,907
and my exclusive puzzle technology
for his new line of toys.

24
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,080
We're going to make a killing.

25
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,790
That's what I'm afraid of.

26
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,501
Now, now, I know what you're thinking.

27
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,504
But those silly riddle crimes
are a thing of the past.

28
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,965
Ancient history that's gone now.

29
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,384
I'm a new man.

30
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,012
But you probably won't figure that out
until it's too late.

31
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,390
Do you know who
you're dealing with here, Baxter?

32
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,935
Yes, a man who's going
to make my company millions.

33
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,687
Everyone's heard of the Riddler.

34
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:52,523
You can't buy that kind
of market recognition.

35
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,569
Leave him alone, or I'll swear out
a complaint against you for harassment.

36
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,281
Here's a little something for the kid.

37
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,163
<i>Still no verdict
in the trial of the Penguin.</i>

38
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,582
<i>Though apprehended
last month by the Batman,</i>

39
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,208
<i>the jury still remains unconvinced</i>

40
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,461
<i>of the felon's guilt
despite overwhelming...</i>

41
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:18,007
As far as I can tell, it looks like
a normal toy. No hidden gimmicks.

42
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,258
You wanna look at it?

43
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,053
Guess not.

44
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,973
<i>Finally in the news,
there was a burglary</i>

45
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:28,017
<i>last night in the Market Lane District.</i>

46
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,145
<i>Thieves made off with rare
antiquities and artifacts</i>

47
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,731
<i>from the Newman Import & Export Company.</i>

48
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,232
Wait. What's that?

49
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:40,029
<i>A Ming vase from the third century,
an 800-year-old tapestry.</i>

50
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,114
<i>I can't replace these.</i>

51
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,867
<i>Those were things
of the past, Batman.</i>

52
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,161
<i>Ancient history that's gone now.</i>

53
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,746
<i>I'm a new man.</i>

54
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,041
<i>But you probably won't figure
that out until it's too late.</i>

55
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,128
- He did it.
- Who?

56
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,756
The Riddler. Remember what he said?

57
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:03,260
"Things of the past."
"Ancient history that's gone now."

58
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,221
Look.

59
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,642
Gee, I don't know.
His riddles aren't usually that subtle.

60
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,978
Besides, he's got a multimillion-dollar
deal with that toy company.

61
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,856
Why would he throw it away
over some stupid riddle crime?

62
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:19,235
Because that's the way
his warped mind works. He's obsessed.

63
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,861
Hey, look.

64
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,951
<i>Greetings, little riddle-tykes!</i>

65
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,579
<i>It's time for riddle number</i>

66
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,251
<i>3-1-7-5-3-7-0-1.</i>

67
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,714
<i>Where in the world
can you have the most fun?</i>

68
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,884
<i>In any store that sells
Wacko Toys, of course.</i>

69
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:48,055
<i>That's because Wacko makes the entire
line of Riddler games and puzzles,</i>

70
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,391
<i>like the Riddler's Riddle-mid.</i>

71
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,102
<i>Hours of fun for only $19.95.</i>

72
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,980
<i>So grab your parents,
or just their wallets,</i>

73
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,899
<i>and run on down to
your nearest toy store.</i>

74
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,360
<i>Tell them the Riddler sent you.</i>

75
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:03,863
This riddle number.

76
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,823
I wonder why he used that.

77
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,741
And why did he put a map up there?

78
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,952
It's got eight digits.

79
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,705
So does a map coordinate.

80
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:21,922
3-1-7-5,

81
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,216
3-7-0-1.

82
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,179
It's the downtown Financial District.

83
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:33,017
What's that building right there
in the center?

84
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,897
The First National Bank.

85
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,551
It's after 10:00.
He should've been here by now.

86
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,179
You know,
maybe we're reading into this thing.

87
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:12,139
Maybe he wasn't sending a riddle at all.

88
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,147
He flipped it over.

89
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,691
- What?
- The number.

90
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,527
He flipped it upside-down when
he turned the chalkboard over.

91
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:32,201
- 10 Leslie?
- It's an address.

92
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,411
We're in the wrong place.

93
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,588
Not a sign of him anywhere, Mr. Nygma.

94
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,840
He must be losing his touch.

95
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,343
All right, hurry up
and get out of there.

96
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,698
Let's go.

97
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,575
Had enough?

98
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,995
Look out!

99
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,209
Robin?

100
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:10,841
My foot.

101
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,060
Let's go.

102
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,275
- You okay?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:31,445
But you better go on without me.
I'll be okay.

104
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,238
Go! Go!

105
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,131
Oh, no!

106
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,759
Give me that.

107
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,062
Do something!

108
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,065
Hold on!

109
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,951
Pull the brake!

110
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,821
Blast this thing.

111
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,910
How do you solve
this contraption, Nygma?

112
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,788
Easy. You just have to be

113
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,373
a genius.

114
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,838
Well, you are a genius, my boy.

115
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,716
Sales are up 20% across the country.

116
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,302
These toys of yours are brilliant.

117
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:25,893
Where did you find him, C.B.?
He's so adorable.

118
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,519
Who?

119
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,938
Me?

120
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,774
Of course you, silly.

121
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:37,196
And you're so smart.
I just love a man with brains.

122
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,617
Gee, I bet you say that to
all the geniuses.

123
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,580
Oh, Mr. Riddler,
can you tell me what these do?

124
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,712
Excuse me, sir, but you have
a phone call in the other room.

125
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,602
You're adorable.

126
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,271
Hello?

127
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:12,940
<i>Hello?</i>

128
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,984
Adorable, huh?

129
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,405
I don't believe you were invited.

130
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,450
I'm on to you, Nygma.

131
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,037
You're still chasing riddles.

132
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,958
<i>You're still giving them.</i>

133
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,626
<i>Is that what you believe?</i>

134
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,254
<i>Well, how do you know
what to believe, Batman?</i>

135
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,673
Maybe I'm not giving clues at all.

136
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,425
Maybe you're seeing things
that aren't there.

137
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,262
But then again,
maybe I am giving you clues.

138
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,014
I could be giving you a clue right now,
couldn't I?

139
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,935
Of course, it's possible
that you're just paranoid.

140
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,355
By the way, did you see my latest toy?

141
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,065
It's a two-way radio.

142
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,614
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
you to meet the great Batman.

143
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,033
He's here because he hasn't got a clue.

144
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:10,872
You can play all you like.

145
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,625
But you and I both know
that I'm going to put you away

146
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,836
because you can't help yourself.

147
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,212
You can't stop.

148
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,050
And I'll be waiting.

149
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,736
He's right, you know.

150
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,530
- Who?
- Batman.

151
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,158
He is going to catch me,
sooner or later.

152
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:49,202
Gee, boss, you're scaring me.

153
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:50,829
You're talking kind of crazy.

154
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,706
Don't you ever call me that!

155
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:56,251
I fooled the police, the doctors,
the parole board, all of them.

156
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,213
There's only one person who's ever
been able to challenge me. Batman.

157
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,758
He's the only one worthy of the game.

158
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,511
But you said sooner or later,
he's gonna catch you.

159
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,556
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm never going back to Arkham.

160
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,312
So I guess there's only one thing to do.

161
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,860
Give me lights.

162
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,321
Sound check.

163
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,031
We got speed.

164
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,784
All right, let's have
places, everyone.

165
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:30,744
Here's your script, Mr. Nygma.

166
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,497
I already know what I'm going to say.

167
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,378
Quiet on the set.
We're going live.

168
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,963
Action.

169
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:45,217
Hey, folks. Wouldn't it be great
to be a kid again,

170
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:49,638
enjoying all those wonderful moments
of childhood with your favorite toys?

171
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,807
Not like that,
you'll break it.

172
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:57,938
Yes. Well, you can recapture
your childhood with Wacko Toys.

173
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,606
All you have to do is pick up

174
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,151
one of the Riddler's puzzles
at your favorite store.

175
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:08,031
Then go back to where it all started,
with toys.

176
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,118
Come on, be a kid again.

177
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,456
He's going to hit
the Gotham Convention Center.

178
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:17,791
How did you figure that?

179
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,460
Because of the clue
he's deliberately giving me.

180
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,674
- What clue?
- He said,

181
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,677
"Go back to where it started,
with toys."

182
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,388
The toy fair.

183
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:56,723
<i>Hello, Batman.
This is it, the end of the game.</i>

184
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,976
<i>I'm a little sad, actually.
You were a worthy opponent.</i>

185
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,188
<i>But then, I told you I'd make a killing
at the toy fair.</i>

186
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,027
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

187
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,613
<i>eight, seven,</i>

188
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,616
<i>six, five,</i>

189
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,868
<i>four,</i>

190
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,663
<i>three,</i>

191
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,748
<i>two...</i>

192
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,516
I always feel sad at funerals.

193
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:43,353
Yes, truly, part of me has died tonight.

194
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,565
And so it is time to move on.

195
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,241
You! I don't believe it.

196
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:24,352
There's no way you could
have survived that explosion.

197
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:27,105
- How did you get out?
- That's my little riddle.

198
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,024
Please, you must tell me.

199
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,986
All right, you win.
You tell me what I wanna know

200
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:36,323
and I'll tell you
what you wanna know. Okay?

201
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,702
You mean, where you've hidden
everything you've stolen?

202
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,206
Certainly. I'll even tell you
how I committed all those robberies.

203
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:46,374
Deal?

204
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,793
No.

205
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,381
- Did you get that?
<i>- We got it.</i>

206
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,388
This ought to be enough
to prove a parole violation.

207
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,184
You're going away for good this time.
All right, get him out of here.

208
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,567
My compliments.
This is a great little idea.

209
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,779
Wait a minute.
Aren't you gonna tell me how you did it?

210
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:17,447
That's not fair!

211
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,916
His accomplices
plea-bargained immediately.

212
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,006
Told the police where
all the stolen goods were

213
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,671
and even agreed to
testify against Nygma.

214
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:36,216
But what I don't get is,
how did you escape from that explosion?

215
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,636
Well...

216
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,724
<i>All the exits were blocked.</i>

217
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:51,231
<i>And I was out of time.
There was only one thing to do.</i>

218
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,483
<i>I jumped inside the safe.</i>

219
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,616
Nice going, Bruce.

220
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,702
Man, I'd have never thought of that.

221
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,245
Neither would the Riddler.

222
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,000
It's impossible, I tell you!

223
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,837
Impossible! My trap was perfect!

224
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,005
How did he do it?

225
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,549
I have to know!

226
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,176
Somebody tell me! It's not fair!

227
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,220
There was no way, I tell you!

228
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,266
No way he could have gotten out!
Somebody tell me!

229
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:30,228
Do you hear me?
Somebody tell me how he did it!

230
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,355
I have to know!

231
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,108
I have to know!
