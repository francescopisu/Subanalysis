1
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,466
Back off, creeps.

2
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,876
Batgirl...

3
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,045
Are you all right?

4
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:53,130
Yes.

5
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,717
Thanks to you.

6
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,686
<i>Barbara!</i>

7
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,063
<i>Hey, Babs!</i>

8
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,609
Yo, bookworm! You up there?

9
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:16,278
What is it, Dick?

10
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,322
All work and no play, you know?

11
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,199
Come on, let's do a pizza run.

12
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:21,784
Love to, but I can't.

13
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,371
If I don't ace these midterms,
Dad says he'll throw me in jail.

14
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:28,124
And with my dad, that's no idle threat.

15
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,504
Okay, catch you later.

16
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,341
Math.

17
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,677
Why did it have to be math?

18
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,069
Hmm. Maybe I should take a break.

19
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,179
Catwoman, I presume.

20
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:37,276
Well, well.
Look what the bat dragged in.

21
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,111
Give up. I've caught you.

22
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,905
Caught me? At what?

23
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,948
Returning to the scene of your crime.

24
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,243
Look... Batgirl, is it?

25
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:49,830
I'm just trying to find out
who took the jade-cat statue.

26
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,958
It's an art treasure.
It belongs to the world.

27
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,461
Right. Pull the other one.

28
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,754
Look.

29
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,131
Huh?

30
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,093
Looks like the alarm cord
was eaten through with acid

31
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,763
like the locks on the skylight. So?

32
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,307
That's not my style.

33
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,767
No finesse.

34
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:14,814
See?

35
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,065
Okay.

36
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,919
If you're innocent, come down
to police headquarters with me

37
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,402
and tell them your story.

38
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,030
That's also not my style.

39
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:28,202
One way or another,
you're coming with me.

40
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:31,831
Bats are just mice with wings,
little girl.

41
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,125
Robin!

42
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,628
Just came to investigate the robbery.

43
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,797
I didn't expect a convention.

44
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,892
- Come on! She's getting away.
- Robin, wait! She's not...

45
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,776
Here, kitty, kitty.

46
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,240
Bye-bye, birdie.

47
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,618
Hey!

48
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,167
We'll talk again, soon.

49
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,630
Well, you were a lot of help.

50
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:24,842
I tried to tell you
she didn't steal the jade cat.

51
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,427
How do you know that?

52
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,888
I just know, that's all.

53
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,098
Oh, well, thank you, Ms. Psychic.

54
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,267
And you call yourself a crime-fighter.

55
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,020
If you'd listened
instead of just barging in...

56
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,147
Just don't get in my way again, okay?

57
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,447
Dork.

58
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,041
- That was a great class.
- You said it.

59
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,834
Let's go get a soda.

60
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,196
Got the note, I see.

61
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,702
If this is a trick, Catwoman...

62
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,954
No trick.

63
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,290
I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I was with you last night.

64
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,127
You're smart, and you're fast.

65
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,089
I thought
maybe you'd like to work together.

66
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:47,925
After all, against the two of us,

67
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,511
whoever took the jade cat
doesn't stand a chance.

68
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,265
Okay. On one condition.

69
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,893
If you're lying to me and I find out,

70
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,478
you'll give yourself up.

71
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,023
Deal.

72
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:19,206
So, you won't be back in time to help me
look for your old flame Catwoman?

73
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,041
Sorry, Dick. You're on your own.

74
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,211
This WayneCorp merger is vital
for the European common market.

75
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:25,796
Okay, sure.

76
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,174
After all, who needs you
when I've got Batgirl to help me?

77
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:32,678
Watch out for Selina.
She likes to play mind games.

78
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,307
I hope Batgirl isn't in over her head.

79
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,227
The Stacked Deck?

80
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,855
That's the sleaziest dive
in Gotham City.

81
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,064
Exactly.

82
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,568
The only place to find information
on the jade cat job.

83
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,361
You're not afraid, are you?

84
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:53,907
No. Of course not. Let's go.

85
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,410
The mouse has guts.

86
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,977
- Hey!
- Here, kitty!

87
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,413
- Oh, my!
- Kitty, kitty!

88
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:27,775
Hey, kitten, how's about spending
one of your nine lives with me?

89
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,985
Crawl back in your litter box, creep.

90
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,911
Anyone else wanna get fresh?

91
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,039
You stay.

92
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,918
I got nothing to say to you, lady.

93
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,263
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it's impolite to walk out on a lady?

94
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,099
This is from the jade cat job.

95
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,726
Residue of the acid used on the locks.

96
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,062
That's nice. Why tell me?

97
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:06,980
They call you "The Chemist."

98
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,943
You know every acid, explosive
and poison by its first name.

99
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:12,820
Any idea where this was made?

100
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,404
Hmm.

101
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,990
Basic corrosive compound.

102
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:22,538
Probably a local manufacturer,
like Axis, Phoenix, or...

103
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,999
Hey!

104
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,396
Was this part of your plan?

105
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,772
It is now.

106
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,783
I think it's closing time.

107
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,877
Hey!

108
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,151
This is unit seven, in pursuit
of Catwoman and Batgirl.

109
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:37,154
Oh, Daddy, if you could see
your little girl now.

110
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,920
- Hang on!
- I am!

111
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:03,931
You could've gotten us killed.

112
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,224
But I didn't.

113
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,518
All that, and we didn't even get
the information we were looking for.

114
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,895
Sure we did.

115
00:12:09,978 --> 00:12:13,398
You saw the way the chemist freaked
when he recognized that acid.

116
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,777
I'm willing to bet only
one guy in Gotham makes it.

117
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,737
An old friend of mine.

118
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,080
<i>This is unit seven.</i>

119
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:31,333
<i>We lost Catwoman and Batgirl
on the Bayshore Expressway.</i>

120
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,168
What the heck is she up to?

121
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:45,722
Hey, I recognize this place
from crime reports.

122
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,641
It used to belong to Roland Daggett.

123
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,685
This is where he invented
the Renuyu drug

124
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,062
that turned Matt Hagen into Clayface.

125
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,111
You do know your police cases.

126
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:02,239
This is also where
Daggett developed a virus

127
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,366
that nearly killed me and my cat.

128
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,136
Aw.

129
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,471
It's nice to be right.

130
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,934
Yes, isn't it?

131
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:34,980
Selina Kyle,
how pleasant to see you again.

132
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,607
The pleasure is all yours, Daggett.

133
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,067
We'll be leaving now.

134
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,944
On the contrary, my dear,

135
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:46,325
you and your lovely young friend here
will be staying forever.

136
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,343
Why take the jade cat, Daggett?

137
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,553
There were other
more valuable treasures.

138
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,139
Because it's exactly
what you would have taken.

139
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,933
Also, I need the money to start over.

140
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:25,280
My legal fees after my last encounter
with Batman left me broke.

141
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:26,740
The money from this statuette

142
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:29,451
will set me up quite nicely
somewhere else

143
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:34,164
while the cops look
for a certain feline thief.

144
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,083
So, what are you going to do?

145
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,628
Leave us hanging over one of these vats
with acid burning through the rope?

146
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,757
If there's one thing
I've learned over the years,

147
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,887
it's that you crime-fighting types
are very resourceful.

148
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:53,266
So I'll just have my men shoot you
and throw your bodies into the vats.

149
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:57,312
There's still enough acid residue
in them to destroy the evidence.

150
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,626
Not bad.

151
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,462
Not bad yourself.

152
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,880
How'd you find us?

153
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,841
Ms. Kitty isn't the only one
with access to a chemical lab.

154
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,509
Where's Catwoman?

155
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,729
Going somewhere, Daggett?

156
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,231
Get away from me!

157
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,955
Nice catch.

158
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,741
Now you know how it feels to look
the Grim Reaper in the eye, Daggett.

159
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,786
The same way I felt
when you pumped me full of your virus.

160
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,079
No!

161
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:21,957
If you let him fall,
you're no better than he is.

162
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,375
Oh, grow up.

163
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:40,392
Catwoman, wait!

164
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,066
Relax. You've had a busy day.

165
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,091
You were going to keep that statue
all along, weren't you?

166
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,801
Of course.

167
00:18:56,926 --> 00:19:00,639
Haven't you learned yet that
only the strong survive in this game?

168
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,893
Okay, I admit it.

169
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,395
I was just playing with you at first.

170
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,356
But you really impressed me.

171
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,066
We make a good team.

172
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,485
Together we could pick this town clean.

173
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,904
Even Batman wouldn't be a match for us.

174
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:19,532
And the cops are a joke,
especially that senile fool Gordon.

175
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,244
We had a deal, remember?

176
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,496
You lost.

177
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,373
Give yourself up now.

178
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,667
Freeze!

179
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,837
Okay. You win.

180
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:35,298
And by the way, Batgirl's innocent.

181
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,092
She was acting under coercion.

182
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,020
You should've said yes.

183
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,357
If I had, I'd be a rat with wings.

184
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,115
I knew you had Catwoman
on a leash all along.

185
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:01,991
You're a lousy liar.

186
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,660
But thanks for trying.

187
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,674
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

188
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,761
I said I'd let them take me,

189
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,013
but I didn't say how far.

190
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:31,020
It's okay.

191
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,148
There'll be another time.
