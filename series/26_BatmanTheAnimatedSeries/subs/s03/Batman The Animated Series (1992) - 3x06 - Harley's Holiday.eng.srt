1
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,619
<i>You've made wonderful
progress, Harley.</i>

2
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,623
You've passed your competency hearing

3
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,668
and tomorrow you'll be released,
mentally sane and sound.

4
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,298
Whee! Who-hoo! Whoopie!
Yay! Yay! Yay!

5
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,384
I mean, thank you, Dr. Leland.

6
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:37,096
That's okay. You have every reason
to be proud of yourself.

7
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,556
Unhand me!

8
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,059
I just wish the other inmates
could make your sort of progress.

9
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,730
I am the master of fear!
The lord of despair!

10
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,898
Cower before me in witless terror!

11
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,859
Hi, Professor Crane.

12
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:54,322
Good evening, child. Worship me, fools!
Worship me!

13
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,491
Scream hosannas of anguish to Scarecrow,

14
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,119
the all-terrible god of fear!

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,912
I think he's getting better.

16
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,541
I hear you're getting out tomorrow.

17
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,627
You got a problem with that?

18
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:09,754
Congratulations.

19
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,009
Yeah, so I made a few mistakes.

20
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,471
I've got my head back together,
and I'm gonna live my life right.

21
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,271
For your sake, I hope so.

22
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:35,613
I'll show you. Starting tomorrow,
you'll see I'm just as sane as anybody.

23
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,491
Oh, my Lord!

24
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,213
Gee, what's wrong with them?

25
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,690
I knew I shouldn't have
worn this outfit.

26
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,386
It's so out of style, it's growing mold.

27
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,347
I probably look like a total geek.

28
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,690
Come on, babies, we're going shopping.

29
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:19,699
I love it.

30
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,033
That makes one of us.

31
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:25,204
Really, Brucie, a man of your social
standing needs a woman like me

32
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,081
to keep you in step
with the latest trends.

33
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,209
Who dresses you anyway? Alfred?

34
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:33,045
Well, actually...

35
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,760
Excuse me, miss.
You can't bring those things in here.

36
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,763
It's okay. They're housebroken.

37
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,027
Are you all right?

38
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,949
Wow, I never saw them do that before.

39
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,869
Hey, don't I know you?

40
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,954
I don't think so.

41
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:10,082
Something about that chin.

42
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,920
I know!
You're Bruce Wayne, the boy billionaire.

43
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,133
Unattached, I see.

44
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,261
May I help you, miss?

45
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,473
Uh-oh! Enter the jealous girlfriend.

46
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,393
Hey, remember me?
That big charity bash a few years back?

47
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:30,853
The one the Joker robbed?

48
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,814
I was the clown girl
holding the gun on you!

49
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,110
Oh, don't worry, I'm over
the crime thing. See?

50
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:46,535
I'm rehabilitated
and ready to live my life right.

51
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,329
How nice for you.

52
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,372
Goodbye.

53
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,336
Gee, you make one little mistake
and they never let you forget.

54
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,382
All I'm looking for
is a fair chance to start over.

55
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,635
That's not asking too much, is it?

56
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,303
Why, no.

57
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,142
Miss?

58
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,397
I just wanna live a normal life
without some cop always pouncing on me.

59
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,235
Hey, what's the deal?

60
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:20,611
Hold it.

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,154
I didn't do anything.

62
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,406
That's a security alarm.
Just give me back...

63
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,411
That's my dress.
I paid for it fair and square.

64
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,207
I know. Just let me remove
the security tag and... Whoa!

65
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,167
It's a frame-up, a fix.

66
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,337
You ain't taking me back
to the slammer, John Law.

67
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,301
Hey!

68
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,764
- What in heaven?
- Stay here.

69
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,520
She ran in there.

70
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,189
- Oh, my. Did you see that?
- What's going on?

71
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,614
Miss, please, I'm sure this has all been
a simple misunderstanding.

72
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:10,536
You don't wanna mess things up
on your first day out, do you? Miss?

73
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,501
I tried to play by the rules, but no,

74
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,255
they wouldn't let me go straight.
Society is to blame.

75
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:26,051
Back off, rich boy, I'm armed.

76
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,812
Scoot over, toots, I'm driving.

77
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,814
Come to Mommy!

78
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,533
Hold on!

79
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,002
Oh! You're gonna pay for that.

80
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:10,429
Let me get this right, Commissioner.

81
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,891
You're saying that milksop Bruce Wayne

82
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:17,811
allowed a crazy woman
in a clown suit to kidnap my Veronica?

83
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,855
Wayne did what he could,
General Vreeland.

84
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,150
And for what it's worth, I don't think
Harley Quinn means to hurt Veronica.

85
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,735
This is her first day out of Arkham

86
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,963
and the threat of being
sent back probably spooked her.

87
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:30,699
I want action, Gordon, not excuses.
My daughter's in danger.

88
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,787
I need SWAT teams,
helicopters, full military backup!

89
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,000
I... I'm sorry, Jim.

90
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,379
All I want is my little Veronica
returned safe and sound.

91
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:48,217
If you could just give this old soldier
a moment to compose himself.

92
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,760
Certainly, sir.

93
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,357
Lieutenant, General Vreeland here.

94
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,359
I'm calling a code red.

95
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,010
Sounds like Harley didn't waste
any time getting into trouble.

96
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:12,533
She's good at that.

97
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:18,455
Still, I think she really wanted
to do right this time.

98
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:22,501
If we can find her first, maybe we can
stop her from ruining her chance.

99
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,425
According to the scanner,
your car should be right about here.

100
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,478
Ha! I got you now.

101
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,320
Huh?

102
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:02,458
Please, Ms. Clown.

103
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,710
Call me Harley. Everyone does.

104
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,254
Please, Harley, let me go. I'm rich.

105
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:09,057
I'll pay whatever you want
if you'll just...

106
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,843
Uh-oh! Company.

107
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,348
Hi, B-man. Wanna race?

108
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,768
Stop the car now!

109
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,895
I think not.

110
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,315
We wanna help you sort this out
before it gets worse.

111
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:29,818
Sure, like you helped
poor Professor Crane last night.

112
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,822
Sorry, boys, you ain't taking me
back to Arkham.

113
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:54,468
I'm gonna get that little kook
if it's the last thing I ever do.

114
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,807
The scanner says
she's headed for the south side.

115
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,851
Probably to someone who can hide her
until the heat's off.

116
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,653
The last time I seen you,
you not only ruined my club

117
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,239
but brought the freaking Batman
down on my head as well.

118
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,534
Give me one good reason
I do not dust you right now.

119
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,208
I'll buy that.

120
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,130
No sweat, toots,
Boxy will take care of us.

121
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,715
That's what I'm afraid of.

122
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,763
So, how soon can you
sneak me out of town?

123
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,014
Leave us not be hasty.

124
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,060
We have a friendship to renew
and Ms. Money-Bags to ransom off.

125
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,734
Oh, no. We can't do that.

126
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,778
See, I'm giving up the crime thing.

127
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,905
I only grabbed her because
I needed a car.

128
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:00,159
Once I'm gone,
she goes home safe and sound.

129
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,496
I'm calling the shots here, sugar.

130
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,249
Anyone says different
has to go through me, got it?

131
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,542
Got it.

132
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,674
You've stuck your cape
into my business for the last time.

133
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,680
Take 'em, boys.

134
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,226
- Get him! Get him!
- Come back here!

135
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,415
We're safe, thank goodness.

136
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,418
Ahh!

137
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:54,171
Back off, freak, or the dame's history.

138
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,634
Get your own hostage.

139
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,078
Sorry, doll.

140
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,956
As we gamblers say,
you just crapped out.

141
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,635
- Any last words?
- Just one.

142
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:43,804
Babies!

143
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,600
Play nice with your new chew toy.

144
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,831
Ahh!

145
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,973
- Harley's gone again.
- So is Bennett.

146
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,936
Did you mean what you said back there
about sending me home?

147
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,730
Sure. You're a good kid,

148
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,025
and I do kind of feel
a little bit responsible for all this.

149
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,526
No kidding.

150
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,532
So, what will happen to you?

151
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:47,826
If I'm lucky, I'll make it out of town

152
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,120
before Bats hauls
my hiney back to the bin.

153
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,789
Can't you explain
that it was all just a mistake?

154
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,835
Ha! With my past?
I don't even believe it myself.

155
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,176
Look, let's make a deal.

156
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:08,013
You get me out of this alive,
and I'll drop all the charges.

157
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,934
Yeah? Hey, you're all right, toots.

158
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,688
For the first time today,
I think things are finally looking up.

159
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,955
<i>You in the car,
release your hostage immediately.</i>

160
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,415
Daddy!

161
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,000
Daddy?

162
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,505
Oy!

163
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,390
Wait. What are you doing?
That's my father.

164
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,810
No, that's your father in a tank!

165
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:09,866
No, you don't.

166
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,972
<i>All units, suspect Quinn
has been sighted</i>

167
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:33,306
<i>headed for Gotham City Square.</i>

168
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,379
Oh, great.

169
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,275
- Got you now.
- You screwy little...

170
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:26,651
Trouble-making clown.

171
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,161
Veronica?

172
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,295
Hey, bird-boy, look alive.

173
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,716
Well, that's my good deed for the day.

174
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,051
Bye.

175
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:52,928
Wait!

176
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,858
My little girl. I was so worried.

177
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,109
I noticed.

178
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,863
Whoa!

179
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,408
Leaving so soon, Boxy?

180
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,244
You got nothing on me.

181
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,123
I'm sure I can find something.

182
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,750
Move it.

183
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,313
You don't know when to quit, do you?

184
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,602
Listen to me.
All the work you've done, your freedom.

185
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,438
If you run away,
you'll lose them, Harley.

186
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,525
You're so close
to winning back your real life.

187
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:49,776
Why risk it now?

188
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm having a bad day!

189
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:00,161
I'm sick of people trying to shoot me,
run me over and blow me up!

190
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,753
I didn't even get to keep my new dress,

191
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,840
and I actually paid for it!

192
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,183
I tried to be good. I really did.

193
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,728
But if that's not good enough, fine!

194
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,773
Let's get back to basics.

195
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,051
Talk about grasping at straws.

196
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:59,220
Oh, well,
at least I'm going out on a joke.

197
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,236
I think I made a mess on your cape.

198
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,790
Home again, home again, jiggity-jig.

199
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,627
Not for too long, though. Ms. Vreeland
dropped the kidnapping charges.

200
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,506
With a little more hard work, you should
be ready to reenter society for good.

201
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,715
Yay.

202
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,176
There's one thing I gotta know.

203
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,346
Why did you stay with me all day,
risking your butt for someone

204
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,890
who's never given you anything
but trouble?

205
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,267
I know what it's like
to try and rebuild a life.

206
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,147
I had a bad day too, once.

207
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,778
Nice guys like you
shouldn't have bad days.

208
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,425
Call me.

209
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,844
Don't press your luck.

210
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,896
Ah, what are you looking at?
