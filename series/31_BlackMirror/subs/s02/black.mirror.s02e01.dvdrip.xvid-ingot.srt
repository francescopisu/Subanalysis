00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,029
(DOOR OPENS)

346
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,396
You could've left me some clothes.

347
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,230
I mean, talk about
an undignified entrance.

348
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,669
That's a bit creepy. What you're doing.

349
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,877
Is there at least a towel?
I'm dripping everywhere.

350
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,352
Hello?

351
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,359
I won't bite.

352
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,118
I'm all right here for now.

353
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,716
Would you like me to put some food on?

354
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,389
Do you eat?

355
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,634
No.

356
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,990
I mean, I don't need to. I can chew
and swallow, if that makes it easier.

357
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,396
Don't worry about it, it's fine.

358
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,833
I need a drink.

359
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,469
Are you sure that's?

360
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,556
I know, I'm not supposed to.
It won't kill us.

361
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,828
The official advice is...

362
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,518
Fuck the official advice. It's one night.

363
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,472
You look well.

364
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,238
Well, I am young.

365
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,956
I mean... you look like him on a good day.

366
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,310
The photos we keep tend to be flattering.

367
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,032
I guess I wasn't any different.

368
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,152
You're so soft.

369
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,192
You're so smooth.
How are you so smooth?

370
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,516
You've got pores and lines...

371
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,391
It's texture mapping.

372
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,951
The really tiny details are visual - 2D.

373
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,912
Here, try my fingertips.

374
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,191
See?

375
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,593
Weird.

376
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,915
Does it bother you?

377
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,473
No.

378
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,879
Yeah.

379
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,951
(WHISPERS) I don't know.

380
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,313
I missed you. I missed you so much!

381
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,715
Hey, don't cry.

382
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,193
Don't cry.

383
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,199
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

384
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,473
Come on, then. Top off.

385
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,833
- What's wrong?
- He had a mole there.

386
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,279
Where?

387
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,914
There.

388
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,069
Hang on.

389
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,831
That's ridiculous.

390
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,390
That's completely stupid.

391
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,789
Hello.

392
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,875
Hi.

393
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,558
Your hand's on my tit.

394
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,716
You're doing wonders
for my self-esteem here.

395
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,638
There's no record of my sexual response.

396
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,989
I didn't discuss
that side of things online.

397
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,112
But you have sexual responses.
I mean...

398
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,591
This works?

399
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,631
Oh.

400
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,399
That, I can turn on and off
pretty much instantly.

401
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,439
See?

402
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,237
I can do it again if you like.

403
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,116
Oh, oh, God. Oh, shit!

404
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,833
- Should I stop?
- No! No, it's really good.

405
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,155
Where... Where did you learn this?

406
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,636
Set routine.
Based on pornographic videos.

407
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,240
(SHE GASPS AND GROANS)

408
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,832
I love you.

409
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,279
I love you.

410
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,911
(MOANS GENTLY)

411
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,789
(GASPS)

412
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,068
What is it?

413
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,792
- What were you doing?
- Nothing.

414
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,752
The way that your eyes were open,
it scared me.

415
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,279
You'd prefer if I closed them?

416
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,153
What, when you're sleeping? Um, yeah?

417
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,118
I don't really need to sleep.

418
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,034
Well, just... try, next time.

419
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,713
Can I get you anything?

420
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,069
- Oh, no.
- Coffee,

421
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,838
- sandwich?
- I said no.

422
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,876
Ash... Look, sorry.

423
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,913
It's just a bit odd.

424
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,999
I can appreciate it's... pretty strange.

425
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,235
I just need a bit of...
just getting used to it.

426
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,430
And I shouldn't have drunk last night.

427
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,198
Next time, could you try and stop me?

428
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,117
- Stop you drinking?
- Yeah.

429
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,754
So I get to enjoy being
a bit of a bastard?

430
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,711
(WEAK LAUGH)

431
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,591
(CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE)

432
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,153
What's wrong?

433
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,550
Oh, God. Shit, right, get in the bedroom.

434
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,556
- What?
- Now!

435
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,117
- Hey.
- Hey!

436
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,992
Can I come in?

437
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,349
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,113
Look at you.

439
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,119
The town mouse has become
the country mouse.

440
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,311
Yeah, it's nice.

441
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,793
Was this all you?

442
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,829
Mm.

443
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,753
- Do you want a cup of coffee?
- Yeah.

444
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,078
You weren't answering calls.

445
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,439
- It's been...
- Or messages.

446
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,994
...really busy.
- I've just been a bit like "Oh, shit,"

447
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,113
- you know, "what's?"
- Yeah. Work's been mad, it's been...

448
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,991
Which is good, you know, obviously,

449
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,235
because it's kept my mind off everything,
so...

450
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,712
Where's the toilet?

451
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,352
Upstairs.

452
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,594
OK.

453
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,718
So, I mean, um... Yeah, let's, er...

454
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,072
Meet up more, yes.
Keep in touch. Yeah, yeah.

455
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,588
- Yeah.
- Come here.

456
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,990
I think it's great you're moving on.

457
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,472
- What?
- Sorry. There were...

458
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,715
There were man clothes, you know.

459
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,113
In the bathroom.

460
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,798
Right.

461
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,353
Is he nice?

462
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,395
Sorry. Big nose. You know.

463
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,114
You deserve whatever you want.

464
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,350
Thanks.

465
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,550
- All right.
- OK. All right.

466
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,950
(CAR LOCK BEEPS)

467
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,152
Hey.

468
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,599
Is everything all right?

469
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,471
Yeah, I'm fine. It's fine.

470
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,193
What did your friend say?

471
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,431
That was my sister.

472
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,038
You know her.

473
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,279
She said that I was...

474
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,874
She said that she was happy
that I'd moved on.

475
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,513
Moved on to what?

476
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,874
Is that not the sort of thing I'd say?

477
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,399
I mean...

478
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,073
It is, isn't it?

479
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,237
Are you sure everything's all right?

480
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,315
Yes!

481
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,475
Shit!

482
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,155
It's OK, I can do it. I can do it.

483
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,872
I can do it.

484
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,989
Don't!

485
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,911
We need to wrap that in paper.

486
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,790
Look, if you're going to pretend
to be asleep,

487
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,637
you could at least breathe, OK?

488
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,114
It's just eerie.

489
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,392
Like this?

490
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,869
(INHALES, EXHALES HEAVILY)

491
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,515
It doesn't work.
I can tell that you're faking it.

492
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,030
Would you like me to have sex with you?

493
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,152
Can you just go downstairs?

494
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,355
OK.

495
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,871
No! That's...

496
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,035
Ash would argue over that.

497
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,752
He wouldn't just leave the room
because I'd ordered him to.

498
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,789
OK.

499
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,233
What? N...

500
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,589
Ah, fucking hell!

501
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,314
Don't cry, darling...

502
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,715
Oh, don't! Just get out! Get out!

503
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,354
Go on!

504
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,391
So you do want me to go?

505
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,750
Just get out! Get out! Get out!

506
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,552
Get out! Get out! Get out!

507
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,798
You're not enough of him!
You are nothing! You're nothing.

508
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,157
- Fight me.
- I don't do that.

509
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,794
Fucking fight me! Hit me.

510
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,273
Hit me.

511
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,912
Hit me! Come on!

512
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,030
Why are you just standing there
taking this?

513
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,798
How can you take this?

514
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,671
Did I ever hit you?

515
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,190
N... No.
No, of course you didn't,

516
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,357
but you might've done if I'd done this.
Or this.

517
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,231
I don't... I don't know.

518
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,955
Maybe you would have. But <i>you</i> wouldn't,
would you? You wouldn't...

519
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,433
I could insult you.

520
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,879
What?

521
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,070
There's tons of invective in the archive.

522
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,351
I liked speaking my mind,
I could throw some of that at you.

523
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,277
Get out of this house.

524
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,636

00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,639
What are you doing?

526
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,597
I can't go more than 25 metres
from my activation point.

527
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,153
What is that, a joke?

528
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,952
Look, I know it sounds mental.

529
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,717
- Where's your activation point?
- At the risk of blowing your mind...

530
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,591
...it's where I was activated.

531
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,914
The bath.

532
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,475
I have to keep within a 25-metre radius
unless my administrator -

533
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,954
that's you - is with me.

534
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,718
Don't call me your administrator.

535
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,318
Why not?

536
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,395
Because...

537
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,953
It sounds sort of sexy.

538
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,070
(LAUGHS HOPELESSLY)

539
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,554
If you're laughing,
can I come back inside?

540
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,910
Feeling a bit...

541
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,076
ornamental out here.

542
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,756
(SHOWER RUNNING)

543
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,874
Funny.

544
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,159
Can you put that down, please?

545
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,553
But it is funny.

546
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,353
Could you just put it down?

547
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,754
Come with me. We're going out.

548
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,315
(# THE BEE GEES:
How Deep Is Your Love)

549
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,353
Cheesy.

550
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,868
# <i>I know your eyes in the morning sun</i>

551
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,434
# <i>I feel you touch me...</i> #

552
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,109
Come on.

553
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,037
Where are we going?

554
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,559
Just hurry up.

555
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,509
(SEAGULLS SQUAWK)

556
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,077
(SHOUTING) No!

557
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,315
Don't do it!

558
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,839
Seriously, don't do it.

559
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,797
I'm not going to.

560
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,114
OK.

561
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,634
See, he would have worked out
what was going on.

562
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,796
This wouldn't ever have happened,

563
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,354
but if it had,
he would have worked it out.

564
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,960
Sorry, hang on. That's a very difficult
sentence to process.

565
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,508
Jump.

566
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,869
What? Over there?

567
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,478
I never expressed suicidal thoughts,
or self-harm.

568
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,476
Yeah, well, you aren't you, are you?

569
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,353
That's another difficult one,
to be honest with you.

570
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,595
You're just a few ripples of you.

571
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,631
There's no history to you.

572
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,990
You're just a performance of stuff
that he performed without thinking,

573
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,598
and it's not enough.

574
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,551
Come on. I aim to please.

575
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,636
Aim to jump. Just do it.

576
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,238
OK.

577
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,748
If you're absolutely sure.

578
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,839
See, Ash would've been scared.

579
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,155
He wouldn't have just leapt off,
he would have been crying,

580
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,428
he would have been...

581
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,833
Oh.

582
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,915
Oh... Oh, God, no.

583
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,598
Please, I don't want to do it.

584
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,870
Please don't make me do it.

585
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,114
No, that's not fair.

586
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,152
No, I'm... I'm frightened.
Darling, please...

587
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,714
I don't... Don't make me.
I don't want to die.

588
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,557
Oh, God, I don't want to die.

589
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,079
No, that's not fair.

590
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,712
Please, I'm frightened,
I don't want to die. Don't...

591
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,637
(SCREAMS) No!

592
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,833
One for you, one for me.

593
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,112
- What?
- We need another slice.

594
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,673
Why?

595
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,756
So I can take one upstairs.

596
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,438
It's not the weekend.

597
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,754
It <i>is</i> my birthday.

598
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,878
OK.

599
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,518
"Thanks, Mum."

600
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,835
Hey, Ash.

601
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,395
Hey. The birthday girl.

602
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,309
- Just gonna come and hang out for a bit.
- OK. I wasn't doing anything.

603
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,952
I brought you some cake.

604
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,672
I know you don't eat anything.

605
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,349
I'm just using you as an excuse
so I can get an extra slice.

606
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,879
ASH: Devious.

607
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,069
GIRL: Mum?

608
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,439
Mum!

609
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,479
Yeah, I'm just coming.
