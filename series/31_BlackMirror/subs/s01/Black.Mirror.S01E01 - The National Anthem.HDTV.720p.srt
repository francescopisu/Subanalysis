00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:48,441
Hello.

2
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:53,410
Just tell me what's happened.

3
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:57,082
And what is it?

4
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,270
I'll be right down.

5
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:06,301
What's happened?

6
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,934
Er, Susannah.

7
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,551
Susannah?

8
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:14,121
Princess Susannah.

9
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:15,926
Is she all right?

10
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,043
Don't know.

11
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,262
'Don't kill me.

12
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:48,668
'Please don't kill me.'

13
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,473
'Read the statement.

14
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,254
'Yes. All right.

15
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,520
'On this screen?

16
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:01,496
'That is correct.

17
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,238
I'm Susannah

18
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,020
'Duchess of Beaumont.

'Please.'

29
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:09,608
What are you doing? Keep it going.

30
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,863
Prime Minister, at this point,
I think it's important to say

31
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:16,419
that we are 100% certain

32
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,659
that this is, indeed,

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,027
Princess Susannah.

34
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:23,411
Her car was intercepted
shortly after midnight,

35
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,350
returning from the wedding
of a college friend.

36
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,192
She'd insisted on going.

37
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:30,047
But you had security on her?

38
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,379
Two PPOs, still unconscious.

39
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:35,715
Heavy sedative, close range,
each with a single puncture wound.

40
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,465
No sign of struggle.

41
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:41,372
What do they want? Money?

42
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,114
Release the Jihadi?

43
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:47,614
Scrap Third World debt?

44
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,899
Save the fucking libraries?

45
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,731
We are convinced both the video and
the demand it contains are genuine.

46
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:57,856
What demand?

47
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:00,153
What Susannah says next...

48
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:04,684
It concerns you directly, sir.

49
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:08,434
Just play it.

50
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:15,958
'There is only one demand,
and it is a simple one.

51
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,419
'At 4pm this afternoon,

52
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,317

'I don't understand!'

58
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:52,348
The video ends with a
series of technical

59
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:54,153
specifications for
the broadcast.

60
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:10,718
Why are you doing this?

61
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:16,036
Is this joke, right?

62
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:18,551
"Ha ha, Mike! Ho ho."

63
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,246
It's real.

64
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:25,926
She said pig.

65
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:28,324
Sex with a pig.

66
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:33,473
They want me to have sex with a pig?

67
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,856
Live on television

68
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:38,817
this afternoon.

69
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,160
But what...

70
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:50,309
We're checking with embedded operatives,
compiling a list of suspects.

71
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,903
Meanwhile, the demand has been made.

72
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,793
There's not long
to formulate our response.

73
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:58,113
Well, I'm not fucking a pig!

74
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,621
Page one, that's not happening.

75
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:04,121
Of course.

76
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,301
Absolutely, sir.

77
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,668
Well, have we established a dialogue
with this...?

78
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,981
We can't. There's no
e-mail address, no code word.

79
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,780
No channel for negotiation.

80
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,779
So we focus on finding Susannah.
We get her back.

81
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:30,926
However it's done, I don't care.
We stop this now.

82
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,223
Everyone's working towards this.

83
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:37,197
Yes. No. Not everyone. A dedicated
core team. This can't go wide.

84
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:40,949
Keep it so far from the press
it's on the other side of Jupiter.

85
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,442
This only exists in this room.

86
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,129
It's already outside it.

87
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:53,067
If there are hacks sniffing around,
shut them down, bright, red, D Notice.

88
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,219
Super fucking Godzilla injunction
with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!

89
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,360
This video came from YouTube.

90
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:02,966
What?

91
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,659
It was uploaded via an encrypted IP
an hour ago.

92
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,940
Well, get it off there!

93
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:12,298
We did after nine minutes, long enough
for it to be duplicated and spread.

94
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,287
Spread?
How many people have seen this?

95
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,819
We take down one,
six clones pop up elsewhere.

96
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:21,147
How many people?

97
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:23,318
50,000. That's our current estimate.

98
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:27,342
The news rooms have got it.

99
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,120
They're running this on air?

100
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,927
No. We put a type five D notice out
and they're complying.

101
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,318
For now.

102
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,180
It's trending on Twitter.

103
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,569
Oh! For... Fucking internet!

104
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,455
What now? What's the play book?

105
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,150
This is virgin territory,
Prime Minister.

106
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:50,666
There's no play book.

107
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:02,459
Princess Susannah's been kidnapped!

108
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,921
You scared the shit out of me!

109
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:05,486
There's a youtube of it!

110
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,814
Go to work!

111
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,541
And satellite,

112
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,787
'..And have full unsimulated
sexual intercourse with a pig.'

113
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,623
No way. It's a piss take, man.
Look at it!

114
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,140
'I don't understand!'

115
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:19,804
Why this is on the news?

116
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:22,979
'..Carlton Bloom's

How do we describe it?
"An indecent act"?

119
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,499
Everyone's seen the video.
They know the details.

120
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,056
If we mention bestiality
Ofcom would be pissed off.

Fuck Ofcom!

122
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,379
We're observing the D Notice.

123
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,690
Surely we're going to do something.

124
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:40,816
We are honouring the D Notice.

125
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,128
The voluntary D Notice!

126
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,944
It may be a sportsman-like
gesture but we are making it.

127
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:47,729
A woman's life is at stake!

128
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:48,980
We follow the procedure.

129
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,814
My timeline consists
of 100% viewers asking

130
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:54,618
why we're not covering it.
How do I reply?

131
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:55,415
You don't.

132
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:56,892
That is totally backwards.

133
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,438
No-one else has broken rank.

134
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:00,094
Not the Beeb, not Sky, not...

135
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,117
Facebook's coverage
is pretty comprehensive!

136
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,688
Maybe

137
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,071
It's like 9/11's happening and

138
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:07,673
we're broadcasting sandwich recipes.

139
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,772
We're not a chat room!

140
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,678
It's on CNN and Fox.

141
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,241
And MSNBC, Al Jazeera, NHK...

142
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,569
All right.

143
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:20,608
Oh, God! This planet!

144
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,168
OK, Sarah, cover the snatch itself.

145
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,671
Damon, public reaction. Meera,

146
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:29,288
the royal angle, upcoming marriage,
etc.

Simon, set tone with
Standards and Practices.

148
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,980
We need to explain this without
viewers sicking up their Weetabix.

149
00:09:34,004 --> 00:09:39,059
Ken, the internet aspect, new paradigm,
Twitter, Arab spring, all that.

150
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,795
Dan, all graphics run past me.
Keep it functional... no Peppa Pigs.

151
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:45,647
Malaika,
update the princess obit VT.

152
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,397
The Obit VT?

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,702
Mm-hm. First, an awkward phone call.
Least I can do is warn Tom.

154
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,218
We put a D Notice on it.

155
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,340
'It's gone global, Tom.'

156
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,619
Don't. I'm begging you.

157
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,619
Don't run it, Martin.

158
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,059
'Look, I'm sorry. I can't help you.'

159
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,597
You know how much help
you're getting hereon in?

160
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:11,538
Multiply nothing by shit-all!
UKN are dead for us!

161
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,625
Shove it up your arse you fucking...

162
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:15,677
Interesting.

163
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:16,739
A man.

164
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:17,677
Man?

165
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:18,711
A man!

166
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,660
Tom, so you're across it...

167
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,946
I'm exploring contingency plans.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,304
'I briefed Callett.'

169
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,220
Ah! Mr Callett.
Noel, from Blue Eye.

170
00:10:33,612 --> 00:10:38,240
Noel won an Emmy by his effects
work on that HBO moon Western thing.

You won't find better.

173
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,499
Can you map a head onto a body live?

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,740
Depends if your camera's moving.

175
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:50,109
Rule sheet specifies a single hand-held
camera in a constant roving motion.

176
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,453
Mm.

177
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:54,562
Yeah, Gonzo style.
He knows his shit. That's tough.

178
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,890
"Fruition to be transmitted
in full"?

179
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:02,300
Focus on the visuals. Different face
mapped onto a live performer.

180
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,201

Can't happen.

184
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:16,699
It has to.

185
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,619
Our embeds have ruled out the major
players. It's not AQ, not IRA.

186

This is what's left...
radicals, hate groups.

People who've threatened yourself
or the royals.

188

They're being pulled in as we speak.

189
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,912
For more than questioning, I hope.

190

Somebody know something.

191

'If we all do it more, there'll be
less waste lying around... '

192
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,750
Is it still not on the telly?

193
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:45,739
Nothing. Must be a hoax.

194
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,179

interactive timeline. Tonally stark.

215

"a sex act". Nothing too gross.

And we are.

309
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,259
It wasn't a collective "you".
It was a singular "you", ie me.

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,099
Sir, we may have something. Jamie's
been tracing the video's origin.

311

I thought it was untraceable.

312
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,262
Technically, yes, so I thought,
"Work with what we do now"

313

That video, before Youtube
compression it was 57.3 meg.

00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:43,861
Anyway, we also know
it was uploaded at 3:16 AM.

is a postcode.

319
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,979
It came from somewhere in there.

Alert the local team.
Full squad. I'll man it.

330
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,854
Yes!

331
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,179
Right. Confident?

332
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,339
It's a kick-bollock scramble,
but with finessing it should be OK.

333
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,660
Finesse quickly.
Our performer's on his way.

334
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,219
It's a new one for me, obviously.
I wouldn't normally... You know.

No.

Yeah, well...

339
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:08,099
What do I put on the invoice?
That's what I'm wondering.

340
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,390
There won't be any invoicing.

Yeah. Well...

You need to get into this.

353
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,267
Is there a dressing room I can use?

354
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,620
No.

355
00:20:09,696 --> 00:20:11,539
Where's my co-star?

356
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,845
Be rude not to give her a kiss
beforehand.

357
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:16,204
Outside in the truck.

358
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:18,946
Full of joie de vivre, isn't he?

359
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,860
You also need to wear this...
on your head.

360
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,468
Board's been prised away.
That's where they got in.

361
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,814
OK.

362
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:39,780
'Target identified.'

363
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:40,993
Commissioner. Thank you.

364
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:42,517
So, team red...

365
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,712
'Any orders, boss?'

366
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,970
Continue reconnaissance
and await instructions,

367
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,408
before you proceed.

368
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,686
'With the 4pm deadline
three hours away,

369
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,605

370
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,420
They got in, yeah?

371
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,881
Do you think I'd be here
if they had?

372
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,366
We've got statements
for either outcome.

373
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,926
Listen,
coverage is very sympathetic.

374
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:15,723
Can't think about coverage now!

375
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:23,664
But it's on-side?

376
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,163
Strong undercurrent of sympathy.

377
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,070
Every poll indicates
understanding, disgust with the

378
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:31,938
captor, outrage at the whole
thing, but not at you.

379
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:39,703
If Walker's team fuck up, I'm not
saying they will, but if they do,

380
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,220
the public anticipates
non-compliance.

381
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:47,429
There'll be squawks from the usuals,

382
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:51,610
but it's not "England expects".

383
00:21:57,051 --> 00:22:02,211
If he kills her, there's no blood
on your hands. Bottom line.

384

'With hours to go, time is running
out for the security services.

Jack, call the police. Take it!

394
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,939
Get someone to shoot that first.

395
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,980

What did you do, Alex?

420
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:33,479
I had a back-up plan.

421
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:36,470
A man prepared to do it
and an FX company that

422
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:38,737
would paint your head
onto his shoulders.

423
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,338
You actually
thought that would work?

424
00:24:40,502 --> 00:24:41,823

Fuck the public!

503
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:52,339
To the public, this would be one man
of questionable popularity

over the life of a girl.

505
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:56,819
They will not release her anyway.
She's probably already dead.

506
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,736
If she isn't,
he'll kill her and upload the video.

507

Everyone will see it.
The world will see it.

508
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,019
The mood will border on insurrection
and you will be destroyed,

509
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,140
I guarantee you...
utterly destroyed.

510
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,745
The polling bears that out.

511
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,979
You won't just be
a disgraced politician,

512
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,099

insist on compliance.

513

that we cannot guarantee
your physical safety.

516
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,422
Or that of your family.

517
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,009
But...

518
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,883

for the broadcast.

It's out of your hands.

tone that causes nausea.

OK. Yeah.

It's sedated?

is that you should take
as long as you need.

If you rush, it might be
misinterpreted as eagerness

or even enjoyment.

562
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,685
It's just
a skeleton crew inside.

563

Closed set.

'I trust this will bring about the
safe return of Princess Susannah.'

'I...

Jesus! Poor bastard!

571
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,219
But it's been on for nearly an hour.

572
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,580
It's history, this.

573
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,019
We've got her. Susannah.

574
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,940
They released her?

575
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:51,778
Stumbling about in the city.

576
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,273
Sedated. She can't remember
anything, but she's unharmed.

577
00:39:55,297 --> 00:39:56,609
But her finger?

578
00:39:56,648 --> 00:39:58,659
Not hers. DNA shows it's male.

579
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,665
What?

580
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,986
There is one other thing. There's a
CCTV grab of her from half three.

581
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:09,219
It seems he let her go
30 minutes before it happened.

582
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,776
Why?

583
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,433
My guess...

584
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,034
he knew everyone would
be elsewhere

585
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:17,292
watching screens.

586
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:20,343
So it's a statement.

587
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,757
Ma'am?

588
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:24,892
That's what this was all about,
making a point.

589
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,780
Should we, er...?

590
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,849
Lose that page of the report.

591
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:31,419
No-one sees it, especially the PM.

592
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
Of course.

593
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:44,473

594
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,146
