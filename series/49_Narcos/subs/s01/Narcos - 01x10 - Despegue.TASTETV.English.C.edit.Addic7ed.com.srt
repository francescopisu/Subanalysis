1
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:15,205
When the public
found out about the excessive lifestyle

2
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,373
of the prisoners at La Catedral,

3
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:21,502
the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes

4
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:24,672
being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.

5
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:28,927
The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,972
of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.

7
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,892
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?

8
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,394
It's from upstairs.

9
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,647
Oh, I get a card.

10
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:44,233
Oh, CIA.

11
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,945
"Congratulations,
Central Intelligence Agency."

12
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,239
This is, uh... this is blowing up
a little bit more than we expected, no?

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,158
Well, hopefully,
the son of a bitch rots in jail.

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,662
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,247
- I forbade you to leak this.
-  How do you know it was us?

16
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,917
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.

17
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,670
Whoever did this, it doesn't really
matter now. What's done is done.

18
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,673
Ambassador, like you said, this is
a Colombian matter. What do we care?

19
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,550
I'm filing a report with the
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.

20
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,470
- Ambassador--
- Good, report to Washington.

21
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,972
'Cause if something isn't done,
every American down here

22
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,017
associated with the government
is gonna look like a fool, including you.

23
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:20,938
I wasn't finished. Until further notice,
you're both suspended.

24
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,564
Go home.

25
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:26,652
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?

26
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:31,114
Mr. President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

27
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:35,952
Moncada's wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

28
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:39,331
It's clear that Escobar
killed those men in that prison.

29
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:45,128
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.

30
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:48,214
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

31
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,466
Forgive me, Eduardo...

32
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:54,388
but I'm having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

33
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:59,434
This is our opportunity
to end Pablo's vacation.

35
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,624
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.

36
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:40,595
Ahh!

37
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,316
Good morning, boss.

38
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,237
Bad news.

39
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,132
Have the bodies disappeared?

40
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:32,355
Our agreement with him states
he can't be moved to another prison.

41
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:36,943
Excuse me, but killing people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

42
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:38,987
Yes, yes,
but we have to tread carefully.

43
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:42,408
If he feels we're violating his terms,

44
00:05:42,616 --> 00:05:45,244
he'll start putting bombs
on street corners again.

45
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:52,499
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats
against him from his biggest enemies.

46
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,795
That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogotá

47
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:58,464
while we improve security
at La Catedral.

48
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,179
The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

49
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,515
would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

50
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:09,767
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,645
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,688
Hm.

53
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,321
Can we trust him?

54
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:22,239
Yes, sir.

55
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,158
Success.

56
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Sure, it cost me a suspension,
but who cares?

57
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:33,458
I just call it a week's paternity leave.

58
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:38,129
I was ready to crack a beer
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.

59
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,756
See, because of me and Peña,

60
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:44,135
the Colombian government
was sending in the army.

61
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,680
Not the cops,
but the fucking army.

62
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,018
There was no way that Escobar
was getting out of this one.

63
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,355
But, then again, in Colombia...

64
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:58,066
nothing goes down
the way you think it will.

65
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,519
I'm calling him.

66
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:41,360
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.

67
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:49,783
I was just thinking
there's nothing in the world I'd love more

68
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:51,619
than to hear my wife's lovely voice.

69
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:54,121
Pablo, what's happening?

70
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:56,749
Why would something
be happening here?

71
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,918
The soldiers.

72
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,211
Soldiers?

73
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:04,298
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.

74
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:05,842
I don't know, Pablo.

75
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,471
Tell me what's happening.

76
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:13,349
No, my love, it's nothing.

77
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,018
Everything is cool.

78
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,899
I'll call back soon, all right?

79
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,945
I love you, baby.

80
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,574
Yes, my love.

81
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,046
Get out the weapons.

82
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:47,551
As you wish, sir.

83
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,953
Listen up, company!

84
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:20,459
You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

85
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:23,961
Let's secure the perimeter.

86
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:27,131
Tell your men
they have orders to shoot anyone

87
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:31,428
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
-  As you wish, General.

88
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,679
Dismissed.

89
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:38,184
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.

90
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:40,811
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!

91
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:44,607
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here

92
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:47,528
to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?

93
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:51,448
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!

94
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,450
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!

95
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:03,000
The car was
outside the garage, still idling,

96
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,335
the keys still in the ignition.

97
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,296
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?

98
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:10,091
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good. Don't.

99
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,426
What? Why not?

100
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:16,514
Nothing. I just... I don't wanna
ring any alarms before I check things out.

101
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,017
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...

102
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:22,395
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.

103
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,022
I'm gonna take care of this.

104
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:29,235
I'll find out where he is, all right?

105
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,572
Look, I'll make you a drink.

106
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,459
Boss...

107
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,253
they're gonna
try to take you out of here

108
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:50,339
and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

109
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,884
If I leave this place,
someone will kill me.

110
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:58,515
Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

111
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:04,562
What the fuck,
let's give those bastards lead.

112
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,231
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

113
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,025
For every one of our men,
they have 20!

114
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:12,194
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

115
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,906
Stop bickering in front of the boss.

116
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:17,325
We have the escape routes.

117
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:20,870
We could get into the hills
before they even know we're gone.

118
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:30,672
There is a time to fight...

119
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,050
and there is a time to be clever.

120
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:36,595
Yes, sir.

121
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:42,057
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.

122
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:43,602
Be smart.

123
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:47,731
Try to settle this matter peacefully.

124
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,444
If that fails?

125
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,700
What are you doing back here?

126
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:02,621
- I forgot my socks.
-  I want you out in five minutes.

127
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,751
Son of a bitch. These Colombians
are knee-deep in a shit storm.

128
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:10,170
We gotta talk.

129
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:12,838
Back here.

130
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,635
What? You get a hooker pregnant?

131
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,804
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.

132
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,306
I checked all area hospitals,
police stations.

133
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,974
We were pursuing leads
on the Cali cartel.

134
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,934
It could be related to that,
or it could be Escobar.

135
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,894
Did you report it
to the Regional Security Office?

136
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,022
If I tell the ROS,
it becomes a five-alarm fire,

137
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:31,816
and whoever has him
might panic.

138
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,027
If it is Escobar,
he's dead already.

139
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,905
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?

140
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,202
Jesus Christ.

141
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,705
Let me see what I can do.

142
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:51,502
General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

143
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:55,715
I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.

144
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:59,259
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.

145
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,012
You'll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

146
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:05,265
while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

147
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,227
We both know that's not true.

148
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:13,024
But it's what you'll tell Escobar
until he's safely inside a military brig.

149
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:14,984
Yes, Mr. President.

150
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,404
What's wrong?

151
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,950
I've got a bad feeling about this.

152
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,620
Eduardo, I trust you...

153
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:31,334
and this is too important to leave
to someone I don't trust completely.

154
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,590
I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

155
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,508
You know that very well.

156
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,555
Nothing will make me happier than to see
that asshole get the justice he deserves.

157
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:56,983
Checked my sources with the Colombian
military. Nobody knows jack shit.

158
00:13:56,984 --> 00:14:00,529
So no indication Escobar had anything
to do with Murphy's disappearance?

159
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,656
It's time to sound the alarm.

160
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:06,035
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?

161
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:10,623
We call out the troops,
he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.

162
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,876
Thanks.

163
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,939
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet

164
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,149
until further notice, understand?

165
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,694
All right. What else do you have?

166
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:43,948
- I know that.
- Velasco.

167
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,533
I'll call you back.

168
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:48,244
Yes, boss?

169
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:51,122
What's happening outside?

170
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,126
We don't know.

171
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,971
I fucked up.

172
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,264
What's that, boss?

173
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:12,978
Gather the boys.

174
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:19,609
And tell the prison guards they're
to fire on anyone who tries to come in.

175
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:25,699
Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

176
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:29,661
They'd better. I hired them.

177
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:35,457
Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellín just informed me

178
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,004
that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

179
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,131
Mm.

180
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,077
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

181
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,204
General!

182
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,415
Let him through.

183
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,251
Good evening, General.

184
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:23,296
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?

185
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,090
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.

186
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:29,219
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?

187
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,889
Inside the prison, obviously.

188
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,016
What do you mean,
he's in the prison?

189
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:37,061
I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

190
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,689
I'm sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

191
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,900
Then what were your orders?

192
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,862
My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

193
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:48,573
and wait for you.

194
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,784
That's not what the president believes.

195
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:55,287
He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

196
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:58,124
I'm sorry,
but those were my orders.

197
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:06,007
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.

198
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:12,429
But since there is
no justice in this country,

199
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,557
he is the vice minister of nothing.

200
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:20,855
This is good.

201
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,234
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

202
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:31,157
This is very good.

203
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:37,037
General, I don't believe
you understand your orders clearly.

204
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,000
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

205
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,710
I'm going to try
to make a miracle happen.

206
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:47,673
I'm going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

207
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:51,384
And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

208
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:54,597
I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

209
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:58,934
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to kill the vice minister of justice

210
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:03,523
right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.

211
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:07,275
At least let me make a call
so they don't shoot you when you walk in!

212
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:10,947
Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

213
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,117
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door! General!

214
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:17,703
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

215
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:18,872
Open it.

216
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,644
Vice Minister, good evening.

217
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:45,398
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

218
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:49,194
Wait here.

219
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,871
Good evening, Vice Minister.

220
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,332
It's been a while.

221
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,755
Good evening.

222
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:14,218
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.

223
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,180
My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.

224
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:20,348
The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

225
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:22,809
for your safety
and everyone else's here.

226
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,937
Mm.

227
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:30,026
I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

228
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:37,074
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

229
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,535
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.

230
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:43,623
And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

231
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,540
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

232
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,170
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

233
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:54,674
If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

234
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:58,930
We have an agreement,
and you're breaking it.

235
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:01,932
What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won't kidnap me

236
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,309
and take me to the US?

237
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,479
Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

238
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,816
like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right?

239
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,776
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word.

240
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:14,320
- Your word.
- Mm.

241
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:19,659
As vice minister of justice?

242
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:24,872
Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

243
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:29,502
Haven't you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

244
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:34,547
We can end this peacefully...

245
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:38,052
if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

246
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,012
Don Pablo,
these bastards will kill you!

247
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,521
I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

248
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:54,819
The press is saying I killed those men,
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.

249
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:01,075
If Gaviria wants me out of here...

250
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,581
he can come here...
and do it himself.

251
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,294
Meanwhile...

252
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:18,218
I'll view any incursion
as a declaration of war.

253
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,442
I'll inform the president
of your position.

254
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:41,448
Excuse me.

255
00:21:53,086 --> 00:21:55,171
Mr. Vice Minister.

256
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,344
Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

257
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,643
I'd rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

258
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:17,483
Let me out!

259
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:21,822
Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

260
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:28,537
My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

261
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:32,625
I hope you'll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

262
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:38,463
It's not every day we're honored with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

263
00:22:43,219 --> 00:22:44,720
Come on, Vice Minister.

264
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,181
Calm down, let's go.

265
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:58,524
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?

266
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:00,445
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.

267
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,197
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?

268
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,829
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,374
Just trying to hold it together.

270
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,047
God, I just wanna go home.

271
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,759
I want my husband back.

272
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:36,105
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.

273
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,029
No.

274
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,699
You're just not sure he's dead.

275
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:55,416
What's taking this guy so long?

276
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,336
General, with all due respect,

277
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,631
I don't think we should've
let him go inside.

278
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:06,926
No.

279
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:11,057
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough
to fuck with the vice minister.

280
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:29,742
Can I get you something to drink?

281
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,411
I don't need anything.

282
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:35,122
Look, don't be so nervous.

283
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,379
As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

284
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:46,716
that if he doesn't remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

285
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:49,554
there will be grave consequences.

286
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:54,474
But if he withdraws the troops,

287
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:58,563
we'll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

288
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:13,659
Good evening,
President Gaviria's office.

289
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,456
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.

290
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:18,999
One minute, please.

291
00:25:26,257 --> 00:25:28,216
Mr. President,
excuse the interruption.

292
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:31,011
There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

293
00:25:32,012 --> 00:25:34,390
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.

294
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:45,276
Hello?

295
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:49,155
Hello?

296
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:55,035
How long will I be here
as a hostage?

297
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:59,873
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

298
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,427
Escobar has Sandoval
inside the prison.

299
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:14,720
Hang up right now,
Mr. President.

300
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,349
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.

301
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,682
Mr. President,
hang up the phone.

302
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:21,895
If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

303
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:24,607
Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.

304
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:27,276
Hang up the phone. Sir!

305
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:36,869
Leave us alone.

306
00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:45,335
- They hung up.
-  Bullshit.

307
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:46,879
Shut up!

308
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,219
So, then...

309
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:58,974
the president is too busy
to speak with me.

310
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:03,145
I don't understand
how he ended up in that jail.

311
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:05,231
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.

312
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:08,483
What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

313
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:11,945
We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

314
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,739
Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

315
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:18,784
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

316
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:21,287
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.

317
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:26,293
Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

318
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,088
Do I have your permission?

319
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:33,509
Good.

320
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,933
María Clara,
connect me with DAS, immediately.

321
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:45,520
- No. No.
- Cancel the call.

322
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:51,277
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.

323
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:54,321
If Sandoval dies...

324
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:58,825
I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

325
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:02,871
But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

326
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,002
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.

327
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:15,926
I just realized something.

328
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:20,805
The president didn't just betray me...

329
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:23,517
he also betrayed you.

330
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:28,396
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.

331
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:30,315
...there would be three options.

332
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:34,860
One: I leave with you, peacefully.

333
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:38,449
Two: I take you hostage.

334
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:42,327
Three: I shoot you,

335
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:47,540
and then, he really would
have a good excuse to kill me.

336
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,709
Right?

337
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,304
Either way, he wins.
Right?

338
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:04,015
Maybe the president
is betraying us both.

339
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:06,058
You could be right.

340
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,060
But you know something?

341
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:11,940
I'll sacrifice my life
to make sure you're dead.

342
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:23,910
You think you're better than me,
but you're wrong.

343
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,458
I come from nothing.

344
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:34,004
I fought hard
to become what I am.

345
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:41,428
If the government
hadn't come after me...

346
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:47,309
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.

347
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:53,440
You and I are nothing alike.

348
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,527
You are a criminal.

349
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:59,780
And criminals can't run forever.

350
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:03,617
Sir.

351
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:22,635
Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

352
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:25,180
while you're still inside.

353
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,226
I would have done the same thing.

354
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,293
Don't kill him.

355
00:30:56,086 --> 00:31:02,426
If he dies... it will be
at the hands of his own government.

356
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,310
Good luck, Vice Minister.

357
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,219
Now what?

358
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:48,346
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.

359
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:49,807
Damn right we do.

360
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,643
Hey, partner.

361
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,271
Remember how I told you
that no one in their right mind

362
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:59,358
would ever kill a DEA agent?

363
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:02,360
Well, to be honest,
after they snatched me,

364
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,612
I'd forgotten that, myself.

365
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:09,116
But then, I calmed down and realized
that if they wanted to kill me,

366
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:12,286
they would've blown my brains out
right in front of my house.

367
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,207
This... was something different.

368
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,921
I figured this was Escobar
knowing that they were coming to get him,

369
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:24,508
and grabbing
a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.

370
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,219
Sit.

371
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:33,391
Man, you fucked up. You think
that they're gonna make a trade for me?

372
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:34,893
No. No!

373
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:39,189
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin'
prison and blow his fuckin' head off!

374
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:51,325
I'm sorry
you were taken against your will,

375
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:55,873
but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,
given your last meeting with Navegante.

376
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,838
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see
your Cali cartel is doing so well,

377
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,549
but you've made a huge mistake.

378
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:07,927
I don't see it that way.

379
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:14,306
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking
the liberty of making you a cocktail.

380
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:18,437
I just learned how to do a really
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.

381
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:21,146
That's wonderful,
but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.

382
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:24,693
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.

383
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,153
Fine. I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.

384
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:31,408
I thought you might
like to see some pictures I have.

385
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:53,262
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo

386
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:56,976
to ID a location
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.

387
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,979
Two hours later, they were dead.

388
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,735
Along with an innocent woman.

389
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:17,746
OK.

390
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,374
Poison will be at La Dispensaria

391
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,294
at around midnight with his crew.

392
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:31,885
Who's your contact at the embassy?

393
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,638
Did you know she had two kids?

394
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:38,599
What do you think our newspapers
will think of that?

395
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,815
Our government doesn't take too kindly
to American-backed death squads.

396
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,442
I could blackmail you
with these pictures.

397
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:51,154
You'd lose your career at the DEA,

398
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:55,784
go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.

399
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,536
But don't worry.

400
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:00,955
I won't ask you or Javier Peña

401
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:04,084
to cross any line
you haven't already crossed.

402
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:08,921
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel
would be a good match.

403
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:12,257
There are many,
in every segment of Colombia,

404
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:15,011
who have been persecuted
by Pablo Escobar.

405
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,138
The families of Moncada and Galeano,

406
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,265
the families of judges and police...

407
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:23,687
people with resources
who need to be unified.

408
00:35:23,896 --> 00:35:25,771
They want vengeance.

409
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:28,567
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.

410
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,699
I can't make any commitments right now.

411
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,118
But I can tell you this:

412
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,664
When Pablo goes down,
and he will go down...

413
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:46,667
you'll hear a knock at your door,

414
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:49,088
and it'll be me.

415
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:58,388
You haven't tried my daiquiri.

416
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:01,224
That Herrera's a pretty good host.

417
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:05,186
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you
door-to-door service right to the embassy.

418
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:07,730
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?

419
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:09,149
What'd he say?

420
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:12,317
You fuckin' gave him that information.

421
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:15,114
He's got pictures on me,
he's got tape on me, Javi.

422
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,619
Answer me.

423
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,455
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?

424
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:27,750
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?

425
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,544
That your version of "all in"?

426
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:34,591
I got one goal: get Escobar.

427
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,470
That's not an answer.

428
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,057
Who gave him the fucking photos?

429
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:46,145
Hey.

430
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,989
See you around, Jav.

431
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,659
I'm gonna go call my wife.

432
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,903
Sir, I have her on the line.

433
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:43,534
- Hello, my love.
-  Hello.

434
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:47,788
Look, we're having
a little problem here.

435
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:52,627
We're trying to solve it,
but you know what to do...

436
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,754
if it doesn't work out, right?

437
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:57,299
Yes, Pablo.

438
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,843
I love you very much.

439
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:02,971
Me, too.

440
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:06,599
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.

441
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:34,044
We are bandits.

442
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:04,740
- Wait a minute! What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!

443
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,880
You've gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

444
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,800
Come on, come on.

445
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:44,114
- Hurry up!
- Get down! No! Get in there!

446
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:07,929
Don't move, don't move!

447
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,030
- All clear!
- All clear!

448
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:28,074
- All clear!
- All clear!

449
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:52,682
- Don't move! Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

450
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:57,229
Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

451
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:09,365
Speak.

452
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,450
Yes, it's him.

453
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:14,079
Speak up, please,
I can't hear you.

454
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:15,830
Is that confirmed?

455
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,791
Wait a minute.

456
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:25,214
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.

457
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,595
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

458
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:37,894
And Escobar?

459
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,897
- All clear!
- All clear!

460
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,566
- All clear!
- All clear!

461
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:47,404
Look what we found.

462
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,330
Do you think he's OK?

463
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,709
I'm sure he's fine.

464
00:42:25,024 --> 00:42:26,734
See you tomorrow.

465
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:29,237
Good night.

466
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:35,160
It's OK... it's OK.

467
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:37,078
It's OK.

468
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,248
Steve...

469
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,418
I just wanna go home.

470
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,096
This is home.

471
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:18,536
Less than an hour
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,

472
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:22,873
word had spread all over Colombia
that war was coming again.

473
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:25,376
But this time would be different.

474
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:28,504
This time,
there would be no surrender...

475
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,340
no negotiations...

476
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,009
no deals.

477
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:37,597
This time...
we were gonna kill him.

478
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:47,023
Escobar said, "Better a grave
in Colombia than a cell in the US."

479
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,109
Well, guess what, motherfucker?

480
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,279
That works for me.
