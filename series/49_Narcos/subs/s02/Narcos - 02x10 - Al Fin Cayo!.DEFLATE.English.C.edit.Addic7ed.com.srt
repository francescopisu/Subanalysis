00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,399
Citizens of Colombia,

2
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:29,822
we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

3
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,623
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,209
Thank you.

5
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,128
How are you, sir?

6
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,428
Thank you.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,350
Thank you.

8
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,189
Much appreciated.

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,903
Thank you.

10
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,406
Please come in, Mr. President.

11
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,346
Mmm.

12
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,349
- All yours.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,863
What's this?

14
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,040
Bravo, Pablito.

15
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,544
I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.

16
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,381
Don't forget
to blow out the candles, Daddy.

17
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,885
Happy birthday, Daddy!

18
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,721
Pablo, we miss you so much.

19
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,889
We wish we could be there with you.

20
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,641
I know, my love.

21
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,687
Soon this will all be behind us.

22
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,357
I promise.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

24
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,878
 Look up "magical realism"
in the dictionary,

25
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,310
and it'll describe a literary style

26
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:17,758
incorporating fantastic
or mythical elements

27
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,052
into otherwise realistic fiction.

28
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,721
Colombia is where it began.

29
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,099
And anyone who's spent real time here
knows why.

30
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,395
It's a place where the bizarre
shakes hands with the inexplicable

31
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,521
on a daily basis.

32
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:35,029
But just like in the novels
of Gabriel García Márquez,

33
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:39,242
the weird shit usually pops off
at certain critical moments.

34
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,328
When the whole place is on edge.

35
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,749
When everything's about to change.

36
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:53,672
Of all the people who had
a vested interest in nailing Escobar,

37
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:56,509
Javier Peña deserved to be there
when it went down.

38
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:01,305
No American had given more or done more.

39
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:06,060
Well...

40
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,354
To, uh...

41
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,274
the Drug Enforcement Administration?

42
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,402
I'll drink to that while I still can.

43
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,195
You're a fucking lifer, Javi.

44
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:24,828
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out which long-term DEA agent

45
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,956
was linked to the Los Pepes death squad.

46
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,999
Well, the Board of Professional Conduct

47
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,419
has never been accused
of being geniuses, so...

48
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:34,255
Yeah, and who reads
the Miami Herald anyway, right?

49
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:42,096
Murphy, listen.

50
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:44,641
I meant what I said.

51
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,812
Anyone starts asking questions, just
tell them what they want to hear, okay?

52
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:53,441
- It was always on me.
- Fuck you, Javi.

53
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,693
And anybody who comes around asking.

54
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, you do me a favor. You...

55
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:07,705
You get him.

56
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,876
Attention passengers.

57
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:18,299
We will now start boarding Flight 464
to Washington, D.C. at Gate Two.

58
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:21,302
All right, well, I gotta...
I can't finish this. It's...

59
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,428
I gotta go.

60
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,270
Take care of yourself.

61
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,739
All it took was the whiff of a scandal

62
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,991
out of the mouth of an exiled drug queen

63
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:47,161
and Peña was gone, like fucking magic.

64
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,996
Good morning, boss.

65
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:33,707
I made some eggs.

66
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,545
- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,213
Thanks.

68
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,886
I got everything we need, boss.

69
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:48,222
You went to a different store, correct?

70
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,809
Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

71
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:57,815
So, the shopkeeper's mom, she's a healer.

72
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,652
I paid her a visit.

73
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:06,657
I told you not to talk to anybody.

74
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:09,076
Yeah, boss, but...

75
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:16,125
only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

76
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:18,753
Look...

77
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:23,341
I asked her for something to protect you.

78
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,927
The sword of St. Michael the archangel...

79
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,139
- the Virgin...
- ...and the Holy Child of Atocha.

80
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,640
Mmm-hmm.

81
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:39,315
You know my mother and I built a church?

82
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:41,775
Yes, sir.

83
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:44,946
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.

84
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,614
That's where I grew up, boss.

85
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:50,325
Happy birthday, sir.

86
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,120
Thank you, Limón.

87
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:56,165
Pardon me.

88
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,766
This signal is coming from Medellín.

89
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,143
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.

90
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,146
- Pablo's come home.
- I think so.

91
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,065
Hopefully he will
speak to them again tomorrow.

92
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:23,734
If he does, we'll be listening.

93
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:45,339
This stays between us, understood?

94
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:51,929
We will set up a temporary base
in Casablanca.

95
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:56,141
We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

96
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,102
- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

97
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,566
Lieutenant Martinez?

98
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,482
How long since we heard
anything from Escobar?

99
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,430
A month? A month and a half?

100
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,408
A month and a half, sir.

101
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:16,370
And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

102
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:20,166
Yes. Waiting.

103
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,295
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.
It's in our blood.

104
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:29,717
Excuse me.

105
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,099
Six.

106
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:51,989
Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

107
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:55,534
It's your turn.

108
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:00,206
I think if coke was legal, boss,

109
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:05,044
you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

110
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:16,889
Yes, sir.

111
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:21,602
We're sure that the call came from
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellín.

112
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:24,104
This is the best intel
we've received in months.

113
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:27,983
Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

114
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:31,112
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

115
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:33,739
If your men are able to find Escobar...

116
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:37,326
I don't care about the consequences.

117
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,163
I want him dead.

118
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,792
Do you have a problem with that?

119
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:52,232
With all due respect, Mr. President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

120
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:55,177
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

121
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,013
Keep me informed.

122
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:02,851
Gentlemen.

123
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:39,888
Mrs. Escobar?

124
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,808
The attorney general called this morning.

125
00:12:42,891 --> 00:12:45,602
He's decided to end
your protective custody.

126
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:49,774
So we have to leave by the weekend.

127
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:53,527
No. No, you can't do this to us.

128
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:56,906
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

129
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:04,955
Ma'am? Ma'am.

130
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:07,750
May I give you some advice?

131
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:15,341
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

132
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:16,967
Forget about him.

133
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:41,826
 The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?

134
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:47,164
Probably not a good idea
right now, my love.

135
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,419
So... do you feel a year older or what?

136
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,714
More like four or five.

137
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:58,384
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

138
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,761
The days feel longer.

139
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,224
For me too.

140
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:09,770
I still don't understand
why you're in Medellín.

141
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:12,022
That place is too dangerous, my love.

142
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:19,571
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

143
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:22,908
Pablo...

144
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:27,704
I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

145
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:32,710
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

146
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,086
You can survive prison.

147
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:40,300
We both know that won't happen.

148
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,678
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

149
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,848
-  Listen to me, Pablo.
- They're talking.

150
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,851
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

151
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:52,187
You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

152
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:53,814
My man.

153
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,318
My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

154
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,236
The people love you and follow you.

155
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,280
Tata, Limón wants me off.

156
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:05,534
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

157
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,622
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

158
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,334
They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

159
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,337
They gave him the Nobel Prize.

160
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,342
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

161
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:23,343
Of the same country that imprisoned him.

162
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,429
 I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

163
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,181
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

164
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:30,058
 All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

165
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,019
It's very important.

166
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:35,147
It's our only way out really.

167
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:37,817
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

168
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,695
Colonel!
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.

169
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,698
Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

170
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:45,157
I'll think about it.

171
00:15:46,074 --> 00:15:47,367
All right?

172
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:51,830
I love you very much.

173
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:25,322
Where are you going?

174
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,199
To Medellín.

175
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:31,828
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

176
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,706
My son needs me.

177
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,084
How so?

178
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:39,169
What you want...

179
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:44,049
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

180
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:45,884
I don't want them to kill him.

181
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:48,136
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

182
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,805
They won't if he turns himself in.

183
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:52,766
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

184
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,685
No! No, ma'am.

185
00:16:54,768 --> 00:17:01,191
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

186
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:05,153
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

187
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:08,991
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

188
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:11,118
We can't even leave the country.

189
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,124
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

190
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,127
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

191
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:28,510
My son...

192
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:32,097
needs his mother.

193
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:40,939
Hermilda.

194
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:53,327
Please be very careful. Please.

195
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,079
Tell the children...

196
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,500
I'll tell them.

197
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,438
We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

198
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:26,026
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

199
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:29,655
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

200
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:33,533
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

201
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:37,788
Now, if he resists...

202
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:41,625
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

203
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:44,294
I want you to take his life. Understood?

204
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,129
- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

205
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:36,596
Everything all right, boss?

206
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:59,870
Tata wants me to surrender.

207
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,210
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

208
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:09,504
Nelson Mandela?

209
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:15,385
Who's that, boss?

210
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,188
Did you buy more rolling papers?

211
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:10,357
Sorry, no, boss.

212
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,145
I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

213
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,001
He's not here.

214
00:22:16,214 --> 00:22:19,634
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

215
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,681
This is my city, Limón.

216
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,395
These are my people.

217
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:37,277
Medellín will never betray me.

218
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:44,034
Colonel.

219
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,578
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

220
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,641
Looks like your little machine
is broken.

221
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,625
Go and fiddle with the little knob.
Go on.

222
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,503
Excuse me, Colonel.

223
00:22:58,757 --> 00:22:59,590
Listen up!

224
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:02,868
Take down the staging area
and head back to Holguín.

225
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,067
Son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

226
00:23:21,863 --> 00:23:24,991
- A ghost.
- What's that?

227
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:29,537
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

228
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,707
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

229
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:41,591
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

230
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,427
Give me the keys!

231
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:47,180
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

232
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:20,541
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

233
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,128
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

234
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,380
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

235
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:44,774
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

236
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:50,696
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

237
00:26:57,537 --> 00:27:01,249
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

238
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,668
Sir.

239
00:27:04,794 --> 00:27:06,880
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

240
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:07,440
- Kick it here!
- There you go.

241
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:10,610
Yeah!

242
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,686
You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

243
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:46,980
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

244
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,734
They're offering seven million dollars
for your head,

245
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:54,070
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

246
00:28:57,532 --> 00:28:59,867
You look just like Che Guevara.

247
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,869
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

248
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,748
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

249
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,884
What? You don't miss me or what?

250
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,182
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

251
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:25,434
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

252
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:27,979
Thank you, Gustavo.

253
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:35,027
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

254
00:29:35,653 --> 00:29:39,198
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

255
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:40,867
Never letting anything stop him.

256
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:45,455
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

257
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:47,487
You remember when we used
to talk about going

258
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:50,317
to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

259
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,672
- Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.
- Mmm.

260
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:58,385
Tata wants me to surrender.

261
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:04,974
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

262
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,976
Maybe it's a good idea.

263
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:13,733
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

264
00:30:13,816 --> 00:30:18,195
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

265
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,655
The legend grows.

266
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:22,826
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

267
00:30:25,286 --> 00:30:28,956
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

268
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,669
Let's cut the bullshit.

269
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:38,508
We are bandits, Pablo.

270
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,343
Right?

271
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:48,142
What do you think?

272
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:53,230
I think...

273
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:59,862
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

274
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:06,786
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

275
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:19,257
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

276
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:43,591
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

277
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:46,385
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

278
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:52,058
It worked perfectly.

279
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,441
You're a good man, Limón.

280
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:04,737
Thank you.

281
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,740
Thanks a lot.

282
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:11,619
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:15,414
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

284
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:16,791
I'm hungry.

285
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:21,337
 Tata?

286
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:26,383
Pablo?

287
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:29,178
There's the love of my life.

288
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,933
- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

289
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:36,477
I feel good.

290
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:41,398
And ready to talk to those reporters.

291
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,986
Good, my love.

292
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:47,154
Does that mean you're
turning yourself in?

293
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:52,118
No, Tata.

294
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,246
I'll never surrender.

295
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,085
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

296
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:03,922
You have to.

297
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,303
I'll never surrender, my love.

298
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:26,444
I know, Pablo.

299
00:34:29,155 --> 00:34:30,782
But what's your plan?

300
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:35,453
All right.

301
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,705
I know what we're going to do.

302
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:44,087
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

303
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,130
That's what we are going to do.

304
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,597
-  ...foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

305
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,516
...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

306
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,228
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

307
00:35:04,231 --> 00:35:08,360
We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

308
00:35:09,904 --> 00:35:13,825
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

309
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:17,662
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

310
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:19,830
You have to believe me.

311
00:35:20,623 --> 00:35:23,626
- We will succeed.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

312
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:30,133
As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

313
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,301
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

314
00:35:32,385 --> 00:35:35,638
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

315
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,557
And listen...

316
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,229
I will not rest until that happens.

317
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:46,690
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

318
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:52,489
 I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

319
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:59,203
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

320
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:00,746
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

321
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,165
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

322
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:04,917
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

323
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:09,214
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

324
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:12,549
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

325
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,009
Colonel, I found him.

326
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:16,011
Who? Escobar?

327
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,555
Yes, Colonel.

328
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,224
He's in Los Olivos.

329
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:26,814
Son, are you sure? We can't afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

330
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,109
I'm sure. I saw him.

331
00:36:31,777 --> 00:36:33,570
What do you mean you saw him?

332
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:37,783
Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

333
00:36:39,118 --> 00:36:40,703
And did he see you?

334
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:43,497
No, I don't think so.

335
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,335
Listen up, Lieutenant.

336
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:49,921
There's still some men
in the staging area.

337
00:36:50,004 --> 00:36:53,591
I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

338
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,843
Copy that, Colonel.

339
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:58,846
One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

340
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:03,476
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

341
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:06,729
Hello, Dad.

342
00:37:06,812 --> 00:37:08,647
How's it going, son?

343
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:12,276
You wanted to ask me something or what?

344
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,610
Yes, sir.

345
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:16,113
What wish did you make for your birthday?

346
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:19,659
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

347
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:22,787
Tell me! Don't be like that!

348
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,289
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

349
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:27,791
is that it was a very good wish.

350
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:28,751
You know,

351
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:31,295
you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

352
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:44,934
Thank you, my love.

353
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:49,605
Captain.

354
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:52,316
-  Captain, can you hear me?
- Yes, Colonel?

355
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,776
How many men are left
in the provisional base?

356
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,654
- Counting me, about 12.
- Listen up.

357
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:02,660
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- Shit! Let's go!

358
00:38:02,743 --> 00:38:05,246
Everybody to Los Olivos!

359
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:06,956
 Hello.

360
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:11,418
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

361
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:12,461
Good.

362
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:16,340
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

363
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,435
Perez!

364
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:32,273
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

365
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:33,649
This is the house.

366
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,945
Get your mom on the phone, okay?

367
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:40,072
Pablo.

368
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:42,533
- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

369
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,619
The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

370
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:50,249
"How do you feel after
all these days on the run?"

371
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:53,544
Write this down.

372
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:57,924
"It's been very hard
being far from my family,

373
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:00,927
who I love more than anything
in the world."

374
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:04,430
- Sergeant, go around.
- "But I feel good.

375
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,056
I feel strong.

376
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,936
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

377
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:15,650
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

378
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:22,740
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

379
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:27,536
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

380
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:34,835
The government
is holding my family hostage.

381
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:39,256
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

382
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,468
that calls itself democratic.

383
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,054
My little kids are innocent children

384
00:39:46,138 --> 00:39:50,601
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

385
00:39:56,732 --> 00:39:59,360
All we want from the government

386
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:02,363
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

387
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:08,577
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

388
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:10,830
Without that... "

389
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,375
One moment.

390
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:17,252
What happened, Pablo?

391
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:24,176
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

392
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,804
Pablo. Pablo.

393
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:30,015
Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.

394
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,059
Pablo, what's going on?

395
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:35,395
What's wrong, Mom?

396
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:40,943
Go on. All right.

397
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:51,204
Go! Go!

398
00:40:52,621 --> 00:40:53,622
Let's go!

399
00:40:57,042 --> 00:41:00,045
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

400
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:01,213
Come on!

401
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,215
Come on! Move, move, move!

402
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:13,142
Go, go, go!

403
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:22,734
Move!

404
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:24,362
Go!

405
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:26,238
Keep going!

406
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,359
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

407
00:42:29,593 --> 00:42:31,345
Sergeant Sarmiento!

408
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,222
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

409
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,100
Is he alive?

410
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:38,143
All that time hunting him...

411
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:39,809
and just like that,

412
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:42,797
I'm looking down at
Pablo fucking Escobar.

413
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:47,403
For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.

414
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:50,739
What a monster he'd be.

415
00:42:51,564 --> 00:42:52,982
But here's the thing.

416
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,995
When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.

417
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:59,123
Just a man.

418
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:00,874
Beard grows if he doesn't shave.

419
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,571
Fat and shoeless.

420
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,538
You take a good long look at evil,
and it reminds you of one...

421
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,726
Long live Colombia.

422
00:43:19,476 --> 00:43:21,551
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

423
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:23,355
We killed Pablo Escobar!

424
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:26,275
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

425
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:29,695
-  Long live Colombia!
-  Long live Colombia!

426
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:53,927
Go ahead.

427
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,479
They killed Pablo Escobar!

428
00:45:31,108 --> 00:45:33,902
My son! My son...

429
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,260
I pray to God that other mothers

430
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:44,431
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

431
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:47,392
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

432
00:46:47,476 --> 00:46:50,521
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

433
00:46:50,604 --> 00:46:52,731
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

434
00:46:52,814 --> 00:46:55,108
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

435
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:58,362
He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.

436
00:46:58,445 --> 00:47:00,405
No one has paid attention to that.

437
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:04,618
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

438
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:08,330
 He was the noblest
of men. Not just as a son...

439
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,320
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

440
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:41,780
Thank you.

441
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:49,788
Talk to me.

442
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:55,377
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

443
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:58,505
He told you that?

444
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,325
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

445
00:48:05,053 --> 00:48:07,097
you were once associates and friends.

446
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:16,106
You were saying?

447
00:48:17,774 --> 00:48:22,320
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

448
00:48:24,364 --> 00:48:25,949
That you would forgive us.

449
00:48:27,409 --> 00:48:29,953
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

450
00:48:32,706 --> 00:48:35,626
How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?

451
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:38,295
In property? In cash?

452
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:44,342
I can find out.

453
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:49,514
That's good.

454
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:52,226
Because I want all of it.

455
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,765
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

456
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,145
You're the review board, right?

457
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,942
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

458
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:45,988
We're not the review board.

459
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:50,909
So who are you?

460
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,122
We're from Operations.

461
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:01,420
What do you want from me?

462
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:04,840
All right, gentlemen!

463
00:50:04,923 --> 00:50:06,508
Gentlemen!

464
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:12,336
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

465
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,599
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

466
00:50:14,683 --> 00:50:16,894
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

467
00:50:18,353 --> 00:50:20,564
311 metric tons.

468
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:25,861
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

469
00:50:25,944 --> 00:50:29,865
And when your rival no longer exists.

470
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:37,914
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

471
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:40,459
Now that piece of shit
is on his last leg.

472
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,544
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

473
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:44,963
And cocaine production goes up.

474
00:50:45,046 --> 00:50:48,132
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

475
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:50,552
but how well one has prepared for them.

476
00:50:50,635 --> 00:50:54,973
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

477
00:50:55,724 --> 00:50:57,726
Can you imagine what happens next year?

478
00:50:58,476 --> 00:51:02,855
 And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

479
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:06,234
We will do it covertly.

480
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,112
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

481
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:10,530
we'll no longer be there.

482
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:12,366
No, sir!

483
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,785
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

484
00:51:15,911 --> 00:51:18,497
Now the king is dead.
Long live the kings.

485
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:27,589
Agent Peña, how much do you know
about the Cali cartel?

486
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:44,395
