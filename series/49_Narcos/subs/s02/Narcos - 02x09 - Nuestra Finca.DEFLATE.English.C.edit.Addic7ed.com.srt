00:00:11,963 --> 00:00:15,134
_

3
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:35,257
Here to the right.

4
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:49,522
Stop.

5
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:55,319
Stay here.

6
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:08,666
Who's there?

7
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:14,755
Relax, sir. We come in peace.

8
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,048
Stay right there!

9
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,552
Relax.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,311
How are the cows?

11
00:01:55,838 --> 00:02:00,176
The cops came here... a few months ago.

12
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:01,844
What did you tell them?

13
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:04,096
The truth.

14
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:09,167
That I haven't seen you in years.

15
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:15,787
You've gotten old, Pablo.

16
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,986
It happens.

17
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:25,531
You look younger.

18
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,034
It happens.

19
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:33,623
Life in the country keeps you young.

20
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,629
Be careful, it's hot.

21
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,174
What's your name?

22
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:46,719
Limón, sir.

23
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:50,681
Don't give me that shit.
What's your real name?

24
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,808
- Jhon.
- Jhon.

25
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,268
Do you know how to milk a cow, Jhon?

26
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:58,647
- No, sir.
- Well, you better learn.

27
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,610
All right, gentlemen.

28
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,781
I get up at 5:00 a.m.

29
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,701
Good night.

30
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:13,287
Good night, Dad.

31
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,926
I read in a book somewhere
about a rich guy who goes broke.

32
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:56,431
When he's asked how it happened,
how he had lost everything, he answered:

33
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:02,229
"Slowly at first.
And then... all at once."

34
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:07,067
For Pablo Escobar,
"all at once" had finally come.

35
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:12,489
His empire in shambles,
his army all dead or in jail,

36
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:17,536
Escobar did the one thing
he could still do: a disappearing act.

37
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:21,248
One month, 14 days and seven hours...

38
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:25,835
with no sightings, no
intercepts, nothing.

39
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,006
While we waited
for his eventual reemergence,

40
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,968
the machine built to capture him
found itself idle.

41
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,672
And that brought
a different kind of danger.

42
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:40,225
One that comes
with too much time to think.

43
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,605
Some started to look inward
at the path we had taken to get here...

44
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:50,819
asking, "How much of this blood is on me,
and how do I get clean?"

45
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:54,490
It is the state, not individuals,

46
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:58,452
that has justice in its hands
and the legitimacy to use arms.

47
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,162
Under mounting political pressure,

48
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:03,290
Gaviria finally publicly denounced
Los Pepes.

49
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,877
And Los Pepes responded
with their own press release.

50
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,505
They said their job was done.

51
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:12,216
They were packing up and going home.

52
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:16,219
But Los Pepes wasn't something
you could turn on and off.

53
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,847
Its members were looking to the future.

54
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,630
One without Escobar.

55
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:23,000
And they each had
their own version of it.

56
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,563
Los Pepes had knocked Pablo
out of the narco business

57
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:30,609
and that had created a vacancy
for a new cocaine king of Medellín.

58
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:34,529
Or, depending on who you asked,
maybe a queen.

59
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,817
Gilberto's no longer
our partner. I don't care what he thinks.

60
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,946
Have you seen the news?

61
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,994
They issued a statement without us.

62
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,415
Los Pepes is done.

63
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,836
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

64
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,130
Hmm?

65
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,089
No one told me anything.

66
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,043
Listen to me, Berna.

67
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,805
If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

68
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:01,765
We don't need anybody else.

69
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,225
Start moving this product now.

70
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,144
That's all fine, Judy.

71
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,938
But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

72
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:13,068
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 million for Los Pepes?

73
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:15,446
I know where they are.

74
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:20,700
Be careful what you say.

75
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:24,246
That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

76
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,998
I'm not interested in the reward.

77
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:29,834
I'm interested in my labs.

78
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:33,922
Then at least tell Gilberto yourself.

79
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:40,929
 Sir?

80
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:45,809
Hello.

81
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,564
And to what do I owe
this lovely surprise?

82
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,733
We're at the warehouse in Manrique.

83
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,485
This place is full of product.

84
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:57,988
What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

85
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:02,158
Keep it. Think of it as a contribution
to your great cause

86
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,578
against the communists in the jungle.

87
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm sure you'll find its value
can be put to good use.

88
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,459
And what do we do about Judy?

89
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,836
Do whatever you think is best.

90
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,464
Well, Gilberto, if you say so.
Thank you very much.

91
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,471
Fidel. Gilberto said
we can keep all of it.

92
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:28,685
What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

93
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,772
We'll learn.

94
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:34,316
If they can, why not us?

95
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,611
And what about Judy? Hmm?

96
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,492
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

97
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:47,418
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

98
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,125
 Los Pepes may have disbanded,
but that didn't mean they were done.

99
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,880
The story of a vigilante army taking down
Escobar made for great headlines.

100
00:08:57,464 --> 00:09:01,593
And while no one was named, it's not
to say it wasn't cause for concern.

101
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:04,220
Yes, ma'am, as far as I know.

102
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,266
No, we're, uh, crystal clear on that.

103
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,726
Messina.

104
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:12,919
Yeah. Uh, he just got in.

105
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,362
- Hey, boss.
-  Murphy fill you in?

106
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:21,279
Yeah.

107
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,908
This article's getting more traction
than we thought.

108
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,453
International news outlets keep calling,
want a statement from the ambassador.

109
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,873
- Are we giving one?
- No. Nobody is.

110
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:32,082
But we're watching it closely.

111
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,959
I don't need to tell you
it could look very bad for us.

112
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,419
I want to make sure we're covered.

113
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:38,839
Well, Los Pepes is disbanded.
It's basically over.

114
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:43,093
Look, I tend to agree. But the press may
shake a few more trees, see what falls.

115
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,302
What if someone talks?

116
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:47,431
The only people that are gonna
talk about Los Pepes is Los Pepes.

117
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:49,391
And they're not talking.

118
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:51,434
So we're covered.

119
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:52,811
We better be.

120
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,523
- Fabian.
- Yes?

121
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,484
- Bring the Mercedes. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.

122
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,111
Hurry up, Berna.

123
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:06,241
Relax, Judy.
That meeting can't start without you.

124
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:07,826
Mmm-hmm.

125
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:10,245
How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

126
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:14,374
- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

127
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:16,125
Three in each.

128
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:20,296
- We need twice as many shifts.
- Yes, ma'am.

129
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:23,925
Oscar, Luis! Get in the cars.
The boss is leaving.

130
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:25,052
Yes, sir.

131
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,374
- Peña.
-  Javier.

132
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:00,545
- What do you want?
- Something happened, we need to talk.

133
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,131
I'm busy. I can't talk.

134
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,298
There's been an attempt on Judy.

135
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,122
She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

136
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,145
Give me time.

137
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:19,940
What's going on?

138
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,194
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

139
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,197
Where you going?

140
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,366
I just want to make sure.

141
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,706
Fuck it. I don't want to know.

142
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,384
- Peña.
- Mr. Peña has arrived.

143
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,014
Let's go. Search.

144
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:25,130
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

145
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:29,444
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

146
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,334
I'm not leaving.

147
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,930
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

148
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,019
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

149
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:51,573
Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

150
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,783
This is all your doing.

151
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:56,745
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

152
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,705
Don't call me again.

153
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,336
Berna, last I heard, leaking classified
intelligence is a federal offense.

154
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,631
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

155
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:09,216
that's killed innocent people.

156
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:14,387
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

157
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,183
Are you threatening me?

158
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:21,394
Yes, I'm threatening you.

159
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:30,070
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

160
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:33,448
What do you want?

161
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,241
You're a cop.

162
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:39,413
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

163
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:42,207
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes.

164
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,500
Arrest them.

165
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,380
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

166
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:53,259
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

167
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:05,647
We'll do it my way.

168
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:10,610
So you want Judy to be a rat?

169
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,361
I don't agree with this, Javier.

170
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,865
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

171
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:21,871
Berna... you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

172
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,250
Fuck your honor.

173
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,170
Says you.

174
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:32,883
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

175
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:36,011
And what have you done?

176
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,766
If you have a better idea, go for it.

177
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,725
Otherwise, this is the deal.

178
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:46,896
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

179
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,997
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

180
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:56,281
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

181
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:00,160
And you can go fuck yourself.

182
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,205
Best way to make a bad story go away

183
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:05,040
is to come up with a better story...

184
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,459
and sell it hard.

185
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:11,087
This is one of the cornerstones
of American foreign policy,

186
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:14,800
and one we learned through years
of trial and error in Latin America,

187
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:18,428
Chile, Guatemala, Panama.

188
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:21,014
Getting caught
with your pants down sucks,

189
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,641
but if at the same time
you give the folks a big win,

190
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:28,230
like, say, dismantling the second biggest
drug cartel in the world,

191
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:31,233
well, then nobody's paying attention
to the bad story.

192
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:33,610
They're too busy patting you on the back.

193
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,043
Risky plan? Yes.

194
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,972
But pressure will force
you to take risks.

195
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:41,326
It'll force you to do a lot of things.

196
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:44,078
We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

197
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:47,457
We don't even know where he is.

198
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,251
I don't know why
you're letting De Greiff come here.

199
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,128
He's coming to scare you.

200
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,870
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

201
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,510
You don't understand, do you?

202
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:03,932
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

203
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:06,893
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

204
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:10,521
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

205
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,024
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

206
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:14,775
They're going to give us their money?

207
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:22,120
No one is going to help us.

208
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:25,662
Everyone knows what that would mean.

209
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:40,134
Whatever he's doing...

210
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:45,765
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

211
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:48,518
Don't forget that.

212
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:20,383
Pablo? Pablo?
Can you hear me, Pablo? Please answer.

213
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:36,816
Tata, can you hear me?

214
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,696
Tata?

215
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:45,659
Can you hear me?

216
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:04,695
That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

217
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,534
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

218
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,828
Our donation to them is an advance.

219
00:19:12,912 --> 00:19:15,498
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

220
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:19,293
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

221
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:21,337
What a fucking joke,

222
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,674
the CIA and their war
against the communists.

223
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:29,553
It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

224
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:33,725
What? Any news about Judy?

225
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:37,401
The Castaños took
their first shot, a bomb.

226
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,670
But they didn't kill her.

227
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:42,191
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

228
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:43,523
What about her assistant?

229
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:46,511
The fat one, what do they call him?
Berna?

230
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:49,574
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

231
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:53,077
Don Berna. Him we found.

232
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,038
Where?

233
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:56,956
Here.

234
00:19:57,707 --> 00:19:59,334
Out front.

235
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:11,012
Don Berna!

236
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,432
Welcome to Cali.

237
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:18,269
Gilberto, thank you, brother.

238
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,188
Forgive us, but we weren't expecting you.

239
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,152
Don't worry about it.
I'm here to speak to you all.

240
00:20:26,986 --> 00:20:28,237
Very well, brother.

241
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,532
It's about Judy.

242
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:38,289
Where's Peña?

243
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:41,209
What do you need?

244
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,716
I got a tip. A guy.

245
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,509
He says he may have a lead, man.

246
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:55,014
Yeah, well, why don't you, uh,
give it to Martinez?

247
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:58,726
Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

248
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:01,896
He wants to give it to an American.

249
00:21:03,564 --> 00:21:06,525
Yeah, what's he got? Who is this guy?

250
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:07,985
He's a guy I know.

251
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,906
Come on, Murphy. He's safe.
He knows I work with you.

252
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,449
What, he doesn't trust you?

253
00:21:18,996 --> 00:21:20,164
All right. Bring him in.

254
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:22,208
He's in Bogotá.

255
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,545
So I gotta go to Bogotá
to meet your friend? Forget it.

256
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:28,506
Come on, Murphy.

257
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,633
You want Escobar, don't you?

258
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:34,554
Please, talk to him.

259
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,848
It's really important.

260
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,352
- All right. Set it up.
- Okay.

261
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,646
Thanks. You won't regret it.

262
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:45,815
In English, please!

263
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,743
Tata, are you there? Can you hear me?

264
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:23,853
Tata, are you there?

265
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:33,613
There's no signal here.
I don't know why you keep trying.

266
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,992
Why don't you come drink with us?

267
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,369
I'll be right there.

268
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:43,432
There's coffee in the Thermos.

269
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:09,249
He's communicating to his wife via radio.

270
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,544
Those are the codes and frequencies.

271
00:24:13,129 --> 00:24:14,797
Pablo is using a radio.

272
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,924
That's the way he communicates
with his wife.

273
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,802
And these are the codes, Murphy.

274
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:24,432
Yeah? Where did it come from
and how did you get it?

275
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:29,311
Lugo is a fiscal at the Tequendama.
He guards the family.

276
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:34,400
What do you want for this? Money? Visa?

277
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:37,236
What do you want, Lugo? Money? Visa?

278
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,403
It don't work that way, bud.

279
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:41,949
No visa, no money, you understand?

280
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,674
Is that what he thinks?

281
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:48,563
That everyone wants to go
to the United States?

282
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:51,071
I don't want anything.

283
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,219
All I want is for this to end soon

284
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:56,363
and you to understand
the family is in pain.

285
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,799
Find him and kill him.

286
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:13,106
So? What do you think?

287
00:25:18,903 --> 00:25:21,989
Javi, he's given us everything.
We got codes, frequencies.

288
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,992
- I think it's real.
- Take it to Martinez.

289
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:27,077
I'm at the embassy.
I gotta call you back.

290
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:29,163
What you doing at the embassy?
What's going on?

291
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:32,750
Nothing I can't handle.
I'll fill you in when I can.

292
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:36,045
- Javi, let's get on this.
- Murphy, take it to Martinez.

293
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:37,546
I'll call you later.

294
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:41,133
Peña's in Bogotá?

295
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:45,178
Yeah, Javi's into something. Shit.

296
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,851
I'll take the codes back.
You stay with Peña, okay?

297
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:50,810
No fucking way. The codes are staying
with me. I'll take it to Martinez.

298
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:58,901
We give Judy immunity,
take her testimony and we are covered.

299
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:00,694
Don't lie to me again, Peña.

300
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:07,743
This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

301
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:13,123
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

302
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,498
It's not intel anyone can provide.

303
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,419
She has leverage over you.

304
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,466
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

305
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,844
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

306
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:29,014
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

307
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:37,523
She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

308
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:39,942
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

309
00:26:40,943 --> 00:26:42,653
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

310
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,823
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

311
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,035
And Peña. Be discreet. Tell no one.

312
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,872
There are people in this building
who won't like it.

313
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,259
Going down?

314
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:17,855
So... how's it going?

315
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:45,925
What are you doing, Pablo?

316
00:27:46,008 --> 00:27:49,595
You don't know how to tie a knot.

317
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,065
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

318
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:40,604
Pablo Escobar.
Reward 2,700,000 pesos.

319
00:28:40,688 --> 00:28:45,109
Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.

320
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:51,198
In Bogotá, 222-50-12.
In Medellín, 461-11-11.

321
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:53,469
The kids would love to be here.

322
00:29:58,098 --> 00:29:59,933
I've been thinking...

323
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,773
I could buy some land here next to you.

324
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,906
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

325
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:19,328
And have my own farm.

326
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:34,551
We could run it together.

327
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,401
What do you think?

328
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,287
We need to finish putting up the wire.

329
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,222
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

330
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:26,228
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

331
00:31:27,604 --> 00:31:32,109
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

332
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:39,909
In the face of all that violence
and death, you were strong.

333
00:31:39,992 --> 00:31:42,398
You are a survivor.

334
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:45,288
A man of action.

335
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:50,627
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

336
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:55,090
- Good evening.
- Colonel.

337
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,467
Sit.

338
00:31:58,177 --> 00:32:01,930
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

339
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:04,725
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

340
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:07,019
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

341
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:11,189
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

342
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:12,232
Did you hear him?

343
00:32:13,942 --> 00:32:15,068
No, Colonel, not yet.

344
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:19,031
All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

345
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,659
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

346
00:32:22,743 --> 00:32:26,288
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

347
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:31,627
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

348
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,920
can you hear him?

349
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:38,592
No. The antenna is not that strong.

350
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:06,245
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

351
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,456
I wasn't paying that much attention.

352
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:12,751
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

353
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:19,508
So, what do you think?

354
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:24,012
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

355
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:29,851
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

356
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,152
Now hold on to the pig.

357
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:43,324
Fuck!

358
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:48,245
Funny that you don't like blood.

359
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:51,498
How strange.

360
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:54,334
What are you trying to say?

361
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:01,424
Clean yourself.

362
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:12,686
You know what's funny?

363
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:20,319
That my dad...

364
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:27,451
has no fucking idea who I am.

365
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:32,956
- I know very well who you are.
- Mmm.

366
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:39,296
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

367
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,547
Is that right?

368
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,800
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

369
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:46,470
- The United States? Disgusting.
- Mmm.

370
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,267
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

371
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:56,814
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

372
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:01,026
- So what? So what? So what?!
- So what?!

373
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:04,904
And what about you? What about you?!

374
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:13,246
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

375
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,124
On this shithole farm.

376
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:20,879
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

377
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,050
Not even one fucking
picture of them here.

378
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,555
Mmm.

379
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:32,641
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

380
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:35,977
That's right.

381
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:42,943
Now tell me...

382
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:45,779
Tell me...

383
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:50,242
what you think of me.

384
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,291
- Who cares?
- I do.

385
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:01,128
It's important to me.

386
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:08,176
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

387
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:12,472
But that's not possible, Pablo.

388
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:16,393
You chose your life!

389
00:36:17,227 --> 00:36:18,854
Be in charge of it.

390
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:23,233
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

391
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:27,237
I'm ashamed.

392
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:33,869
I think you're a murderer.

393
00:36:38,915 --> 00:36:40,959
At last, the truth.

394
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,340
At last, the truth.

395
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:51,219
A truth...

396
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:57,058
that breaks my heart.

397
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,899
Leave me alone.

398
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,810
Limón.

399
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,856
Yes, sir?

400
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,072
You like it here, right?

401
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,742
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

402
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:58,870
Peaceful.

403
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:04,835
Kneel down.

404
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,686
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

405
00:38:23,728 --> 00:38:27,649
Under that tree is a buried
case of money.

406
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:30,558
Go get it.

407
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:32,362
Are we leaving, boss?

408
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:34,740
Yes.

409
00:38:36,908 --> 00:38:37,742
Go on.

410
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,971
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

411
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:02,559
How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

412
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:05,895
Do you not realize that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

413
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:12,736
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

414
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:16,281
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

415
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:20,785
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

416
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:22,162
You're sorry?

417
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:25,329
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

418
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:29,711
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

419
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:31,754
But you can't help us find asylum.

420
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,554
That's bullshit!

421
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,015
They're going to...

422
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:44,392
...kill us all.

423
00:39:45,655 --> 00:39:47,479
Mama, what's wrong?

424
00:39:51,566 --> 00:39:52,984
Nothing, my love.

425
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:07,082
I'm sorry, Attorney General...

426
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:11,878
but I don't know what else to do.

427
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:23,056
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

428
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:25,058
Tell him to surrender.

429
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:30,646
The power of the law is your last hope.

430
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:33,817
Think about your children.

431
00:41:20,488 --> 00:41:21,948
Shit.

432
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:41,527
- No.
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

433
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:44,864
- Do you like it? Yes?
- No. No.

434
00:43:18,314 --> 00:43:19,649
Fuck.

435
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,736
Jhon. What are you doing here?

436
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:34,831
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

437
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:37,542
We spent it. It's gone.

438
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:40,461
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

439
00:43:44,507 --> 00:43:46,301
You've already hurt me.

440
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:49,429
You fucked up my life.

441
00:43:57,228 --> 00:44:00,607
I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

442
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:03,610
Hang on, Maritza.

443
00:44:21,377 --> 00:44:22,503
And this?

444
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:30,636
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

445
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,974
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

446
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:38,728
You lying... bitch! Get off!

447
00:44:38,811 --> 00:44:41,605
Motherfucker! Bastard!

448
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:45,443
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

449
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:49,238
Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.

450
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:52,492
What did you say?

451
00:44:54,702 --> 00:44:57,205
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

452
00:44:57,288 --> 00:45:00,708
I might! Why shouldn't I?

453
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,423
- What? So now you're a killer?
- Like your hero?

454
00:45:08,424 --> 00:45:09,926
Jhon!

455
00:45:10,885 --> 00:45:13,346
I know you! Get that shit out...

456
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:12,113
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

457
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:15,200
But I have bad news.

458
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:17,327
- What happened?
- Look.

459
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:27,586
It's rotten, sir.

460
00:46:38,473 --> 00:46:42,602
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

461
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:54,738
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

462
00:46:54,822 --> 00:46:57,325
There's about six thousand dollars.
I counted, boss.

463
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:10,922
Get your things. We're leaving.

464
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,635
 Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

465
00:47:15,718 --> 00:47:20,014
 Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

466
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:21,057
Where?

467
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,225
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

468
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:25,186
We've used it before.

469
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,897
Berna knows where.

470
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:30,107
I'll see you there.

471
00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:50,920
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

472
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,756
Let's go, Flaco.

473
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:03,182
She's on her way.

474
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:11,566
I know what you're thinking.

475
00:48:14,402 --> 00:48:17,655
I'm making a mistake.

476
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:22,827
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

477
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,372
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

478
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:27,623
Up here, Flaco.

479
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:44,391
I can't protect a rat.

480
00:49:01,908 --> 00:49:05,036
I didn't think you'd betray me.

481
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:08,622
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

482
00:49:09,749 --> 00:49:12,293
So now, you're going
to get on that plane.

483
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:15,296
And if I don't, what? What happens?

484
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:18,340
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

485
00:49:18,424 --> 00:49:20,468
And I won't protect you anymore.

486
00:49:51,832 --> 00:49:53,251
Tell me something.

487
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:56,587
Did Cali arrange this?

488
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:01,592
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

489
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:05,722
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

490
00:50:07,014 --> 00:50:11,227
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

491
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:15,064
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

492
00:50:15,773 --> 00:50:17,858
I only protected your life.

493
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:23,906
Relax. You'll have money.

494
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,243
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

495
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,997
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

496
00:50:32,373 --> 00:50:36,544
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

497
00:50:43,134 --> 00:50:44,844
Don't worry about a thing.

498
00:50:45,553 --> 00:50:51,225
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

499
00:51:14,206 --> 00:51:16,083
Hey, man. How's it going?

500
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:19,086
Everything good at the safe house?

501
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,965
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

502
00:51:24,592 --> 00:51:26,803
Reassigned. Headed home.

503
00:51:26,886 --> 00:51:30,890
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

504
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:33,225
Something about chain of command.

505
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:35,895
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

506
00:51:36,645 --> 00:51:41,859
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald  in, uh...

507
00:51:41,942 --> 00:51:43,861
oh, about five hours.

508
00:51:43,944 --> 00:51:47,906
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

509
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:52,203
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

510
00:51:54,997 --> 00:51:57,500
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

511
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,668
it won't be pointed in my direction.

512
00:52:01,128 --> 00:52:02,922
You should've stayed in your lane.

513
00:52:04,173 --> 00:52:05,216
Wow.

514
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:08,386
And Cali too, right?

515
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:11,597
They get a pass?

516
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:17,812
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

517
00:52:17,895 --> 00:52:19,230
Pay me?

518
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,901
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

519
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:27,112
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

520
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:32,702
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

521
00:52:33,744 --> 00:52:37,915
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

522
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,667
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

523
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:42,420
The laughs.

524
00:52:42,503 --> 00:52:44,463
Um... Oh.

525
00:52:44,547 --> 00:52:46,591
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

526
00:52:47,341 --> 00:52:48,661
I guess word about this

527
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:51,452
 Miami Herald  thing is spreading
like a prairie fire.

528
00:52:52,638 --> 00:52:53,848
And bring your passport.

529
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:56,725
I think you're going home, but...

530
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,103
you didn't hear that from me.

531
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:46,627
Tata?

532
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:53,425
Tata, can you hear me?

533
00:54:54,218 --> 00:54:55,553
 Pablo?

534
00:54:58,305 --> 00:54:59,974
It's me, my love.

535
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:03,060
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

536
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:05,313
I've missed you so much.

537
00:55:06,021 --> 00:55:08,023
Where have you been, Pablo?

538
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,113
I had to do something very important.

539
00:55:18,117 --> 00:55:20,536
But I'm back home, my love.

540
00:55:23,664 --> 00:55:25,666
I'm home.

541
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:42,210
