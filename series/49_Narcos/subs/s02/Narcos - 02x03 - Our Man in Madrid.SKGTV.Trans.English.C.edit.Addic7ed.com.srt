1
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:24,513
Pablo Escobar said, "Sometimes I'm God.

2
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,309
If I say a man dies,
he dies the same day."

3
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:35,273
In his career, this asshole
killed thousands of police officers

4
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:38,068
at a rate of over 400 a year.

5
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:42,823
With numbers like that staring you
in the face, you have to ask...

6
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,826
what possesses a man to put on a uniform

7
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:49,621
that all but
guarantees his days are numbered?

8
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,294
Most of them were just kids,

9
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:58,881
raised to reach a fork in the
road and choose the right path.

10
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,384
Fight for the good guys.

11
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:06,722
They were young,
they were full of hope...

12
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,725
and they thought they were invincible.

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,769
_

14
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,939
And those that were left behind
would feel their loss the most.

15
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,859
Everybody's got a breaking point,

16
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:22,112
when shit sickens them so much
that they just have to act.

17
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:28,619
For Pinzón, that
breaking point meant resignation.

18
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,663
_

19
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,894
But there were those
who couldn't resign,

20
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,983
who couldn't just walk away.

21
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,546
Presidents have breaking points, too.

22
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,176
And Gaviria had finally found his.

23
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,263
_

24
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:55,187

00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:57,940

00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:10,244

_

77
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,924
- We're safe!
- Pass me the ball.

78
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,926
- Here you go.
- Here it is.

79
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:45,472
_

80
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,268
_

81
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,105
_

82
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,151
_

83
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:07,118
_

84
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:17,545
_

85
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:49,035
_

86
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,372
_

87
00:09:56,793 --> 00:10:01,423
_

88
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:04,509
_

89
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:08,555
_

90
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:10,932
_

91
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:15,812
_

92
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:20,150
This is Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela.

93
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,776
And if you've never heard of him,

94
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,154
it's because that's exactly
the way he wants it.

95
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,699
Ask him what he does for a living
and he'll tell you that he's a banker,

96
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:29,325
and that would be true.

97
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,537
In fact, he and his brother Miguel
controlled their own bank.

98
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,540
Or he might tell you that he
and his brother owned and operated

99
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,334
one of Colombia's
largest chains of drug stores.

100
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,987
The brothers could also tell you they

101
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,988
ran their own soccer
team. Which they did.

102
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:46,634
América de Cali, one of
the best teams on the continent

103
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:49,929
and a fierce rival of Pablo's
Atlético Nacional.

104
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,018
But what they'd never tell you is
that these businesses were a front

105
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,978
and that the Rodríguez brothers

106
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,856
were the second biggest
cocaine traffickers in the world:

107
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,109
the leaders of the Cali cartel.

108
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:06,279
Like Pablo and the Medellín cartel,

109
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,949
they started out as run-of-the-mill
criminals, bank robbers.

110
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,577
And with all that money
they scored from their heists,

111
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,205
they quickly
graduated to smuggling weed.

112
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,082
And when they realized
that ten pounds of blow

113
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,210
was worth as much as a ton of marijuana,

114
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,213
they jumped headfirst
into the cocaine business.

115
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:26,174
These guys were no
piece of shit street dealers.

116
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:30,553
They planned meticulously,
maximizing profit, minimizing risk.

117
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:34,015
As the business grew, a young
ambitious Colombian kid,

118
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:38,520
a guy you might know named
Pacho Herrera, was such a good earner

119
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:41,397
that the brothers eventually
promoted him to partner.

120
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:46,069
But they had a competitor,
and not just any competitor.

121
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,610
One that wasn't interested in

122
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,847
abdicating the
throne as the king of coke.

123
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:52,867
- Don Pablo.
- But Gilberto was smart.

124
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,953
He didn't care that Escobar
wore the crown.

125
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:55,995
_

126
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,666
So they went to him with a proposal, Miami,
the cocaine capital of the world,

127
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,837
would remain Pablo's territory,
and in return, the Rodríguez brothers

128
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,423
would make do with a little territory
in the northeast called New York City.

129
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:10,677
The extra 1,089 miles may have made it

130
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,389
a little harder to get to, but it
turns out the folks in New York

131
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:18,476
were just as head over heels
for cocaine as the folks down south.

132
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,479
And while there were
1.8 million people in Miami,

133
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:23,815
there were seven million
in New York City.

134
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:28,444
As much as the Cali guys loved money
and the finer things in life,

135
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:30,613
they hated the wrong kind of attention.

136
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,699
For the "Gentlemen of Cali," it was

137
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,225
about appearing like legitimate
businessmen.

138
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,581
And business was good. But that didn't
mean that it couldn't get better.

139
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:43,751
_

140
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:48,172
_

141
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:51,885
_

142
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:55,179
_

143
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:57,515
_

144
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:03,688
_

145
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:08,735
_

146
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:12,572
_

147
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,741
_

148
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:16,868
_

149
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:20,496
_

150
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,708
_

151
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,589
_

152
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:34,802
_

153
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:41,976
_

154
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,437
_

155
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,273
_

156
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,276
_

157
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,655
_

158
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:56,699
_

159
00:13:56,783 --> 00:14:00,745
_

160
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:04,165
_

161
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:09,253
_

162
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,297
_

163
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,967
_

164
00:14:14,884 --> 00:14:20,598
_

165
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:22,600
_

166
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:30,024
_

167
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:34,028
_

168
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:38,533
_

169
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,994
_

170
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:43,496
_

171
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:48,167
_

172
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:51,212
_

173
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:55,300
This was one thing that the Cali
guys and the DEA could agree on.

174
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,636
As controversial as
Colonel Carrillo's methods were,

175
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,681
he was the only guy
that Escobar was afraid of.

176
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,808
And returning command
of Search Bloc to him

177
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:06,102
was exactly what we needed.

178
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:10,189
The president has offered us every available
resource to defeat Escobar.

179
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,275
All we have to do now
is manage it properly.

180
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,777
So I'm still gonna rely
on intelligence from you.

181
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:18,448
But we're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

182
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,056
No more large-scale operations.

183
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,392
Search Bloc goes back
to small-scale tactics.

184
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,662
- Amen.
- Stealth operations, surprise raids,

185
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:26,873
that sort of thing. We change the game.

186
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,960
But there's one thing that we
need to do first. Trujillo.

187
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:35,798
_

188
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:38,676
_

189
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:44,932
A hundred men? That's not exactly
small-scale tactics.

190
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,728
First thing is, we let Pablo
know that we're back.

191
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:57,570
[Steve] Now you can bet that
the second a convoy of a hundred men

192
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,073
and six marked police
trucks leave that base,

193
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:03,284
that Escobar's army of spotters
would be burning up the phone lines

194
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,953
just to tell Escobar all about it.

195
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:09,248
_

196
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:13,294
_

197
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,298
And you'd be right.
But that was the point.

198
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:21,010
You see, these spotters made it
impossible for us to operate

199
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,221
in the secrecy we required.

200
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:25,306
So we needed to blind them.

201
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,811
And the first step to blinding
someone is getting them to open their eyes.

202
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:34,357
_

203
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,526
Probably this rooftop here.

204
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:39,570
Once those signals went
up, we could pick them up,

205
00:16:39,654 --> 00:16:42,031
get a fix and get a
location of each one.

206
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,369
_

207
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,051
_

208
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,264
_

209
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:09,642
And I guess you could say that the
second part of Carrillo's plan

210
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,728
was to show Pablo that
the sheriff was back in town.

211
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,773
And he did that the best way he could.

212
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:26,576
_

213
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:30,037
_

214
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:32,707
_

215
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,585
_

216
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:41,090
_

217
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:44,635
_

218
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,765
_

219
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:55,855
_

220
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,816
_

221
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:01,611
_

222
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:09,285
Hmm.

223
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,830
_

224
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:20,046
_

225
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,050
_

226
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:31,641
Hmm.

227
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:56,916
_

228
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:58,751
_

229
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,795
- We got 'em.
- Keeps going like that

230
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:04,507
until you reached Barrio Pablo
Escobar. We captured six radio transmissions.

231
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,385
But we haven't pinpointed
the exact location.

232
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,595
- No, sir.
- So our best bet

233
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,224
is to corner each of these buildings.
This time, we hit the ground.

234
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:19,647
_

235
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,359
_

236
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,652
_

237
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,487
Peña, you're with me.

238
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:29,657
Murphy, Jacoby, you stay
here to guide us.

239
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,286
Careful out there.

240
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:50,678
_

241
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,267
_

242
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,893
_

243
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,478
_

244
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:01,856
Oh, we got one. Spotter One is down.

245
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:07,445
_

246
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,909
_

247
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:18,831
_

248
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,458
_

249
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:22,668
_

250
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,086
_

251
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,632
_

252
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,134
_

253
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,511
_

254
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:44,523
_

255
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:49,987
_

256
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:54,617
_

257
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:23,604
_

258
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:28,192
_

259
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:34,699
_

260
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:38,327
- _
- Shut up, kid.

261
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,083
_

262
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:49,714
_

263
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:52,550
_

264
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:57,096
_

265
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:03,519
_

266
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:10,901
_

267
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,946
_

268
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,787
_

269
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,539
_

270
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:27,001
_

271
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:51,150
_

272
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,611
_

273
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,120
_

274
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,044
_

275
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:16,467
_

276
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,302
_

277
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,222
_

278
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:45,120
_

279
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:46,789
_

280
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,582
_

281
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:51,252
_

282
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:53,921
_

283
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:57,258
_

284
00:23:57,341 --> 00:23:59,301
_

285
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:02,263
_

286
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:10,396
_

287
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,189
_

288
00:24:14,316 --> 00:24:17,027
_

289
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:19,196
_

290
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:23,284
_

291
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:44,013
- _
- Tata.

292
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:47,516
_

293
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:50,060
_

294
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:53,397
_

295
00:24:57,067 --> 00:25:00,904
_

296
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,452
_

297
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:23,510
_

298
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:28,766
_

299
00:26:01,423 --> 00:26:03,300
_

300
00:26:07,638 --> 00:26:09,682
_

301
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:14,520
_

302
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,147
_

303
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:22,027
_

304
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,294
Javi, where are the fucking spotters?

305
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,214
Carrillo went a different way.
He, uh... he cut them loose.

306
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:44,091
Oh, we're letting people go now?

307
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:46,969
Yeah, Murphy, we're letting people go.

308
00:26:48,011 --> 00:26:49,638
And what does that mean?

309
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,891
- Don't worry about it, man.
- Hey, fucking talk to me.

310
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,728
- Let go of my fucking arm.
- What the fuck happened?

311
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:01,900
Carrillo put a gun to the
kid's head and he pulled the trigger.

312
00:27:03,694 --> 00:27:05,487
To make a fucking point.

313
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,033
We good now?

314
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,206
Yeah, we're good.

315
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:26,759
_

316
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,179
_

317
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:33,098
_

318
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:38,812
_

319
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:51,533
_

320
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,744
_

321
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,797
_

322
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,089
_

323
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:25,776
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened tonight.

324
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:30,239
- What do you think happened?
- I know I got left behind on purpose.

325
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:31,740
For your own best interest.

326
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:34,701
You don't know a goddamn thing
about my best interest.

327
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:38,122
You know, Murphy, what happens
out there isn't really for everyone.

328
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,998
- But it is for Peña?
- You're not Peña.

329
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:42,167
- 'Cause I'm a damn gringo.
- Because I trust him.

330
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:43,877
Why don't you try me?

331
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:47,506
This fight against Escobar,
you want to win it.

332
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:50,968
These guys aren't fighting by the
same rules, so why should we?

333
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,681
- You know what that means?
- Oh, I do.

334
00:28:56,682 --> 00:29:01,562
So whether this is about protecting me
or protecting you, stop icing me out.

335
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:14,741
_

336
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,293
_

337
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:30,257
_

338
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,928
_

339
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:40,601
_

340
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:42,811
_

341
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:45,856
_

342
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,788
_

343
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:09,755
_

344
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:15,052
_

345
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,827
_

346
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:43,664
_

347
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,552
_

348
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:02,099
_

349
00:31:02,182 --> 00:31:03,433
_

350
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,939
_

351
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:13,277
_

352
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:16,196
_

353
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:22,077
_

354
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:26,081
_

355
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:29,960
_

356
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:32,713
_

357
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:38,468
_

358
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:54,568
_

359
00:31:56,486 --> 00:31:58,613
_

360
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:01,199
_

361
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:09,708
_

362
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:15,964
Peña.

363
00:32:16,048 --> 00:32:19,760
_

364
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:22,971
_

365
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:26,600
_

366
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:35,025
_

367
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:37,778
_

368
00:32:37,861 --> 00:32:40,280
_

369
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:43,575
_

370
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:47,662
_

371
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:51,375
_

372
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:54,920
_

373
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:00,801
_

374
00:33:00,884 --> 00:33:03,970
_

375
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:05,472
_

376
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:15,649
_

377
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,903
_

378
00:33:19,986 --> 00:33:23,240
_

379
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:29,371
_

380
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:31,790
_

381
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:36,086
This is Moncada's biggest lab.

382
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,089
It'll have to be inventoried
before it's dismantled and moved.

383
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:40,715
How you know that?

384
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,719
- One of my CI's.
- Hell of a tip.

385
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:46,054
It's a hell of a CI.

386
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:48,432
Look, you want
Escobar's men, there they are.

387
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:50,725
- Let's do it.
- All right.

388
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,506
Get up! Move! Move!

389
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,860
Get up!

390

394
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:43,672
Your CI hooked us a pretty big fish.

395
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,048
Yeah, he's a winner.

00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:50,595
Wonder if he'll give us Escobar.

00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,391
- Don't know, we'll see what Carrillo gets.
- Yeah. We'll see.

399
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:02,315
Carrillo told me that he talked to
you. He thinks he can trust you.

400
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:04,067
Yeah, he can.

401
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,989
- That's not what I mean.
- Ahh.

00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:11,491
Let's go.

403
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,327
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

408
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,166
- You get anything out of him?
- Something.

409
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,960
Not everything. Are you coming?

410
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:09,090
I'm in, yeah. Let's go.
