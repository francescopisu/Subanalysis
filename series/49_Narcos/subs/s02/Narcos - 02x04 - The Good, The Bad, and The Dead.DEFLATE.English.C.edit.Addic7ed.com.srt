00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,130
_

3
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,109
Tata.

4
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:28,043
Tata. Where is everyone?

5
00:01:44,058 --> 00:01:45,226
Pablo.

6
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,983
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

7
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,526
I'm all right.

8
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,154
Go back to bed.

9
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:55,022
Do you know why they brought you there?

10
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:59,235
He said they were going to send a message
to other kids.

11
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:03,197
Who is "he"? Do you remember his name?

12
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:05,950
Colonel Carrillo.

13
00:04:08,077 --> 00:04:09,954
I know this is difficult...

14
00:04:10,746 --> 00:04:13,499
but tell me what happened
when they brought you there.

15
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:17,920
They killed my friend.

16
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,340
-  I'm very sorry...
- This is a farce.

17
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:23,843
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

18
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,470
Whether he did or didn't do it
is beside the point.

19
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,056
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

20
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,684
Besides, Valeria Velez?

21
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,103
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

22
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,606
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

23
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,886
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo,

24
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,275
they'll believe us.

25
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:47,450
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo about this...

26
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,368
They'll assume it's the truth.

27
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,453
Exactly.

28
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:01,422
What do you propose?

29
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:04,175
That we don't play Escobar's game.

30
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:07,678
And that we leave things as they are...
for the time being.

31
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,644
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

32
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:18,773
- No, no, no. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest...

33
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:21,192
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

34
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:26,864
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it ever happened,

35
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:29,868
and the American news
hasn't even picked up the story.

36
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,453
Of course.

37
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:36,416
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

38
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:42,046
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

39
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:44,966
- Of course.
- Right?

40
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:52,765
Hmm.

41
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:55,851
Hmm.

42
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:01,482
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

43
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:06,071
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared for his life.

44
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:09,001
The world has to know
what sort of monster

45
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:10,806
that son of a bitch Carrillo is.

46
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,500
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

47
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:18,081
Give me that pencil.

48
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:25,048
When Pablo Escobar starts believing

49
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,344
the pen's mightier than the sword...
you know you're getting to him.

50
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:38,519
Carrillo's attacks on Pablo's facilities
in Medellín were putting him

51
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:40,730
- under more and more pressure.
- Burn everything.

52
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,192
The way Carrillo saw it...

53
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:49,947
...each sicario we took out
got us one step closer to Escobar.

54
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,744
Don't move! Felix, take this one.

55
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:58,164
Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

56
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,817
While everyone could agree

57
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:05,487
it felt good emptying Pablo's pockets...

58
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:07,798
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

59
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:12,970
...they weren't all sold on the method.

60
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,477
Is it true?

61
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:21,248
- Not to my knowledge.
- Don't play word games with me.

62
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,898
If that kid's telling the truth,
Peña and Murphy were there.

63
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,317
They're the only Americans
that asshole trusts.

64
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,532
I find it hard to believe that Colonel
Carrillo would want American witnesses.

65
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,822
Exactly what he wants.

66
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:35,709
Guarantees they won't say shit if people
start asking questions. And guess what?

67
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,003
People are asking questions.

68
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:44,217
Look, if Carrillo wants
to walk out in the streets

69
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:47,846
and gun down every sicario in Medellín,
God bless him.

70
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,421
But our guys can't be
there when he does it.

71
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,126
Understood?

72
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:55,729
Understood.

73
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,773
It's been quiet for about a week.
Nothing of significance.

74
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:02,527
But a phone we connected to Edgar Prisco
popped up three times last night.

75
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:05,489
All within Manrique,
the same three-block vicinity here.

76
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:08,366
They just can't fucking help themselves,
can they?

77
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,549
My men did a drive-by early this morning

78
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,228
and identified a potential location.

79
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,748
Right here. The pool hall.

80
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:37,062
Are we having a good time?

81
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:46,546
That's a very pretty girl.

82
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,890
But you're paying for
those lines, asshole.

83
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,582
Clean this shit up!

84
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:02,046
Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

85
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:10,262
Wake up, asshole! And you, Edgar!

86
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:14,891
Call Pablo and ask him
where he wants us to take his half.

87
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:17,185
All right. All right.

88
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,174
What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

89
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,984
- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

90
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,443
What?

91
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:28,447
- Have you been calling from this phone?
- No.

92
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,033
Son of a...

93
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,019
Move it, faggot!

94
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:11,573
Where you going?

95
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,547
Hey, there.

96
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:41,561
Murphy! Not a good neighborhood
to get yourself lost in, eh?

97
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,272
Fuck.

98
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,926
Shh, shh, shh.

99
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,012
Dad.

100
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,724
- Quickly, inside.
- Friend.

101
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,394
Calm down, friend.

102
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:10,651
Everything is all right.

103
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:13,529
Fuck.

104
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:17,324
Murphy! Gavera 37!
You need to get up here!

105
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,538
Murphy, get in the car.

106
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,710
The fuck were you thinking?

107
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:38,094
This fucking close.

108
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:42,390
We were definitely getting closer.

109
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:45,352
And so who could blame
the "Gentlemen of Cali"

110
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:49,314
for starting to think about a future
without Pablo Escobar?

111
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:55,570
I can't believe it. You son of a bitch.

112
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,155
It's carbon rock.

113
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:00,825
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

114
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:05,038
Did you think I bought chemistry labs
because I enjoyed the class in school?

115
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,874
You're going
to put chemists out of business.

116
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,003
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

117
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,257
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

118
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:20,095
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

119
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:25,142
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's in hiding.

120
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:29,062
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

121
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:32,482
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

122
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:34,609
Could you take care of that?

123
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,237
Yes, of course.

124
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:41,533
But don't make it too obvious.

125
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,497
I don't want Judy Moncada asking fucking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

126
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,666
Then you should call Pablo

127
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:55,630
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

128
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:58,186
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

129
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:15,775
Guys.

130
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,490
The Search Bloc took
another Moncada lab.

131
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:24,200
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

132
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:25,785
Ricardo got away.

133
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:27,704
- When was this?
- Last night.

134
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:32,667
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

135
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:35,337
Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

136
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,340
Since when do we hide, brother? Huh?

137
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,760
Let's trust the boss.

138
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:45,263
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

139
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:54,898
- Hello? Who is this?
- Get me Don Pablo. Fernando Duque.

140
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,316
- Fernando.
- Get him now.

141
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,861
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

142
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:08,995
Boss?

143
00:15:09,913 --> 00:15:11,831
Your lawyer, Mr. Duque.

144
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:18,088
- How many were published?
-  Don Pablo,

145
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:21,800
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

146
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,680
How many of my letters were published,
Fernando?

147
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:30,141
Yes. Uh, none.

148
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,727
They're very, very well written.

149
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:35,714
It's not about how well
written they were, Fernando.

150
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:39,216
It was the fucking truth!

151
00:15:53,123 --> 00:15:55,226
If it seemed like Escobar's world

152
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,359
was crashing down around him,

153
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,463
it was actually about to get worse.

154
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,175
Remember when Pablo collaborated
with M-19 communists

155
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,470
during the Palace of Justice siege?

156
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,724
By doing that,
he pissed off the Autodefensas...

157
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,852
an extreme right-wing paramilitary group

158
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:16,688
that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.

159
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:21,025
This is why
we saw ourselves forced to take up arms

160
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,610
and defend ourselves...

161
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:26,114
The leaders of the Autodefensas
were the Castaño brothers:

162
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:27,782
Fidel and Carlos.

163
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,285
Carlos is the one
barking orders at people.

164
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,455
In the late 70s, their father, Jesús,

165
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:37,000
a prominent landowner,
was kidnapped by the FARC guerrillas

166
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,211
who demanded 50 million pesos
for his ransom.

167
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,298
But his sons were
only able to come up with 16.

168
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,801
Well, that didn't cut it.

169
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:49,554
So the guerrillas
beat the elder Castaño to death.

170
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:54,309
From that day forward, the right-wing,

171
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:58,021
psychopathic, commie-killing
Castaño brothers

172
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,899
swore never to rest
until their father was avenged...

173
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:07,572
...and every last guerrilla
driven from the countryside was killed.

174
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:11,993
Move it, you sons of bitches!

175
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:14,920
Even innocent villagers

176
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,565
who simply lived in
guerrilla strongholds

177
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:21,086
were put to death because
they lived under communist subjugation.

178
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:28,676
And in their efforts to wipe out
the communist guerrillas...

179
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,557
the Castaños caught the attention
of some like-minded friends.

180
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:38,603
- Mr. Stechner.
- Good to see you, my friend.

181
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:41,856
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

182
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,817
All right. Very good.

183
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:50,281
These weapons
are better than the last ones.

184
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:51,199
They should be.

185
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:54,494
Thank you, Mr. Green, for the continued
support of your country.

186
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:58,206
I haven't used that name
since the School of the Americas.

187
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:02,377
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

188
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,005
We will not stop
until the last communist is dead.

189
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,715
Another struggle is emerging.

190
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:14,138
One that is essential to our, uh...
shared cause.

191
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:16,307
Escobar.

192
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,726
Escobar deserves to die.

193
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,439
But our fight is here in the jungle,
against the guerrilla.

194
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:26,901
Yes, and Pablo's still
strong in Medellín.

195
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:30,154
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

196
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:38,408
An alliance is forming...

197
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,523
with the objective of
taking out Escobar.

198
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,709
Who?

199
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,128
Rival elements from the
trafficking world.

200
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:50,341
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

201
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:54,387
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

202
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,182
And that strategic Colombian resources
and revenue streams...

203
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,185
don't fall into the wrong hands.

204
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,065
Guys.

205
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,734
Ms. Judy.

206
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:58,618
All right, now... I would like
to know the reason for this meeting.

207
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:02,455
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

208
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,582
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

209
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,454
We know you all joined
forces against him.

210
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:13,266
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

211
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:17,751
Why? What do you want out of this?

212
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,641
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

213
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:25,102
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

214
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:30,566
is also allied with the guerrillas,
whom he has helped on many occasions.

215
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:34,695
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is a patriotic act.

216
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:38,741
Imagine, Pacho, your financial resources

217
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:44,247
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

218
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,126
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

219
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,095
No, no, no, Mrs. Moncada. No.
A death squad?

220
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,407
No. An army.

221
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,635
And when this army gets to Medellín,

222
00:20:57,719 --> 00:21:00,597
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

223
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,576
It'll be a matter of weeks.

224
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:05,092
What do you say, Pacho?

225
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:09,147
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

226
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,232
All of this sounds interesting.

227
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:22,879
With all due respect, gentlemen,

228
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:26,205
our organization already has
an strategy in place,

229
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,120
and it's working.

230
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:30,671
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

231
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:34,547
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

232
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,259
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

233
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:46,934
Look, I'll share this conversation
with our partners.

234
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:50,772
But I think that, for now,
our answer is no.

235
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,026
Excuse me.

236
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,007
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

237
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,967
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

238
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:24,388
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

239
00:22:24,472 --> 00:22:26,641
He's back there, looking for you.

240
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:33,439
If he finds out I'm here, he'll want
to kill me too. Let's talk. Relax.

241
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,173
Because of you,

242
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:38,469
I'll never be able to
go back to Medellín.

243
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:39,349
Maritza!

244
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,482
Because of you, my daughter
and I have to live in hiding.

245
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,032
Relax, relax, relax!

246
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,253
I really am sorry,
and I'm here because I want to help you.

247
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:51,624
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around in your taxi?

248
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:54,794
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

249
00:22:54,877 --> 00:22:57,492
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

250
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,175
You killed me, Jhon.

251
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:03,843
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

252
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:08,850
You knew how badly I needed that money
and you took advantage of that.

253
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,103
I really am sorry, Maritza.

254
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:14,605
Believe me, I think I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

255
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:15,690
What is it?

256
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:19,527
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

257
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:28,077
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

258
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,258
I'm the one who drives Escobar.

259
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,883
I know when his sicarios
aren't with him.

260
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,876
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on here?

261
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:37,753
Mom, go back inside. Go inside.

262
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,717
Doña Liliana.

263
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,970
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

264
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:49,515
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

265
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,642
so you can leave with your daughter.

266
00:23:56,814 --> 00:24:01,027
And you? What do you get out of this?

267
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,989
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

268
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:06,407
I'm afraid.

269
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:12,914
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

270
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:59,794
All right. My turn.

271
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:01,629
Mmm.

272
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:04,382
You both look beautiful.

273
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:13,975
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

274
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:33,953
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

275
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:39,083
Velasco told me.

276
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:07,903
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

277
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:13,242
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

278
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:16,662
Let's see.

279
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:19,707
How do you hold it?

280
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:33,912
What?

281
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,332
Are you sure you want to laugh at
your wife while she's holding a gun?

282
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:41,682
- It's not a joke, Pablo.
- Tata.

283
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:45,983
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

284
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:50,316
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

285
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:55,774
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

286
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:07,046
All right.

287
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,885
But I think you need
more practice with that.

288
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:38,077
- Javi, it's Gabriela.
- What's up?

289
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,950
It's been a while and I want to see you.

290
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:40,686
Now?

291
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:43,874
I can't right now. I'm working.

292
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,794
Don't be like that.

293
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:58,305
All right. Give me...
20 minutes, all right?

294
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:02,059
Get the lecture from Messina
about not leaving base?

295
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:03,144
Yeah.

296
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:06,606
Crosby must've really laid into her
on that one.

297
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:20,244
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

298
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,582
Okay, I guess it means "Fuck that."

299
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:28,419
Hello.

300
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,423
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

301
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:36,510
- Javi... Javi, Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

302
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:40,973
Hello.

303
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:43,017
Hi.

304
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,894
She's a friend of a friend.

305
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:48,189
Maritza, meet Javier.

306
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:51,358
And...

307
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,738
why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

308
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,574
She's in trouble.

309
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,327
Just hear her out.

310
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,173
Goddammit, Gabby.

311
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:04,873
You could have told me
over the phone, no?

312
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,749
- I knew you wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

313
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,667
- Bye!
- No, no, no.

314
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:11,545
Wait. It's important.

315
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:13,923
Please.

316
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:16,342
Hear her out.

317
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,269
What's your name? Maritza?

318
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,362
What kind of trouble are you in?

319
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,406
Who are you in trouble with?

320
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:45,162
- La Quica.
- La Quica. You know La Quica?

321
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,252
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

322
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:53,587
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

323
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,509
Why does he want to kill you?

324
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,513
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

325
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:12,648
And how are you going to do that?

326
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:17,027
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

327
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:25,619
Her name is Maritza Rincón.

328
00:30:25,703 --> 00:30:28,872
She works at the market across from
the brothel where the girls were killed.

329
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:31,250
Where we almost had La Quica
and the other guy...

330
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:34,962
Jhon Burgos. Goes by "Limón."

331
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:39,008
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

332
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:42,970
This girl Maritza was actually
in the back seat serving as a cover

333
00:30:43,053 --> 00:30:44,972
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

334
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,808
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

335
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:54,940
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

336
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:57,860
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

337
00:30:57,943 --> 00:30:59,903
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

338
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:03,198
Makes sense for La Quica to hire someone
the police didn't know about.

339
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:05,576
What does she want out of this?
A ticket to Disneyland?

340
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:08,120
She knows she doesn't get shit
if it doesn't pan out.

341
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:10,569
If this is true,

342
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:13,650
she can tell us when Limón
and Escobar go somewhere.

343
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:19,840
You were there. You trust her?

344
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:23,761
Yeah.

345
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:26,388
Yeah, I do.

346
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:38,025
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

347
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:39,276
Let's go.

348
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:45,157
- All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

349
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,664
Can you explain this?

350
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:57,795
A subpoena.

351
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:01,840
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

352
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:05,010
You mean your witch hunt.

353
00:32:06,387 --> 00:32:09,765
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

354
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:14,395
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

355
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:19,149
How many times do I have to tell you
that I don't know how Escobar escaped?

356
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,486
He must have paid someone off.

357
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:26,532
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

358
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:34,164
This is about transparency, truth, law.

359
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:39,586
And I sense from your
reluctance to speak

360
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,550
that the truth will not be kind to you
or our esteemed president.

361
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:52,599
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

362
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:56,311
I must confess that we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

363
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:59,648
but we're talking about
a national crisis.

364
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:06,196
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

365
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,035
Look, sir...
I ask you to please trust me.

366
00:33:14,663 --> 00:33:17,374
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

367
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:23,088
is destroying the life of a very good
human being. Our president.

368
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:28,135
Well, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

369
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:43,484
Hello?

370
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:45,444
Hello, Maritza. It's me.

371
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,823
- I spoke with Peña.
- Pay attention.

372
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:54,369
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant.

373
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:59,184
He lives in the south. I need you
to give the Americans the address.

374
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,816
Understand?

375
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:05,088
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

376
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:10,677
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

377
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,097
But I need you to trust me.

378
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:17,768
Give me the address.

379
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:19,645
Write it down.

380
00:34:21,104 --> 00:34:24,983
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

381
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:29,780
Got it.

382
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:45,504
...my love. Do it again.

383
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:48,966
I'm sorry, boss.
You'll be late to your appointment.

384
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:51,093
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

385
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:55,514
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

386
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:09,463
Everything all right, boss?

387
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:26,563
Peña.

388
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:31,234
9th Street. 98-3.

389
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:33,487
Okay. Got it.

390
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:39,993
I need to know
if there's activity around this address.

391
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:42,454
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

392
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,039
Okay. You got it.

393
00:37:05,644 --> 00:37:06,870
This was recorded about

394
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:08,379
- five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

395
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,439
Let me clean it up.

396
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:17,572
All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.

397
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:19,366
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

398
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:21,576
- Yeah.
- You two are staying here.

399
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,578
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

400
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,712
Crosby finds out you
went on another raid,

401
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:26,480
we all get a ticket home.

402
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,846
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

403
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:30,544
It's not negotiable.

404
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,258
We'll be in radio contact.

405
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:40,095
Jesus.

406
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:54,109
We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

407
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:55,527
Yes, Colonel.

408
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,864
Attention! We're headed out!

409
00:38:27,476 --> 00:38:29,227
We're on San Juan.

410
00:38:29,311 --> 00:38:31,938
Copy that. Watch your six, guys.

411
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:34,608
How's it looking out there?

412
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:36,461
Everything's calm.

413
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:39,303
Murphy, you're buying
the drinks tonight.

414
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:42,157
Cheap bastards.

415
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:45,952
Don't forget to pick me and Peña up
some cigars on the way.

416
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,205
Of course, blondie.

417
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,637
Reverse!

418
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:06,181
Look above!

419
00:39:08,183 --> 00:39:09,351
It's an ambush!

420
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:14,648
Sabada!

421
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:18,151
Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

422
00:39:23,824 --> 00:39:25,325
Son of a bitch!

423
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:28,036
Goddamn it, speak to me!
We need people there.

424
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,120
Carrillo!

425
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:34,167
Go, go, go! Come on!

426
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:47,889
Fuck!

427
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:25,969
Look at me.

428
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,933
Look at me.

429
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:48,116
You asked a child to give me this.

430
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,797
You can have it back.

431
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:10,347
And this...

432
00:41:12,057 --> 00:41:14,851
is for my cousin, Gustavo.

433
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:18,521
Coward.

434
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:20,106
Son of a bitch.

435
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:35,432
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

436
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:41,271
I'll go back to Bogotá
with the body until the funeral.

437
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:44,941
They call his wife?

438
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:47,068
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

439
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:52,490
This ain't on you, Javi.
It's on Escobar.

440
00:42:52,574 --> 00:42:54,910
And one way or another, he pays.

441
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:59,706
We all do. Right?

442
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,258
This isn't your fault, Peña.

443
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:54,719
- No?
- No.

444
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:03,019
- I got played.
- We all got played.

445
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:06,022
We all had the information,
it was backed up by Centra Spike...

446
00:44:06,106 --> 00:44:07,148
Stop.

447
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:10,860
Just...

448
00:44:14,697 --> 00:44:16,282
You know, you coming here...

449
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:21,371
you say all the right things.

450
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,752
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

451
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:37,512
Colonel Carrillo's funeral
will be tomorrow.

452
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:43,518
I don't do funerals.

453
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:09,229
They're saying
that Pablo himself killed Carrillo.

454
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:11,272
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

455
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:16,903
Or me, or you, Pacho.

456
00:46:16,986 --> 00:46:19,989
No, no.
We've got to come up with another plan.

457
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:23,368
Another approach.
Another way to achieve our goals.

458
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:28,623
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

459
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:33,544
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

460
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,540
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...

461
00:47:08,388 --> 00:47:10,855
and they're already asking for my head.

462
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:14,711
They want a scapegoat.

463
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:18,214
And we have to give them one.

464
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,177
That's why we're going to say that you

465
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:31,376
were poorly advised by
your vice minister.

466
00:47:34,564 --> 00:47:37,476
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

467
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,821
We're going to say that I acted alone
and without authorization

468
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:43,948
when I entered La Catedral.

469
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:48,828
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

470
00:47:56,169 --> 00:47:57,754
I don't accept your resignation.

471
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:02,342
Now, more than ever, the country
needs you, Eduardo. I need you.

472
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,927
We have to do it, César.

473
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:11,684
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

474
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:14,729
everyone's looking for someone to blame.
All of them.

475
00:48:15,688 --> 00:48:17,357
And it's not going to be you.

476
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:29,035
It's been my honor serving you
and the people of Colombia.

477
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:47,428
Good luck.

478
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,545
Limón told me you have a daughter.

479
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,507
How old?

480
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:13,222
- Two.
- And what's her name?

481
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:19,061
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

482
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:30,448
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

483
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:40,249
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

484
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,503
Thank you.

485
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:50,343
Know that... you have a friend in me.

486
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:07,777
What did you do?

487
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,405
I took care of it.

488
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,408
You're safe now.

489
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:16,452
Limón.

490
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:14,719
Hey.

491
00:52:17,013 --> 00:52:18,681
What are you doing here?

492
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,021
Where's Olivia?

493
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:28,065
She's at home. With my sister.

494
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:40,328
Hey, you okay?

495
00:52:48,336 --> 00:52:50,338
Hey.

496
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:19,909
What now?

497
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,370
What the fuck do you want?

498
00:53:23,162 --> 00:53:24,914
I want to help you.

499
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:28,084
Oh, yeah?

500
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,380
Come with me and I'll show you.

501
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:26,976
Make yourself at home.

502
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,756
Agent Peña.

503
00:54:57,882 --> 00:54:59,675
Welcome to Montecasino.
