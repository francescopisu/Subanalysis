2
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:24,100
(narrator) Dresden - the great,
beautiful and historic city

3
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,362
so far barely touched by the war,

4
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,973
believed by its inhabitants
to be somehow inviolate -

5
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:33,267
became, in the technical language
of the experts,

6
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:36,147
a severe case of over-bombing.

7
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:41,905
(woman) We had so many refugees
who had come from the Eastern Front

8
00:00:41,985 --> 00:00:46,273
that at this point
the city had swollen to double its size.

9
00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:48,349
The only men we had in the city

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,063
were from the veterans' hospital,
blind and crippled.

11
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:57,214
The blind were trying to carry
the cripples and couldn't see their way.

12
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:02,202
And some people who tried to walk along,
they were pulled in by the fire.

13
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:05,383
They all of a sudden disappeared
right in front of you.

14
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:09,793
There is such a draught
in a firestorm like that.

15
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:11,707
It's a most horrible thing.

16
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:15,512
You have to save yourself
or try to get as far away from the fire

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,729
because the draught pulls you in.

18
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,605
(narrator) Next day came the Americans.

19
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:25,938
A Western demonstration
of support for the Russians,

20
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:27,824
now less than 100 miles away.

21
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:32,847
Over 1300 Flying Fortresses
to pound the ruins of a city.

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,181
(Gray) The city was in flames
but after three days we had to go in

23
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:42,440
and try to find the people
and take them out of the ruins.

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,463
And sometimes a washbasinful
contained nine, ten people,

25
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:52,793
because their size had shrunk
to just a small amount.

26
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:56,510
We just couldn't believe
that this was a whole person.

27
00:01:56,598 --> 00:02:00,657
And this picture is just terrible.

28
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:04,222
I saw sometimes
two people close together

29
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:09,754
who maybe in despair had...
It was one tiny little figure.

30
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:16,884
(narrator) In the centre of the city,
cordoned off from the survivors,

31
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,998
they built great funeral pyres.

32
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:25,706
(Gray) There was no time
to dig individual graves.

33
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,050
We had to dig mass graves.

34
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,455
They tried to identify by jewellery
or by belongings,

35
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:37,980
but many people could not be identified.

36
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:46,311
Later in the ruins
you found inscriptions:

37
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,689
"Hans, are you alive?"

38
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,836
"Martha, are you still in the ruins?"

39
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,898
(narrator)
Industrial damage was slight.

40
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:59,004
The railway was working again
in three days.

41
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,111
But over 100,000 died.

42
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:06,179
Dresden was another monument
to total war.

43
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:11,161
(narrator) The last Nazi newsreel
the Germans saw.

44
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:16,496
It features scratch units in action
on the Eastern Front, on German soil.

45
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:23,554
The slogans now play on sexual fear
of the Red hordes.

46
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,393
The main propaganda weapon -
stories of rape,

47
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,571
stereotyped accounts
backed by dubious pictures

48
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,645
in which the corpses
may, for once, be German.

49
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:40,663
Tales of brutal soldiery told
in the stock language of racial hatred -

50
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,621
beasts, rape, animals, bestiality.

51
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:46,767
Sie haben meine Schwester
und meine Mutter

52
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,411
in bestialischer
und tierischer Weise misshandelt.

53
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:55,512
Refugees from Germany's eastern
provinces and the occupied territories.

54
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:59,576
Families were separated,
never to be reunited.

55
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:04,063
Thousands died from drowning,
thousands from shelling.

56
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:08,359
The great German Reich was shrinking.

57
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:10,818
The Germans coming home.

58
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:20,795
On the Western Front

59
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:23,705
the Allied air forces
ranged at will beyond the Rhine,

60
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:27,117
paralysing all movement
in preparation for the final assault.

61
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:29,538
With bombs, rockets and cannonfire

62
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:35,988
they struck at bridges, railways, roads,
at a single horse and cart.

63
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:40,658
It was my duty to tell Hitler

64
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:45,459
that from the point of view of armaments
the war was lost.

65
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,568
And I did it in several memorandums,

66
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:55,434
and the harshest one was 19 March '45

67
00:05:55,553 --> 00:06:00,342
in which I told him very bluntly,
which nobody dared to tell,

68
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:05,171
that the war will be finished
within four or six weeks.

69
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:08,166
(narrator) Hitler boasted
of losses in infantry

70
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,858
made good by countless numbers
of new units.

71
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:14,231
He himself
presented medals to his new recruits.

72
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:18,981
What they lacked in experience they made
up for in National Socialist ardour.

73
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,593
A young runner reports how
he carried weapons up to the front line.

74
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:27,421
Als der Russe näher heranrückte,
bestand meine Aufgabe darin,

75
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:30,421
Meldungen zu den einzelnen
Kompaniegefechtsständen...

76
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,565
(narrator) His reward,
an Iron Cross Second Class.

77
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,271
March 24.

78
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,157
The Rhine crossing.

79
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,487
Montgomery's last showpiece battle.

80
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,508
Upstream the Americans
slipped across almost unopposed.

81
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:57,769
The goal the field commanders
had in mind - Berlin.

82
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,345
Across the Rhine now.

83
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,833
From the Dutch border
to the Black Forest in the south,

84
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,019
the Allied columns pushed on
into the heart of Germany

85
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:22,126
through scenes that were
the commonplace of war.

86
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,530
Towns and villages that burned

87
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:34,410
as the towns and villages
of Poland, France, Russia,

88
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:38,284
Yugoslavia and Greece had burned.

89
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,967
But for these civilians, for the women
and children who saw the war go past,

90
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:58,307
there were no ghettos
and no gas chambers.

91
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:01,491
Only, in some, a sense of anger.

92
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:08,129
(woman) The first time I have
had hatred against Hitler and the Nazis

93
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:12,386
was not hatred
against the terror regime,

94
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:16,098
it was hatred like among gangsters.

95
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:20,747
Hitler promised us
to win half of the world

96
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:23,698
and he asked us to help him

97
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,921
and so we have done,

98
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,266
and now we have nothing.

99
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:30,223
We have only our clothes.

100
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:33,936
(narrator) The collapse
of Nazi government had left a vacuum.

101
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:36,861
The advancing troops
were politically innocent.

102
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:40,274
Their methods were rough and ready.

103
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,147
(man) The Bürgermeister's
the first one you meet.

104
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,217
He'd have his sash on

105
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:48,096
and he would inform us
that he was not a Nazi,

106
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:49,974
the town council was not.

107
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,357
We would promptly round them all up

108
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:55,886
and ship them out
because we knew we had all the Nazis.

109
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:58,843
You put soldiers with townspeople

110
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:04,475
and after the first couple of hours
of a small amount of tension

111
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,383
when both parties realised that the
other was not gonna stab them suddenly,

112
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:14,795
we'd find ourselves swapping
hard tack or chocolate

113
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,869
for a cooked meal
by one of the German families.

114
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:23,426
And they in turn would show us family
pictures - not the uniform ones -

115
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:26,457
and then you'd find a GI
showing his family to them.

116
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,371
It's funny how the feeling
could change so rapidly.

117
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:34,590
Some woman came to me. In addition
to trying to offer me her own services,

118
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,779
she was trying to obtain something else.

119
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:39,850
I looked at her. I was feeling
particularly mean that day.

120
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,334
My father was sick and the Red Cross
had given me information

121
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:47,938
that my brother-in-law had been killed
in Germany. Word had just come to me

122
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:52,160
and I was about ready to tear anyone
apart with my own two hands.

123
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:54,884
And I said in desperation almost:

124
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:57,608
"Don't bother me.
You're dealing with a Jew."

125
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,721
"You don't want anything to do with me."

126
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:04,744
And she looked at me and she said,
"Aber Sie sind ein weißer Jude",

127
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:07,968
which you can translate,
"But you are a white Jew."

128
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:12,686
And I did everything to restrain myself
from just belting her in the mouth.

129
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:26,912
(narrator) The camps were overrun.

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,593
Many Germans had known of them.
Others had preferred not to know.

131
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,135
Now they were forced to see.

132
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,706
In one place the mayor and his wife
went home and hanged themselves.

133
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:55,801
This is Buchenwald.

134
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:37,006
Those who had survived deportation,
slave labour,

135
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,803
selection for the death camps,
starvation,

136
00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:42,025
were from every country in Europe,

137
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:46,170
of all callings, of many religions,
many political faiths.

138
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,352
Some turned on their oppressors.

139
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,021
Allied prisoners were freed.

140
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,065
(cheering)

141
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,015
(narrator)
German soldiers went into captivity.

142
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:46,746
Displaced persons, ordinary Germans,
prisoners of war passed on the roads

143
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:49,894
and had nothing to say to each other.

144
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:54,567
Germany was an ant heap
some giant had kicked to pieces.

145
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:04,657
Here and there, looting.

146
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,495
Brief opportunities to celebrate
the collapse of the system.

147
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:20,849
The victors had their own views
on law and order.

148
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,610
Some property was still sacred.

149
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:57,718
(Speer) In April '45,
Berlin was more ruins than a town.

150
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,553
In the centre of Berlin,

151
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:03,969
one could find almost no building
which was still intact.

152
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:07,191
But it was my wish
to have the Berlin Philharmonic

153
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,563
having a concert for the last time.

154
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:15,280
I knew that it would be my last concert
for a long time, perhaps forever,

155
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:20,920
and I invited friends

156
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:25,108
and as many people as possible to go in.

157
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:29,518
We were sitting there in our coats
because there was no heating.

158
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,780
It was cold and it was shivering

159
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:37,950
and in this atmosphere
of destruction and misery

160
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:41,104
the concert started and we started

161
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:45,057
with the last part
of the Götterdämmerung.

162
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,997
(narrator) Hitler no longer
made public appearances.

163
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,726
More and more he withdrew

164
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:59,282
to his underground headquarters beneath
the Imperial Chancellery - the bunker.

165
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:06,110
(Speer) When I came back from this
concert for the military conference,

166
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:10,756
we came into the bunker
and Hitler was almost out of his mind.

167
00:15:10,837 --> 00:15:13,477
And Goebbels was already there.

168
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:20,042
And Hitler showed to us the wires he'd
just received of the death of Roosevelt.

169
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,645
Goebbels was jumping up and saying,
"That's it. That's it!"

170
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:28,014
"Now we have got it. Now I think
everything will turn to the better."

171
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:34,619
(narrator) In the east, over railway
lines converted to the Russian gauge,

172
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:38,337
the Russian command was piling up
vast supplies of material.

173
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,519
Six armies were involved.

174
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:45,013
Their object: to smash the German forces
on the approaches to Berlin

175
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,268
and take the capital of Nazi Germany.

176
00:15:55,221 --> 00:16:00,666
On the 75th anniversary
of Lenin's birth, 16 April 1945,

177
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:03,767
the massed artillery opened fire.

178
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:21,649
My heart was going smaller
and I get very anxious

179
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:24,566
because I knew that the attack began.

180
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:42,323
(narrator) The first barrage was
less effective than Zhukov had hoped.

181
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:47,272
The Germans were still secure
in their second line of defence.

182
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:58,285
In the centre of the front,
opposite Berlin,

183
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:04,071
there were 400 guns to the mile
to open a way for the assault tanks.

184
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,651
The Red Army was over the Oder,

185
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:21,834
reinforcing and breaking out
of its bridgeheads.

186
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,557
The armoured columns pushed ahead
against desperate resistance.

187
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,237
Some of our young boys, they jumped
out of the holes, had their Panzerfaust

188
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,191
and they were shooting to the tanks
and destroyed more than four tanks,

189
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:38,826
and the others
were shooting with their guns

190
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:41,859
and killed all the Russian soldiers.

191
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:47,420
And the Russians must have been
before in a Magazin,

192
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,568
or in a sweet factory,

193
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:53,484
because they had all their arms
full of sweets and chocolate.

194
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:56,175
Everybody in our unit was 15 and 16

195
00:17:56,252 --> 00:18:00,583
and they were running onto the street
with the chocolate.

196
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:11,398
(narrator)
In the west it was a different story.

197
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:15,813
Sidestepping pockets of the enemy
the Allied columns moved east.

198
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:20,525
(man) You could pick up the telephone
and ring up the next village

199
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,597
to see if it was still German-occupied.

200
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:24,975
Say,
"Hello, what's happening down there?"

201
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:30,125
One had almost moved into
a dreamlike and unreal situation

202
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:35,227
where towns and villages
flew by with no resistance at all.

203
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:37,988
Normal countryside, no damage at all.

204
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:43,239
And every day one said to oneself,
"Surely this can't go on."

205
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,846
Certainly, I think,
the thought of one's own survival

206
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,994
after all this gradually became
more and more uppermost.

207
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,706
When one did run into
any sort of determined resistance,

208
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:56,162
it was a matter of half anger:

209
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,468
"How dare these people
prolong the agony any more?"

210
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:03,575
And the other half
was jolly nearly a blue funk.

211
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:12,664
(narrator) Uelzen,
a little town in northern Germany,

212
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:17,731
30 miles short of the Elbe.
Here the Germans did stand and fight.

213
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,062
There was an edginess now
among the Allied fighting men,

214
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:37,559
their fingers quick on the trigger.

215
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,741
Their opponents were elite troops
and officer cadets.

216
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:43,619
It took a four-day battle
with considerable losses

217
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,883
and many civilian deaths
before resistance collapsed.

218
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:09,749
Mostly the Germans
surrendered thankfully.

219
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:13,155
Their main aim - to go into captivity
with the Anglo-Americans

220
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,151
rather than with the Russians

221
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:19,218
on whose land and population
they had inflicted such losses.

222
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,585
Desperately they strove
to reach safety in the west.

223
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:40,438
In the Ruhr pocket
over 300,000 men of Army Group B

224
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:43,920
were surrounded and forced to surrender.

225
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,065
The Western Allies
had achieved their main objective -

226
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:52,635
the destruction
of the German land forces in the west.

227
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,364
(speaks German)

228
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:09,085
(translator)
It wasn't until the first half of April

229
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:11,158
that he retired to the bunker,

230
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:16,460
because the air raids
were getting worse and more frequent.

231
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,551
The bunker was divided up in such a way

232
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:28,000
that in the lower area
there was a military conference chamber

233
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:31,259
with an anteroom
which led to Hitler's study.

234
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:35,295
His workroom and bedroom
led off this anteroom

235
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:39,585
and also a room
with a bathroom for Eva Braun.

236
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:48,023
There were some women in Hitler's
former life who were important for him,

237
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,096
but I think during the last time

238
00:21:53,174 --> 00:21:57,843
there was nobody else near
and as close to him like Eva Braun.

239
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,993
She loved him really
and she came surprisingly to Berlin

240
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:08,089
and when she arrived, Hitler tried
to seem angry but he wasn't successful.

241
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:11,501
His eyes were so full of joy

242
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:16,181
and he was obviously so happy
that she was there

243
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:20,403
that nobody tried to send her back.

244
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,257
(narrator) The Russians
were now firing on Berlin itself,

245
00:22:31,343 --> 00:22:34,442
their forward troops
already in the outskirts

246
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,778
fighting their way
from street to street.

247
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:43,154
So came his birthday, 20 April,

248
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:47,109
and there came the congratulations

249
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:51,747
and everybody shook his hand
and wished him the best.

250
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,461
It was all very depressed,

251
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:59,379
it was not a happy birthday.

252
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,146
And when the official part was over

253
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:08,237
Hitler retired at once,
but Eva Braun invited some of the people

254
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:13,190
to go upstairs in her little living room
to make a birthday party.

255
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:20,638
And one found a record, a hit song,
to dance with music.

256
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:27,687
And then we sat around the table and
tried to forget our miserable situation.

257
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,101
There was laughing and joking

258
00:23:31,187 --> 00:23:35,934
and everybody drank
and giggled and gaggled.

259
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:40,691
It was a very artificial
sort of gayness.

260
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,769
(speaks German)

261
00:23:44,614 --> 00:23:48,520
(translator) After there was
another conference on the situation,

262
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:53,590
but it was already apparent
that it was getting near the end.

263
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:59,913
Reichsleiter Bormann said to me
that I should put everything in motion

264
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:01,982
so that we would have luggage ready

265
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:06,935
in case of a possible move
to the Berghof in Berchtesgaden.

266
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:16,989
He refused absolutely and said,
"No, I cannot leave Berlin."

267
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:22,360
"I have to make a decision here
in Berlin or I have to go under."

268
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:27,611
And this was the first time

269
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:33,869
that he ever mentioned the possibility
that we could not win,

270
00:24:33,947 --> 00:24:40,199
that he mentioned the chance of defeat.

271
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:44,150
I remember April 20 1945,

272
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:47,217
that was the birthday of Adolf Hitler,

273
00:24:47,335 --> 00:24:51,394
and on the radio there was a speech
of Joseph Goebbels.

274
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:56,464
And he said, "Berlin will remain German

275
00:24:56,542 --> 00:25:00,448
and Vienna will be German again."

276
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:05,747
And my mother said,
"God thanks, we will win the war",

277
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:11,041
and I said, "Mother, you are wrong
and Goebbels is wrong."

278
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,375
"It's terrible,
but I am quite sure the war is over

279
00:25:15,454 --> 00:25:17,330
and we will lose the war."

280
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:22,277
And my mother said,
"Do you think in this hour

281
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,650
Goebbels will tell us a lie?"

282
00:25:34,328 --> 00:25:37,045
(speaks Russian)

283
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:41,917
(translator) The battle for Berlin
itself was extremely difficult.

284
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,633
It had to be taken street by street,
house by house,

285
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:52,050
some of them nine and ten storeys high,
and there were lots of these houses.

286
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,532
The fascists held out on every floor.

287
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:58,832
They had also set up barricades
in every street.

288
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:03,283
They'd converted the main buildings
into strongpoints against us.

289
00:26:16,794 --> 00:26:22,162
We were in Berlin now and in this
evening we just visit my mother

290
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:26,420
and she was very nearly crying,

291
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,486
because she thought
maybe I'm dead or something.

292
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:36,736
And it was late in the evening
and we wanted to sleep there,

293
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:41,298
but some men of the house came
and they said, "It's impossible."

294
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:45,672
"You can't sleep here because
the Russians are not far from here

295
00:26:45,757 --> 00:26:49,739
and if they arrive here by night
and they see you here with guns,

296
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:52,038
maybe they will shoot us."

297
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,111
So we couldn't sleep there.

298
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:58,032
We went over the street,
there was a school, and we slept there.

299
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,854
(man speaks Russian)

300
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,921
(translator) On the 21st,

301
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:14,333
we went on together into the outer ring
of the suburbs of Berlin itself.

302
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,928
The order of the day of our high command
reverberated through the whole country.

303
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,617
They were heard throughout the world:

304
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:28,065
"Our soldiers have broken into Berlin."

305
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:36,233
(narrator) The Russians
worked out their tactics in detail

306
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:39,460
using models of streets and buildings.

307
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,868
Behind the apparent chaos
of the fighting lay a precise plan

308
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,096
to encircle the city
and strike at the centre.

309
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,320
Some troops had come all across Russia

310
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:52,384
through territory the retreating Germans
had looted, burned, destroyed.

311
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:00,709
Berliners sheltering in their cellars

312
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:04,273
wondered what their fate would be
at Russian hands.

313
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,891
(woman speaks Russian)

314
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,760
(translator) Even the children
had not been evacuated.

315
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:14,634
They all lived in cellars.

316
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:18,585
I went into the cellars

317
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,919
and remember most of all
the repetition of this phrase:

318
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:27,145
"When will this nightmare end?"

319
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:33,356
Suddenly on April 22, I think - yes -

320
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:37,235
they came out of the military conference

321
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:40,150
with a totally stony face

322
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:46,316
and dark, frightened eyes

323
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:51,882
and he called us to come
to this little anteroom.

324
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:58,558
He sent for Eva Braun
and for the secretaries and for the cook

325
00:28:58,642 --> 00:29:02,471
who was still in Berlin
who cooked for him.

326
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:06,963
And then he came in
and said with a monotone voice

327
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:12,106
and so unkindly
as we never had heard him speak to us:

328
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,664
"Ladies,
please pack your things at once."

329
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:18,544
"You have to go to the south."

330
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:22,840
"The last aeroplane
starts in about an hour."

331
00:29:24,268 --> 00:29:27,988
And then it was silent.
"No", he said, "it's all lost."

332
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:31,622
"There's no hope. You have to go."

333
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,852
And then was a moment
of absolute silence

334
00:29:34,932 --> 00:29:37,725
and we stood shocked.

335
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:43,788
Suddenly Eva Braun made a few steps,

336
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,401
went to Hitler and said:

337
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:50,657
"But you know I don't leave you.
I stay on your side."

338
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:54,801
"You know that.
Don't try to send me away."

339
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,328
Then Hitler
did something very astonishing

340
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:03,352
which he never did
and nobody had ever seen such a gesture.

341
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,998
He kissed her on her lips.

342
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:14,204
And then it happened
that the other girls and me too,

343
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:18,317
we heard us saying, "We'll stay, too."

344
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,642
This situation in the bunker

345
00:30:22,731 --> 00:30:25,905
was a fantastic one.

346
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,130
One really can't...

347
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:30,317
An unrealistic one.

348
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:33,272
One really can't describe

349
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:38,801
how the moods
went on and off like waves.

350
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,830
Sometimes they were all exhilarating
and were thinking,

351
00:30:43,906 --> 00:30:50,573
"Well, now the Western troops
coming for release of Berlin..."

352
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:52,955
Goebbels was exclaiming

353
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:57,858
one of the biggest decisions of war
Hitler just made,

354
00:30:57,947 --> 00:31:02,660
he is now determined

355
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:06,800
no more to fight against the West,
only to the East in Berlin,

356
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:10,758
and this will mean
that the Western powers

357
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:14,589
will join us
in our fight against Russia.

358
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,738
Such things happened every now and then.

359
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:23,792
And then a few minutes afterwards
everybody was speaking about suicide

360
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,788
and how they are preparing it.

361
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:29,703
Goebbels in detail was saying

362
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:35,919
how he will let his children be killed
who were already in the bunker.

363
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:37,376
(speaks German)

364
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:41,327
(translator) After a few days
the telegram came from Göring

365
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,280
which said, "Mein Führer..."

366
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:49,186
No longer "my beloved Führer",
just "my Führer".

367
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:54,256
"I know that you are now totally cut off

368
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:59,592
and are no longer in possession
of full freedom to command."

369
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:06,762
"According to the law of succession,
I will now step into your position

370
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:13,325
and will undertake to represent Germany
both in internal and external matters."

371
00:32:13,404 --> 00:32:16,852
"Yours, Göring."

372
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:22,836
Hitler was so worked up over this.

373
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:26,976
He sat in his chair
and could not grasp it at first.

374
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:33,539
This was added to by Bormann
who added fuel to the fire somewhat

375
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,719
so that Hitler then said:

376
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:41,365
"To give me an ultimatum,
that really is the end!"

377
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:47,120
One day there came one of the men
of the press bureau, press office,

378
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,113
and brought the news -

379
00:32:50,193 --> 00:32:56,554
I think he had heard it by radio
from Reuters News Agency -

380
00:32:56,637 --> 00:33:01,548
that Himmler had had negotiations

381
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:04,920
with Graf Bernadotte for capitulation.

382
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,488
And Hitler was very upset

383
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,392
because he held Himmler
for his most faithful paladin

384
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,202
and the most reliable one,

385
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:20,802
and now he saw
that also he had tried to betray him.

386
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:27,014
He remembered suddenly that the poison
which he had to use for himself

387
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:30,692
was given to him
by one of Himmler's staff

388
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:33,807
and he mistrusted that it may affect...

389
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:38,098
Perhaps Himmler tried a dirty trick

390
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:44,741
and gave him something
that would only make him unconscious,

391
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,187
so that he could be transported
against his will out of the bunker

392
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:53,104
and delivered to the enemy.

393
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:58,584
And to test this he ordered a doctor

394
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:04,069
to try to test this poison capsule
on the dog.

395
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:08,485
So he said farewell to this creature.

396
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:14,578
I think it was next to Eva Braun,
this one who stood next to him.

397
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:17,153
And Blondi died very promptly.

398
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:42,359
(narrator)
For a tiny handful of German anti-Nazis,

399
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:45,657
the Russians came as liberators.

400
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,987
(man) On Tuesday morning, the 24th,

401
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,912
we suddenly saw
the Gestapo had disappeared.

402
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:58,395
During the night the whole prison
was given over to normal prison guards,

403
00:34:58,474 --> 00:35:02,456
old men, not nice men.

404
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,831
And when we saw that...

405
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:11,051
Many of the uniforms
the Gestapo guards had put away there.

406
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:15,192
We said,
"Now, when the Russians take over,

407
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:20,491
you are the men who will be killed,
not we. Let us out."

408
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,555
They were very...

409
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:27,585
They said, "No, we can't do that.
Tonight the Gestapo will come back."

410
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,770
And then in the afternoon of Tuesday
we made an agreement with them

411
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:35,525
and said,
"Look, we will put out ourselves,

412
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:38,554
we the prisoners,
some guards on the roof,

413
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:43,308
and observe the coming here
of the Russian Front."

414
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:49,603
"In the minute we hear Russian gunfire,
not only the artillery shelling,

415
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:53,325
then you will let us out."
They said, "All right."

416
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:55,437
When the door was opened in the prison

417
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:57,776
there was with us
a Jewish Russian doctor

418
00:35:57,896 --> 00:36:02,261
who was a concentration inmate
of Sachsenhausen, the famous...

419
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:04,719
He - I don't know for what reason -

420
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,630
a month ago
was brought by the Gestapo to our prison

421
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:13,198
to do the most dirty jobs
in the prison all the time.

422
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:17,382
And we couldn't contact him much
but we knew him.

423
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,130
Then he stood there on the street
and, "Where to go?" as a Russian.

424
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:24,317
And I said, "Look, come with us."

425
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:27,470
"My mother-in-law will feed you.
Come in our basement."

426
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:32,994
And he went with me. When the first
units of Russians came two days later,

427
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:36,669
he met them at the door
addressing them in Russian:

428
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:40,160
"We are all anti-fascists
in this basement."

429
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:43,847
When the Russians came in in the end...

430
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:50,750
We found the first lot,
the fighting troops which came in,...

431
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,518
They took away our watches, of course,

432
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,659
and they were very cautious.

433
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:57,884
We could understand that.

434
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:02,760
They took away things they liked
but they behaved very businesslike.

435
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,095
They stayed in this house here

436
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:10,627
and they lived in this room, three
or four of them, quite high officers.

437
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,997
They got up in the morning
at eight o'clock

438
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:15,692
and at nine o'clock
they went to the Tiergarten,

439
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,679
which isn't very far from here,

440
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:21,060
and behind the Tiergarten
is, or was, the Chancellery

441
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:23,475
where Hitler
was still alive and fighting.

442
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:26,045
They went out and did their job

443
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:30,263
and came back
at five o'clock in the afternoon sharp

444
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:36,403
and then they asked me down here
to play the piano

445
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:41,161
and give them a little tune.

446
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,838
And then we drank together
and we sang together.

447
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:48,482
(woman) Suddenly we saw
the first Russian soldiers.

448
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:52,555
They knocked at our door,

449
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:56,312
came in and were very kind.

450
00:37:56,395 --> 00:38:01,490
They said to my mother and to me

451
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:05,938
if there were German soldiers
in the house

452
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:08,893
or asked for weapons.

453
00:38:09,016 --> 00:38:11,274
And then they left.

454
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:17,564
But the next Russians
were quite different.

455
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:23,976
One of them raped me
and other inhabitants of the house.

456
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:27,731
Two women living next door were killed

457
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:32,559
and we weren't able to bury them
because the shelling was still going on.

458
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:35,210
When the Russians came along
they asked us:

459
00:38:35,294 --> 00:38:38,316
"Where are your women?
We want to have your women",

460
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:42,732
or, "Frau, Frau, Frau", they said in
German, what they called German.

461
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:48,137
I had the trick or I found the trick

462
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:51,473
to take them to these two dead bodies.

463
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,733
I opened the carpet and said,
"This is my Frau here."

464
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,307
"I can't supply you with any women."

465
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,263
"These are the only two women
we knew here which we had."

466
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:06,556
And the Russians kneeled down,
some of them,

467
00:39:06,673 --> 00:39:09,204
and made the cross

468
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:13,613
and said little prayers,
which was very astounding,

469
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:19,946
and got up again and kissed me
because they thought I was the widower

470
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:25,544
and gave me presents,
gave me cigarettes, gave me bread,

471
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:29,421
clapped me on my shoulder
and went off again

472
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:35,166
and got what they wanted, probably,
the next house or in the next street.

473
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:38,701
Every night,
I used to go home to see my mother

474
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:42,993
and get something to eat
and some cigarettes,

475
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,482
because we didn't get any food
at daytime.

476
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:51,245
And my mother
was every time, every night,

477
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:54,239
she was very lucky
to see me again, naturally.

478
00:39:54,318 --> 00:40:00,254
And so my mother asked me and also
other people from our house asked me:

479
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,446
"Just take your uniform off,

480
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:08,125
stay here
and don't go back to fighting."

481
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,772
Always I said, "No, I can't do it."

482
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,519
I couldn't stay at home safe
and they are still fighting.

483
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:26,885
(narrator) The Battle of Berlin was
one of the most difficult of the war.

484
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:30,139
It cost the Russians over 100,000 men.

485
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:44,725
Total German losses are unknown.

486
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:05,438
(man speaks Russian)

487
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:10,958
(translator)
The storming of Berlin continued.

488
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:15,253
The encircling ring round the whole city
and round the centre of Berlin itself

489
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:18,437
was being drawn tighter and tighter.

490
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:20,627
Only a few hundred yards separated us

491
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,546
from the viper's nest
of Hitler's headquarters,

492
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:25,457
the Imperial Chancellery.

493
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:30,100
Then he began, "My last will",

494
00:41:30,184 --> 00:41:34,439
and then he dictated me
at first his private will

495
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:39,194
and afterwards his political testimony.

496
00:41:40,158 --> 00:41:43,180
And, I must confess,

497
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:50,358
that I was... I was at first
in a very excited mood,

498
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:57,564
because I expected that I would be
the first and the only one

499
00:41:57,651 --> 00:42:01,557
who knows, who is going to know,

500
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:05,852
the explanation and declaration

501
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:09,696
why the war had come to this end

502
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:13,799
and why Hitler couldn't stop,

503
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,866
and why the development
and why the catastrophe.

504
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:23,541
I thought, "Now I will come
to the moment of the truth."

505
00:42:24,696 --> 00:42:27,685
And I was heart bumping

506
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:32,020
when I wrote down what Hitler said.

507
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,740
But he used nothing new.

508
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:40,225
He came out with his old phrases.

509
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:45,448
He repeated his accusations,

510
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:51,658
his revenge swearing to the enemy

511
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:56,563
and to the Jewish capitalistic system.

512
00:42:56,651 --> 00:43:00,710
And then he announced

513
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:05,660
in the second part
of the political testimony,

514
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,957
he announced a new government.

515
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:11,034
(speaks German)

516
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:17,592
(translator) Eva Braun
had by now persuaded the Führer

517
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:23,686
to the point where he actually wanted
to improvise a marriage service to her.

518
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:37,846
To do this, they got an official
from the propaganda ministry

519
00:43:37,928 --> 00:43:41,485
who would fulfill the function
of registrar.

520
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:46,515
I joined the others
in this little workroom of Hitler's

521
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:49,817
and they were sitting there
around a table

522
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:55,037
and so I had to congratulate Eva Braun.

523
00:43:55,114 --> 00:44:00,744
I was a little shy as to what to say,

524
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:03,547
and I shook hands with her

525
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:08,573
and she said, "Oh, you can say
Mrs Hitler to me now," and I did.

526
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,903
(narrator) On the rocket,
"This is for the Reichstag."

527
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:23,648
Others said, "Remember Stalingrad",
"Remember the Ukraine",

528
00:44:23,732 --> 00:44:28,216
"Remember the widows and children",
"Remember the tears."

529
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:32,355
(Linge speaks German)

530
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,350
(translator)
Hitler had now drawn his conclusions.

531
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,493
He said farewell to everybody.

532
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:43,715
I was the last one he came to.

533
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:50,695
Hitler said to me:
"I have given the order to break out."

534
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,605
"You should break out in groups."

535
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,633
"Join one of these groups
and try to get through to the west."

536
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:07,692
Then I asked Hitler:
"For whom should we fight on for now?"

537
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,990
And to that Hitler said in a monotone:

538
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,601
"For the coming man."

539
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,811
I saluted him. He gave me his hand
and I disappeared out of the room.

540
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:23,952
Suddenly there was a bang,
there was a shot,

541
00:45:24,075 --> 00:45:28,439
and it was obviously within the bunker,

542
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:35,726
because the noises
of the outside shooting,

543
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:40,178
we know how they sound.

544
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:45,708
And the little boy of Goebbels,

545
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:49,966
he noticed that there was another sound.

546
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:55,638
He said, "Oh, that was a bull's-eye."

547
00:45:55,723 --> 00:46:00,283
And I thought, yes, you are right.
That was really a bull's-eye.

548
00:46:00,365 --> 00:46:03,125
(speaks German)

549
00:46:03,204 --> 00:46:06,150
(translator)
I went into Hitler's workroom

550
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:12,825
with the former Reichsleiter Bormann
and this picture presented itself to us.

551
00:46:13,868 --> 00:46:17,894
Hitler was sitting
on the left of the sofa

552
00:46:17,973 --> 00:46:23,876
with his face bent slightly forward
and hanging down to the right.

553
00:46:23,957 --> 00:46:29,554
With the 7.65
he had shot himself in the right temple.

554
00:46:30,517 --> 00:46:33,048
The blood had run down onto the carpet

555
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:38,527
and from this pool of blood
a splash had got onto the sofa.

556
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:49,506
Eva Braun was sitting on his right.

557
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:54,405
Eva Braun had drawn both her legs
up onto the sofa

558
00:46:54,493 --> 00:46:57,559
and was sitting there with cramped lips

559
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,781
so that it immediately
became clear to us

560
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,272
that she had taken cyanide.

561
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:08,033
I took Hitler by his neck.

562
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:12,672
Behind me were two other officers
from his bodyguard.

563
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:20,306
And so we took Hitler's body
and proceeded with it into the park.

564
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,014
In the park, we laid the bodies
together next to each other

565
00:47:29,134 --> 00:47:32,232
and poured
the available petrol over them.

566
00:47:34,197 --> 00:47:38,867
In the Reich Chancellery park
there was fire all around.

567
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:42,896
A draught had got up

568
00:47:42,982 --> 00:47:48,001
so that we could not set the corpses
alight with an ordinary match.

569
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:57,554
So I twisted a taper
out of some paper from a notebook

570
00:47:57,636 --> 00:48:02,350
and Reichsleiter Bormann,
who meanwhile had also come upstairs

571
00:48:02,431 --> 00:48:07,145
with others like Dr Goebbels,
Burgdorf and some officers,

572
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:13,130
lit the taper
and I threw the taper onto the bodies

573
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:17,390
and in an instant
the corpses were set alight.

574
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:26,629
(Nikulina speaks Russian)

575
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:29,474
(translator)
That night we were the first

576
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:32,652
to take the fight
into the Chancellery itself.

577
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,056
Our objective was to be the planting
of our banner on the building itself.

578
00:48:41,177 --> 00:48:42,857
There was a group of us.

579
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:46,967
Our group consisted of me,
Sanogen, Alimov and Uzbek,

580
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:50,068
who was the Young Communist organiser
of our battalion.

581
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:53,557
He and his Young Communists
had fought through with us together.

582
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:57,277
They protected me so that I could fight
my way in to hoist the flag.

583
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:59,198
They gave me the banner to enable me

584
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:01,814
to get into the building itself
and hoist it up.

585
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:03,801
Having got into the building,

586
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:07,913
we started making our way
up the staircase towards the attic.

587
00:49:09,564 --> 00:49:15,390
Some fascists opened up on us and
Sanogen was hit in the head and fell.

588
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,845
His friends rushed forward to him

589
00:49:17,927 --> 00:49:21,484
while I had to make it upstairs
to plant the banner.

590
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:30,959
And having made my way onto the roof
through a shell hole,

591
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:34,221
I secured our red banner
with a length of telegraph wire.

592
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:36,293
(cheering)

593
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:41,401
- How do you do?
- You're one of Joe Stalin's soldiers

594
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:44,732
- and I'm pleased to meet you.
- (man speaks Russian)

595
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,103
(narrator) When the armies
of East and West met in Germany

596
00:49:50,189 --> 00:49:54,477
there was a brief moment
of warmth and comradeship.

597
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:58,359
- Well, we fought the same way together.
- Yes.

598
00:49:58,437 --> 00:50:04,569
Well, all the best, old man. I'm very
glad to have met you. Very glad indeed.

599
00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:08,907
- (speaks Russian)
- Thank you very much.

600
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:12,543
We don't understand the language
but we mean the same thing.

601
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:33,804
(narrator) The Red Army saw themselves
as liberators, not avengers.

602
00:50:43,128 --> 00:50:46,347
But the crimes of Hitler's Reich
had to be paid for,

603
00:50:46,427 --> 00:50:49,373
it was the ordinary German who paid.
