1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,460

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,990
North Africa.

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,040
High in Morocco's Atlas Mountains,

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,270
Barbary macaques shiver
in the icy cedars.

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,120

6
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,880
The ancestors of these monkeys
fled here from a disaster

7
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,430
that overwhelmed their homeland.

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,040
Now, trapped in this
isolated corner of Africa,

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,600
there's no going back
to the land farther south.

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,830
Even in this snowy refuge,

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,910
there's a reminder
of what drove them here.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,630
The unbridled power of the African sun.

13
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,760
Under its intense gaze,
the snow can't last for long.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,440
Meltwater should bring life
to the lowlands.

15
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,910
Hundreds of torrents cascade southwards.

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,080
But each is flowing towards extinction.

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,630
Just 200 miles south of the mountains,

18
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,360
the rivers are vaporised.

19
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,960
Life has been burnt off the land.

20
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,550
This was the apocalypse
from which the Barbary macaques fled,

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,110
the sudden and unstoppable advance

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,160
of the greatest desert on the planet.

23
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,780

24
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,600
The Sahara transformed North Africa.

25
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,470
Today, it covers an area
the size of the United States,

26
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,870
one-third of the entire
African continent.

27
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,480
This is one of the hottest
places on Earth.

28
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,360
The merciless sun,

29
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,990
a colossal 15-million-degree
nuclear reactor,

30
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,840
blasted life
from the surface of the land.

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,510
It still wreaks havoc.

32
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,470
A faint breath of wind
can be the beginning of disaster.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,430

34
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,600
Nomads tell of entire 
villages being engulfed,

35
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,630
camel trains disappearing,

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,710
and people buried alive
inside their tents.

37
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,520

38
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,200
A sandstorm can be
a thousand miles across.

39
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,710
It seems miraculous that anything
can survive such devastation.

40
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,030
The Saharan apocalypse
wiped out many creatures,

41
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,600
but today, some still cling on

42
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,990
in the lands around the margins
of the great desert.

43
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,920
It's very dry here.

44
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,910
Some years, the rains fail entirely.

45
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
A lone Grevy's zebra.

46
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,990
He weighs close to half a tonne,

47
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,360
and can go for three days
without drinking.

48
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,030
Like the macaques, his forebears
were refugees from the advancing Sahara.

49
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,520

50
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,960
The land is scrubby and dry.

51
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,440

52
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,790

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,910
But this stallion
has claimed it as his own.

54
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,280
He's been waiting months for visitors.

55
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,790
Female visitors.

56
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,120
If they like his territory,
they might stay a while.

57
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,200
It's his first chance to mate
for a very long time.

58
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,910

59
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,560
Hardly a success.

60
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,590
Perhaps his visitors are looking
for a more impressive partner.

61
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,360
There's another setback.

62
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,470
The females were being followed.

63
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,470
A posse of young males -
every one a rival.

64
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,120
It's time to separate 
the men from the boys.

65
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,310

66
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,270
One by one, the stallion sees them off.

67
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,430
The females had ringside seats.

68
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,590
And his prowess has not gone un-noted.

69
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,870
Machismo gives way to tenderness.

70
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,480
Around here, you have to take
every opportunity,

71
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,190
be it for food, for water, or for mates.

72
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,200
Female Grevy's are a fickle bunch.

73
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,670
The herd have decided to move on.

74
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,760
All of them.

75
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,360
The stallion may never see them again.

76
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,760
But there's a chance that one
is now carrying his foal.

77
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,480
In this harsh land,
that must count as a triumph.

78
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,670
The sun's power cannot, however,
reach far underground.

79
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,800
Below, in stark contrast,
conditions are stable and tolerable.

80
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,270
And home to one of the planet's
strangest mammals.

81
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,950
Meet the naked mole rats.

82
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,520
These sabre-toothed sausages
wouldn't last a day in the desert.

83
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,230
Special filming tunnels allow us to see

84
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,150
how well adapted they are
to the subterranean life.

85
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,270
They can run equally well
in both directions,

86
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,670
so tight space is no problem.

87
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,710
They have lost their fur.

88
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,200
And most bizarrely,
they live in social colonies,

89
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,710
much like termites or ants.

90
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,880
After time spent digging,
the workers come together to relax.

91
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,670
But one here is very different
from all the rest.

92
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Their queen,

93
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,880
twice as heavy as her subjects,

94
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,120
and not afraid to throw
her weight around.

95
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,360
She is the mother of every
worker in the colony,

96
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,950
and exists in a near-continuous
state of pregnancy.

97
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,830
Even now, two dozen babies
are pulsating within her swollen belly.

98
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,040
Just occasionally,
one of her brood is raised differently,

99
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
a daughter becomes a princess.

100
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,480
Until now, this youngster's
enjoyed a lazy, privileged life.

101
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,320
But not for much longer.

102
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,000
She has a destiny to fulfil.

103
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,280
The surface is a place where
no naked mole rat can survive for long.

104
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,920
But a princess will risk everything
to search for a partner.

105
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,270
The quest is urgent.

106
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,870
There's an enticing smell in the air.

107
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,640
A seductive scent
draws her downwards, to safety.

108
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,230
She's sniffed out a partner.

109
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
He too is alone,

110
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,840
and eager to start a new colony
in his lonely burrow.

111
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,350
Two months later,
the princess has become a queen.

112
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,390
And a new tyranny begins.

113
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,630
Tough though they are, such refugees

114
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,000
living on the edges of North Africa

115
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,710
cannot survive in the heart of the Sahara.

116
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,790
And yet here, in southern Nigeria,

117
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,910
there are creatures preparing to journey

118
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,070
right across the centre
of that great desert.

119
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,790
Barn swallows.

120
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,920

121
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,120
They've spent the winter
roosting in a forest of elephant grass.

122
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,200
But now, it is time for them to leave.

123
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,950
All two million of them.

124
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,040
They're tiny, each weighing the same
as a couple of one-pound coins,

125
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
yet the journey
to their breeding grounds in Europe

126
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,430
is over 3,000 miles long.

127
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,350
Ahead of them lies a vast death trap.

128
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,400
The Sahara is too large to go around.

129
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,310
The swallows have no choice
but to meet it head-on.

130
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,080
It will take one of nature's
greatest feats of navigation

131
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,830
to cross this lifeless wasteland.

132
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,750
A wilderness that stretches
not just to the horizon,

133
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,030
but almost beyond imagination.

134
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,680
It's an immense blank space on the map.

135
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,760
In spite of the Sahara's reputation,

136
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,510
less than one-fifth of it is sand.

137
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,750
The rest is stone and wind-scoured rock.

138
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,470
The sun not only bakes the land,

139
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,750
it warps its appearance.

140
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,790
The super-heated air, rising
upward from the desert surface,

141
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,990
distorts the distant scene.

142
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,710
A reflection of the sky
shimmers on the sands,

143
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,510
a mirage.

144
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,120
The sun is an illusionist.

145
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,510
To thirsty travellers,
a mirage can resemble a lake

146
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
which agonisingly recedes
as it's approached.

147
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,550
And swaying camels coming to the rescue

148
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,000
transform into dry, spiny acacia trees.

149
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,040
To cross this confused,
shimmering landscape,

150
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,990
many swallows will need to find
real water amongst the mirages.

151
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,120
Even in the Sahara,
rain does sometimes fall

152
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,630
and that is sufficient
for plants to survive,

153
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,710
providing they have
the right adaptations.

154
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,270
Rising from the sand,
a dried-out ball of twigs.

155
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,790
In strong winds, it can travel.

156
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,000
This plant may have been dead
for 100 years.

157
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,270
Yet its name suggests
that all is not lost,

158
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
for this is a resurrection plant.

159
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,440
Around here, rain might only
fall once or twice a year.

160
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,110
But if you're searching for decades,
that might be enough.

161
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,470
Dead limbs absorb water
and unfurl in a matter of minutes.

162
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,760
But the resurrection plant
needs one more miracle.

163
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,630

164
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,920
Rain must fall on its branches

165
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,560
before they dry out and close up again.

166
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,920
Within hours, shoots emerge.

167
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,790
In just a few weeks,

168
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,000
they flower and develop seeds
of their own.

169
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,000
Then, before they can grow any larger,

170
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,590
the sun kills them.

171
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,830
But their seeds live on,
ready for when the rains return,

172
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,320
even if that is a century from now.

173
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,110
North Africa wasn't always so brutal.

174
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,120
Scattered across the Sahara
are glimpses of life

175
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,030
before the apocalypse
swept over the land.

176
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,230
In the north, a petrified forest,
trees turned to stone.

177
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,520
Remains from a far distant,
wetter past.

178
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,710
White sediments in the heart
of the Sahara are the dried-out remains

179
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,000
of what was once
the world's largest lake.

180
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,670
In the east, ruined cities
hark back to a time of plenty.

181
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,310
And here, deep inside Libya,
is Messak Settafet.

182
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,560
Carved here are hundreds
of images of animals,

183
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,470
all drawn from life.

184
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,190
Ghosts from a greener time.

185
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,400
Remarkably, a remnant
of this old North Africa survives.

186
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,080
Bou-Hedma in Tunisia
is sustained by mountain rains.

187
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,510
It's a relic of the savannah
that once carpeted North Africa.

188
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,070
The vast grassland vanished

189
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,070
when a shift in the Earth's orbit
drove the rains south,

190
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
and in perhaps
only a matter of centuries,

191
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,830
the Sahara Desert
overwhelmed North Africa.

192
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,550
The evidence suggests this took place
around 6,000 years ago.

193
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,800
In evolutionary terms,
that's no time at all.

194
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,990
And life has had little chance
to adapt to this new world.

195
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,270
Only a few tough specialists

196
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,240
can cope with life amongst the dunes.

197
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,110
Camels are sometimes called
ships of the desert.

198
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,960
But, like the swallows,
they're really only visitors here.

199
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,400
These ships can certainly
cross the Sahara,

200
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,630
but even they can't make their home
in the harshest places.

201
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,390
Left to wander the desert by themselves,
camels would not survive.

202
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,790
They depend on their human navigators
to find oases and wells.

203
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,310
Saharan folklore
is full of tales of caravans

204
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,480
that missed a well
by a few hundred metres and disappeared.

205
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,040
This is the White Desert, in Egypt.

206
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,230
The landscape is littered
with giant chalk pillars,

207
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,120
carved by innumerable sandstorms.

208
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,720
This glaring white oven is lethally hot.

209
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,400
Food here is almost non-existent.

210
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,790
But there's a rare gift
from a passing camel.

211
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,280
The smell has lured dung beetles
from miles around.

212
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,110
For them, this is manna from heaven.

213
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,160
One dung ball could provide enough food

214
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,360
to last this female beetle
the rest of her life.

215
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,350
But she has a problem.

216
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,840
To keep it fresh,
she must bury it in moist ground.

217
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,830
And that's not easy to find.

218
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,760
The temperature
has already risen 10 degrees.

219
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,760
This lizard avoids the roasting sand.

220
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,720
Only 30 centimetres above the surface,
it's significantly cooler.

221
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,350
The reverse-pushing technique
is certainly the fastest way

222
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,510
to keep the ball rolling.

223
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,190
But it does have one drawback.

224
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,230
You can't see where you're going.

225
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,000
Disaster!

226
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,000
Stuck between two dunes.

227
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,880
The dung ball is twice her weight,

228
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,560
but the urge to keep pushing
is inextinguishable.

229
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,360
Now, it's 41 degrees Celsius.

230
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,150
Soon, she'll be baked alive.

231
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,680
Her survival instinct, in the end,
overrides her love for dung.

232
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,510

233
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,600
Much of the Sahara is uninhabitable,

234
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,880
but there are rare places where
there is some possibility of survival.

235
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,560
Places where, by strange chance,
there is water.

236
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,750
Waw an-Namus is an extinct volcano.

237
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,470
From space, it's a remote,
black scar on the Libyan Sahara.

238
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,990
Yet there are other colours here,
colours rarely seen on the desert floor.

239
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,680
Blue and green.

240
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,190
Rain fell thousands of years ago
when the Sahara was green

241
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,190
and percolated deep into the ground.

242
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,550
And here water from this vast,
ancient reservoir rises to the surface.

243
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,510
These pools offer another glimpse
of the Sahara's past.

244
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,430
Wherever there's water in North Africa,

245
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,830
living relics from this wetter time
have a chance to cling on.

246
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,160
This oasis is fed
by a hot volcanic spring.

247
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,720
Slightly away from the
stream of near-boiling water,

248
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,080
it's cooler and fish can live.

249
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,630
These are Tilapia.

250
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,000
Hatchlings stick close to their mother.

251
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,990
There are other dangers here
beside the scalding water.

252
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,710
Particularly at night.

253
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,040
The crocodiles are stealthy.

254
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,560
And the Tilapia
are almost blind in the darkness.

255
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,310
In panic, they all leap
to escape the hunter's approach.

256
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,160
But this female can't abandon her brood.

257
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,870
The crocodiles won't be thwarted.
They, too, can leap.

258
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,080
With first light, the crocodiles
lose the element of surprise,

259
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,520
and the battle is over for now.

260
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,800
The mother fish has survived,
but where are her young?

261
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,600
All present and correct.

262
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,190
They spent the whole night
sheltering in her mouth.

263
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,710
The contest will be repeated at sunset.

264
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,870
There is nowhere else to go.

265
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,950
Oases are always sought
by desert travellers

266
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,630
but not all are as they seem.

267
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,470
This is the great Ubari Sand Sea,

268
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,760
in the heart of the Sahara.

269
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,600
These swallows have travelled
1,500 miles since they left Nigeria.

270
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,230
Their superb powers of navigation
will eventually guide them to Europe,

271
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,960
but now they,
and other thirsty migrants,

272
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,910
need to find a speck of blue
amidst this ocean of sand.

273
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,840

274
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,350
And here it is,

275
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,190
Umm al-Maa.

276
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,000
Here, too, ancient groundwater
wells up to the surface.

277
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,640

278
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,830
But the birds need to be careful,

279
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,520
for the sun has played a terrible trick.

280
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,670
This oasis is poisonous.

281
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,830
Intense evaporation
over thousands of years

282
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,230
has left the water saltier than the sea.

283
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,630
As if to underline the horror,

284
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,030
the place is infested
by vast swarms of flies.

285
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,710

286
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,590
But this plague is the birds' salvation.

287
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,000
The flies are filled with freshwater,
filtered from the brine.

288
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,190
So, like a desert wanderer
squeezing a drink from a cactus,

289
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,840
the birds get all the water they need
from the flies' bodies.

290
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,510
More and more migrants join in.

291
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,470
Wagtails.

292
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,560

293
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,950
This is the birds' only stopover.

294
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:25,000
It gives them enough fuel
to escape from the Sahara and Africa.

295
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,070
Away from an oasis, it seems remarkable
that anything can live at all.

296
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,920
The temperature of the sands
can exceed 70 degrees Celsius.

297
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,840
There's not the slightest trace of water
left at the surface.

298
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,280
And when that happens,
the Sahara itself cries out.

299
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,950

300
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,360
Billions of sliding grains
generate a hum

301
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,350
that echoes
across miles of empty desert.

302
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,760
These are the Sahara's
legendary singing dunes.

303
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600

304
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,510
Over time, these avalanches add up.

305
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,600
If you watch the dunes for long enough,
something remarkable is revealed.

306
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,310
One and a half years
flash past in a matter of seconds.

307
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,800
On this timescale,
the dunes are like a stormy sea.

308
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,590
An unstoppable tsunami of sand.

309
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,350
In this immense,
ever-shifting landscape,

310
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,670
it's easy to see how
a lost traveller could succumb

311
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,960
to what's been called
the Sahara's only endemic disease -

312
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,600
madness.

313
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,190
Can anything survive
the North African desert

314
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,080
when the sun is at its fiercest?

315
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,750
It's approaching midday.

316
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,560
A fringe-toed lizard is hungry.

317
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,760
He's on a stakeout.

318
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,590
Flashy scales reflect
some of the sun's rays.

319
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,950
Nevertheless,
the heat is almost unbearable.

320
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,670
His prey hasn't left home all day.

321
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,520
The lizard is the last animal
still out on the dunes.

322
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,070
But even he can't take it any more.

323
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,040
To survive longer,
you'd need a spacesuit.

324
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,950
And in a way,
that's what these insects have.

325
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,150
Silver ants' armoured skin
reflects light.

326
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,880
They can tolerate temperatures
that would kill any other land animal.

327
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,280
Even so, they can only survive for
less than 10 minutes in the midday sun.

328
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,030
Time is precious.

329
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,840
The ants race to find food
as soon as their predators go to ground.

330
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,670
They can't afford to waste
a second getting lost,

331
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,350
so they spin
to take a bearing from the sun.

332
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,840
They log every change of direction,
every footstep

333
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,990
in order to know exactly where they are
and where their nest lies.

334
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,910
Only four minutes to spare and
they've found a victim of heat stroke.

335
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,750
A meal.

336
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,480
But it's going to take
a monumental effort to get it home.

337
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,790
Three minutes to go and they're
nearing their maximum temperature,

338
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,080
an astounding 53 degrees Celsius.

339
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,040
But there are already casualties.

340
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
One minute left,
and they're not going to make it.

341
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,790
Something has to change.

342
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,470
The silver ant is the hardiest
of all desert inhabitants.

343
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,400
Even so, it can only survive outside
in the middle of the day

344
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,880
for a matter of minutes.

345
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,550
Now, the desert belongs
to the sun alone.

346
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,080
The sun has scorched life
from the Sahara.

347
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:29,030
And yet the vast desert it created
is a source of life half a world away.

348
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:39,200
The advancing Sahara
vaporised the world's largest lake,

349
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,110
leaving behind the silvery remains
of countless microscopic algae.

350
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,520
In winter, the wind carries away
700,000 tonnes

351
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,280
of this mineral-rich dust every day.

352
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,040
It blows from here
all the way to South America,

353
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,440
where, astonishingly,
it fertilises the Amazon Rainforest.

354
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,430
A striking demonstration
of the reach of this mighty continent.

355
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,110
Throughout its long history,

356
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,360
Africa has influenced the entire planet.

357
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,480
It was the cradle of
a remarkable array of land animals

358
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,280
that spread across the globe.

359
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,040
And, of course,
it was the ancestral home of all of us.

360
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,780

361
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,160
This is the tale of 
two of the Africa team's

362
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,600
most challenging desert expeditions.

363
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,950

364
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,720
One focused on a minuscule creature
with an incredible turn of speed.

365
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,520
The other on a subject so slow,
to film it in action would take years.

366
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,790

367
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,080
In both cases, the Sahara
would push crews to the limit

368
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,230
in pursuit of the perfect shot.

369
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,880
In Tunisia, the mission is to
capture footage of moving sand dunes,

370
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,240
something that's never been tried
like this before.

371
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,070
The problem is that
because the dunes move so slowly,

372
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,310
we're going to have to leave
cameras here for about 20 months,

373
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,550
and that just means there's
a huge potential for things to go wrong.

374
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,200
And with filmmaking,
if something can go wrong,

375
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,710
it usually will.

376
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,910
Two local shepherds, Amur and Nasser,

377
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,960
have volunteered to tend the equipment full-time.

378
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,880
The camera tower will be the tallest
structure for as far as the eye can see.

379
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,040
And there are three other cameras
at lower angles.

380
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,280
All this toil will yield
surprisingly scant results.

381
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,950
WRIGHT: They've programmed the cameras
to take one photo every day,

382
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,030
that's only 365 photographs a year.

383
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,320
Which, when you run it at normal speed,
just over 14 seconds.

384
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,440
I think it's taken longer
to explain what's going to happen

385
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,030
than the end result will actually be.

386
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,510
The cameras are left to
the mercy of the sun, wind and sand.

387
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,920
In the meantime, crews are shooting
all across North Africa.

388
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,070
In Egypt, the challenge
is to get into the world

389
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,520
of the most heat-tolerant
desert animal -

390
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,430
the silver ant.

391
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,990
They're really small,
they're really fast.

392
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,230
Like, you're not too sure
if you've seen an ant.

393
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,760
The crew have three weeks
to gather the footage they need.

394
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,710
We're going to try a tracking 
shot on this ant nest.

395
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,960
Moving forward towards it,

396
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,600
as the ants pour out of the hole
in their millions.

397
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,750
Not only are these insects super-fast,

398
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,430
they also keep antisocial hours.

399
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,630
The thing is,
we need to be out here

400
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,310
in the middle of the day
to film these ants.

401
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,830
They don't do what they do
when it's nice and cool

402
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,960
at 7:00, 8:00 in the morning.

403
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,510
I can't remember ever being in a place

404
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,430
where the wind was so relentless
and the temperatures were so high.

405
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,790
The insufferable heat
is not the only problem.

406
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,920
Dangers are everywhere.

407
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,950

408
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,160
There's a really fat scorpion,
it's really big!

409
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,830
One, two, three...

410
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,960

411
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,870
This might kill.

412
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

413
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,400
It's big and they have
a lot of poison in his dart thing.

414
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,640
What, that thing there?

415
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,200
Oh, my god!

416
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,550
Don't touch it!

417
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,630
The scorpion will be released

418
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,000
far, far away from the camp,
in a shady spot.

419
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,960
No such luck for the team.
They're back to work in the midday sun.

420
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,630
This is... This is too much.

421
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,230
This is crazy! This is crazy!

422
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,950
Indeed.

423
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,000
The heat seems to have given Kat
and Warwick a touch of Saharan madness.

424
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,840
The plan is to do an experiment,

425
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,830
to find out how fast these little ants can run.

426
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,430
So we're going to lay this
along the floor,

427
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,120
and hopefully an ant will
run alongside it,

428
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,710
and we can film it at high speed.

429
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,990
And from that, calculate their...
their speed,

430
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,680
and perhaps try and relate it
to how fast that would be for a human.

431
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,430
Like me.

432
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,110
Silver ants are expert navigators,

433
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,110
using the angle of the sun
to calculate their position.

434
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,030
But for our team, even basic
mental tasks are becoming a challenge.

435
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,190
Count a second.

436
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,110
See one running and then count a second,
see how far it gets.

437
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,160
It's quite difficult
to count a second, isn't it?

438
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,310
No, it's "one".

439
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,710
"One", yeah!

440
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,110
There he goes.

441
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,470
He's gone 10 centimetres
in four seconds,

442
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,950
but we're running
at 500 frames a second,

443
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,400
which is 20 times normal time.

444
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,040
So, in fact, he's covered
those 10 centimetres in...

445
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,000
We know that he does
half a metre in one second.

446
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,510
Half a metre per second, yep.

447
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,680
- 50 centimetres in one second, roughly.
- Yeah, yeah.

448
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,040
So, how many body lengths is that?

449
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,480
He's maybe doing
five body lengths a second

450
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,790
if he's two metres tall, like I am.

451
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,870
Are you?

452
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,030
Yeah. That's how much more
than a normal man I am.

453
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,350
Eventually, the duo decide that 
if the silver ants were our size,

454
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,320
they'd be doing 280 miles an hour.

455
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,430
They're one of the fastest sprinters
in the animal kingdom.

456
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,910
No wonder we've been
struggling to film them.

457
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,040
It does explain a few things.

458
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,510
Ant-letics!

459
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,630
Knowing the exact speed of the ants
is all well and good,

460
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,110
but there's still a great deal of work
to be done before the shoot finishes.

461
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,390
However, in Tunisia,
there's no shortage of time,

462
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,680
and hopefully no news is good news
as far as Amur and Nasser are concerned.

463
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,920
The final week in Egypt, and the crew
seem to be adapting to life in the oven.

464
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,790
Practice is making perfect,
and the sequence is coming together.

465
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,800
I think we've got some lovely shots.

466
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,000
Every single shot's
been really hard-earned.

467
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,640
But getting down in the ants' world

468
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,830
is now taking its toll on the kit.

469
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,270
It's running to stand still,

470
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,350
the business of blowing dust
off these things.

471
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,750

472
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,520
Oh, no!

473
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,030
It's got dust in it!

474
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,760

475
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,880
Ooh, crunch.

476
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,680
SLOSS: I think these ants
are stunning-looking.

477
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,720
Near-impossible to film, I think,
because of the speed they had.

478
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,520
But, you know, I've come to love them
over the days and weeks.

479
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,200
With the sequence in the bag,

480
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,830
Warwick wants the
final traditional sunset shot.

481
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,310
It's the best time of day
to film sunsets, in the evening.

482
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,630
That's experience that tells me that,

483
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,520
I've been doing this for years.
You learn these things.

484
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,320
Thanks to Warwick's experience,
including sunsets, he and Kat

485
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,030
have captured the extraordinary life
of the speedy silver ant.

486
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,360
Over a year later, in Tunisia,

487
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,000
it's time to take down
the sand dune cameras.

488
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,390
Bonjour!

489
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,280
- Nasser.
- Amur.

490
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,400
Hi. Hello again.

491
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,470
So how's it been,
has it been good?

492
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,030
It's okay, but two days ago,
we have a little bit, small problem.

493
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,550
After surviving 600 days in the desert,

494
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,030
the small problem is that
the cameras have been vandalised.

495
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,310
I'm really hot and bothered now,
it's 40 degrees,

496
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,920
and someone's smashed the cameras.

497
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,400
Not been a good
start to the day, to be honest.

498
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,520
There's no doubt the dunes have moved.

499
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,750
But the question is
whether the equipment has survived.

500
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,520
That is amazing.
The camera's still here.

501
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,150
I guess maybe it just took them so long
to get through the toughened plastic,

502
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,390
that they felt they had
made so much noise

503
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,830
that they were worried
about the guards coming,

504
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,230
because they only sleep
a couple of hundred metres away.

505
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,830
After almost two years of waiting,
it's the moment of truth.

506
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,640
We're going to find out,
to find out whether or not

507
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,920
the cameras have actually recorded anything.

508
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,150
It's just hugely stressful because
it's never been done before.

509
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,150
The footage is a surreal 
window into a secret world,

510
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,750
the private life of a sand dune.

511
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,400

512
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,390
The Africa team struggled under the burning sun

513
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,310
and driving winds
that are hallmarks of the Sahara.

514
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,590
They went home with an
enormous admiration for the creatures

515
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:51,310
that spend their entire lives battling
to survive in this brutal desert world.
