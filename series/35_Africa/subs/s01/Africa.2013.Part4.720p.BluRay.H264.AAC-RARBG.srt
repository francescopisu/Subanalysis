1
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,000
The Cape of Good Hope,

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,040
on Africa's southerly tip.

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,520
Here, two great seas meet.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
One, the warm Indian Ocean,

5
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,280
the other, the chilly Atlantic.

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,440
And as they mingle,
so they create a billowing cloak

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,880
that drapes the summit
of Table Mountain.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,400
Spectacular though this is,
the mountain's cloudy covering

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,400
is only a hint of the profound influence

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,400
that these two very different oceans
have on the fortunes of life here.

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,320
And not just here at the Cape,

13
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,880
but across the length and breadth
of southern Africa.

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,360
Two thousand miles north from the Cape,

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,000
beneath this sandy beach,

16
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,880
new life is stirring.

17
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,880

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Hundreds of baby green turtles

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,160
emerge like a torrent
from the safety of their nest.

20
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,200
Each one, just seven centimetres long,

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,960
must make a 100-metre sprint
down the beach.

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,040
From the moment they hatch,

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,160
they're driven by an instinctive urge
to run to the sea.

24
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,800
Few creatures start life

25
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,040
with the odds for success
so heavily stacked against them.

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,080
Yellow-billed kites.

27
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,360
Pied crows.

28
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,400

29
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,240
But so many of these hatchlings
appear together

30
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,640
that predators can't catch them all.

31
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Last out, this baby might seem doomed.

32
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,080
But struggling out late
could just give her a chance.

33
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160

34
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,000
The crows seem insatiable.

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,800
Even those that reach
the sea aren't safe.

36
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,320
This female has to make a dash for it.

37
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,760
She's still in danger,
and not just from above.

38
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,560
A ghost crab may be smaller
than the hatchling,

39
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,240
but it has the strength
to drag her into its lair.

40
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
Not this time.

41
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
At last, the sea.

42
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,840

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,920
She has to catch a breath
if she's not to drown.

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,920
But the pounding waves
make it desperately difficult.

45
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,280

46
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,680
Beyond the surf, calmer water.

47
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
But even here,
the hatchling is not out of danger.

48
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,080
She dives.

49
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,280
Just in time.

50
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,800
Only one hatchling in a thousand
will survive to adulthood.

51
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,080
But if she does,
she may live for 80 years.

52
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,120
For now,
the ocean is there to be explored.

53
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
As the hatchling disappears
into the deep blue,

54
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
she swims into the waters

55
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,560
of one the planet's
most powerful currents,

56
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
the Agulhas.

57
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,040
The Agulhas sweeps south
towards the Cape,

58
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
transporting 100 billion gallons
of warm water every day.

59
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,320
These tropical seas are so warm,

60
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,920
they evaporate on an enormous scale.

61
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Water vapour rises until, at altitude,

62
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,360
it cools and condenses into clouds.

63
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,160
As the clouds drift inland,

64
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,080
they bring rain to one of the least
explored corners of our planet,

65
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,400
the mountains of Mozambique.

66
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,680

67
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,800
This the wettest place
in Southern Africa.

68
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
Decades of civil war

69
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,360
have kept travellers away
from this little-known land.

70
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,240
It was satellite mapping

71
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
that revealed the full extent
of the forest that grows here.

72
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,240
So now it's known to outsiders
as the Google rainforest.

73
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,240

74
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
It could also be called
the butterfly forest.

75
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,560
After the rains,

76
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,400
butterflies have emerged together
in huge numbers.

77
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,800
As soon as their wings dry out,
they will take to the air.

78
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Their goal, to find a mate.

79
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,200
But how?

80
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,880
There may be thousands close by,

81
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
but the foliage is so thick

82
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,640
it's difficult for them
to find each other.

83
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,080

84
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,840
They have a remarkable solution.

85
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,200
They follow rivers upstream
and travel to higher ground.

86
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,520
The journey can take hours
of determined flying.

87
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,800
Eventually they emerge
into the only open space there is.

88
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,760
The treeless peak of Mount Mabu.

89
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,160
Up here, free from the confines
of the forest,

90
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,160
they hold a butterfly ball.

91
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,840
Now, the butterflies have all the space
they need for their aerobatic courtship.

92
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,280
The male's strategy is simple,

93
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
fly higher and faster
than the competition

94
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,000
and just maybe you'll win
a virgin female.

95
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,800
This spectacular gathering,
unseen by outsiders until now,

96
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,000
happens for just half an hour
each morning

97
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,280
and for just a few weeks in the year.

98
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
Once mated, the females descend

99
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
back to the rainforest
to lay their eggs.

100
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,040
A forest that only exists

101
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,680
because of moisture rising
from the warm Agulhas current

102
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,320
hundreds of miles away
in the Indian Ocean.

103
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,440
The rainwater now flows southwards
from Mozambique's highest peaks

104
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,800
to the lowlands of the Eastern Cape.

105
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,440
And where the land flattens,
rivers slow,

106
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,240
creating a vast swamp 50 miles across.

107
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,320
This is Gorongosa.

108
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,200
Here, all kinds of creatures come
to catch fish.

109
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,040

110
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200

111
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,280
Whiskered catfish work as a team.

112
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,400
They take a gulp of air at the surface

113
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,640
and then belch it out underwater
to create a net of bubbles,

114
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
and that traps little fish.

115
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
There are fish for everyone.

116
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,800
And each species has its own technique
for catching them.

117
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,760

118
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,800
It's all very well having a big beak

119
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,320
but you've still got to know
how to use it.

120
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,400
This young pelican has a lot to learn,

121
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,360
and not long to do so.

122
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,760

123
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,840
Maybe, like the catfish,
teamwork is the answer.

124
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,680
It's certainly working for the flock,

125
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,560
and this pelican seems to be
getting the hang of it.

126
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,400
But surely
it can't swallow that catfish.

127
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,440
Trying to was a mistake.

128
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,440

129
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,160
The rainwater,
briefly held in Gorongosa's swamp,

130
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,880
has now been enriched
with silt and sand.

131
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,000
All down this coast,
sediment-laden rivers,

132
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,560
the Zambezi, the Limpopo,
the Save, drain back to the sea,

133
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,040
and there they meet
the Agulhas Current.

134
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,200
And what happens to all that sand?

135
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
Over the millennia,
the Agulhas has worked it

136
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
into a complex underwater landscape.

137
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,960
This vast sand sculpture
is the Bazaruto Archipelago,

138
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,080
the oldest of its kind in the world.

139
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,320
It may look like paradise,
but living here is not easy.

140
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,120

141
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,360
For 100,000 years

142
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,440
the Agulhas Current has battered
these submerged dunes

143
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
with underwater sandstorms.

144
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,080
But where the water is deep enough
to escape these storms,

145
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,000
nutrients carried from Africa's interior
fuel an explosion of life.

146
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,800
A rare oceanic hunter rules here.

147
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,840
Giant kingfish.

148
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,400
As big as a man and, weight for weight,

149
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,920
one of the most powerful fish
in the sea.

150
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,640
Despite their size,

151
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
they're extraordinarily agile
when hunting.

152
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
Normally, kingfish are solitary,

153
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,400
but for just a few weeks each year,
they gather at places like Bazaruto

154
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,840
and prepare for an extraordinary journey,

155
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
one that will take them far inland.

156
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,360
The Mtentu River.

157
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,040
The king of kingfish
leads them upstream.

158
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,080
As they travel further into freshwater,

159
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
they seem to change
from aggressive hunters

160
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,560
into dedicated pilgrims.

161
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,200
Now, many miles from their natural home,

162
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,920
and in response to an unknown cue,

163
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,400
they stop and begin to circle.

164
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,160
Other marine fish that migrate upriver
usually do so in order to breed,

165
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,160
but there's no evidence that
these kingfish spawn up here.

166
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,800
Neither do they hunt.

167
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,800
So, what are they doing?

168
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
In truth, the purpose of this strange
behaviour is still unknown.

169
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,760
Within a few weeks, they will retrace
their journey back to the ocean.

170
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
The lives of kingfish,

171
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,760
like those of turtles, and butterflies,
and pelicans,

172
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,720
are influenced by the Agulhas Current.

173
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,120
But that influence
can only reach so far.

174
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,200
And this is why.

175
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,600
The Drakensberg Mountains.

176
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,520
Here, local people say that
the vultures soar so high

177
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
they can see into the future.

178
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,000
These sheer cliffs,
rising to over 3,000 metres,

179
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,720
hold back the advancing rain clouds,
and as a result,

180
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,040
the land beyond them
is starved of water.

181
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,360
This is the greatest expanse
of sand in the world,

182
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
a seemingly endless desert

183
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,480
that is the vast, parched centre
of Southern Africa.

184
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,440
Thousands of miles to the west,

185
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
where this desert meets
the Atlantic Ocean,

186
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,240
another current prevails.

187
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,400
But the Benguela Current,
surging up the west side of Africa,

188
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,560
has a very different character.

189
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,400

190
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,480
It's extremely cold, full of nutrients,

191
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,320
and it's thronged with life.

192
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,600
A great white shark.

193
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,840
They can raise their body temperature

194
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,120
to 10 degrees above that
of the surrounding sea.

195
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,120
But doing so requires an enormous amount
of high-grade fuel.

196
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,960
So this is a great bonanza for them.

197
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,200
The body of a dead whale.

198
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,560
The carcass will draw in
every great white for miles around.

199
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,040
And here, off Cape Town,
that means a lot of sharks.

200
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,680
Instead of feeding in a frenzy,

201
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,040
these sharks have rather refined
table manners.

202
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,400
They swim side by side to get
the measure of each other,

203
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,240
then each takes its turn.

204
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,240
This female is the biggest,
so she eats first.

205
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,000
The next only feeds
when she gives way.

206
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,560
The waters of the Benguela are so rich,

207
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,560
they support more great white sharks
than any other seas on the planet.

208
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,520

209
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,040
And they are so cold,

210
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,960
they attract some surprising creatures
to these African shores.

211
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,920

212
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,360
Penguins.

213
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,560
African penguins.

214
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,000
This female is returning
to relieve her partner.

215
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,240
Of course, there's no ice here,

216
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,960
but these rocks
can be almost as slippery.

217
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000

218
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,000
But there are more serious obstacles
than the slippery rocks awaiting them.

219
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,480
It's his turn to feed,

220
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,400
so he leaves her
to look after their eggs.

221
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,160
Now, she must tackle a problem faced
by no other kind of penguin.

222
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,680
For the next 10 days,
she must protect her eggs

223
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
from the African sun.

224
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,200
A dense coat of feathers that keeps
her warm in cold seas

225
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,880
now stifles her.

226
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,760
On these exposed rocks, she must shade
her eggs instead of keeping them warm.

227
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,880
Everything here seems
the wrong way round.

228
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,680
For some, the soaring temperature

229
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,160
is too much.

230
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,400
A neighbour deserts his nest.

231
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,680
His egg will not survive.

232
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,920
He's not the only one to give up.

233
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,320
Some years,
not a single chick is reared.

234
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Penguins are adapted to withstand
temperatures of 40 degrees below zero,

235
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,440
not 40 degrees above.

236
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,640

237
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,640
Now, at the hottest part of the day,
the very worst time,

238
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,800
her chicks are hatching.

239
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,600
Just when they need her most,

240
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,680
she's reaching the limit
of her endurance.

241
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,200
After 10 days of intensive fishing,

242
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,240
the chick's father comes back
to take his turn at the nest.

243
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,720
But will he be too late?

244
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,120

245
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,080

246
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,640
He greets his young
for the very first time.

247
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,680

248
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,080
The coolness of the Benguela Current
brought the penguins here.

249
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,680
But that very coolness is
a great disadvantage

250
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,040
because it generates little rain.

251
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,840
It can, however, produce moisture
in a different form.

252
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,400

253
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,120
A thick blanket of fog
rolls in from the sea

254
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,840
and condenses on this thirsty land.

255
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,760
And each year, the desert bursts into
life with a dazzling display.

256
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,120
Water is so scarce that this show
will not last long,

257
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,040
so plants compete to attract
their pollinators with colour.

258
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,760
Here in Namaqualand,
a 600-mile strip of coastal desert

259
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,440
becomes carpeted with blooms.

260
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,760
The morning sun opens a Namaqua Daisy

261
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,600
and reveals a male monkey beetle

262
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,720
asleep inside.

263
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,920
Nights here are so cold,

264
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,080
that monkey beetles shelter within
the closed up petals of the daisies.

265
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,840
The habit brings benefits to both sides.

266
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,280
The beetle is kept warm
and the flower gets pollinated.

267
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,960
But now the beetle has urgent business.

268
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,040
He must find a mate.

269
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,200

270
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,360
As he searches,
he hops from bloom to bloom,

271
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,600
pollinating each in turn.

272
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,640
At last, he spots a potential mate.

273
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,680
A golden princess.

274
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,040
But here comes trouble.

275
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,160
A rival.

276
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,160
There's no time for introductions.

277
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
But he's been too slow.

278
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,200
The rivals immediately begin to brawl.

279
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,760
The female will only mate
inside the daisy,

280
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,480
so they wrestle for possession.

281
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,720
They're so engrossed in fighting
they've pushed her off.

282
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,640
The challenger is ejected.

283
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,440
The winner wastes no time before getting
back to business.

284
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,560
At last.

285
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,360
Now there will be a new generation
of monkey beetles

286
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,920
to pollinate these Namaqualand flowers.

287
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,680
For most of the year,
this land is desperately dry,

288
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,760
but just occasionally, brief, violent
storms sweep in from the cold ocean.

289
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,720

290
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,120
Springbok have been roaming this desert
for many months,

291
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,760
searching for one of these rare
and highly-localised downpours.

292
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,840

293
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,160
The grass is sprouting.

294
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,640
And that is worth celebrating.

295
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
If you're a springbok

296
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,760
that means pronking.

297
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,160
We still don't know
exactly why they do this.

298
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,920
The simplest answer

299
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,160
is that they're dancing for joy.

300
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,560
Africa's most southerly tip.

301
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,520
This is where the two
great ocean currents,

302
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,920
the warm Agulhas and the cold Benguela,
crash into one another.

303
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,480
And this collision, in itself,
draws in life in abundance.

304
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,280

305
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,160
A super-pod of hunting dolphins,
5,000 strong.

306
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,840

307
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,320
And shadowing them,

308
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,840
Africa's biggest predator,

309
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,960
a Bryde's whale.

310
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,080
This female is 15 metres long

311
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,400
and weighs more than
a whole family of elephants.

312
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,120
The dolphins are in pursuit of sardines.

313
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,760
Millions of them!

314
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,440
But these cold-water fish
are heading towards

315
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,080
an impenetrable barrier of warm water

316
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,320
that they will not cross,

317
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,080
the Agulhas Current.

318
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,440

319
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,400
They're trapped.

320
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,120
And that gives the whale her chance.

321
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,720
But the sardines are so speedy

322
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,000
that the whale only catches
a few with each pass.

323
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,360
More and more hunters arrive.

324
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,240

325
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,880
The whale needs the other hunters,
to push the fish upwards,

326
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,120
forcing them against the surface.

327
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,440
Now they have nowhere to escape.

328
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,400
With each lumbering turn,
she loses precious time,

329
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,360
time that favours the more nimble.

330
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,040
The Bryde's whale probably knows
that this opportunity

331
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,560
will last less than five minutes.

332
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,560
And with the last few lunges,
she finally cashes in.

333
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,440
The forces that triggered
this great event

334
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,200
have also shaped the fortunes of life

335
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,400
far beyond this particular battleground.

336
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,080
Without these currents,
Southern Africa would be a desert.

337
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,920
But combined, the very different powers
of the Agulhas and the Benguela

338
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,280
have transformed the Cape
into a land where life can flourish.

339
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,040
The Comoros Islands
off Africa's east coast,

340
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,920
are a haven for green turtles.

341
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,320
Every year, a million turtles
hatch on these beaches,

342
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,120
but the chances of any
one of them surviving is tiny.

343
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,040

344
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,400

345
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,840
The Africa team came here
to try and capture

346
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,440
the dramatic first few minutes
in the lives of these baby turtles.

347
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,840
It was to be both a technical
and surprisingly emotional challenge.

348
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,680
FLAY: It's only when you get down
on the eye level of the baby turtle

349
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,800
that you realise what an enormous
journey it's got to make down the beach.

350
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,640
And it really is quite epic.

351
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,440
PEARSON: That's fine.
Oh, yeah, that's lovely.

352
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,480
It's using all of these complicated,
heavy bits of equipment,

353
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,440
which hopefully will enable us
to get into the world of a turtle

354
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,040
which is just a few inches long.

355
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,400
As they break out of all the
soft sand, they hit the hard sand

356
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,440
and that's where
the real sprint takes place.

357
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,480
They must be desperate to hit that water

358
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,360
because you can see,
the sea's just over the horizon.

359
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,760
We were following them all the way down
and you do kind of get

360
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,960
involved with them and cheering them on.

361
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,200
FLAY: Okay, slow down a bit, slow down.

362
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,960
And then suddenly all these crows
come flocking in

363
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,760
and start picking them off

364
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,400
and you just think
that's just so unfair.

365
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,320
PEARSON: Lots more coming in.
There's loads coming in now.

366
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,640
FLAY: And you've got to feel for them.

367
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,720
You know, it's really quite upsetting,

368
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,600
particularly when you're looking through
the camera and I'm just filling a frame

369
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,320
with a turtle running down the beach,

370
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,600
then suddenly from nowhere
a beak comes in and woosh, and that's it.

371
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,880
That turtle is no more.

372
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,560
The turtles that escape

373
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,080
the perils of the beach

374
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,440
still have to face pounding surf.

375
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,400
But at last, they're in their element.

376
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,360
More than can be said for the crew.

377
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,680
They're faster than you,
aren't they?

378
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,640
Yep. It's a bit embarrassing.

379
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,640
Beaten by something that's less
than a day old.

380
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,640
When we saw hatchlings
getting off the beach

381
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,080
and you see them going in
the white water you think

382
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,120
they'd just get obliterated.

383
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,240
They just punch through the water,
they do get flung around

384
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,760
but then they just right themselves,

385
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
keep on swimming,
and they're ahead of you

386
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,400
coming out the back of the wave
and it's amazing.

387
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,200
You're seeing all these
baby turtles getting picked off

388
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,080
left, right and centre,
but they just keep going.

389
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,440
They are just so resilient.

390
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,440

391
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,560
And that made what happened next
so distressing.

392
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,000
A particularly high spring tide
flooded the beach.

393
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,920
Any baby turtles still in their nests
would be lucky to survive.

394
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,160
- See it bubbling out as well, sea the air.
- Yeah.

395
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,880
Well, it means that basically
anything below that line

396
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,120
is going to be gone.

397
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,920
Let's hope and pray it's not, but...

398
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,760
As you say, we don't know.
Let's wait and see.

399
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,240
All across the world,
turtles are in decline.

400
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,120
Their eggs are stolen,

401
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,760
the adults are hunted for their flesh,

402
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,040
and they drown in fishing nets.

403
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,880
But here in the Comoros,
they have friends.

404
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,960
It's amazing here in Itsamia.
It's just a really heartening story

405
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,240
of how the local people

406
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,520
are doing everything they can
to protect, sort of,

407
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,800
what they think of as their turtles.

408
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,920
And some of the baby turtles
have survived the flood tide.

409
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,980
I've already found
two baby turtles in the nest.

410
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,720

411
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:38,699
If we save the nests
we help them to leave.

412
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,660
It's my village,

413
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:46,500
I must protect the baby turtles
and the big turtles,

414
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,740
it's for all of us.

415
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,360
The whole village comes
to help the hatchlings.

416
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,440
But the most important effort
is to protect the adults

417
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,520
from outsiders who would hunt them
for their meat.

418
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,080
They've taken it upon themselves
to really police the beaches around here

419
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,280
and make sure that poaching
is kept to a minimum.

420
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,360
The selfless
protection these people provide

421
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,520
means that this is one
of the few places in the world

422
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,560
where turtle numbers
are actually increasing.

423
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,120
And remarkably, here in Itsamia,

424
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,880
the population has, in fact, doubled
in the last decade.

425
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,480
As the shoot was coming to the end,
cameraman Kevin Flay

426
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,720
noticed that some of the turtles
that made it through the surf,

427
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,040
faced one last danger.

428
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,240
I'm getting shots
of a kite which is flying down

429
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
and taking turtles
off the water surface.

430
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,480
That was a part of the story
we had to tell.

431
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,360
The aim is for us

432
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,840
to be underwater looking straight up

433
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,160
as this happens
and that's actually really quite hard.

434
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,600
Okay. Three.

435
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,840
Two, one.

436
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,160
Undeterred, the crew got into position.

437
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,920
There we go, the kite's up.

438
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,440
You can't see where you're going
because my head's glued

439
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,120
to this viewfinder, so I'm banging
into rocks and things like that.

440
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,800
I'm really just trying to keep
the turtle in shot.

441
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,880
Something came in then?

442
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,920
She came in and swooped down
over the water's surface.

443
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,720
And you could see the kite
from underwater?

444
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,440
I could see it. I could see the shape.

445
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,120
In frame and you were running?
Yeah.

446
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Didn't take the turtle.
Didn't take the turtle.

447
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,440
Probably that's the best of both worlds.

448
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,640
because we got our lovely
underwater shot of a kite

449
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,440
and the turtle gets away!

450
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,640
This lucky hatchling isn't the only one.

451
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,320
With the help
of the village of Itsamia,

452
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,160
thousands more have a chance
to make it to the open ocean.

453
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,640
It's only really local
populations that can actually

454
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,000
support and sustain
this conservation work.

455
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,400
If it comes from the roots upwards

456
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,440
then it's got a chance of success.

457
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,000
You know, I think it's amazing,
I really do, the fact that they do this

458
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,640
and, you know, we should see it 
more often around the world.

459
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,400
It's hard not to admire these
extraordinary little creatures

460
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,720
as they battle against such odds.

461
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,960
This baby turtle won't touch land again

462
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,120
until she returns to the very same
island to lay her own eggs.

463
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,800
With luck, she'll find the beach
is still protected

464
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,920
by the people of Itsamia.
