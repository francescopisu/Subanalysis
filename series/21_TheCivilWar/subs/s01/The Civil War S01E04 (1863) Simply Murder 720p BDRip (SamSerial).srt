1
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:19,854
"IN THIS ARMY,

2
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,814
"ONE HOLE IN THE SEAT
OF THE BRITCHES

3
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,941
"INDICATES A CAPTAIN,

"TWO HOLES--A LIEUTENANT,

"AND THE SEAT OF THE PANTS
ALL OUT

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,074
INDICATES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL
IS A PRIVATE."

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,372
THEY BOTH HAD
A PARTICULAR WAY OF YELLING.

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,042
THE NORTHERN TROOPS MADE
A SORT OF HURRAH.

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,543
IT WAS CALLED BY ONE SOLDIER,

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,921
"THE DEEP, GENEROUS, MANLY
SHOUT" OF THE NORTHERN SOLDIER.

11
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,508
THE CONFEDERATES, OF COURSE, HAD
WHAT WAS CALLED THE REBEL YELL.

12
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,845
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT THAT SOUNDED LIKE.

13
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:56,390
ONE NORTHERNER DESCRIBED IT,
HE SAID--

14
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,519
HE DESCRIBED IT BY DESCRIBING
THE PECULIAR CORKSCREW SENSATION

15
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,522
THAT GOES UP YOUR BACKBONE
WHEN YOU HEAR IT,

16
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,692
AND HE SAID, "IF YOU CLAIM
YOU'VE HEARD IT

17
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,902
"AND WEREN'T SCARED,

18
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,321
THAT MEANS YOU NEVER
HEARD IT."

19
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:11,572
IT WAS...

20
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:16,035
IT WAS BASICALLY, I THINK,
A SORT OF FOX HUNT YIP

21
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,163
MIXED UP WITH A SORT
OF BANSHEE SQUALL.

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,999
AND IT WAS USED
ON THE ATTACK.

23
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,044
AND AN OLD CONFEDERATE VETERAN
AFTER THE WAR

24
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,963
WAS ASKED AT A UDC MEETING
IN TENNESSEE SOMEWHERE

25
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,799
TO GIVE THE REBEL YELL.

26
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,425
THE LADIES HAD NEVER
HEARD IT.

27
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:36,722
AND HE SAID, "IT CAN'T BE DONE,
EXCEPT AT A RUN,

28
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,010
"AND I COULDN'T DO IT ANYHOW

29
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,379
"WITH A MOUTH
FULL OF FALSE TEETH

30
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,268
AND A STOMACH FULL OF FOOD."

31
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,230
SO THEY NEVER GOT TO HEAR
WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.

32
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:04,416
THE CIVIL WAR
WAS FOUGHT IN 10,000 PLACES.

33
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:10,297
MURFREESBORO, CHAMBERSBURG,
DRANESVILLE, AND OPELOUSAS,

34
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,217
APACHE CANYON,
ST. AUGUSTINE,

35
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,845
PADUCAH, AND BRANDY STATION,

36
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,472
ON THE RED RIVER,
THE RAPPAHANNOCK,

37
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,516
AND THE RAPIDAN,

38
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:24,145
ACROSS THE SUSQUEHANNA
AND THE MONONGAHELA,

39
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,397
FROM MOUNT IDA
AND MOUNT OLIVE

40
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:28,732
TO MOUNT ZION,

41
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,153
FROM NINEVAH
AND NICKAJACK GAP

42
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,280
TO NEW BERNE, NEW CARTHAGE,

43
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,490
NEW IBERIA, NEW LISBON,

44
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,075
AND NEW HOPE,

45
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,827
FROM THE YAZOO DELTA

46
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,453
TO THE CHICKASAW BLUFFS.

47
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,796
BY 1863, THE TAIPING
REBELLION IN CHINA

48
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,591
HAD ENTERED ITS 13th YEAR.

49
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,428
CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT
IN AFGHANISTAN.

50
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:00,431
IN AMERICA, EDDIE CUTHBERT
OF THE PHILADELPHIA KEYSTONES

51
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,018
STOLE THE FIRST BASE
IN PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL.

52
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,385
THE NATIONAL ACADEMY
OF SCIENCE

53
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,354
WAS FOUNDED IN WASHINGTON.

54
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,690
THE ROLLER SKATE
WAS PATENTED,

55
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:12,151
AND HENRY FORD
AND WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST

56
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,485
WERE BORN.

57
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,493
IN 1863, CONFEDERATE GENERAL
STONEWALL JACKSON

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,537
WOULD BECOME A TERROR
TO THE UNION ARMY

59
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,166
AND A LEGEND
NORTH AND SOUTH.

60
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,876
JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN,

61
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,920
A COLLEGE PROFESSOR
FROM MAINE,

62
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,421
WOULD LEAD HIS REGIMENT
TO GLORY

63
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,257
ON HILLSIDES IN VIRGINIA
AND PENNSYLVANIA.

64
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,803
IN THE WILDERNESS
WEST OF FREDERICKSBURG,

65
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,138
ROBERT E. LEE WOULD DEVISE

66
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,599
ONE OF THE MOST DARING
AND BRILLIANT BATTLE PLANS

67
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:46,268
OF THE WAR...

68
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,562
WHILE 1,000 MILES
TO THE WEST,

69
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,190
ULYSSES S. GRANT
CONTINUED TO HAMMER AWAY

70
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,484
AT THE REBEL STRONGHOLD
AT VICKSBURG.

71
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,365
CONFEDERATE PRIVATE
SAM WATKINS

72
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,784
WOULD FIGHT AT MURFREESBORO,
SHELBYVILLE,

73
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,871
CHICKAMAUGA, LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN,
AND MISSIONARY RIDGE,

74
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,749
AND SOMEHOW SURVIVE,

75
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,376
WHILE ELISHA HUNT RHODES

76
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,711
WOULD HAVE THE BEST
FOURTH OF JULY OF HIS LIFE.

77
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,843
IN 1863, DESPITE
A NORTHERN VICTORY AT ANTIETAM,

78
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,387
DESPITE EMANCIPATION,

79
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,307
DESPITE A CLEAR SUPERIORITY
IN MEN AND MATERIEL,

80
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:28,310
THE UNION SEEMED CLOSE
TO FUMBLING ALL IT HAD.

81
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,231
MEANWHILE, FROM VICKSBURG
TO CHARLESTON,

82
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,275
THE FRAGILE CONFEDERATE
COALITION

83
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,819
WAS COMING APART,

84
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:40,030
AND YET SOMEHOW THE CONFEDERACY
STAYED ALIVE

85
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,366
BY THE DARING AND LUCK
AND GENIUS

86
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,742
OF ITS HIGH COMMAND.

87
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,291
BUT THE BIGGEST TESTS
WERE COMING THAT SUMMER

88
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,544
WHERE THE MISSISSIPPI
TOOK A SHARP TURN AT VICKSBURG

89
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,422

THEY HAD FOUGHT

155
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,456
ACROSS THE RAPPAHANNOCK
AT FREDERICKSBURG IN DECEMBER.

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,006
AT FREDERICKSBURG,
THERE WAS A... AN EXCHANGE

157

ACROSS THE RAPPAHANNOCK.

158
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,344
ONE OF THEM HOLLERED,
"HEY, REB,"

159
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,764

00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,350
"WHEN ARE YOU FELLAS
GOING TO COME OVER?"

161
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,893
THEY SAID, "WHEN WE GET
GOOD AND READY.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?"

163
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,729

"DON'T YOU WISH,
YOU MAY GET IT!"

165

166

172
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,377
OCCUPY THE TOWN,

173
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,673
THEN TAKE
THE THINLY DEFENDED HEIGHTS.

174
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,677
BOLD ACTION DID NOT COME
NATURALLY TO AMBROSE BURNSIDE,

175
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,524
THOUGH HE HAD LED HIS MEN
TO FREDERICKSBURG

176
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,763
DETERMINED TO DISPLAY

177
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,808
THE FIGHTING SPIRIT
HIS PREDECESSOR GEORGE McCLELLAN

178
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,977
HAD SO CONSPICUOUSLY LACKED.

179
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,439
BUT NOW THE WAR DEPARTMENT
FAILED HIM,

180
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,899
AND 17 DAYS PASSED

181
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,444
WAITING FOR PONTOON BRIDGES
TO ARRIVE.

182
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,947
BY THE TIME THE BRIDGE
WAS IN PLACE,

183
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:36,743
LEE HAD 75,000 MEN
WAITING IN THE HILLS.

184
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,122
STONEWALL JACKSON
WAS ON THE RIGHT,

185
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,707
JAMES LONGSTREET
ON THE LEFT

186
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,042
ALONG A BLUFF CALLED
MARYE'S HEIGHTS.

187
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,374
FROM THE TOP OF THE HEIGHTS,

188
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,382
LEE COULD JUST SEE
CHATHAM MANSION

189
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,634
ACROSS THE RIVER
ON THE UNION SIDE,

190
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,969
WHERE 30 YEARS BEFORE

191
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,972
HE HAD COURTED HIS WIFE
MARY CUSTIS.

192
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,266
IT WAS NOW BURNSIDE'S
HEADQUARTERS.

193
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,437
ON DECEMBER 11,

194
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,856
UNION GUNS BEGAN SHELLING
FREDERICKSBURG,

195
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:09,651
SETTING MUCH OF THE TOWN
ON FIRE.

196
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,778
THEN THE TROOPS STARTED
ACROSS THE RIVER.

197
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,949
SOME WONDERED
WHY THE CONFEDERATES

198
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,785
DID NOT MAKE IT HARDER
FOR THEM TO CROSS.

199
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,038
"THEY WANT TO GET US IN,"
ONE PRIVATE SAID.

200
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,915
"GETTING OUT WON'T BE
QUITE SO SMART AND EASY."

201
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,421
WHILE WAITING TO ATTACK
THE HEIGHTS,

202
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,923
UNION MEN LOOTED
WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE TOWN.

203
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,850
THE GREAT ASSAULT CAME
TWO DAYS LATER ON DECEMBER 13.

204
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:45,312
FEDERAL FORCES ADVANCED
TOWARD MARYE'S HEIGHTS.

205
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,148
LEE COULD NOT BELIEVE
THE ENEMY WOULD BE SO FOOLISH.

206
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,568
HIS ARTILLERY COVERED
ALL THE APPROACHES.

207
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,404
4 LINES OF RIFLEMEN
WAITED BEHIND A STONE WALL

208
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,782
THAT RAN ALONG
THE BASE OF THE HILL.

209
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,534
"GENERAL," AN OFFICER
ASSURED JAMES LONGSTREET,

210
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,536
"A CHICKEN COULD NOT
LIVE IN THAT FIELD

211
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,829
WHEN WE OPEN ON IT."

212
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,167
"HOW BEAUTIFULLY
THEY CAME ON.

213
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,255
"THEIR BRIGHT BAYONETS
GLISTENING IN THE SUNLIGHT

214
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:13,215
"MADE THE LINE LOOK LIKE A HUGE
SERPENT OF BLUE AND STEEL.

215
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,302
"WE COULD SEE OUR SHELLS
BURSTING IN THEIR RANKS,

216
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,010
"MAKING GREAT GAPS,
BUT ON THEY CAME,

217
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,681
"AS THOUGH THEY WOULD GO
STRAIGHT THROUGH US AND OVER US.

218
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,475
"NOW WE GAVE THEM CANISTER,
AND THAT STAGGERED THEM.

219
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,768
"A FEW MORE PACES ONWARD,

220
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,853
"AND THE GEORGIANS
IN THE ROAD BELOW US ROSE UP

221
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,522
"AND LET LOOSE
A STORM OF LEAD

222
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,317
INTO THE FACES
OF THE ADVANCING BRIGADE."

223
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,695
"THE BRILLIANT ASSAULT
OF THEIR IRISH BRIGADE

224
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,697
"WAS BEYOND DESCRIPTION.

225
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,240
"WE FORGOT THEY WERE
FIGHTING US,

226
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,535
"AND CHEER AFTER CHEER
AT THEIR FEARLESSNESS WENT UP

227
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,537
"ALONG OUR LINES.

228
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,080
GENERAL GEORGE PICKETT."

229
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,877
IT WAS SUICIDE.

230
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,754
"THEY CAME FORWARD,"
ONE MAN SAID,

231
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,216
"AS THOUGH THEY WERE BREASTING
A STORM OF RAIN AND SLEET.

232
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,219
"FACES AND BODIES
HALF TURNED TO THE STORM.

233
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,722
SHOULDERS SHRUGGED."

234
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,684
THE IRISH BRIGADE GOT
WITHIN 25 PACES OF THE WALL.

235
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,395
THE MEN OF THE 24th GEORGIA
WHO SHOT THEM DOWN

236
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,730
WERE IRISH, TOO.

237
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,401
A UNION OFFICER
WATCHING FROM A CHURCH STEEPLE

238
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,697
SAW BRIGADE AFTER BRIGADE
CHARGE THE STONE WALL.

239
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,073
"THEY SEEMED TO MELT,"
HE SAID,

240
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,201
"LIKE SNOW COMING DOWN
ON WARM GROUND."

241
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,125
THEY STILL BELIEVED
THAT TO TAKE A POSITION,

242
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,211
YOU MASSED YOUR MEN
AND MOVED UP

243
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,880
AND GAVE THEM THE BAYONET.

244
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,757
THERE WERE PRACTICALLY
NO BAYONET WOUNDS

245
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,216
IN THE CIVIL WAR
MUCH MORE THAN THERE WERE

246
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,552
IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR
OR THE SECOND.

247
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,429
THEY NEVER CAME
IN THAT KIND OF CONTACT,

248
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,390
OR AT LEAST VERY SELDOM
CAME IN THAT KIND OF CONTACT,

249
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,642
BUT THEY STILL THOUGHT
THAT TO MASS THEIR FIRE

250
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,602
THEY HAD TO MASS THEIR MEN.

251
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:49,811
SO THEY LINED UP

252
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,813
AND MARCHED UP TOWARD
AN ENTRENCHED LINE

253
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,273
AND GOT BLOWN AWAY.

254
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,950
14 ASSAULTS WERE
BEATEN BACK FROM MARYE'S HEIGHTS

255
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,288
BEFORE BURNSIDE DECIDED
IT COULD NOT BE TAKEN.

256
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,792
9,000 MEN FELL
BEFORE THE CONFEDERATE GUNS.

257
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,464
MORE CREDIT FOR VALOR IS GIVEN
TO CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS.

258
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,967
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAD
MORE ELAN AND DASH.

259
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,970
ACTUALLY, I KNOW OF
NO BRAVER MEN IN EITHER ARMY

260
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,972
THAN THE UNION TROOPS
AT FREDERICKSBURG,

261
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,016
WHICH IS A SERIOUS DEFEAT.

262
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,810
BUT TO KEEP CHARGING
THAT WALL

263
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,177
AT THE FOOT
OF MARYE'S HEIGHTS,

264
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,021
AFTER ALL THE FAILURES
THERE HAD BEEN--

265
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:39,277
AND THEY WERE ALL FAILURES--
IS A SINGULAR INSTANCE OF VALOR.

266
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,156
WATCHING FROM ABOVE,
EVEN ROBERT E. LEE WAS MOVED.

267
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,409
"IT IS WELL," HE SAID,
"THAT WAR IS SO TERRIBLE.

268
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,119
WE SHOULD GROW
TOO FOND OF IT."

269
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,875
COLONEL
JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN

270
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,293
AND HIS 20th MAINE

271
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,045
WERE AMONG THE THOUSANDS
OF UNION MEN

272
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,173
PINNED DOWN
AT THE FOOT OF THE HEIGHTS.

273
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,759
THAT NIGHT, THE TEMPERATURE
FELL BELOW FREEZING,

274
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,261
AND A STIFF WIND BLEW.

275
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,225
MEN NOW FROZE
AS WELL AS BLED TO DEATH.

276
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,270
NIGHT BROUGHT QUIET.

277
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,981
"BUT OUT OF
THAT SILENCE ROSE NEW SOUNDS,

278
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,192
"MORE APPALLING STILL--
A STRANGE VENTRILOQUISM,

279
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,612
"OF WHICH YOU COULD NOT
LOCATE THE SOURCE.

280
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,156

303
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,772
THEY WERE
STUCK THERE ALL NIGHT

304
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,273
AND ALL THE NEXT DAY,

305
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,276
CROUCHING BEHIND A WALL
OF THEIR OWN DEAD,

306
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,320
TRYING NOT TO HEAR
THE CONFEDERATE BULLETS

307
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,906
THUDDING INTO THE CORPSES

BURNSIDE, OPENLY WEEPING,

309
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,748
DECLARED THAT HE HIMSELF
WOULD LEAD THE NEW ATTACK.

310
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,500
SUBORDINATES TALKED HIM
OUT OF IT.

311
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,838
THAT NIGHT, CHAMBERLAIN
AND HIS MEN

312
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,300
SCRAPED OUT SHALLOW GRAVES
FOR THE DEAD.

313
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,267
AS THEY WORKED,

314
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,303
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS
BEGAN TO DANCE

315
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,513
IN THE WINTER SKY.

316
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,226
"WHO
WOULD NOT PASS ON AS THEY DID?

320
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,447
IT WAS VERY UNUSUAL
TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

321
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,991
THAT FAR SOUTH,

322
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,786

LIT UP WITH STREAMERS OF FIRE,

323
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,997
AND WHATEVER
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS ARE.

324
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:40,000

TOOK IT AS A SIGN

325
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,459
THAT GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF

326
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,712
WAS CELEBRATING
A CON FEDERATE VICTORY.

"THE SLAUGHTER
IS TERRIBLE,

IT IS USELESS

331
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:03,898
THE UNION
HAD LOST 12,600 MEN.

332
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,902
THE SOUTH HAD LOST 5,300 MEN,

333
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,030
BUT MANY OF THEM
WERE ONLY MISSING--

334
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,656
GONE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

335
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,496
THE BATTERED UNION ARMY
LIMPED BACK ACROSS THE RIVER.

336
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,791
ICY RAIN BEGAN TO FALL.

337
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,418
FROM THE RUINS
OF FREDERICKSBURG,

338
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:26,296
CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS

341
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,059
THE CONFEDERATES WENT
BACK INTO THE TOWN,

342
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,852
AND THEY SAW ALL THE DAMAGE
THAT HAD BEEN DONE

343
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,619
DURING THE UNION OCCUPATION
OF THE TOWN--

344
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,899
IT WAS A GREAT DEAL
OF DAMAGE, REAL VANDALISM--

345
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,150
AND THEY WERE SHOCKED.

346
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,861
AND SOMEONE
ON JACKSON'S STAFF SAID,

347
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:50,987
"HOW ARE WE GOING
TO PUT AN END

348
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,323
TO ALL THIS KIND OF THING?"

349
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,284

"KILL THEM. KILL THEM ALL."

"CLARKSVILLE.

LEARNED THAT HE WAS AMONG
THE MISSING AT FREDERICKSBURG.

368
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,344
IN FACT, HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS
WERE CERTAIN HE WAS DEAD,

TO RECOGNIZE HIS BODY

BLACKENED UNION CORPSES.

30 PRIVATES,

506
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:03,563
58 HORSES, AND BRIGADIER GENERAL
EDWIN STOUGHTON.

507
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,565
"FOR THAT, I AM SORRY,"
LINCOLN SAID

508
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,275
WHEN TOLD OF THE CAPTURE,

509
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,235
"FOR I CAN MAKE
BRIGADIER GENERALS,

510
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,070
BUT I CAN'T MAKE HORSES."

511
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,116
GENERAL MOSBY HAD
MADE LIFE MISERABLE

512
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,077
FOR NORTHERN COMMANDERS
THROUGHOUT THE WAR.

513
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,579
NO OTHER CONFEDERATE OFFICER

514
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,913
WAS MENTIONED FAVORABLY

515
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,000
AS MANY TIMES IN
ROBERT E. LEE'S DISPATCHES.

516
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,793
AS JOHN SINGLETON MOSBY.

517
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:30,044
THERE WERE NO MEDALS
IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY,

518
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,925
NOT ONE IN THE WHOLE
COURSE OF THE WAR.

519
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,219
THE CONFEDERATE REASON
FOR THAT GIVEN WAS

520
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,388
THAT THEY WERE ALL HEROES
AND IT WOULD NOT DO

521
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,223
TO SINGLE ANYONE OUT.

522
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,601
THEY WERE NOT ALL HEROES.

523
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:46,147
BUT THERE WAS A SUGGESTION
MADE TO LEE

524
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,474
THAT THERE BE A ROLL OF HONOR

525
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,775
FOR THE ARMY OF
NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

526
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,694
AND LEE DISALLOWED IT.

527
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,280
THE HIGHEST HONOR YOU COULD
GET IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY

528
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,782
WAS TO BE MENTIONED
IN DISPATCHES,

529
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,285
AND THAT WAS CONSIDERED
ABSOLUTELY ENOUGH.

530
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,376
"MARCH 5, 1863.

552
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:08,104
THE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED
BY THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION

553
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,482
OBVIOUSLY DID NOT
RECEIVE IT AS NEWS

554
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,526
BECAUSE THEY KNEW
BEFORE LINCOLN KNEW

555
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,695
THAT THE WAR
WAS ABOUT EMANCIPATION,

556
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,822
AND MOREOVER, THEY KNEW,

557
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,158
AS PERHAPS LINCOLN DID
WITHOUT FULLY REALIZING IT,

558
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,328
AND CERTAINLY AS MANY PEOPLE
TODAY DO NOT REALIZE,

559
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,289
THAT THE EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION DID NOTHING

560
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,958
TO GET THEM
THEIR FREEDOM.

561
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,835
IT SAID THAT
THEY HAD A RIGHT

562
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,963
TO GO AND PUT THEIR BODIES
ON THE LINE

563
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,924
IF THEY HAD THE NERVE
TO BELIEVE IN IT,

564
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:40,678
AND MANY OF THEM HAD
THE NERVE TO BELIEVE IN IT,

565
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:42,346
AND MANY SUFFERED FOR THAT.

566
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,830
TO LINCOLN,
IT WAS NOW CLEAR

567
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,478
THAT HARSHER MEASURES
WERE NEEDED

568
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,856
TO DESTROY THE CONFEDERACY.

569
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,482
HE CALLED FOR MORE TROOPS,

570
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:54,734
AND IN FEBRUARY,

571
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,070
PUSHED A CONSCRIPTION ACT
THROUGH CONGRESS.

572
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,740
THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION
HAD ALREADY AUTHORIZED

573
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,201
THE ARMING OF FREED SLAVES.

574
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,688
"AS TO THE POLITICS
OF WASHINGTON,

575
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,079
"THE MOST STRIKING THING

576
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,082
"IS THE ABSENCE OF PERSONAL
LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT.

577
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,375
"IT DOES NOT EXIST.

"HE HAS NO ADMIRERS,
NO ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS,

00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:18,007
NO ONE TO BET ON HIS HEAD."

580
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,468
THE FALL ELECTIONS
HAD NOT GONE WELL.

581
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,470
FREDERICKSBURG
ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE.

582
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,599
AND IN WASHINGTON, TALK OF
THE DISASTER WAS EVERYWHERE.

583
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,476
"IF THERE IS
A WORSE PLACE THAN HELL,"

584
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:32,188
LINCOLN TOLD A VISITOR,
"I AM IN IT."

585
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,024
THE SINGLE MOST UNPOPULAR ACT
OF LINCOLN'S ADMINISTRATION

586
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:37,109
WAS THE EMANCIPATION
PROCLAMATION.

587
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,945
IT NOT ONLY WAS HORRIBLY
UNPOPULAR IN THE CONFEDERACY,

588
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,322
WHERE JEFFERSON DAVIS
CALLED IT

589
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,782
"THE MOST WICKED THING

590
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,451
THAT THE DARK SIDE OF HUMANKIND
HAD EVER COME UP WITH,"

591
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,621
BUT MILLIONS OF NORTHERNERS
RESPONDED TO IT AS WELL.

592
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,372
THEY DID NOT
REALLY WANT THE--

593
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,875
A GREAT MANY NORTHERNERS
DID NOT WANT THE WAR

594
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,044
TO BE CHANGED TO A WAR
OVER SLAVE LIBERATION.

595
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,298
OPPOSITION TO THE WAR
WAS SPREADING,

596
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,134
ESPECIALLY AMONG DEMOCRATS
IN THE HEARTLAND--

597
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,804
MICHIGAN, OHIO,
IOWA, INDIANA,

598
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,390
AND THE SOUTHERN HALF
OF LINCOLN'S OWN ILLINOIS.

599
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,268
THE PROCLAMATION IGNITED
AN ANTIWAR MOVEMENT

600
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,020
IN THE NORTH.

601
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,649
ALL BUT 35 MEN
OF THE 138th ILLINOIS

602
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,859
DESERTED OVER EMANCIPATION,

603
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,569
DECLARING THEY WOULD LIE
IN THE WOODS

604
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,655
UNTIL MOSS GREW
ON THEIR BACKS

605
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,490
RATHER THAN HELP
FREE THE SLAVES.

606
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,745
GROUPS WITH NAMES LIKE
THE KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE

607
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,789
AND SONS OF LIBERTY
MET IN SECRET

608
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,667
AND MUTTERED OF FORCING
AN END TO THE WAR.

609
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,418
THEIR ENEMIES
CALLED THEM COPPERHEADS,

610
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,046
AND THEY WORE ON THEIR LAPELS
THE HEAD OF LIBERTY,

611
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,173
SNIPPED FROM A COPPER PENNY.

612
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,094
THEIR LEADER WAS CONGRESSMAN
CLEMENT VALLANDIGHAM OF OHIO.

613
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,971
LINCOLN HAD HIM
THROWN IN JAIL

614
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:50,182
AND LATER BANISHED
TO THE CONFEDERACY.

615
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:55,020
"YOU HAVE NOT
CONQUERED THE SOUTH. YOU NEVER WILL.

616
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,857
"WAR FOR THE UNION
WAS ABANDONED,

617
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,776

00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,904
"AND WITH STRONGER BATTALIONS
THAN BEFORE.

00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,198
"WITH WHAT SUCCESS?

620
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,993
LET THE DEAD
AT FREDERICKSBURG ANSWER."

621
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,040
ALL OF THESE THINGS
BORE IN ON HIM,

622
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,084
PLUS THE FACT THAT THE SOUTH
HAD A STRONG ARMY

623
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,086
AND A GOOD LEADERSHIP
AND WAS--

624
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,505
BUT THEN HE WOULD PICK UP
A RICHMOND NEWSPAPER,

625
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:22,882
AND HE'D SAY,
"HERE'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING

626
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,050
"ABOUT JEFF DAVIS... DOWN HERE.

627
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,886
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T LOOK SO BAD."

628
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,722
BECAUSE THE SOUTH
HAD A FREE PRESS, TOO.

629
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,015
AND HE REALIZED, YOU KNOW,

630
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,183
THAT JEFF WAS NOT DOING
ANY BETTER THAN HE WAS

631
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,561
AS FAR AS
THEY WERE CONCERNED.

632
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,980
DAVIS WAS WALKING DOWN
THE STREET IN RICHMOND ONE DAY,

633
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,231
AND A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER,

634
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,693
WHO WAS IN RICHMOND
ON FURLOUGH, PASSED HIM

635
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,778
AND STOPPED HIM AND SAID,

636
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,991
"SIR, MISTER,
BE YOU JEFFERSON DAVIS?"

637
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,035
DAVIS SAID THAT HE WAS.

638
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,682
THE SOLDIER SAID,
"WELL, I THOUGHT SO.

639
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:55,372
YOU LOOK SO MUCH LIKE
A CON FEDERATE POSTAGE STAMP."

640
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:10,012
JEFFERSON DAVIS
WAS TRYING TO WIN A WAR

641
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:12,765
WHILE FORGING A NATION
OUT OF 11 STATES

642
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,934
SUSPICIOUS OF
EVEN THE MOST TRIVIAL MOVE

643
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,020
TOWARD CENTRALIZED
GOVERNMENT.

644
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,731
WHEN DAVIS CALLED FORA DAY
OF NATIONAL FASTING,

645
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,524
THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA
IGNORED IT,

646
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,153
THEN NAMED A DIFFERENT FAST DAY
OF HIS OWN.

647
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,947
"I ENTERED
INTO THIS REVOLUTION

648
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,281

"TO SUSTAIN
THE RIGHTS OF STATES

"AND TO PREVENT THE
CONSOLIDATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

"AND I AM STILL A REBEL,

OF GEORGIA."

653
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,588
"THE CONFEDERACY
HAS BEEN

00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,800
"DONE TO DEATH BY POLITICIANS.

"PARDON ME,"
A SOUTH CAROLINIAN

657
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,055
WROTE HIS CONGRESSMAN,

658
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,642
"IS THE MAJORITY
ALWAYS DRUNK?"

659
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,769
VICE PRESIDENT
ALEXANDER STEPHENS

660
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:01,021
BELIEVED DAVIS
WEAK AND VACILLATING,

661
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:04,316
TIMID, PETULANT,
PEEVISH, OBSTINATE.

662
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:08,112
STEPHENS LEFT RICHMOND IN 1862,
RARELY TO RETURN.

663
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,159
"I MAKE NO TERMS,"
DAVIS ONCE SAID.

664
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,328
"I ACCEPT NO COMPROMISE."

665
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,330
HE REFUSED
TO UNBEND IN PUBLIC

666
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,333
OR TO CURRY FAVOR
WITH THE PRESS.

667
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,961
PRIVATELY, HE COMMUTED
NEARLY EVERY DEATH SENTENCE

668
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,130
FOR DESERTION
THAT REACHED HIS DESK,

669
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,466
EXPLAINING THAT
THE POOREST USE OF A SOLDIER

670
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,592
WAS TO SHOOT HIM.

671
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:36,724
HE'S OFTEN DESCRIBED
AS A BLOODLESS PEDANT,

672
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,226
A MAN WHO FILLED
ALL HIS TIME

673
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,980
WITH SMALL-TIME PAPERWORK
AND NEVER ANYTHING ELSE,

674
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:47,026
AN ICY-COLD MAN
WHO HAD NO FRIENDLINESS IN HIM.

675
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,819
I FOUND THE OPPOSITE
TO BE TRUE

676
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,404
IN ALL THOSE RESPECTS.

677
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,906
DAVIS WAS AN OUTGOING,
FRIENDLY MAN,

678
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,034
A GREAT FAMILY MAN--

679
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,119
LOVED HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN--

680
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,497
AN INFINITE STORE
OF COMPASSION.

681
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,749
LEE SAID IT BEST--

682
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,626
HE SAID, "I DON'T THINK
ANYONE COULD NAME ANYONE

683
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,004
"WHO COULD HAVE DONE
A BETTER JOB THAN DAVIS DID.

684
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,380
"AND I PERSONALLY
DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE

685
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,883
WHO COULD HAVE DONE
AS GOOD A JOB."

686
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,090
THAT'S FROM ROBERT E. LEE,

687
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,677
WHICH IS
PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY.

688
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:19,224
DAVIS MAY WELL HAVE BEEN
THE ONLY SOUTHERNER

689
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,435
WHO UNDERSTOOD
SOUTHERN NATIONALITY,

690
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,396
WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT SACRIFICES
HAD TO BE MADE

691
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,649
IF THE CONFEDERACY WAS EVER
GOING TO JELL AS A NATION.

692
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,778
HE KEPT SAYING, "I NEED THE KIND
OF POWERS THAT LINCOLN GOT.

693
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,864
"I NEED THE KIND OF RESOURCES
THAT HE GOT IN THE DRAFT LAWS.

694
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,192
"I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUSPEND

695
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,867
THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
LIKE HE DID."

696
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,410
HE WOULD HAVE SAID,

697
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,288
"WE CAN'T LIVE BY THE DOGMAS
OF THE QUIET PAST ANY LONGER."

698
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:43,290
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT,
BUT HE ACTED THAT OUT.

699
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,017
HE SAID, "I HAVE TO
BE GIVEN THE KINDS--

700
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,293
"THIS CON FEDERATE GOVERNMENT

701
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,129
"NEEDS THE KIND OF NATIONAL
AUTHORITY--NATIONAL POWER

702
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,590
THAT THE UNION HAD
IN ORDER TO WIN."

703
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,258
AND THEY DIDN'T GET IT
BECAUSE THE STATES' RIGHTS

704
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,760
HELPED KILL THE CONFEDERACY.

705
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,849
A SINGLE CAKE OF SOAP
NOW COST $1.10--

706
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,561
1/10 OF A SOLDIER'S
MONTHLY PAY.

707
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,271
AT THE BEGINNING OF 1863,

708
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:10,109
A BARREL OF FLOUR
COST $70 IN THE SOUTH.

709
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,736
BY YEAR'S END,
IT COST $250.

710
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,324
THE CONFEDERATE TREASURY
CRANKED OUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

711
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,369
IN NOTES UNBACKED BY GOLD.

712
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,287
SOUTHERN PRINTING
WAS SO PRIMITIVE

713
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,414
THAT COUNTERFEITERS
WERE SOMETIMES CAUGHT

714
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,333
BECAUSE THEIR WORK
WAS TOO GOOD.

715
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,963
BY 1862 AND 1863,
THE SOUTH SUFFERED

716
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,757
FROM TERRIBLE
INFLATIONARY CURRENCY.

717
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:37,010
WHAT WAS REALLY AT A PREMIUM
WAS A UNION GOLD DOLLAR.

718
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,137
SO THAT THE CONFEDERATE PEOPLE

719
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,555
COULD NEVER GET AWAY
FROM THE UNION,

720
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,764
NOT EVEN ECONOMICALLY.

721
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,977
"IF THE CONFEDERACY
IS DEFEATED,

722
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,688

724
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,611
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN,
INFURIATED BY SOARING PRICES,

725
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,072
STORMED THROUGH
DOWNTOWN RICHMOND SHOPS,

726
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,866
SMASHING WINDOWS
AND GATHERING UP

727

728
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,996

729
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:06,290
AND JEFFERSON DAVIS
HIMSELF CAME OUT,

730
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:09,626
THROWING WHAT MONEY HE HAD
IN HIS POCKETS TO THE CROWD

731
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,712
AND BEGGING THEM
TO BLAME THE YANKEES,

732
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,838
NOT THE GOVERNMENT.

733
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,633
THEN HE WARNED THE TROOPS
WOULD OPEN FIRE

734
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,677
IF THEY DID NOT DISPERSE.

735
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,470

WERE CALLED UPON

TO CONTRIBUTE
1/10 OF THEIR PRODUCE,

743
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,366

WAS EMPOWERED

00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,244
TO IMPRESS MALE SLAVES
AS LABORERS,

745
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,123

AWAY FROM THE GOVERNMENT
AND THE FIGHTING.

748
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:57,090
150,000 SLAVES WERE MARCHED
ALL THE WAY TO TEXAS.

842
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,221
A TENACIOUS WEST POINTER
CALLED FIGHTING JOE,

843
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:21,891
WHO DRANK AND TALKED
TOO MUCH FOR HIS OWN GOOD.

844
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,603
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY,
LINCOLN TOLD HIM,

845
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,480
TO DESTROY LEE'S ARMY.

846
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,441
"MY PLANS ARE PERFECT.

847
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:31,985
"MAY GOD HAVE MERCY
ON GENERAL LEE,

848
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:33,194
FOR I WILL HAVE NONE."

849
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,477
HOOKER'S PLANS
CALLED FOR

850
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:40,952
ONE PART OF HIS ENORMOUS ARMY

851
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,580
TO FEIGN AN ASSAULT
ON LEE'S FRONT,

852
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,874
STILL AT FREDERICKSBURG,

853
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,293
WHILE THE REST MARCHED
UP THE RAPPAHANNOCK,

854
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,294
CROSSED THE RIVER,

855
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,962
AND ATTACKED LEE
FROM THE REAR.

856
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:57,427
ON APRIL 30, HOOKER'S
MAIN FORCE--70,000 STRONG--

857
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,179
REACHED CHANCELLORSVILLE--

858
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,639
A LONE HOUSE IN A CLEARING

859
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,642
SURROUNDED BY A THICK FOREST
CALLED THE WILDERNESS.

860
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:10,023
HOOKER AND HIS OFFICERS
MOVED IN DOWNSTAIRS

861
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,150
AND CONTINUED
TO MAP OUT THE ASSAULT

862
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,943
THEY WERE SURE WOULD TRAP LEE.

863
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,865
"THE ENEMY
MUST EITHER INGLORIOUSLY FLY

864
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,659
"OR COME OUT
FROM BEHIND HIS DEFENSES

865
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,495
"AND GIVE US BATTLE
UPON OUR OWN GROUND,

866
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,622
WHERE CERTAIN DESTRUCTION
AWAITS HIM."

867
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:31,586
"THE HEN IS THE
WISEST OF ALL THE ANIMAL CREATION

868
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,546
"BECAUSE SHE NEVER CACKLES

869
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,632
UNTIL AFTER THE EGG
IS LAID."

870
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,013
BUT ROBERT E. LEE,
OUTNUMBERED NEARLY TWO TO ONE,

871
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,307
WAS NOT FOOLED
BY HOOKER'S PLAN.

872
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,977
DEFYING ALL MILITARY
CONVENTION,

873
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,188
HE DIVIDED HIS OWN
MUCH SMALLER FORCE,

874
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,858
LEAVING ONLY ¼ OF HIS MEN
AT FREDERICKSBURG

875
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,360
BEFORE RUSHING WEST
TO SHORE UP HIS FLANK.

876
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:00,407
WHEN LEE'S CONFEDERATES REACHED
THE EDGE OF THE WILDERNESS,

877
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,659
UNION TROOPS MOVED OUT
TO ENGAGE THEM.

878
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:13,670
FIRE!

879
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,471
BUT THE FIGHTING
HAD HARDLY BEGUN

880
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,766
WHEN FIGHTING JOE HOOKER
INEXPLICABLY ORDERED HIS FORCES

881
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,770
BACK TO DEFENSIVE POSITIONS
AROUND THE CHANCELLOR HOUSE.

882
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,648
"TO TELL THE TRUTH,"
HE LATER TRIED TO EXPLAIN,

883
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,067
"I JUST LOST CONFIDENCE
IN JOE HOOKER."

884
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,905
LEE SENSED HOOKER'S CONFUSION

885
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,700
AND THE NEXT DAY
DIVIDED HIS ARMY A SECOND TIME,

886
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:46,911
SENDING 28,000 MEN
UNDER STONEWALL JACKSON

887
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,664
ON AN EXTRAORDINARY
14-MILE MARCH

888
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,458
THROUGH THE DENSE WILDERNESS

889
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,377
AND AROUND
THE UNION'S RIGHT FLANK.

890
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:02,844
HOOKER SOMEHOW
PERSUADED HIMSELF

891
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,430
THAT JACKSON
WAS ACTUALLY RETREATING

892
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,474
AND DESPITE
THE SKELETAL REBEL FORCE

893
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,892
REMAINING IN FRONT OF HIM,

894
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,769
CHOSE TO STAY IN CAMP.

895
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:15,440
ALL DAY LONG CAME REPORTS
FROM TERRIFIED UNION PICKETS

896
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,025
OF A HUGE REBEL FORCE

897
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:20,403
MOVING JUST BEYOND
THE SCREEN OF TREES TO THE WEST.

898
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,863
THEY WERE IGNORED.

899
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:25,700
LATE THAT AFTERNOON,

900
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,787
UNION TROOPS WERE BOILING COFFEE
AND PLAYING CARDS

901
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,872
WHEN DEER CAME BOUNDING
OUT OF THE FOREST

902
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,209
AND THROUGH THEIR CAMP.

903
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,462
JACKSON'S ARMY
WAS RIGHT BEHIND THEM.

904
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:51,684
"IT WAS A PERFECT WHIRLWIND
OF MEN," A SURVIVOR SAID.

905
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,020
"THE ENEMY SEEMED TO COME
FROM EVERY DIRECTION."

906
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,871
THE FEDERALS FELL BACK
NEARLY TWO MILES

907
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,791
BEFORE DARKNESS STOPPED
THE CONFEDERATE SWEEP.

908
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:21,172
CHANCELLORSVILLE, IN
MANY WAYS, IS LEE'S MASTERPIECE.

909
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,341
IT'S WHERE
THE ODDS WERE LONGEST.

910
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,677
IT'S WHERE HE TOOK
THE GREATEST RISK

911
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:26,845
IN DIVIDING HIS ARMY

912
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,514
IN THE PRESENCE
OF A SUPERIOR ENEMY

913
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:32,433
AND KEPT
THE PRESSURE ON.

914
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:36,229
THE REAL FAULT
AT CHANCELLORSVILLE

915
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,982
WAS THE ATTACK WAS STAGED
SO LATE IN THE DAY

916
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,984
THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE
TO PUSH IT

917
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,945
TO THE EXTENT
THAT JACKSON HAD INTENDED TO.

918
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:46,281
AND HE WAS EVEN ATTEMPTING
TO MAKE A NIGHT ATTACK--

919
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,449
AVERY RARE THING
IN THE CIVIL WAR--

920
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,577
BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT
HE HADN'T FINISHED UP

921
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,161
WHAT HE HAD STARTED
TO BEGIN.

922
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,748
EAGER TO FIGHT ON,

923
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,209
JACKSON RODE OUT
BETWEEN THE LINES THAT EVENING

924
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,545
TO SCOUT
FOR A NIGHT ATTACK.

925
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,213
WHEN HE TURNED
BACK TOWARD HIS MEN,

926
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,550
NERVOUS CONFEDERATE PICKETS
OPENED FIRE.

927
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,220
TWO OF HIS AIDES FELL DEAD.

928
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,514
JACKSON WAS HIT TWICE
IN THE LEFT ARM.

929
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,563
HIS SHATTERED ARM
WAS AMPUTATED THE NEXT MORNING.

930
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,356
LEE WAS HORRIFIED.

931
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,901
"HE HAS LOST
HIS LEFT ARM," HE SAID,

932
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,528
"BUT I HAVE LOST MY RIGHT."

933
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:31,034
HOOKER CONTINUED TO BUMBLE.

934
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,744
AS HE NERVOUSLY WATCHED
THE FIGHTING

935
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,746
FROM THE PORCH
OF THE CHANCELLOR HOUSE,

936
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:37,415
A SHELL SPLIT THE PILLAR
HE WAS LEANING AGAINST

937
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:38,875
AND KNOCKED HIM SENSELESS.

938
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:41,753
GROGGY ALL DAY,

939
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,506
HE REFUSED
TO RELINQUISH COMMAND.

940
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,383
FINALLY, HE ORDERED RETREAT.

941
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,263
THE DEFEAT WAS TOTAL.

942
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,233
AGAIN THE UNION ARMY WITHDREW
ACROSS THE RAPPAHANNOCK.

943
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,989
HOOKER HAD LOST 17,000 MEN,

944
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,033
EVEN MORE
THAN AT FREDERICKSBURG.

945
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:18,164
"MY GOD, MY GOD," SAID LINCOLN
WHEN HE GOT THE NEWS,

946
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,916
"WHAT WILL THE COUNTRY SAY?"

947
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:28,925
CHANCELLORSVILLE WAS
LEE'S MOST BRILLIANT VICTORY

948
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:31,052
AND ONE OF THE COSTLIEST.

949
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,973
13,000 OF HIS MEN
WERE DEAD OR OUT OF ACTION,

950
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,101
BUT IT WAS THE LOSS OF ONE MAN
THAT CONCERNED HIM MOST.

951
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:42,647
STONEWALL JACKSON
SEEMED TO BE RECUPERATING.

952
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,941
THEN ON SUNDAY, MAY 10,

953
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,609
HE TOOK A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

954
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:50,697
THE SCENE
IS IN A BEDROOM

955
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,200
IN WHICH HE'S COMING
IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

956
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,497
PNEUMONIA'S WHAT HE DIED OF,
NOT THE LOSS OF HIS ARM.

957
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,044
AND HIS WIFE
GOT THERE TO BE WITH HIM,

958
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,089
AND THE SURGEON, DR. MCGUIRE,

959
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:12,802
TOLD MRS. JACKSON THAT
HER HUSBAND WOULD DIE THAT DAY,

960
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:15,638
AND SHE TOLD HIM, SAID,

961
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,558
"THE DOCTOR SAYS THAT
YOU WON'T LAST THE DAY OUT,"

962
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:23,062
AND HE SAID, "NO, MY CHILD.
IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS."

963
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,273
AND THEN FINALLY SHE SAID,

964
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,609
"YOU'LL BE WITH THE LORD
THIS DAY,"

965
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:32,113
AND HE WENT OFF INTO
SOME SORT OF SLEEPY DELIRIUM.

966
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,907
PNEUMONIA AFFECTS PEOPLE
IN STRANGE WAYS.

967
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,534
AND HE CALLED THE DOCTOR OVER

968
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:39,454
AND SAYS, "DR. MCGUIRE, MY WIFE
TELLS ME I'M GONNA DIE TODAY.

969
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,420
IS THAT TRUE?"

970
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,332
AND THE DOCTOR SAID,
"YES, IT IS."

971
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:47,378
HE SAID,
"GOOD. VERY GOOD.

972
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,423
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE
ON A SUNDAY."

973
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,885
AND WHEN THEY OFFERED HIM
BRANDY OR MORPHINE,

974
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:57,055
HE SAID, "NO. I WANT TO KEEP
MY MIND CLEAR,"

975
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,223
AND THE LAST THING
HE SAID--IT SORT OF--

976
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,558
HE WANDERED IN HIS MIND.

977
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:04,270
HE WAS CALLING ON A.P. HILL,
"PREPARE FOR ACTION."

978
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:05,438
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

979
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:09,275
HE WAS QUIET, VERY QUIET
FORA SPELL,

980
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,736
AND HE SAID IN A CLEAR,
DISTINCT VOICE,

981
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:13,863
"LET US CROSS OVER THE RIVER

982
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,449
AND REST UNDER THE SHADE
OF THE TREES,"

983
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:17,533
AND THEN DIED.

984
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,126
"THE DEATH
OF OUR PIOUS, BRAVE,

985
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:30,421
"AND NOBLE GENERAL
STONEWALL JACKSON

986
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,715
IS A GREAT BLOW
TO OUR CAUSE."

987
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,774
WINFIELD SCOTT.

988
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,443
HEN RY HALLECK.

989
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,904
IRVIN MCDOWELL.

GEORGE McCLELLAN.

991
00:51:57,824 --> 00:52:00,118
JOHN POPE.

992
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,995
GEORGE McCLELLAN AGAIN.

993
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,915
AMBROSE BURNSIDE.

994
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:08,000
JOSEPH HOOKER.

995
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:11,504
LINCOLN COULD NOT FIND
THE GENERAL HE NEEDED.

996
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:13,589
HE NOW KNEW
THAT TO WIN THE WAR,

997
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,801
THE SOUTHERN ARMIES
HAD TO BE CRUSHED.

998
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,302
HE HAD THE MEN,

999
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:22,598
BUT HE NEEDED A GENERAL
WITH THE WILL TO USE THEM.

1000
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:26,477
"NO GENERAL YET
FOUND CAN FACE THE ARITHMETIC,

1001
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,105
"BUT THE END OF THE WAR
WILL BEAT HAND

1002
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,648
WHEN HE SHALL BE DISCOVERED."

1003
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,570
"VICKSBURG IS THE KEY.

00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,864
"THE WAR CAN NEVER BE
BROUGHT TO A CLOSE

00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,699
UNTIL THE KEY
IS IN OUR POCKET."

1006

00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,714
"AS FAR AS THE EYE
COULD SEE--

1011
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:56,382
THAT IS VICKSBURG."

1012
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,886
FOR 2½ MONTHS,
ULYSSES S. GRANT

1013
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,473
DOGGEDLY ATTEMPTED TO
DIG OR HACK OR FLOAT HIS ARMY

1014
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,561
THROUGH THE TANGLED BAYOUS
AND SEIZE THE TOWN OF VICKSBURG.

1015
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:10,313
NOTHING WORKED.

1016
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:13,274
THE PRESS ACCUSED HIM
OF SLOTH AND STUPIDITY,

1017
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:15,193
HINTED HE WAS DRINKING AGAIN.

1018
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:21,157
FINALLY, GRANT DECIDED
ON A DARING PLAN.

1019
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:22,700
HE WOULD MARCH DOWNRIVER

1020
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,661
THROUGH THE SWAMPS
ON THE WESTERN SIDE,

1021
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,205
CROSS BELOW VICKSBURG,

1022
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,166
AND WITHOUT HOPE OF RESUPPLY
OR REINFORCEMENT,

1023
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:32,501
COME UP FROM BEHIND
AND ATTACK THE CITY.

1024
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,690
BY EARLY MAY,
GRANT HAD CROSSED THE RIVER.

1025
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,070
"WHEN THIS WAS EFFECTED,

1026
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,821
"I FELT A DEGREE OF RELIEF

1027
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,574
"SCARCELY EVER EQUALED SINCE.

1028
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,244
"I WAS NOW
IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY

1029
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,579
"WITH A RIVER
AND THE STRONGHOLD OF VICKSBURG

1030
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,749
"BETWEEN ME
AND MY BASE OF SUPPLY,

1031
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,834
"BUT I WAS ON DRY GROUND

1032
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,504
ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE RIVER
WITH THE ENEMY."

1033
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:22,301
THE MEN KNEW THEY WERE
CUT LOOSE FROM THEIR BASE,

1034
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,428
KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE
DEPENDENT FOR SUPPLIES

1035
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,639
ON A VERY TENUOUS
SUPPLY LINE,

1036
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:29,267
BUT GRANT HIMSELF
GAVE THEM CONFIDENCE.

1037
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,727
THEY BELIEVED GRANT KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

1038
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,188
AND ONE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT
FOR THEIR BELIEVING THAT

1039
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:35,606
WAS QUITE OFTEN
ON THE MARCH,

1040
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,608
WHETHER AT NIGHT
OR IN THE DAYTIME,

1041
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,735
THEY'D BE MOVING
ALONG A ROAD OR OVER A BRIDGE

1042
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,238
AND RIGHT BESIDE THE ROAD
WOULD BE GRANT ON HIS HORSE--

1043
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,949
A DUST-COVERED MAN
ON A DUST-COVERED HORSE,

1044
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,325
SAYING "MOVE ON, CLOSE UP."

1045
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,702
SO THEY FELT VERY MUCH

1046
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,246
THAT HE PERSONALLY WAS
IN CHARGE OF THEIR MOVEMENT,

1047
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:52,498
AND IT GAVE THEM
AN ADDED CONFIDENCE.

1048
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,136
IN 3 WEEKS,
GRANT'S ARMY,

1049
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:08,180
CUT OFF FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD,

1050
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,266
MARCHED 180 MILES,

1051
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,351
FOUGHT AND WON 5 BATTLES

1052
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:15,062
AT PORT GIBSON...

1053
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,064
RAYMOND...

1054
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,150
JACKSON...

1055
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:21,402
CHAMPIONS HILL...

1056
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:24,405
AND BIG BLACK RIVER...

1057
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,907
AND FINALLY SURROUNDED
VICKSBURG ITSELF,

1058
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,452
TRAPPING 31,000 CONFEDERATES.

1059
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:34,040
ON MAY 19,

1060
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:37,126
GRANT TRIED TO TAKE THE TOWN
BY DIRECT ASSAULT

1061
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:39,211
BUT WAS BEATEN BACK.

1062
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:48,721
"MAY 19.

1063
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:51,057
"THANKS BE TO THE GREAT RULER
OF THE UNIVERSE.

1064
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,851
"VICKSBURG IS STILL SAFE.

1065
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,102
"THE FIRST GREAT ASSAULT

1066
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,688
"HAS BEEN MOST
SUCCESSFULLY REPELLED.

1067
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:01,233
"ALL MY FEARS IN REFERENCE
TO TAKING THE PLACE BY STORM

1068
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,069
"NOW VANISHED.

1069
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,571
"REVEREND WILLIAM
LOVELACE FOSTER,

1070
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:08,824
CHAPLAIN, 35th MISSISSIPPI
VOLUNTEERS."

1071
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,537
GRANT SETTLED IN
FOR A SIEGE,

1072
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,707
RESOLVED, HE SAID,
TO "OUTCAMP THE ENEMY."

1073
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,461
"IT IS SUCH
FOLLY FOR THEM

1074
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,671
"TO WASTE THEIR AMMUNITION
LIKE THAT.

1075
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,215
"HOW CAN THEY
EVER TAKE A TOWN

1076
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:28,677
"THAT HAS SUCH ADVANTAGES FOR
DEFENSE AND PROTECTION AS THIS?

1077
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,596
"WE'LL JUST BURROW
INTO THESE HILLS

1078
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,849
AND LET THEM BATTER AWAY
AS HARD AS THEY PLEASE."

1079
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,484
ON MAY 15,
JEFFERSON DAVIS

1080
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,820
SUMMONED GENERAL LEE
TO RICHMOND.

1081
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,948
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE
ABOUT GRANT.

1082
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:51,283
DAVIS WANTED TO SEND
PART OF LEE'S ARMY

1083
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,828
TO RELIEVE VICKSBURG.

1084
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,413
LEE WAS AGAINST IT.

1085
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,914
HE HAD A BOLDER PLAN.

1086
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,252
THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA

1087
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:02,670
SHOULD INVADE THE NORTH AGAIN,

1088
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,840
STRIKING THIS TIME
INTO PENNSYLVANIA.

1089
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,634
LEE WOULD ATTACK HARRISBURG
AND PHILADELPHIA

1090
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:12,388
AND FORCE GRANT NORTH
TO DEFEND WASHINGTON.

1091
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,766
WITH LUCK, WASHINGTON
ITSELF MIGHT FALL.

1092
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,686
IT MIGHT EVEN FORCE LINCOLN
TO SUE FOR PEACE

1093
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,022
AND RECOGNIZE THE CONFEDERACY.

1094
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,566
DAVIS AGREED.

1095
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:28,112
EVERYTHING NOW HUNG
ON VICKSBURG IN THE WEST

1096
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:30,489
AND PENNSYLVANIA IN THE EAST.

1097
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,242
AS GRANT PRESSED
HIS SIEGE AT VICKSBURG,

1098
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:34,702
LEE MOVED NORTH.
