1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,473
"Were these things real?

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,476
"Did I see those brave
and noble countrymen of mine

3
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,313
"laid low in death
and weltering in their blood?

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,652
"Did I see our country
laid waste and in ruins?

5
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,196
"Did I see
soldiers marching,

6
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:34,744
"the earth trembling and jarring
beneath their measured tread?

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,288
"Did I see the ruins

8
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:41,000
"of smoldering cities
and deserted homes?

9
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,128
"Did I see the flag
of my country,

10
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,630
"that I had followed
so long,

11
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,009
furled to be
no more unfurled forever?"

12
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,973
"Surely they are
but the vagaries

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,184
of mine own imagination."

14
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:06,984
"But hush! I now hear
the approach of battle.

15
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,987
"That low, rumbling sound
in the west

16
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,990
is the roar of Cannon
in the distance."

17
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:17,870
Private Sam Watkins, company h,
1st Tennessee regiment.

18
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,335
"Strange, is it not,

19
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:28,297
"that battles, martyrs, blood,
even assassination

20
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:32,802
should so condense
a nationality?"

21
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,012
Walt Whitman.

22
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:40,810
It is <i>the</i> event
in American history

23
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,813
in that
it is the moment

24
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,816
that made the United States
as a nation,

25
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,819
and I mean that
in different ways.

26
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,822
The United States
was obviously a nation

27
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,990
when it adopted
a constitution,

28
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,326
but it adopted a constitution

29
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:02,832
that, required a war
to be sorted out

30
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,836
and therefore required a war
to make a real nation

31
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,839
out of what was
a theoretical nation

32
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,634
as--as it was designed at
the constitutional convention.

33
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,513
Before the war, it was said,
"the United States are."

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,015
Grammatically,
it was spoken that way

35
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,519
and thought of as a collection
of independent states.

36
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,439
After the war, it was always
"the United States is,"

37
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,442
as we say today without being
self-conscious at all.

38
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,445
And that sums up
what the war accomplished.

39
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,573
It made us an "is."

40
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,800
The confederate states
of America had once stretched

41
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:58,137
from the rappahannock
to the rio grande.

42
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,807
Its leaders had once dreamed
of a tropical empire

43
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,809
reaching ever southward

44
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:08,731
to Mexico, Guatemala,
Nicaragua, Brazil.

45
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:13,652
By April 1865,
the dream was gone.

46
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,487
Richmond had fallen.

47
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,490
The confederate government,
and Jefferson Davis with it,

48
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,827
had fled into the wilderness
of north Carolina.

49
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,247
The confederate armies,
once the terror of the union,

50
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,251
had been battered and starved
almost out of existence

51
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,755
and then forced to surrender
at appomattox,

52
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:37,968
where ulysses s. Grant had
finally cornered Robert e. Lee.

53
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,346
In April 1865,

54
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,933
Elisha hunt rhodes would receive
the best news of the war

55
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,893
and then the worst.

56
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,272
In the woods of north Carolina,
two old adversaries,

57
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,274
William tecumseh sherman

58
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,276
and Joseph e. Johnston,

59
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,322
would meet on the field
of battle one last time.

60
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,618
By then, confederate Sam Watkins
would write,

61
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,287
"the once proud army
of Tennessee

62
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,207
had degenerated to a mob."

63
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,210
In April 1861,

64
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:15,464
Abraham Lincoln had implored
his countrymen not to go to war,

65
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,468
to listen to "the better angels
of their nature."

66
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,805
Now in April 1865,

67
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,933
the bloodshed was finally
coming to an end.

68
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,228
But in Washington,

69
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:34,108
John wilkes booth could not
accept that the war was over.

70
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,570
In four years,

71
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,866
more than a million photographs
were made of the war.

72
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,787
Now no one seemed
to want them anymore.

73
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,250
Mathew Brady went bankrupt.

74
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,753
Thousands of
glass-plate negatives were lost,

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,172
mislaid or forgotten.

76
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,759
Thousands more were sold
to gardeners,

77
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:05,264
not for the images they held,
but for the glass itself.

78
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,100
In the years
that followed appomattox,

79
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,103
the sun slowly burned
the image of war

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,440
from thousands
of greenhouse glass panes.

81
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,444
"The civil war," a Harvard
professor wrote at the time,

82
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,945
"opened a great Gulf

83
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,948
"between what happened before
in our century

84
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,243
"and what has happened since.

85
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,370
"It does not seem to me
as if I were living

86
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,373
in the country
in which I was born."

87
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,461
The war was over,
and it was not over.

88
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:40,799
"My shoes are gone.
My clothes are gone.

89
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,801
"I'm weary, I'm sick,
I'm hungry.

90
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,804
"My family have all been killed
or scattered.

91
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,807
"And I have suffered all this
for my country.

92
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,311
"I love my country,
but if this war is ever over,

93
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,981
I'll be damned if I ever
love another country."

94
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,653
"So blackwood
and I left the army--our army--

95
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,072
"left them there
on the hill

96
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,532
"with their arms stacked
in the field,

97
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:10,162
"all in rows,

00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,837
"and in a little while

101

of the presence
of what was left of the army."

Barry Benson.

Elisha hunt rhodes.

127
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,208
Word of Lee's
surrender spread fast.

128
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,877
A galloping rider
shouted the good news

129
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,712
to sherman's army
in north Carolina,

130
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,173
and one gleeful soldier
bellowed back at him,

131
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,384
"you're the son of a bitch
we've been looking for

132
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,221
all these four years!"

133
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,892
Church bells rang out
in every northern town.

134
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,952
The people
of deer isle, Maine,

135
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,454
had followed the steady march
of union victories

136
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,333
with the same joy felt by towns
all over the north,

137
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,961
and when news of appomattox
got out to the islands,

138
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,131
shouting horsemen carried it
from house to house,

139
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,260
but the grieving
did not end.

140
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,720
Private William toothaker
succumbed to disease

141
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,722
aboard a transport ship,

142
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,724
leaving four small children

143
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,894
whose memories of him
would quickly fade.

144
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,398
And a letter came, informing
private albion Stinson's wife

145
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,235
that her husband had been killed
near appomattox courthouse

146
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,613
just five days before
the confederate surrender.

147
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,326
When the news reached
clarksville, Tennessee,

148
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,828
the union military governor

149
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,957
ordered a grand
citywide celebration.

150
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:45,252
"All the storehouses
were brilliantly lighted.

151
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,755
"These blue devils

At vicksburg,
2,000 liberated union prisoners

00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,606
crowded onto the decks
of the steamboat sultana,

157
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,276
gleeful to be on their way north
at last.

158
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,778
Near Memphis,
a boiler exploded,

159
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,281
and she burst into flames.

160
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,783
More than 1,200 men died,

161
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,828
still hundreds of miles
from home.

162
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,208
"We are scattered,

163
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,918
stunned..."

"The remnant of heart
left alive in us

Mary chesnut.

171
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,234
When the news of the
surrender reached Edmund ruffin,

172
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,236
the old Virginia secessionist

173
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,698
who had fired one of
the first shots at fort sumter,

174
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,535
he draped a rebel flag over
his shoulders and shot himself

00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,537
rather than live, he wrote,

176
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:08,418
in a restored union with members
of "the yankee race."

177
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,089
"You may forgive us,"

178
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,258
a surrendering rebel officer
told Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain

179
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,761
after the ceremony
at appomattox,

180
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,763
"but we won't <i>be</i> forgiven.

181
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,559
"There is a rancor in our hearts
which you little dream of.

182
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,770
We hate you, sir."

183
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,242
April 14, 1865
was good Friday.

184
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,744
It also marked to the day

185
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,206
the fourth anniversary
of the surrender of fort sumter,

186
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,251
and within the fort's
pulverized walls that morning,

187
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,754
everything was being readied
for a noontime ceremony.

188
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,258
The fort's old union commander,
colonel Robert Anderson,

189
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,760
was to raise the same flag

190
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,264
he had been forced
to haul down in 1861.

191
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,767
An audience of northern soldiers
and dignitaries

192
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,396
and some 4,000 former slaves
watched.

193
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,940
Few local whites
chose to attend.

194
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,279
"At first, I could
not hear colonel Anderson,

195
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,656
"for his voice
came thickly,

196
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,616
"but in a moment,
he said clearly,

197
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,995
<i>"i thank god that I have lived
to see this day.</i>

198
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:29,541
"And after a few more words,
he began to hoist the flag.

199
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,544
"It went up slowly
and hung limp,

200
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,547
"a weather-beaten,
frayed, and shell-torn old flag

201
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,049
"not fit for much more work,

202
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,386
"but when it had crept clear
of the shelter of the walls,

203
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,181
"a sudden breath of wind
caught it,

204
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:50,353
"and it shook its folds and flew
straight out above us.

205
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,731
"I think we stood up.

206
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,233
“Somebody started
<i>the star-spangled banner.</i>

207
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,235
"And we sang the first verse,

208
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,113
"which is
all that most people know.

209
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,574
"But it did not make
much difference,

210
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,120
"fora great gun was fired close
to us from the fort itself,

211
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,248
"followed, in obedience
to the president's order,

212
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,752
<i>"by a national salute
from every fort and battery</i>

213
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,087
<i>that fired upon fort sumter."</i>

214
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,428
In Washington that same day,

215
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,348
John wilkes booth dropped
by Ford's theatre

216
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,350
to pick up his mail.

217
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,853
A stagehand told him
the president and general Grant

218
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,356
were both expected to attend
that night

219
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,858
to see the actress Laura keene

220
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,403
in a British comedy
called our American cousin.

221
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,865
Booth told his band of
devoted followers of a new plan.

222
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,660
He would shoot Lincoln
and Grant.

223
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,703
Lewis paine was to kill

224
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,539
secretary of state
William seward.

225
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,542
George atzerodt was to shoot
the vice president,

226
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,085
Andrew Johnson.

227
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,048
Early that evening,
booth led his horse

228
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,051
out of the livery stable
near Ford's theatre.

229
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,973
A young boy was told to hold it
at the stage door.

230
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,058
At the last minute,

231
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,561
general and Mrs. Grant
begged off the theatre party

232
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,063
and left the city
for Philadelphia.

233
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,565
The lincolns arrived

234
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,569
and took their seats
in the presidential box.

235
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,071
With them were
major Henry rathbone

236
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,407
and his fiancee,
Clara Harris.

237
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,869
<i>What would you
advise, ma?</i>

238
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,204
<i>Just remember,
dear, he's rich.</i>

239
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,500
<i>Hush! Here he comes.</i>

240
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,043
<i>Mr. trenchard!</i>

241
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,045
<i>We were just saying</i>

242
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:43,091
<i>how you always seem sure
of hitting your mark.</i>

243
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,721
The president seemed
to be enjoying the play.

244
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,807
His wife held his hand.

245
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,894
Booth swallowed two brandies
at a nearby bar,

246
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,896
then returned
to the theatre.

247
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,899
He waited
for the laughter to rise,

248
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:03,111
then slipped silently
into the president's box.

249
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,324
He held a dagger
in his left hand,

250
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,742
a derringer pistol
in his right.

251
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,744
<i>The nasty beast!</i>

252
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:17,751
<i>Sir, your vulgarity
renders you intolerable</i>

253
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,753
<i>in polite society.</i>

254
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,177
<i>Maybe I don't know
the manners of polite society,</i>

255
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:32,182
<i>but I guess I know enough to
turn you inside out, old gal,</i>

256
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,352
<i>you sockdolagizing
old man-trap.</i>

257
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,922
Booth fired, then vaulted
over the front of the box,

258
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,862
caught his right spur
in the draped flag,

259
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,949
and landed on stage,
breaking his left leg.

260
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,533
He waved his dagger

261
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,536
and shouted something
to the stunned audience.

262
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,539
Some thought he said,
<i>"sic semper tyrannis" --</i>

263
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,042
thus be it ever
to tyrants,

264
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,543
Virginia's state motto.

265
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,714
Others heard it
as "the south is avenged!"

266
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,051
For a long moment,
the theatre was still,

267
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,429
then Mary Lincoln screamed.

268
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,225
The bullet from booth's pistol

269
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,227
had entered the back
of Lincoln's head,

270
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,229
torn through his brain,

271
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,732
and lodged
behind his right eye.

272
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,903
A surgeon from the audience
pronounced the wound mortal.

273
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,702
Soldiers carried the unconscious
president from the theatre

274
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,247
into a boarding house
across 10th street.

275
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,876
"We put him
on the first floor

276
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,129
"and laid him on the bed.

277
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,381
"When we took him into
the room, we had to get out.

278
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,383
"They wouldn't
let anybody in

279
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,386
without it was a doctor
or something."

280
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,763
Private Jacob soles.

281
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:00,228
"The giant sufferer lay
extended diagonally across the bed,

282
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,231
"which was not long enough
for him.

283
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,108
"He had been stripped
of his clothes.

284
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,194
"His slow, full respiration
lifted the covers

285
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,488
"with each breath he took.

286
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,160
His features were calm
and striking."

287
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,245
Gideon welles.

288
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,248
The doctors could do nothing.

289
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,251
Mary implored her husband
to speak to her

290
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,170
and wept so inconsolably,

291
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,631
she was finally taken
into the front parlor.

292
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,509
Cabinet officers
stood by helpless all night,

293
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,511
doubly shocked to hear

294
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,513
that booth's accomplice
Lewis paine

295
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,058
had stabbed
secretary of state seward,

296
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,018
then run out
into the street crying,

297
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,063
"I'm mad! I'm mad!"

298
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,194
George atzerodt had been
too frightened

299
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,239
to carry out booth's order
to kill the vice president.

300
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,701
Around 6:00 in the morning,

301
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,703
Navy secretary welles
stepped outside

302
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,207
and found the streets filled
with silent, anxious people.

303
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,336
"A little before 7200,
i went back into the room.

304
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,713
"The death struggle
had begun.

305
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,717
"Robert, his son, stood
at the head of the bed.

306
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,719
"He bore himself well,

307
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,723
"but on two occasions gave way
and sobbed aloud,

308
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,268
leaning on the shoulder
of senator Sumner."

309
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:28,650
At 7:22 on the morning
of April 15, 1865,

310
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,152
Abraham Lincoln died.

311
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,155
He was 56 years old.

312
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,158
Secretary of war
Edwin Stanton said,

313
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,370
"now he belongs
to the ages."

314
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,333
His pockets contained
two pairs of spectacles,

315
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,836
a pocket knife,
a linen handkerchief,

316
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,671
and a wallet.

317
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,674
In it were
nine newspaper clippings

318
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,385
and a confederate $5.00 bill.

319
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:08,815
"Mother prepared breakfast
and other meals as usual,

320
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,819
"but not a mouthful was eaten
all day by either of us.

321
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,322
"We each drank half a cup
of coffee. That was all.

322
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:17,866
"Little was said.

323
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,869
"We got every newspaper,
morning and evening,

324
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,205
and passed them silently
to each other."

00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,249
Walt Whitman.

326
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,712
The telegraph carried the news

327
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,714
across the country in minutes.

328
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,215
No president

329
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,342
had ever been murdered.

330
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,517
People would remember
for the rest of their lives

331
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,561
where they were
and what they felt

332
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,229
and what the weather was like

333
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:52,650
when they heard
what had happened.

00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,903
We shall appreciate him
at last."

349
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,823
George Templeton strong.

350
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,244
"On the Avenue
in front of the white house

351
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,246
"were several hundred
colored people,

352
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,248
"mostly women and children,

353
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,250
"weeping and wailing
their loss.

354
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,252
"This crowd did not diminish

355
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,255
"through the whole
of that cold, wet day.

356
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,300
"They seemed not to know
what was to be their fate

357
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,178
"since their great benefactor
was dead,

358
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,765
"and though strong and brave men
wept when I met them,

359
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:09,769
"the hopeless grief
of those poor colored people

360
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,106
affected me more than
almost anything else."

361
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,650
Gideon welles.

362
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,114
Lincoln's casket lay in state,

363
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,616
first in the east room
of the white house,

364
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,619
then in the rotunda
of the capitol.

365
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,748
He was to be buried
in Springfield, Illinois,

366
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,834
his adopted home.

367
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,003
The small coffin
of his son Willy,

368
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,462
who had died in Washington,

369
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,340
was disinterred
to make the journey with him.

370
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,428
Mary Lincoln was
too overcome with grief to go.

371
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,225
The funeral train
took 12 days

372
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:54,314
and traveled 1,662 miles through
the soft spring landscape,

373
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,233
retracing the route
Lincoln had taken to Washington

374
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,235
four years earlier.

375
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,251
In Philadelphia,

376
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,754
Lincoln's coffin lay
in independence hall,

377
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,257
where he had declared he would
"rather be assassinated"

378
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,259
than surrender the principles

379
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,137
embodied in the declaration
of independence.

380
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,780
In New York, the procession
took four hours.

381
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:49,577
Scalpers sold choice window
positions along the route

382
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,121
for $4.00 and up.

383
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,583
From his grandfather's window,

384
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,295
a young Theodore Roosevelt
watched the procession pass.

385
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,600
At Cleveland,
10,000 mourners

386
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,603
passed through a specially built
outdoor pavilion

387
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,064
every hour, all day,

388
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,483
despite a driving rain.

389
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,749
It ended in Springfield
on may 4th.

390
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:41,212
The coffin rode
to the Illinois state house

391
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,215
in a magnificent
black-an d-silver hearse

392
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,217
borrowed from St. Louis

393
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,720
and lay open in the chamber
of the house of representatives

394
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,722
where Lincoln had warned

395
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,768
that "a house divided
against itself cannot stand."

396
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:05,403
Among the thousands of people
who shuffled past his coffin

397
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,449
were many who had known him
in the old days--

398
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,742
farmers from new Salem,

399
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,620
law clients
and rival attorneys,

400
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:19,834
neighbors who had nodded to him
each morning on his way to work.

401
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,752
Sarah, the president's
stepmother,

402
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,254
had had a premonition

403
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,174
when Lincoln left for Washington
four years before.

404
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,136
"I felt it in my heart that
something would happen to him,"

405
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:35,224
she said, "and that i
should see him no more."

406
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,689
General Joseph hooker

407
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,193
led the final, slow march
to oak Ridge cemetery

408
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,403
through a gentle spring rain.

409
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:05,213
"You white people are
the children of Abraham Lincoln.

410
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:09,926
"We are at best
only his stepchildren.

411
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:14,222
"Viewed from the genuine
abolition ground,

412
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:21,062
"Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy,
cold, dull, indifferent,

413
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:25,650
"but measuring him
by the sentiment of his country,

414
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,694
"a sentiment he was bound
as a statesman to consult,

415
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:33,866
"he was swift, zealous,
radical, and determined.

416
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,702
"Taking him all in all,

417
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,747
"measuring the tremendous
magnitude

418
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,707
"of the work before him,

419
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,211
"considering the necessary means
to ends,

420
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:49,715
"infinite wisdom has seldom
sent any man into the world

421
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:55,054
better fitted for his mission
than Abraham Lincoln."

422
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,765
Frederick douglass.

423
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,735
On April 26,

424
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,238
union cavalry trapped
John wilkes booth

425
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,741
in a Virginia tobacco barn
and set it afire.

426
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,244
His accomplice David herold
surrendered.

427
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,745
Booth preferred death.

428
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,831
A soldier shot him
in the neck.

429
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,836
At the end, he asked
to have his hands raised,

430
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:31,382
looked at them, and said,
"useless, useless."

431
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,347
That day, in a farmhouse near
durham station, north Carolina,

432
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,349
confederate general
Joseph johnston

433
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,352
surrendered what was left
of his army

434
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,396
to William tecumseh sherman.

435
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,192
Jefferson Davis,
exhausted but still defiant,

436
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,694
fled southward,

437
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:55,865
hoping somehow to rally
the confederacy from Texas.

438
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:59,869
"It may be that with
a devoted band of cavalry,

439
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,872
"i can force my way
across the Mississippi,

440
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,499
"and if nothing
can be done there,

441
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,835
"then I can go to Mexico

442
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:12,381
and have the world from which
to choose a location."

443
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,468
On may 10
at irwinville, Georgia,

444
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,387
union cavalry
caught up with him.

445
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,973
With the arrest
of its president,

446
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,476
the confederate government
ceased to exist.

447
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:28,272
Davis was sent north to Virginia
under heavy guard.

448
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,900
Northern newspapers spread
the false rumor

449
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,403
that Davis had been apprehended
wearing women's clothes.

450
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,867
North and south, he was reviled
as the villain of the war.

451
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,745
These misconceptions about Davis
are so strange,

452
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,748
that it's as if a gigantic
conspiracy was launched.

453
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,751
It was partly launched
by southerners who,

454
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,294
having lost the war,

455
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,296
did not want to blame it
on their generals,

456
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,131
so they blamed it
on the politicians,

457
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,258
and, of course, Davis
was the chief politician.

458
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,552
So it was the southerners
more than the northerners

459
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,554
who vilified Jefferson Davis.

460
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,766
The northerners wanted to hang
him from a sour apple tree,

461
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:08,020
but, the southerners <i>really</i>
tore him down after the war.

462
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,606
Davis was imprisoned
at fortress Monroe

463
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,109
in a cell kept
perpetually lit

464
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,611
and was made
to wear chains,

465
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,154
though he protested

466
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,116
that "those are orders
for a slave,

467
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:24,120
and no man with a soul in him
vvould obey such orders."

468
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:29,417
"Dear varina, this is not
the fate to which I invited you

469
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:33,421
"when the future was
rose-colored for us both,

470
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:38,426
"but I know you will bear it
even better than myself,

471
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,928
"and that, of us two,

472
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:45,141
I alone will ever look back
reproachfully on my career."

473
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,940
Scattered fighting
stuttered on in Louisiana, Alabama,

474
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,943
and Mississippi,
and even further west,

475
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,863
where on may 13, 1865,

476
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,949
private John j. Williams
of the 34th Indiana

477
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:05,453
became the last man killed
in the civil war,

478
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,622
in a battle
at palmitto ranch, Texas.

479
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:14,211
The final skirmish was
a confederate victory.

480
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,802
On the morning
of may 23, 1865,

481
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:26,307
the American flag flew at
full staff above the white house

482
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:29,310
for the first time
since Lincoln's death.

483
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,313
U.S. Grant and the new
president, Andrew Johnson,

484
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,315
stood side by side

485
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,151
to watch the grand armies
of the Republic pass in review

486
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:42,698
down Pennsylvania Avenue
from the capitol.

487
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,492
"And so it came,

488
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,495
"this glorious
old army of the potomac,

489
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,747
"for six hours marching past,

490
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,832
"18 or 20 miles long,

491
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,335
"their colors telling
their sad history.

492
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,337
"It was a strange feeling

493
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:59,507
"to be so intensely
happy and triumphant

494
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:02,510
and yet to feel
like crying."

495
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:11,393
The great procession
took two days.

496
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,022
General
George Armstrong custer

497
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,525
stole the show
the first day,

498
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,028
galloping past the dignitaries
far ahead of his men,

499
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,530
brandishing his sabre,

500
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,492
his long yellow hair
whipping in the wind.

501
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,453
But the crowds cheered loudest
the next morning

502
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,997
as William tecumseh sherman
rode past

503
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:37,002
at the head of the great army
he had led to the sea.

504
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,467
By may, most of the Yankees

505
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,469
had withdrawn
from clarksville, Tennessee.

506
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,973
What remained of the 49th
and 14th Tennessee regiments

507
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,766
came home.

508
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:53,811
Private John j. Denny
of company k

509
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,479
was not among them.

510
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,983
He had died
at chancellorsville.

511
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,987
Of the 29 Stewart college
seniors who went to war,

512
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,531
16 had been killed
in battle.

513
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:09,535
7 more had died
of wounds and disease.

514
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:17,042
In September, railway service
to clarksville was resumed.

515
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,425
Deer isle, Maine, was
an indirect casualty of the war.

516
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,843
When its men came home,

517
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,845
they found fishing
had fallen off.

518
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:30,431
There was new money to be made
in other industries

519
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,266
in nearby towns.

520
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,476
The old families moved away.

521
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,396
Some of the houses
they left behind

522
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,232
became summer homes
for vacationers,

523
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,320
most of whom were unaware
of what had happened there.

524
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,036
John wilkes booth's
accomplices

525
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,039
were swiftly tried
before a military commission.

526
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,750
All eight were found guilty.

527
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,919
Four were sentenced
to be hanged,

528
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,755
including Mary surratt,
whose only crime may have been

529
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,257
that she owned
the boarding house

530
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,801
in which
the conspirators met.

531
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,929
The executions took place

532
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,932
in the courtyard
of the old penitentiary building

533
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:14,892
on July 7.

534
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,939
The prisoners climbed
the 13 steps

535
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,984
and sat in chairs while
the charges were read aloud.

536
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,446
Two priests
comforted Mrs. surratt

537
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,990
and shielded her
from the sun.

538
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:35,788
White hoods were slipped
over their heads.

539
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,337
General winfield Scott hancock,
the hero of gettysburg,

540
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,339
clapped his hands three times,

541
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,842
and soldiers knocked
the front part of the platform

542
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,095
out from under the condemned.

543
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:11,073
It took them more than
five minutes to die.

544
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,493
A northern newspaper said,

545
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,038
"we want to know
their names no more."

546
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:29,508
"Somewhere they crawled
to die alone in bushes,

547
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:33,512
"low gullies,
or on the sides of hills.

548
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,514
"There, in secluded spots,

549
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:39,018
"their skeletons,
bleached bones, tufts of hair,

550
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,437
"buttons,
fragments of clothing

551
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,981
are occasionally found yet."

552
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:50,446
"Our young men,
once so handsome and so joyous,

553
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,947
"taken from us--

554
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,450
"the son from the mother,

555
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,869
"the husband from the wife,

556
00:33:57,036 --> 00:34:00,956
the dear friend
from the dear friend."

557
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,833
Walt Whitman.

558
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:23,479
3.5 million men
went to war.

559
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,982
620,000 men died in it,

560
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,029
as many as in all the rest
of America's wars combined.

561
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:40,496
1/4 of the south's white men
of military age were dead.

562
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,917
In Iowa, half the men
eligible to fight

563
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,919
served in the union army,

564
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,922
filling 46 regiments in all.

565
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:53,926
13,001 iowans died--

566
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:57,930
3,540 in battle,

567
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:01,934
515 while prisoners of war,

568
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:07,439
and 8,498 of disease.

569
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,193
Those figures were typical.

570
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,112
The 5th New Hampshire regiment

571
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:17,449
started out from Concord
in 1861 with 1,200 men.

572
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,952
When they returned
to New Hampshire

573
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,453
after gettysburg,

574
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,664
there were only 380 left.

575
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,961
In Mississippi in 1866,

576
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,964
1/5 of the state's
entire budget

577
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,384
was spent
on artificial limbs.

578
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:39,555
Millions were left
with vivid memories of men

579
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,474
who should have still
been living but were not.

580
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,436
The survivors went home

581
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,149
and got on
with the business of living.

582
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,444
"The morning
after my arrival home,

583
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,447
"i doffed my uniform
of first lieutenant,

584
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,449
"put on some of
my father's old clothes,

585
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,954
"and proceeded to wage war
on the standing corn.

586
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,956
"The feeling I had
was sort of queer.

587
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,958
"It almost seemed,
sometimes,

588
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:12,129
"as if I had been away
only a day or two

589
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,840
"and had just taken up
the farm work

590
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,342
where I had left off."

591
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:23,015
Leander stillwell,
formerly 61st Illinois.

592
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:27,978
The boys who had gone
off to war were old men now.

593
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,480
They walked over
the old battlefields

594
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,191
with their families,

595
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,735
pointing out the places
where they had once done things

596
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:38,906
that now seemed impossible,
even to them.

597
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:43,410
They had a theoretical
notion of having a country,

598
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:47,456
but when the war was over,

599
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:49,343
on both sides, they knew
they had a country.

600
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,084
They'd been there.

601
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,421
They had walked its hills
and tramped its roads.

602
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,423
They--they saw
the country,

603
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,342
and they knew
they had a country,

604
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,887
and they knew the--the effort
that they had expended

605
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,973
and their dead friends
had expended to preserve it.

606
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,934
It did that.

607
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,978
It made their country
an actuality.

608
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,287
By the turn of the century,

609
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,289
monuments and memorials
and statues

610
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,292
stood in city parks
and courthouse squares

611
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,253
from Maine to Mississippi.

612
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,965
"Number 220--
statue of American soldier.

613
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,925
"Price, $450.

614
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,427
"When used
as a family monument

615
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,806
"and photos of the deceased
soldier can be furnished,

616
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,433
"we will model a new head
in a true likeness.

617
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,229
The extra cost
will be but $150."

618
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,482
The monumental bronze company,
bridgeport, Connecticut.

619
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:04,950
"Hall's hill, Virginia,
July 4, 1865.

620
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,452
"Another independence day
in the army,

621
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,955
"and this has been my fifth.

622
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:13,458
"The first we passed
at camp Clark near Washington,

00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,460
"the second
at Harrison's landing,

"the third at gettysburg,

"the fourth at Petersburg,

"and today we are back
in Washington

627
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,970
"with our work finished.

628
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,972
The day has been fun."

00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,515
Elisha hunt rhodes.

630
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,980
The war made
Elisha hunt rhodes.

631
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,483
Having risen from private
to colonel during the war,

632
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,486
he was promoted
to brigadier general after it,

633
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,490
then went into the cotton
and wool business in Providence.

634
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,994
He devoted nearly every
idle hour to veterans' affairs

635
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,539
and never missed
a regimental reunion.

636
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:29,326
"America has no north,
no south, no east, no west.

637
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:32,537
"The sun rises over the hills
and sets over the mountains.

638
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,540
"The compass just points
up and down,

639
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,043
"and we can laugh now
at the absurd notion

640
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,462
"of there being a north
and a south.

641
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,590
We are one
and undivided."

642
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,675
Sam Watkins.

643
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,805
Sam Watkins returned
to Columbia, Tennessee,

644
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,807
ran the family farm,

645
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,184
and in the evenings
worked on his memoirs,

646
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,644
<i>company aytch,</i>

647
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,272
despite, he said,
"a house full of young rebels

648
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:04,069
clustering around my knees
and bumping my elbows."

649
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,987
But for the war,

650
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:10,867
these men were like
any other possible friends.

651
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:16,373
You can, remember the--
Thomas Hardy's poem.

652
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,875
"Had he and I but met,
in some old ancient inn,

653
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:21,878
we might sit down to wet
right many a nipperkin."

654
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,881
You know, "but ranged as
infantry, standing face to face,

655
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:29,511
"i shot at him as he at me,
and killed him in his place.

656
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:32,013
"Strange and curious,
a war is.

657
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,891
"You shoot a fellow down
you'd treat where any bar is,

658
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,018
or help to half a crown."

659
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,562
Isn't that it?

660
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,814
Especially in our own,
--our own society,

661
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,817
where these men
shared a common history,

662
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,819
men and women,

663
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,821
shared a common
love of Liberty,

664
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,824
gave it slightly
different English

665
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,828
as it spun
through their lives,

666
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:59,958
but at the same time,
when death came

667
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,961
and there was no more
to fight about,

668
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,964
the sort of ocean
of--of love and respect

669
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,966
closed over them again,

670
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,010
and they were together.

671
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:14,973
"I think we understand
what military fame is--

672
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,809
"to be killed
on the field of battle

673
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,313
and have our names spelled
wrong in the newspapers."

674
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,523
William tecumseh sherman.

675
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,487
William tecumseh
sherman remained a soldier,

676
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,489
fighting Indians
and shunning politics

677
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,492
until his retirement
in 1883.

678
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,994
"If nominated,
i will not run,"

679
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,457
he told a republican delegation
urging him to run for president.

680
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,751
"If elected,
i will not serve."

681
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:47,297
He died in New York City
in the winter of 1891.

682
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,300
Among the honorary pallbearers
who stood bareheaded

683
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,969
in the cold wind
outside the church

684
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,971
was 82-year-old
Joe johnston,

685
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:59,017
who had fought sherman
in Georgia and the carolinas.

686
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,187
When a friend warned him
he might fall ill,

687
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:05,190
johnston told him,
"if I were in sherman's place

688
00:42:05,357 --> 00:42:07,192
"and he were
standing here in mine,

689
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,903
he would not
put on his hat."

690
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,907
Johnston died 10 days later
of pneumonia.

691
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,496
"April 1866.

692
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,499
"There are nights here
with the moonlight,

00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,502
"cold and ghastly,
and the whippoorwills

694
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:29,506
"and the screech owls alone
disturbing the silence,

695
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:33,009
"when I could tear my hair
and cry alone

696
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,054
for all that is past
and gone."

697
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,516
Mary chesnut.

698
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,436
When James and Mary chesnut

699
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,438
returned
to mulberry plantation,

700
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,942
they found the old house
stripped by union men,

701
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,945
the cotton burned.

702
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,197
Mary managed
to make a little money

703
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,657
selling butter and eggs

704
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,951
in partnership
with her former slave,

705
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,953
and she continued to write,

706
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,956
but she never completed
the mammoth task

707
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,000
of reworking her war diary.

708
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,968
Jefferson Davis was never
tried for treason,

709
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:18,930
nor could he ever bring himself
to ask for a pardon.

710
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,974
After two years in prison,

711
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,768
he was released on bond
and spent the rest of his life

712
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,146
living off the charity
of a wealthy widow

713
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:28,857
and working
on a massive memoir,

714
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:33,236
<i>the rise and fall
of the confederate government.</i>

715
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,781
He died, still persuaded
of the justice of his cause,

716
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,951
at the age of 81.

717
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,496
Hiram revels of Mississippi
became the first black man

718
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,499
ever elected to
the United States senate,

719
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:50,378
filling the seat
last held by Jefferson Davis.

720
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:53,506
Vice president
Alexander Stephens

721
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,509
was imprisoned briefly
and then re-elected

722
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,512
to his old congressional seat
from Georgia

723
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,557
as if there had never been
a confederacy.

724
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,020
Mary Todd Lincoln

725
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,522
never recovered
from her husband's murder.

726
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,025
Her son tad died in 1871.

727
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:15,028
Five years later,
her eldest son Robert

728
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:18,031
had her committed
to a mental institution.

729
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,034
She spent her last years
in Springfield,

730
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,036
rarely leaving a room

731
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,080
whose curtains
were never raised.

732
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,542
For Clara barton,

733
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,544
the angel
of the battlefield,

734
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,546
the grim work continued.

735
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,840
After the war,
she went down to andersonville

736
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,926
and helped arrange
dignified burial

737
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,636
for thousands
of the union prisoners

738
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,137
who had died there,

739
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:46,393
then went on to found
the American red cross.

740
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,522
On November 10, 1865,
Henry wirz,

741
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,400
commandant
at andersonville prison,

742
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,734
was hanged in the yard

743
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,529
of the old capitol prison
in Washington

744
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:59,030
for war crimes.

745
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,575
He pleaded
he had only followed orders.

746
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,038
Walt Whitman published
<i>drum</i> taps,

747
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,042
a book of civil war poems
he thought his finest,

748
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,545
then turned largely to prose.

749
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:18,091
His writings revolutionized
American literature.

750
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,596
Phil Sheridan went out west
to take on a new enemy,

751
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,058
declaring that the only
good Indian was a dead Indian.

752
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,061
George Armstrong custer
went west, too,

753
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:34,065
carrying with him his belief
in his own invincibility.

754
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:38,528
In 1876, the sioux and Cheyenne
proved him wrong.

755
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:41,489
George mcclellan stayed abroad
for three years

756
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,992
after losing the election
to Lincoln.

757
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,495
He heard no slander
about himself there, he said.

758
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:49,497
Then he came home

759
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,125
and got himself elected
governor of New Jersey.

760
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,169
The conqueror of fort sumter,

761
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,504
Pierre gustave
toutant Beau regard,

762
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,006
promoted railroads,

763
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,008
managed the Louisiana
state lottery,

764
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,093
and got rich.

765
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,053
Nathan bedford forrest

766
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,640
promoted railroads, too,
but failed.

767
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,019
In 1867, he became
the first imperial wizard

768
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,021
of the ku klux klan

769
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:19,110
but quit when the klan
grew too violent even for him.

770
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,530
General Dan sickles
somehow escaped court-martial

771
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,532
for his blunder
at gettysburg.

772
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:27,243
He had the leg he lost
in the peach orchard

773
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,078
mounted in a miniature casket

774
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,457
and gave it to the army
medical museum in Washington,

775
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:38,129
where he visited it regularly
for 50 years.

776
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,256
John bell hood,
who had survived

777
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,342
some of the fiercest fighting
of the war,

778
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:43,927
died with his wife
and daughter

779
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,680
in the New Orleans yellow fever
epidemic of 1878,

780
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:51,351
leaving 10 orphaned children.

781
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,978
George pickett never
overcame his bitterness

782
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,981
over the destruction
of his division at gettysburg.

783
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,983
Suffering
from severe depression,

784
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,821
he turned down offers of command
from the ruler of Egypt

785
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,823
and the president
of the United States

786
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:08,660
and ended up
in the insurance business.

787
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,830
Confederate general
James longstreet

788
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,832
joined the republican party,

789
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,334
served as Grant's
minister to Turkey,

790
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,337
dared to criticize
Lee's strategy at gettysburg,

791
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,172
and for all these things

792
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,174
was considered
a traitor to the south

793
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:26,970
by his former
comrades-in-arms.

794
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,681
Frederick douglass

795
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,528
continued to fight
as hard for civil rights

796
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,518
as he had against slavery

797
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:38,398
and became the most powerful
black politician in America.

798
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:42,694
A young visitor once asked him
what he should do with his life.

799
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:47,532
"Agitate!" The old man answered.
"Agitate! Agitate!"

800
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,994
Julia ward howe

801
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,997
helped lead the American woman's
suffrage association

802
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,416
for 55 years.

803
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,502
At her funeral in 1910,

804
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,005
4,000 mourners
joined in singing

805
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,258
<i>the battle hymn
of the Republic.</i>

806
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,010
Colonel Washington roebling

807
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,512
left the army corps
of engineers,

808
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,223
finished his father's bridge
at Cincinnati,

809
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,350
and went on to build

810
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,813
the greatest suspension bridge
in the world in Brooklyn.

811
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,984
"I have fought against
the people of the north

812
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:26,362
"because I believed they were
seeking to wrest from the south

813
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,573
"its dearest rights,

814
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,909
"but I have never
cherished toward them

815
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,036
"bitter or vindictive feelings,

816
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:38,583
and I have never seen the day
when I did not pray for them."

817
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,252
Robert e. Lee

818
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,546
swore renewed allegiance
to the United States

819
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:47,550
and by so doing persuaded
thousands of his former soldiers

820
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,552
to do the same.

821
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:52,555
He was weary, ailing,
and without work

822
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:55,558
in the summer of 1865

823
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:58,561
when an insurance firm
offered him $50,000

824
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,564
just for the use
of his name.

825
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,566
He turned it down.

826
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:06,069
"I cannot consent
to receive pay

827
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,571
for services
i do not render."

828
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:13,076
He ended up in the noble
way you might have expected

829
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,411
after you'd learned
to expect it.

830
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,539
He was--didn't know what to
do with himself after the war.

831
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,124
His profession was gone.

832
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,293
Even his country was gone.

833
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,296
And he was approached,
with a good deal of hesitation,

834
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,131
by these people
from a little school

835
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,968
called Washington college,

836
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,929
and he accepted the presidency
of Washington college.

837
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:37,684
He had an annual salary of
$1,500 and a house to live in,

838
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,644
and he spent
the rest of his life

839
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:43,523
at what after his death
was called Washington and Lee.

840
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,067
"The greatest mistake
of my life," he said,

841
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:49,028
"was taking
a military education."

842
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:50,655
And whenever his students

843
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,022
and those of the neighboring
Virginia military institute

844
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,367
marched together,

845
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:58,246
Lee made a point
of staying out of step.

846
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,041
He never returned
to Arlington again.

847
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,544
Once, on his way
to Washington,

848
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:08,089
he glimpsed his old home
from a passing train.

849
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,552
He died in 1870.

850
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,556
In his last moments,
he went back to the war,

851
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:19,559
ordering a.P. Hill
to bring up his troops,

852
00:50:19,726 --> 00:50:21,561
just as stonewall Jackson had

853
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,813
on his deathbed
at chancellorsville.

854
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,780
Then Lee called out,
"strike the tent."

855
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,542
"For he will smile

856
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:48,046
"and give you
with unflinching courtesy,

857
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:51,549
"prayers, trappings, letters,
uniforms and orders,

858
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:56,054
"photographs, kindness,
valor and advice,

859
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,057
"and do it
with such grace and gentleness

860
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,977
"that you will know you have
the whole of him pinned down,

861
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:06,064
“mapped out,
easy to understand--

862
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,066
"and so you have.

863
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,568
"All things except the heart.

864
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:13,488
"The heart he kept...
A secret to the end

865
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,282
from all the picklocks
of biographers."

866
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:25,458
"I feel that we are
on the Eve of a new era

867
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,210
"when there is to be
a great Harmony

868
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,630
"between the federal
and the confederate.

869
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:32,548
"I cannot stay
to be a living witness

870
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,717
"to the correctness
of this prophecy,

871
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:40,515
but I feel it within me
that it is to be so."

872
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:42,934
The qualities

873
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:46,020
that served ulysses s. Grant
so well in war--

874
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:50,024
stubbornness, independence,
aversion to politics--

875
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,610
deserted him in peacetime.

876
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,195
He entered the white house

877
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,781
pledged to peace, honesty,
and civil rights,

878
00:51:56,948 --> 00:52:00,785
but corruption tainted
his two terms.

879
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:04,038
After the presidency,
he settled in Manhattan,

880
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:08,543
where he lent his name
to a wall street brokerage firm.

881
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,545
Another partner in the firm

882
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:13,548
stole millions
from the shareholders in 1884

883
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:16,050
and bankrupted
the Grant family.

884
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:20,805
Once again,
U.S. Grant was penniless.

885
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:25,059
At almost the same moment,
he was found to be suffering

886
00:52:25,226 --> 00:52:28,479
from inoperable cancer
of the throat.

887
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,066
Determined to provide
for his family before he died,

888
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,486
he set to work
writing his memoirs.

889
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,614
In the summer of 1885,
he moved to a cottage

890
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,118
at mount McGregor
in the adirondacks.

891
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,662
Unable now to eat or speak,

892
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:48,166
he sat on the front porch
in the afternoons,

893
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:50,501
laboring over his manuscript.

894
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:54,005
He finished it on July 16

895
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:56,382
and died one week later.

896
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:03,014
Grant's memoirs sold
half a million copies

897
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,892
and restored
his family's fortune.

898
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:22,533
In 1913, the government held
a 50th anniversary reunion

899
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,535
at gettysburg.

900
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,413
It lasted three days.

901
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,040
Thousands of survivors

902
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,042
bivouacked
on the old battlefield,

903
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:34,587
swapping stories,
looking up old comrades.

904
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,011
The climax was to be

905
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:44,513
a re-enactment
of pickett's charge.

906
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,058
As the rebel yell rang out

907
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,060
and the old confederates
started forward again

908
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,770
across the fields,

909
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:53,981
a moan, "a gigantic gasp
of unbelief,"

910
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,526
rose from the union men
on cemetery Ridge.

911
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,029
"It was then,"
one onlooker said,

912
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:03,032
"that the Yankees, unable
to restrain themselves longer,

913
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,534
"burst from
behind the stone wall

914
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,788
"and flung themselves
upon their former enemies,

915
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:13,042
"not in mortal combat,
but embracing them

916
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:15,920
in brotherly love
and affection."

917
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,551
"Pageant has passed.

918
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:25,554
"The day is over,
but we linger,

919
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:29,558
"loath to think we shall
see them no more together--

920
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:34,563
these men, these horses,
these colors afield."

921
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,066
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.

922
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:40,069
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain

923
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:41,988
was at the gettysburg reunion,

924
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:46,492
still imposing at 83,
despite almost constant pain

925
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,495
from the unhealed
internal damage done him

926
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,790
by a confederate minie ball
at Petersburg.

927
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:57,503
The reunion was, he said,
a transcendental experience,

928
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,299
"a radiant fellowship
of the fallen."

929
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,009
He had received
the medal of honor

930
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,012
for his courage
at little round top,

931
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,639
served four terms
as governor of Maine,

932
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,517
then became president
of bowdoin college,

933
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,478
where he managed to teach
every subject in the curriculum

934
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,106
except mathematics.

935
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:22,069
He died
of his ancient wound in 1914.

936
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,407
The war was over.

937
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,172
Who won the war?

938
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,841
The union army
obviously won the war

939
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:47,011
in the sense that they were
the army left standing

940
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,012
and holding their weapons

941
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,015
when it was all over.

942
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:54,518
So the soldiers who fought
in the union army,

943
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,520
the generals who directed it,

944
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,523
the president
who led the country during it

945
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,026
won the war.

946
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:06,030
If we're not talking
just about the series of battles

947
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:09,158
that finished up with
the surrender at appomattox,

948
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:12,536
but talking instead
about the struggle

949
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:17,041
to make something higher
and better out of the country,

950
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,543
then the question
gets more complicated.

951
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:23,547
The slaves won the war,
and they lost the war

952
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:28,969
because they won freedom,
that is, the removal of slavery,

953
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:34,141
but they did not win freedom
as they understood freedom.

954
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:37,228
I suppose that slavery

955
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:43,901
is merely the--the horrible
statutory expression

956
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:50,491
of a deeper--of a deeper rift
between people based on race,

957
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:58,499
and that is what
we struggle still to--to heal.

958
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:03,003
And, I think the--the
significance of Lincoln's life

959
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,505
and his victory

960
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:07,508
was that--that
we will never again

961
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,511
enshrine these concepts
into law,

962
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:15,015
but now let's see
what we can do to erase them

963
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,936
from the hearts
and minds of--of people.

964
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,479
The civil war

965
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,524
is not only the central event
of American history,

966
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:27,361
but it's a central event in
large ways for the world itself.

967
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:30,030
If we believe, today, in the
20th century, as surely we must,

968
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,658
that popular government
is the way to go,

969
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:33,993
it is the way

970
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,953
for the emancipation
of the human spirit,

971
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,330
then the civil war
established the fact

972
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,749
that a popular government
could survive,

973
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,419
that it could overcome
an internal secession movement

974
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:44,962
that could destroy it.

975
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,756
So the war
becomes--in essence, it becomes

976
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,800
a testament
for the liberation

977
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,511
of the human spirit
for all time.

978
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,478
Four million Americans
had been freed

979
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,480
after four years of agony,

980
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,483
but the meaning of freedom
in American life

981
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,861
remained un resolved.

982
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,655
"Emancipated slaves
own nothing,"

983
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,657
one Tennessee planter wrote,

984
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:17,870
"because nothing but freedom
has been given them."

985
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,498
Thousands of blacks
wandered Southern roads

986
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:25,169
searching for relatives
or looking for work or food.

987
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,671
Thousands more stayed
on their plantations

988
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,675
as hired hands
or sharecroppers.

989
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,344
The 13th amendment

990
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:36,347
was followed
by a 14th and a 15th,

991
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:37,848
promising full citizenship

992
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,851
and due process
for all American men,

993
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,269
white and black.

994
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,022
But the promises
were soon overlooked

995
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:48,025
in the scramble
for a new prosperity,

996
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,694
and white supremacy
was brutally reimposed

997
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,072
throughout
the old confederacy.

998
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:56,700
The white south
won that war of attrition.

999
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,702
It would take another century

1000
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,205
before blacks
gained back the ground

1001
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:05,084
for which so many
had given their lives.

1002
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,716
I think what we need
to remember most of all

1003
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:18,222
is that the civil war
is not over

1004
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:23,227
until we, today, have done
our part in fighting it,

1005
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:26,230
as well as understanding
what happened

1006
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,316
when the civil war generation
fought it.

1007
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,237
William faulkner, said once

1008
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:39,743
that history is not "was,"
it's "is,"

1009
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:43,664
and what we need to remember
about the civil war

1010
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:46,166
is that the civil war

1011
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,670
is in the present
as well as in the past.

1012
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,172
The generation
that fought the war,

1013
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,342
the generation that argued
over the definition of the war,

1014
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,804
the generation that had
to pay the price in blood,

1015
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,515
that had to pay the price
in blasted hopes

1016
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,684
and a lost future,

1017
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:09,648
also established a standard
that will not mean anything

1018
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,984
until we have finished
the work.

1019
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:15,195
You can say there's
no such thing as slavery anymore

1020
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,864
we're all citizens.

1021
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:21,201
But if we're all citizens,
then we have a task to do

1022
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,121
to make sure that that, too,
is not a joke.

1023
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:29,376
If some citizens live in houses
and others live on the street,

1024
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,212
the civil war
is still going on.

1025
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,715
It's still to be fought,

1026
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:37,092
and regrettably,
it can still be lost.

1027
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:02,660
<i>Gettysburg's guns are
still, and the dead sleep on.</i>

1028
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,163
<i>America's most famous
battleground is a camp again</i>

1029
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,207
<i>with a road dividing
the blue and gray.</i>

1030
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,417
<i>There is no other
dividing line now</i>

1031
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,837
<i>as 2,500 veterans gather
from north and south</i>

1032
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:18,425
<i>to mark the 75th anniversary
of America's armageddon.</i>

1033
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:19,677
<i>Hello.</i>

1034
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:21,178
<i>Hello.
How are you?</i>

1035
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,681
<i>Glad to see you.</i>

1036
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,183
<i>Ha ha ha!
You're all right.</i>

1037
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,686
<i>Woo! Woo!
Woo!</i>

1038
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,688
<i>Woo! Woo!
Woo!</i>

1039
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,189
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

1040
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,440
<i>That's
the rebel yell.</i>

1041
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,901
Woo! Woo! Woo!

1042
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:38,696
We think that we are

1043
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,865
a wholly superior people.

1044
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,660
If we'd been anything like
as superior as we think we are,

1045
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:46,870
we would not
have fought that war,

1046
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,455
but since we did fight it,

1047
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:52,167
we have to make it
the greatest war of all times

1048
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:55,170
and our generals were the
greatest generals of all time.

1049
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,548
It's very American
to do that.

1050
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:37,212
In time, even death itself
might be abolished.

1051
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:40,132
Sergeant Barry Benson,
a south Carolina veteran

1052
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,634
from mcgowen's brigade,
wilcox's division,

1053
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:45,637
a.P. Hill's corp,
army of northern Virginia,

1054
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:47,639
he had enlisted
three months before sumter,

1055
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,684
at age 18,
and served through appomattox--

1056
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:54,188
saw it so when he got around
to composing the reminiscences

1057
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:56,523
he hoped would
"go down amongst my descendants

1058
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,777
for a long time."

1059
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,820
Reliving the war in words,

1060
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,907
he began to wish
he could relive it in fact.

1061
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:08,827
And he came to believe
that he and his fellow soldiers,

1062
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,329
gray and blue,

1063
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:13,457
might one day
be able to do just that,

1064
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:17,544
if not here on earth,
then afterwards in Valhalla.

1065
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:21,673
"Who knows?" He asked, as his
narrative drew toward its close,

1066
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,676
"but it may be given to us,
after this life,

1067
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:26,512
"to meet again
in the old quarters,

1068
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,180
"to play chess and draughts,

1069
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:31,308
"to get up soon to answer
the morning roll call,

1070
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:35,479
"to fall in at the tap of the
drum for drill and dress parade,

1071
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:38,190
"and again to hastily don
our war gear

1072
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:39,858
"while the monotonous patter
of the long roll

1073
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,486
"summons to battle.

1074
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:46,573
"Who knows, but again
the old flags, ragged and torn,

1075
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,035
"snapping in the wind,
may face each other and flutter,

1076
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:51,745
"pursuing and pursued,

1077
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:55,249
"while the cries of victory
fill a summer day.

1078
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,042
"And after the battle,

1079
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,837
"then the slain and wounded
will arise

1080
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,005
"and all meet together
under the two flags,

1081
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,674
"all sound and well.

1082
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:07,010
"There will be talking
and laughter and cheers,

1083
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:10,681
"and all will say,
<i>did it not seem real?</i>

1084
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:14,101
<i>Was it not
as in the old days?"</i>

1085
01:04:14,125 --> 01:05:14,125
