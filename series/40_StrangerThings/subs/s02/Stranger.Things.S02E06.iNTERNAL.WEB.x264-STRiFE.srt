1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,051
Get him out. Go! Go!

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,637
God! Hold on, sweetie!

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,310
I'm right here. Just hold on.

4
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,659
- Vitals?
- Heart rate 220. Temperature's 106.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,494
Will, where does it hurt?

6
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,080
All over.

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,875
She says he feels like he's burning.
Check for burns.

8
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,961
I don't see anything.

9
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:50,425
- Where does it hurt the most, Will?
- Everywhere! Everywhere!

10
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,309
♪ Here we stand or here we fall ♪

11
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,979
♪ History won't care at all ♪

12
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,148
Wait a sec. How big?

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,902
First it was like that.
Now he's like this.

14
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,571
I swear to God, man,
it's just some little lizard, okay?

15
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,448
- It's not a lizard.
- How do you know?

16
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,218
- How do I know if it's not?
- How do you know it's not just a lizard?

17
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,369
Because his face opened up
and he ate my cat.

18
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,919
♪ We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall ♪

19
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:35,178
♪ While you're waiting
For the hammer to fall ♪

20
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,148
I don't hear shit.

21
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,149
He's in there.

22
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,918
All right, listen, kid. I swear, if this
is some sort of Halloween prank,

23
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,128
- you're dead.
- It's not.

24
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,504
- All right?
- It's not a prank.

25
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,922
Get it out of my face.

26
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,841
You got a key for this thing?

27
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,393
Let me see that.

28
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,396
He must be further down there.

29
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,484
I'll stay up here
in case he tries to escape.

30
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,109
Steve?

31
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,405
Steve, what's going on down there?

32
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,867
Get down here.

33
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,748
Oh, shit.

34
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,878
Oh, shit!

35
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,969
No way.

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,013
No way.

37
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,213
That thing, it...
it did something to him.

38
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,716
Okay. And these now-memories,
as you call them,

39
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,468
how long has he been experiencing them?

40
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,928
I told you, since Thursday.
Since I found him in the field.

41
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,513
And why wasn't he brought in?

42
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,224
I have been bringing him in,
and what have you done?

43
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,018
Nothing. Nothing!

44
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,062
These are new symptoms, Joyce.

45
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:58,441
No. No, he has been telling you
over and over that something's wrong,

46
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,964
and you said it was all in his head.

47
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,820
You said, "Be patient."
Those were your words.

48
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,656
I understand that you're upset,
okay? I get it.

49
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,380
I would be, too, if I were in your shoes.

50
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,828
But we are all in the same boat here,
and I just need you to try...

51
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,498
What? Stay calm? Trust you?

52
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,127
No, I want him transferred
to a real hospital.

53
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,629
Well, you know that's not possible.

54
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,232
He really will get
the best treatment here, Mrs. Byers.

55
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,299
The very best.

56
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,431
And what are you
treating him for, exactly?

57
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,937
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with him?

58
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:41,442
Can a single person in this room
tell me what is wrong with my boy?

59
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,073
What is wrong with my boy?

60
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,451
You see why I have
to stop the truth from spreading, too.

61
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,954
Just the same as those weeds there.

62
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,872
By whatever means necessary.

63
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,646
Whoo-hoo!

64
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,483
- To taking down the man.
- To taking down the man.

65
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,700
Commie bastards sure know how
to make a spirit. Am I right?

66
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,538
- Oh, no, no, no. We... we can't.
- Yeah, no. No, I've got to drive.

67
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,874
Drive? What, tonight?

68
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,875
Our parents...

69
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,086
Would be proud
if they knew what you were up to.

70
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,007
Just tell 'em you're at Tammy's
or Dawn's or whoever's,

71
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,134
and take my guest room.

72
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,848
- I mean, do... do you want to stay?
- Well, it is pretty late.

73
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,186
Okay. Uh...
Could I use the sofa?

74
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,524
Okay, I'm confused.
What's going on here? A lovers' quarrel?

75
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,527
- No, no. I mean, we're just friends.
- Friends.

76
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:18,581
You've told me a lot of shockers today,
but that, that is the first lie.

77
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,042
- It's not a lie.
- No?

78
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,669
You're young, attractive.

79
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:29,842
You've got chemistry, history,
plus the real shit, shared trauma.

80
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,929
Trust issues, am I right?

81
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,348
Something to do with your dad.

82
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,601
- What? No, I mean, my dad's...
- An asshole.

83
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,438
Hmm. It is a curse to see so clearly.

84
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,983
You, you're harder to read.

85
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,194
Probably, like everyone,

86
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:53,032
afraid of what would happen if you
accepted yourself for who you really are

87
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:58,079
and retreated back to the safety of...

88
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,665
- Name? Name?
- Steve.

89
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:04,460
Oh. Steve. We like Steve.

90
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,087
Yes.

91
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,923
- But we don't love Steve.
- What?

92
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:14,011
No, we... I mean, I do.

93
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:20,893
There it is, ladies and germs,
the second lie of the evening.

94
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,688
So, how'd I do?

95
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,944
My goodness.
You two are adorable, aren't you?

96
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,657
Listen...

97
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,493
there's a pull-out sofa in my study
if you want it.

98
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,453
But if I were you,

99
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,666
I'd cut the bullshit
and share the damn bed.

100
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,302
Afraid.

101
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,352
Trust issues?

102
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,896
Trust issues.

103
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,899
Retreat?

104
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,569
I don't retreat.

105
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,031
Trust issues? I do not...

106
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,415
Oh. Hey.

107
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,999
Hey.

108
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,461
I just, uh...

109
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,755
I... I just wanted to say that...

110
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,091
Oh, no, don't... I mean... He's so drunk.

111
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,635
- Wasted.
- Yeah.

112
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,013
I mean, what? He knows us for a couple
of hours, and he's got us all figured out?

113
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,097
Exactly.

114
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,101
God. Okay, yeah. I feel...
I'm glad we feel the same way.

115
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,811
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

116
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,110
Uh...

117
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,697
So, uh, good night, I guess.

118
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,034
Yeah, um, good night.

119
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,804
Oh, He-Man, thank you for saving my life.
What strong muscles you have.

120
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,893
- I knew it.
- Hey! They're in love!

121
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,355
No, actually, they're not.
They don't even exist on the same planet.

122
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,066
Aren't you too old
to be playing with toys?

123
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,863
That... that's not the point.
The point is to stay out of my room.

124
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,699
Then tell your little nerdy friend
to shut his mouth.

125
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,077
What are you talking about?

126
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,831
"Code red, Lucas. Code red. Code red."

127
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,499
Bunch of nerds.

128
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,713
No, no, no, no, no, no.

129
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,632
Dustin!

130
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,887
This is Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin?

131
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,431
- Well, well, well, look who it is.
- Sorry, man.

132
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,974
My stupid sister turned it off.

133
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,727
Well, when you were having
sister problems, Dart grew again,

134
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,396
he escaped, and I'm pretty sure
he's a baby Demogorgon.

135
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,690
- Wait. What?
- I'll explain later.

136
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,026
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.
- Steve?

137
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,944
And bring your binoculars
and wrist rocket.

138
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,237
Steve Harrington?

139
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,573
All right, let's go.

140
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,534
Just be there, stat. Over and out.

141
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,793
All right, cowboy, good news.

142
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,962
We're giving you the green light.

143
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,631
How you feeling?

144
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,092
Never better.

145
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,637
All right, well, got a present for ya.

146
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,767
- The hell is that?
- Uh, something you should see.

147
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,530
Watch your step.

148
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:19,692
All living organisms develop
defense mechanisms against attack.

149
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,487
They adapt. They find some way to survive.

150
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,876
Oh, my God.

151
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,879
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?

152
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,881
It's been spreading,

153
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,509
growing beneath us like some cancer.

154
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,305
- Why aren't you burning it?
- There's a complication.

155
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,105
They made me sign,
like, a thousand documents.

156
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,860
I mean...
we all had to. We had to.

157
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,738
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.

158
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,324
They're gonna make you
do the same. I'm sure.

159
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,784
Yeah. Well, hey, whatever.

160
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,747
What kind of documents?

161
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,666
Uh, confidentiality,

162
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,211
and there were these official forms
saying, like, nothing ever happened,

163
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,296
which is why...

164
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,215
Will got lost in the woods.

165
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,299
Yeah.

166
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:33,140
Man, I always thought stuff like this
happened in movies and comic books.

167
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,019
Certainly not in Hawkins,
and certainly not to someone like you.

168
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,313
- Or you.
- Yeah.

169
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,275
Bob Newby, superhero.

170
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,114
You cold?

171
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,450
Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.

172
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,911
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.

173
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,746
- Okay.
- Okay? I'm fine.

174
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,956
I'm fine.

175
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,836
It's not like you didn't warn me.
"This is not a normal family."

176
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,047
- Isn't that what you said?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,217
You weren't kidding.

178
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,805
It kinda makes my idea of moving to Maine
sound a little less crazy, right?

179
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,599
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all.

180
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,687
Mom?

181
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,398
Hey.

182
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,567
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor!

183
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,571
- Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay?
- Okay, they're on their way.

184
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,655
Hey.

185
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,994
- Who is that?
- What?

186
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,038
- What?
- It's me, big guy. It's Bob.

187
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,333
Are you a...

188
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,545
doctor?

189
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,966
No. No, it's just me. Just... just Bob.

190
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,423
So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?

191
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,092
Uh, sorry?

192
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,762
The sofa.

193
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,682
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.

194
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,350
I bet.

195
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,230
Oops.

196
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,233
Mmm.

197
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,737
Oh, yeah.

198
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,782
Yeah, we just, um...

199
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,743
We just had some fun girl time.

200
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,721
- Will you be back for dinner?
- Mmm-hmm.

201
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,973
- Yeah, I'll be home real soon.
- Say hey to Ally for me.

202
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,500
Okay. All right.
I love you, too, Mom. Bye.

203
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,630
She said Mike's at your brother's house.
They just had a sleepover. So...

204
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,298
Oh, okay.

205
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,133
Do you wanna try again?

206
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,179
No. No, it's fine. They're probably
just at the matinée or something.

207
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah, I'm sure.

208
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,566
For your travels.

209
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,112
And to water it down.

210
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,363
Got it.

211
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,034
Thank you for everything.

212
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,247
Don't thank me yet.
Just keep your eyes on the papers, hmm?

213
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,541
And if you need to reach me again...

214
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,168
don't.

215
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,065
Twenty-one.

216
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,112
Twenty-two.

217
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,242
- Max, are you getting that or what?
- Okay!

218
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,161
Swear to God, Max!

219
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,381
What are you doing here?

220
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,716
- I have proof.
- What?

221
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,594
Proof that what I told you was real.
But we have to hurry.

222
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,470
What kind of proof?

223
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,916
Who the hell were you talking to?

224
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,588
Mormons.

225
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,255
Mormons?

226
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,175
Talkative ones.

227
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,236
Come on, hop on.

228
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,031
Hurry.

229
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,743
This better be good, stalker.

230
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,422
Do you know your name?

231
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,757
Will.

232
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,635
- Your full name?
- William Byers.

233
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,929
Do you know... Do you know who I am?

234
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,140
A doctor.

235
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,185
Have we met before?

236
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,272
- I don't remember.
- Hmm.

237
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,149
You don't remember me?

238
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,152
Okay.

239
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,029
How about, uh... How about this guy here?

240
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,118
Know who that is?

241
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,207
It's all right. Take your time.

242
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,044
That's my friend.

243
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,547
Mike.

244
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,676
What about me, kid? You remember me?

245
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,436
They tell me you helped save me
last night. You remember that?

246
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,816
Do you remember anything about last night?
About what happened?

247
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,445
I remember they hurt me.

248
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,741
You mean the doctors?

249
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,995
No. The soldiers.

250
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,289
The soldiers hurt you?

251
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,042
They shouldn't have done that.

252
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,502
It upset him.

253
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,718
You say, "Upset him." Is that him?

254
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,770
Okay. Okay, I wanna try something.

255
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,980
It's gonna seem a little odd at first,

256
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,858
but I think it's really gonna help us
understand what's going on.

257
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,984
Is that okay?

258
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,236
Okay.

259
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:53,080
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know
if you feel anything. Okay?

260
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,472
- Do you feel anything?
- Little sting.

261
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,100
It stings? Where?

262
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,351
My chest.

263
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,562
- Okay, son.
- Sweetie...

264
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,109
- How about now?
- It... it burns.

265
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,610
Ah!

266
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,070
- It burns.
- Where?

267
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,447
Everywhere.

268
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,075
That's enough. That's enough!

269
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,078
Stop! You heard her! That's enough!

270
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,496
That's it! We're done!

271
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,331
Okay.

272
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,126
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.

273
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:45,841
Our best guess right now
is it's some kind of virus

274
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,220
which is causing
this neurological disorder.

275
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,432
Now, when... when a typical virus
attaches itself to its host...

276
00:23:55,934 --> 00:24:01,481
it duplicates, right? It spreads,
essentially hijacking the host.

277
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,067
A virus is alive. It has an intelligence.

278
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,195
That's not... That's not unusual.

279
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,615
What is so unusual here,

280
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:16,371
this virus... the infected hosts
seem to be communicating.

281
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:24,963
It has some sort of a hive intelligence,
and it's connecting all the hosts.

282
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,633
The good news is a virus can be cured.

283
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,469
We... we're gonna continue to run tests.

284
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,638
We're gonna see what we find.

285
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:39,060
What happens
when he can't remember anything?

286
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,438
When there's
nothing else there?

287
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,150
What happens when my boy is gone?

288
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,828
All right,
so let me get this straight.

289
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,247
You kept something
you knew was probably dangerous

290
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:04,252
in order to impress a girl who...
who you just met?

291
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,756
All right,
that's grossly oversimplifying things.

292
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,425
I mean, why would a girl
like some nasty slug anyway?

293
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,053
An interdimensional slug?
Because it's awesome.

294
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,936
Well, even if she thought it was cool,
which she didn't, I... I just...

295
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,344
I don't know. I just feel like
you're trying too hard.

296
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,966
Well, not everyone can have
your perfect hair, all right?

297
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,688
It's not about the hair, man.

298
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,816
The key with girls is just...
just acting like you don't care.

299
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,528
- Even if you do?
- Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.

300
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,198
- Then what?
- You just wait until, uh...

301
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,328
- until you feel it.
- Feel what?

302
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,914
It's like before it's gonna storm,
you know?

303
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,708
You can't see it,
but you can feel it, like this, uh...

304
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,587
electricity, you know?

305
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,632
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field
when the clouds in the atmosphere...

306
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,219
No, no, no, no, no.
Like a... Like a sexual electricity.

307
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,302
Oh.

308
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,766
You feel that and then you make your move.

309
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,309
So that's when you kiss her?

310
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,062
- No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo.
- Sorry.

311
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:08,233
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah,
they want you to be aggressive.

312
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,027
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a...

313
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,738
- I don't know, like a lion.
- Mmm.

314
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,575
But others, you gotta be slow,
you gotta be stealthy, like a...

315
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,244
like a ninja.

316
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,787
What type is Nancy?

317
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,833
Nancy's different.
She's different than the other girls.

318
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,502
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.

319
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,212
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

320
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:34,050
But this girl's special, too, you know.
It's just, like, something about her.

321
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,428
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

322
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,513
You're not falling in love with this girl,
are you?

323
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,974
Uh, no. No.

324
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,894
- Okay, good. Don't.
- I won't.

325
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,398
She's only gonna break your heart,
and you're way too young for that shit.

326
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,449
Fabergé.

327
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,533
What?

328
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
It's Fabergé Organics.

329
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,582
Use the shampoo and conditioner,
and when your hair's damp...

330
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,791
It's not wet, okay?

331
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,460
- When it's damp...
- Damp.

332
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,796
You do four puffs
of the Farrah Fawcett spray.

333
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,800
- Farrah Fawcett spray?
- Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.

334
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,971
You tell anyone I just told you that
and your ass is grass.

335
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,015
You're dead, Henderson. Do you understand?

336
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,098
Yup.

337
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,311
Okay.

338
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,816
- Farrah Fawcett, really?
- I mean, she's hot.

339
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,526
Yeah.

340
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,796
Hey, it's, uh...

341
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
It's me.

342
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,554
I know that I've been
gone too long, and, uh...

343
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,767
It's... I just, I want you to know
that it's not about you

344
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,727
and it's not about our fight.

345
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,021
Okay?

346
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,236
Something came up, and I will...
I will explain it all when I see you.

347
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,780
I just... I want you to know
that I'm not mad.

348
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,283
I'm just sorry.

349
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,414
About everything.

350
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,794
I...

351
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,756
I don't want you to get hurt at all.

352
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,344
And I don't wanna lose you.

353
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,147
Just make sure you heat up
some real food. Not just Eggos.

354
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,192
And I want you to eat all the peas,
even if they're mushy and gross. And...

355
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,822
I will be home soon.

356
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,565
This is him last week.

357
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,541
And there are the hippocampal
abnormalities we had discussed.

358
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,334
Nothing out of line with what we've seen

359
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,463
from others suffering
from post-traumatic stress. But...

360
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,924
this is Will from last night.

361
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,134
And as you can see,

362
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,929
there are now abnormalities
in the limbic and paralimbic areas.

363
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,013
And this...

364
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,976
is from an hour ago.

365
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,154
- I don't hear any suggestions.
- We have bigger problems than the boy.

366
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,573
- Do we?
- We can't keep delaying the burn.

367
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,119
You're talking about putting...
putting a Band-Aid on this.

368
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,331
- Right now, a Band-Aid is the best option.
- It's our only option.

369
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,129
- And if it kills the boy?
- Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.

370
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,465
Say that to me again.

371
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,011
The rate this is spreading,
he'll be lost by the end of the day.

372
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,223
What we do or don't do
won't change the outcome.

373
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,891
We have to start the burn.

374
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,437
Where you going?

375
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,189
I'm going to think.

376
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,615
What the hell is taking so long?

377
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:33,581
Hey... doctors take forever, always.
Just try and relax. Just be patient.

378
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,554
You know, I just...

379
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,727
Let me through. Let me through!

380
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,747
- You know we can't do that.
- I need to talk to...

381
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,732
- He'll be with you shortly.
- You said that an hour ago.

382
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,248
Will.

383
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,709
Will? Will?

384
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,880
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?

385
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,258
Uh...

386
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,634
I saw something.

387
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,096
In your now-memories?

388
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,310
The shadow monster.

389
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,355
I think I know how to stop him.

390
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,832
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.

391
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,876
This will do just fine.

392
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,586
Good call, dude.

393
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,805
I said medium-well!

394
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,018
Who's that?

395
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,860
You told her?

396
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,695
- So what?
- "So what?"

397
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,965
- You wanted to tell her, too.
- But I didn't, all right?

398
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,742
We agreed not to tell her
and to look for Dart.

399
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,912
- Who you conveniently found.
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

400
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,539
I'm saying you have
a creepy little bond with him.

401
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,917
Yeah, that was before
he turned into a Demogorgon.

402
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,877
- And you haven't heard from Mike?
- No.

403
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,170
- Or Will?
- No.

404
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,881
- Hopper?
- No! No one is around.

405
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,175
Why do you think
I'm with Steve Harrington?

406
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,011
- Something's...
- Wrong. I agree.

407
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,722
Which is why we need
as much help as we can get.

408
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,479
She didn't believe me anyway.

409
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,315
You probably didn't tell it right.

410
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,525
That must be it.

411
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,611
So, we good?

412
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,993
Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one
helping me out is this random girl?

413
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,996
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go.
Let's go, I said!

414
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,498
- All right, asshole! God!
- Okay! Stupid.

415
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,976
What...

416
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,604
What is all of this?

417
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,900
I don't know.

418
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,986
Mom?

419
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,363
Will?

420
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,142
I don't shoot Polaroid.

421
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,770
- What?
- It's not mine.

422
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,314
Someone else has been here.

423
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,458
Sam, this is ludicrous.

424
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,794
- Just give him a moment, okay?
- We don't have time...

425
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,172
Hey, jackass, why don't you
do us all a favor and shut up, okay?

426
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,684
That's it.

427
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,813
That's what? What... what's there, Will?

428
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,065
I don't know.

429
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,070
I just know
he doesn't want me to see there.

430
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,240
I think it's important.

431
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,145
Let's see if this kid's a wizard
or schizo, Doc.

432
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,608
First door on your right, gentlemen.

433
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,654
- I'm guessing a ten.
- Let's not overdo it now.

434
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,782
I read four.

435
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,868
Moving in.

436
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,102
So you really fought
one of these things before?

437
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,482
And you're, like, totally,
100% sure it wasn't a bear?

438
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,652
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay?
It wasn't a bear.

439
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,946
Why are you even here
if you don't believe us?

440
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,240
Just go home.

441
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,327
Geesh. Someone's cranky.
Past your bedtime?

442
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,211
That's good. Just show her you don't care.

443
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,254
I don't.

444
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,509
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.

445
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,105
- It's kinda awesome.
- Huh?

446
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,732
The fog, I mean.

447
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,818
Looks like the ocean.

448
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,237
- You miss it?
- What?

449
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,741
The ocean. The waves? California?

450
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,789
- Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.
- No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

451
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,088
My dad's still there. So...

452
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,176
- Why?
- It's this legal term called "divorce."

453
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,762
See, when two married people
don't love each other anymore...

454
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,845
Yeah.

455
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,267
My mom and my stepdad,

456
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,898
they wanted a fresh start away from him.

457
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:24,695
As if... As if he was the problem,
which is total bull.

458
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,405
And things...

459
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,241
are just worse now.

460
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,869
My stepbrother's always been a dick,

461
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:37,583
but now he's just angry...
all the time and...

462
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,339
Well, he can't take it out
on my mom, so...

463
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,050
So he takes it out on you?

464
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,180
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

465
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:58,437
It's just... I know that I can be
a jerk like him sometimes,

466
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,984
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.

467
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,198
I guess I'm angry, too, and...

468
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,827
I'm sorry.

469
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,250
Jesus! What's wrong with me?

470
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,336
Hey. You're nothing
like your brother, okay?

471
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,799
You're cool and different.
And you're super smart.

472
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:31,053
And you're, like, totally tubular.

473
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,598
- Nobody actually says that, you know.
- Well, I do now.

474
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,767
And it makes you seem really cool.

475
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,854
I like talking with you, Mad Max.

476
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,524
And I like talking with you, stalker.

477
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,368
- You see him?
- No.

478
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,122
Lucas, what's going on?

479
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,248
Hold on!

480
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,382
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock!

481
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,051
There.

482
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,762
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

483
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,810
- Wait. You sure that's not a dog?
- What?

484
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,065
He's not taking the bait.
Why is he not taking the bait?

485
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,234
Maybe he's not hungry?

486
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,154
Maybe he's sick of cow.

487
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,582
Steve? Steve, what are you doing?

488
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,208
Steve?

489
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,379
Just get ready.

490
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,783
Come on, buddy.

491
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,999
- What's he doing?
- Expanding the menu.

492
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,876
Come on, buddy.

493
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,505
Come on, buddy.

494
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,758
Come on. Dinner time.

495
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,345
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.

496
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,598
He's insane.

497
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,559
He's awesome.

498
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,832
Steve, watch out!

499
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,083
A little busy here!

500
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,378
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!

501
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,134
Steve!

502
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,555
Steve! Abort! Abort!

503
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,148
- Steve, run!
- Steve, hurry!

504
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,482
Steve, run!

505
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,945
Shit!

506
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,697
Are they rabid or something?

507
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,366
They can't get in! They can't!

508
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,457
Shit!

509
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,794
Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone!

510
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,046
Shit!

511
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,258
We're at the old junkyard,
and we are going to die!

512
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,566
Out of the way! Out of the way!
You want some? Come get this!

513
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,892
Jeez.

514
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,195
What happened?

515
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,905
I don't know.

516
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,907
- Steve scared 'em off?
- No.

517
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,491
No way.

518
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,370
They're going somewhere.

519
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,720
- Almost there, ladies.
- Roger.

520
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,359
All right, stay frosty, boys.

521
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,709
- Wait. That's where I was.
- What?

522
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,836
It's that damn graveyard.

523
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,976
Sir, there's nothing here.

524
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,787
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.

525
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,411
Got some kind of fog
moving in now.

526
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,667
I'm sorry.

527
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,213
What? What do you mean, sweetie?

528
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,716
He made me do it.

529
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,887
Who? Who made you do what?

530
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,889
I told you.

531
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,183
They upset him.

532
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,269
They shouldn't have done that.

533
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,272
They shouldn't have upset him.

534
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,233
The spy.

535
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,945
The spy!

536
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,029
We've got movement.

537
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,365
You've got company, fellas.

538
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,159
Whoa, whoa!

539
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,078
I need to get through! It's a trap!

540
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,580
It's a trap! I need to warn them.
It's a trap!

541
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,920
I can't see shit!
Where are they? Where are they?

542
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,214
They're right on you!

543
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,341
- Wait, what?
- What was that?

544
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,435
Will, sweets, talk to me.
You got to help me understand.

545
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,979
It's too late.

546
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,008
You should go now.

547
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,062
They're almost here.

548
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:31,086
