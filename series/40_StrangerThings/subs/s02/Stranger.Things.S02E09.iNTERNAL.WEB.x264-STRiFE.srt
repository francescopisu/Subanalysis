1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,552
Eleven.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,595
Mike.

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,767
Is that...

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,399
I never gave up on you.

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,361
I called you every night.
Every night for...

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,904
353 days.

7
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,991
I heard.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,452
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,895
- That you were okay?
- Because I wouldn't let her.

10
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,835
- The hell is this? Where you been?
- Where have you been?

11
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,796
You've been hiding her.

12
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,550
- You've been hiding her this whole time!
- Hey!

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,635
Let's talk.

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,637
Alone.

15
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,313
- Protecting her! Protecting her?
- Listen. Listen to me.

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,690
The more people know about her,
the more danger she's in.

17
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,984
And the more danger
you and your family are in...

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,360
So I should be thanking you?

19
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,031
I'm not asking you to thank me!
I'm asking you to try to understand.

20
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,449
I don't! I don't understand!

21
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,368
That's fine. That's fine!
Just do not blame her!

22
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,329
All right? She's upset enough as it is.

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,790
I don't blame her! I blame you!
I blame you!

24
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,083
That's okay, kid. That's okay.

25
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,294
No! Nothing about this is okay!

26
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,922
- Nothing about this is okay!
- Oh, jeez...

27
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,673
You're a stupid, disgusting,

28
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,693
- lying piece of shit!
- Okay. All right! Stop it.

29
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,636
- Liar! Liar! Liar!
- Stop it. It's okay.

30
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,305
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Liar! Liar!

31
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,063
You're okay, kid. You're okay.

32
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,359
I'm sorry, kid.

33
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,823
- We missed you.
- I missed you, too.

34
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,991
We talked about you
pretty much every day.

35
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,456
Teeth.

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,208
- What?
- You have teeth.

37
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,712
Oh. You like these pearls?

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,422
Eleven?

39
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,553
Hey. Um, I'm Max.

40
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,971
I've heard a lot about you.

41
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,311
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

42
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,565
Hey.

43
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,068
Can I see him?

44
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,543
He's not doing well.

45
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,006
I know.

46
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,384
I saw.

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,928
What else did you see?

48
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,985
You opened this gate before, right?

49
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,156
Yes.

50
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,454

that you could close it?

Nancy? No, no, no. Not my type. Uh...

69
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,624
No, actually,
I am looking for my little sister Max.

70
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,334
Goes by Maxine.

71
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,462
She's been missing all day,
and, uh, to be honest with you,

72
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,465
- I've been worried sick, you know, so...
- Oh.

73
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,594
I thought she was at Lucas', but
Mrs. Sinclair said your house is the...

74
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,431
the designated hangout, so, you know...

75
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,143
Here I am.

76
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,732
Their driveway is pretty dark
this time of night.

77
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,110
So drive slowly.

78
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,321
Always.

79
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,990
And when you see Mike,
tell him to come home already, okay?

80
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,867
You're a real lifesaver, you know that?

00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,995

A lot. And, I mean,
that's considering we can get in there.

90
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,281
The place is crawling with those dogs.

91
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,240
Demo-dogs.

92
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:34,036
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said, uh, Demo-dogs.

93
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,621
Like Demogorgon and dogs.

94
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,625
You put them together,
it sounds pretty badass...

95
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,987
How is this important right now?

96
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,376
It's not. I'm sorry.

97
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
I can do it.

98
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,504
You're not hearing me.

99
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,923
I'm hearing you. I can do it.

100
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,384
Even if El can,
there's still another problem.

101
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,348
- If the brain dies, the body dies.
- I thought that was the whole point.

102
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,056
It is,
but if we're really right about this...

103
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,185
I mean, if El closes the gate
and kills the mind flayer's army...

104
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,686
Will's a part of that army.

105
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,354
Closing the gate will kill him.

106
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,245
- He likes it cold.
- What?

107
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,290
It's what Will kept saying to me.

108
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,792
He likes it cold.

109
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,047
We keep giving it what it wants.

110
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,843
If this is a virus,
and Will's the host, then...

111
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,929
Then we need
to make the host uninhabitable.

112
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,515
So if he likes it cold...

113
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,974
We need to burn it out of him.

114
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,185
We have to do it somewhere
he doesn't know this time.

115
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,603
Yeah, somewhere far away.

116
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:47,193
Take Denfield,
then you'll see a large oak tree.

117
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,655
You're gonna swing a right.
That road is gonna dead-end.

118
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,074
And it's about a five-minute walk
from there.

119
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,953
Okay. Denfield to oak tree.
Swing a right.

120
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,205
That's it. But it's channel ten, right?

121
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,957
It's channel ten. Listen...

122
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,793
You let me know
when that thing is out of him.

123
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,429
You should go with him.

124
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,141
- What?
- With Jonathan.

125
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,979
- No, I'm...
- I'm not just gonna leave Mike.

126
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,398
No one's leaving anyone.

127
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,113
I may be a pretty shitty boyfriend,
but...

128
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,826
turns out I'm actually
a pretty damn good babysitter.

129
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,752
Steve...

130
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,087
It's okay, Nance.

131
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,464
It's okay.

132
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,759
I...

133
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,816
Just be careful, okay?
I can't lose you again.

134
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,611
You won't lose me.

135
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,445
Do you promise?

136
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,698
Promise.

137
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,247
El... Come on, let's go. It's time.

138
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,251
Okay.

139
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,846
So, what, we're just
not gonna talk about it, huh?

140
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,557
About what?

141
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,651
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just curious, you know,

142
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,396
why all of a sudden
you look like some kind of MTV punk.

143
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,777
I'm not mad, kid. I just want to know
where you've been.

144
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,655
That's all.

145
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,076
To see Mama.

146
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,205
Okay.

147
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,710
- How'd you get there?
- A truck.

148
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,836
A truck?

149
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,462
A big truck.

150
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,007
A big truck? Whose truck was it?

151
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,926
- A man's.
- A man's?

152
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,469
A nice man.

153
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,766
Okay. So let me just
get this straight in my head.

154
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,060
So a nice man in a big truck,

155
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,187
he drove you to your mama's,
and then what?

156
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,065
Your Aunt Becky gave you
those clothes and that makeup?

157
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,524
I...

158
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,653
I shouldn't have left.

159
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,158
Mmm-mmm.

160
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,950
No.

161
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,746
No, this isn't on you, kid.
I should've been there.

162
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,210
I should never have lied to you
about your mom.

163
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,546
Or about when you could leave.

164
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,549
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.

165
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,387
Sometimes I feel like I'm...

166
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,770
Like I'm just some kind of black hole
or something.

167
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,980
A black hole?

168
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,775
Yeah, it's a...
You know, it's this thing in outer space.

169
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,613
It's like, it sucks everything towards it
and destroys it.

170
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,658
Sarah had a picture book
about outer space. She loved it.

171
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,786
Who's Sarah?

172
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,370
Sarah?

173
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,251
Sarah's my girl.

174
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,923
She's my little girl.

175
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,426
Where is she?

176
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,139
Well, that's kind of the thing, kid.
She, uh...

177
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,143
She left us.

178
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,898
- Gone.
- Yeah.

179
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,318
The black hole. It got her.

180
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,573
And somehow...

181
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,661
I've just been scared, you know?

182
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,122
I've just been scared
that it would take you, too.

183
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,833
I think that's why I get...

184
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,503
so mad.

185
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,007
I'm so sorry.

186
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,885
For everything.

187
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,849
I could be so... so...

188
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,184
Stupid?

189
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,479
Yeah. Stupid.

190
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,399
Just really stupid.

191
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,077
I've been stupid, too.

192
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,746
I guess we broke our rule.

193
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,001
I don't hate it, by the way.

194
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,294
This whole...

195
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
look.

196
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,508
It's kinda cool.

197
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,303
Bitchin'.

198
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,140
Okay. Sure.

199
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,772
Bitchin'.

200
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,468
All right.

201
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,887
It should fit now.

202
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,764
Is this really necessary?

203
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,934
Yes, it is, okay? This is
a ground-breaking scientific discovery.

204
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,354
We can't just bury it like
some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.

205
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,147
All right, all right, all right.

206
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,025
But you're explaining this to Mrs. Byers,
all right?

207
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,153
Christ. Help me out.

208
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,280
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get the door, man.

209
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,949
All right, I got the door.

210
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,368
- Ew. Jesus...
- God...

211
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,956
Phew!

212
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,551
Mike, would you just stop already?

213
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,178
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?

214
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,597
That lab is swarming
with hundreds of those dogs.

215
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,841
- Demo-dogs!
- The chief will take care of her.

216
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,142
Like she needs protection.

217
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,019
Listen, dude,
a coach calls a play in a game,

218
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,688
bottom line, you execute it. All right?

219
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,982
Okay, first of all,
this isn't some stupid sports game.

220
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,651
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.

221
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,112
So my point is...

222
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,826
Right, yeah, we're on the bench,
so, uh, there's nothing we can do.

223
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,120
That's not entirely true.

224
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,373
I mean, these Demo-dogs,
they have a hive mind.

225
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,750
When they ran away from the bus,
they were called away.

226
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,437
- If we get their attention...
- Maybe we can draw them from the lab.

227
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,838
Clear a path to the gate.

228
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,256
Yeah, and then we all die.

229
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
That's one point of view.

230
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,467
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.

231
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,885
I got it!

232
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,223
This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel. So...

233
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,517
Here, right here. This is like a hub.

234
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,477
So you got all the tunnels
feeding in here.

235
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,104
Maybe if we set this on fire...

236
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,230
Oh, yeah? That's a no.

237
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,001
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.

238
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,252
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.

239
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,212
- By the time they realize we're gone...
- El would be at the gate.

240
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,656
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.

241
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,800
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

242
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,743
No buts. I promised
I'd keep you shitheads safe,

243
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,286
and that's exactly what I plan on.

244
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,246
We're staying here. On the bench.

245
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,540
And we're waiting for the starting team
to do their job.

246
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,663
Does everybody understand?

247
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,376
This isn't a stupid sports game.

248
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,462
I said does everybody understand that?

249
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,922
I need a yes.

250
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,474
It's my brother.

251
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,977
He can't know I'm here.
He'll kill me. He'll kill us.

252
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,162
Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington?

253
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,872
Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants.

254
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,459
What are you doing here, amigo?

255
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,003
I could ask you the same thing.

256
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,921
Amigo.

257
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,426
Looking for my stepsister.
A little birdie told me she was here.

258
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,178
Huh, that's weird. I don't know her.

259
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,056
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.

260
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,516
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.

261
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,437
You know, I don't know, this...

262
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,649
This whole situation,
Harrington, I don't know.

263
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,676
It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.

264
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,944
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

265
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,532
My 13-year-old sister goes missing
all day.

266
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,410
And then I find her with you
in a stranger's house.

267
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,413
And you lie to me about it.

268
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,710
Man, were you dropped too much
as a child, or what?

269
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,339
I don't know what you don't understand
about what I just said.

270
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,509
She's not here.

271
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,970
Then who is that?

272
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,890
Shit! Did he see us?

273
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,642
Oh, shit. Listen...

274
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,522
I told you to plant your feet.

275
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,235
Well, well, well.

276
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,239
Lucas Sinclair. What a surprise.

277
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,534
I thought I told you
to stay away from him, Max.

278
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,494
- Billy, go away.
- You disobeyed me.

279
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,372
And you know what happens
when you disobey me.

280
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,708
- Billy...
- I break things.

281
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,378
Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop!

282
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,464
Get off of me, you...

283
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,842
Since Maxine won't listen to me,
maybe you will.

284
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,719
You stay away from her.

285
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,264
Stay away from her! You hear me?

286
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,516
I said get off me!

287
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,646
So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.

288
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,191
No. You are.

289
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,568
Steve!

290
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,490
Looks like you got some fire in you
after all, huh?

291
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,409
I've been waiting to meet this King Steve

292
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,704
everybody's been telling me so much about.

293
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,581
Get out.

294
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,631
- Yes! Kick his ass, Steve!
- Get him!

295
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,507
Murder the son of a bitch!

296
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,551
- Now! Now!
- Get that shithead!

297
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,553
Kill the son of a bitch!

298
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,837
- Steve!
- Billy!

299
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
Holy shit!

300
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,017
Shit!

301
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,691
No one tells me what to do!

302
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,443
Whoo! Get up!

303
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,486
You're gonna kill him.

304
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,819
The hell is this?

305
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,988
You little shit,
what did you do?

306
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,490
What did you do?

307
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,326
Shit.

308
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,129
From here on out, you leave me
and my friends alone. Do you understand?

309
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,964
Screw you.

310
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:47,014
Say you understand! Say it! Say it!

311
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,932
I understand.

312
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,268
- What?
- I understand.

313
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,366
Let's get out of here.

314
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,235
It's actually kinda nice.

315
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,119
We'll do it here.

316
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,183
Are you sure this is a good idea?

317
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,061
This thing has had Will long enough.

318
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,564
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

319
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,068
Papa!

320
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,872
All right. You let me do the heavy lifting
up front, all right?

321
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,040
You save your strength till we're below.

322
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,502
You okay?

323
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,411
Nancy?

324
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,459
No, don't touch it.

325
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,755
Hey, buddy...

326
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,174
It's okay. You put up a good fight.

327
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,009
He kicked your ass,
but you put up a fight.

328
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,302
You're okay.

329
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,055
Okay, you're gonna keep straight
for a half a mile,

330
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,057
then make a left on Mount Sinai.

331
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,851
What's going on?

332
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,270
Oh, my God!

333
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,688
Just relax. She's driven before.

334
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,332
- Yeah, in a parking lot.
- That counts.

335
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,691
They were gonna leave you behind.

336
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,901
Oh, my God.

337
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,611
I promised that you'd be cool, okay?

338
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,738
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

339
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:37,244
Oh, my God. No! Whoa!
Stop the car. Slow down.

340
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,246
- I told you he'd freak out.
- Stop the car!

341
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,831
Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus!

342
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,595
Oh, wait, that's Mount Sinai. Make a left.

343
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,043
- What?
- Make a left.

344
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,480
What's happening?

345
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,649
It hurts.

346
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:13,905
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

347
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:17,200
Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!

348
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,373
It hurts! Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!

349
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,168
- Mom.
- No!

350
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,011
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

351
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,270
Hello!

352
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,314
- Whoa!
- Incredible.

353
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,399
I told you. Zoomer.

354
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,782
Guys.

355
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,039
Oh, no. Guys.

356
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,667
Hey, where do you think you're going?

357
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,211
What are you, deaf? Hello?

358
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,173
We are not going down there right now.
I made myself clear.

359
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,009
Hey, there's no chance
we're going to that hole, all right?

360
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,303
This ends right now!

361
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,263
Steve, you're upset, I get it.

362
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,975
But the bottom line is,
a party member requires assistance,

363
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,936
and it is our duty
to provide that assistance.

364
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,564
Now, I know you promised Nance
that you would keep us safe.

365
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,359
So, keep us safe.

366
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,619
Holy shit.

367
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,208
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure it's this way.

368
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,377
You're pretty sure,
or you're certain?

369
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,338
I'm 100% sure.
Just follow me and you'll know.

370
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,174
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't think so.

371
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,092
What?

372
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,429
Any of you little shits die down here,
I'm getting the blame. Got it, dipshit?

373
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,682
From here on out, I'm leading the way.
Come on, let's go.

374
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,394
Come on.

375
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,854
Hey, a little hustle.

376
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,630
Stay here.

377
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,889
Oh, shit.

378
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,357
Hey, Doc.

379
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,028
Those suckers
got you pretty good, huh?

380
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,864
It's okay, don't talk.

381
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,951
Don't talk. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

382
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,583
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning to tell you.

383
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:16,337
This is Eleven. Eleven, Doc Owens.
Doc Owens, Eleven.

384
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,967
She's been staying with me
for about a year

385
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,428
and she's about to save our asses.

386
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,264
Maybe when this is all said and done,

387
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,892
maybe you could help her out, too,
you know?

388
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,479
Maybe you could help her lead,
like, a normal life.

389
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,982
One where she's not poked
and prodded and...

390
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,943
treated like some kind of lab rat,
you know?

391
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,779
I don't know, just a thought.

392
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,408
But, uh... think about it.

393
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,374
Don't go anywhere.

394
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,892
God.

395
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,353
What is this place?

396
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,730
Guys, come on. Keep moving.

397
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,947
What the hell?

398
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,203
Shit!

399
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,458
- Help! Help! Help!
- Dustin.

400
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,626
Shit!

401
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,419
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

402
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,629
What happened?

403
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:42,966
It's in my mouth!
Some got on my mouth! Shit!

404
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,853
I'm okay.

405
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,355
- You serious?
- Very funny, man.

406
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,440
- Nice. Very nice.
- Jesus, what an idiot.

407
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,193
Hang on. Wait, wait.

408
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,579
All right, Wheeler.

409
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,540
I think we found your hub.

410
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,012
Drench it.

411
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,247
It's not working. It's not working.
Mom, are you listening to me?

412
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,207
- Just wait!
- How much longer?

413
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,334
Look... look at him!

414
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,936
- Jonathan, wait!
- You're killing him!

415
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,253
Just wait!

416
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,756
- No!
- No, leave it!

417
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,941
- You're killing him!
- Leave it!

418
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,844
Wait, Jonathan, Jonathan!
His neck! His neck!

419
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,064
No, no, no, no.

420
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,548
Stay here.

421
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,828
- You ready?
- Yeah.

422
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,145
- Ready.
- Ready.

423
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,148
Light her up.

424
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,318
I am in such deep shit.

425
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,299
All right.

426
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,811
Get the hell out of my son!

427
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,039
Go, go, go!

428
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,005
Let's go, let's go!

429
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,215
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

430
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,665
Will, baby.

431
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,626
Will. Will.

432
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,504
- Please, Will. Will.
- Come on, buddy.

433
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,297
- Please. Can you hear me?
- Come on.

434
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,299
- Come on.
- Please. Will.

435
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,430
Mom?

436
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,642
Oh, honey. Oh, God.

437
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,416
Chief, are you there?
Chief, do you copy?

438
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,375
Yeah, I copy.

439
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,044
Close it.

440
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,585
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

441
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,340
Hey, this way!

442
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,639
Help! Help! Help! Help!

443
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,693
Help! Help!

444
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,778
- Hold on!
- Steve, pull him out.

445
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,405
Everybody back! Back!

446
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,096
- You good?
- You okay?

447
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,415
Guys, we gotta go!

448
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,171
Dart.

449
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:23,843
Shh. Stop.

450
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,387
- Dustin, get back.
- Trust me, please.

451
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:35,521
Hey. It's me, it's me.
It's just your friend, it's Dustin.

452
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,398
It's Dustin, all right?

453
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,317
You remember me?

454
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,237
Will you let us pass?

455
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:49,785
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the storm cellar.

456
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,912
That was a pretty douchey thing to do.

457
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,833
You hungry? Yeah?

458
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,185
- He's insane.
- Don't.

459
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,044
Shut up.

460
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:02,381
I've got our favorite. See? Nougat.

461
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,348
Look at that. Yummy. Here, all right?

462
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,934
Eat up, buddy. Come on. Come on.

463
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,102
Let's go.

464
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,190
There's plenty. I've got more.

465
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,705
Goodbye, buddy.

466
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,831
Let's go, let's go!

467
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,809
I want you to find something
from your past,

468
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,147
something that angers you.

469
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,440
Now channel it.

470
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,901
Papa!

471
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,626
Jesus!

472
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:23,962
What was that?

473
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,008
They're coming.

474
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,635
Run! Run!

475
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,594
Let's go! Let's go!

476
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,430
Come on, Mike!
Move, Mike!

477
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,975
- There, there!
- Come on! Let's go.

478
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,519
Go, go, go! Let's go!
Come on! Come on!

479
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,603
Come on!

480
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,313
Come on, hurry up! Come on!

481
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,277
Come on, come on, come on!

482
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,028
Lucas, come on.
Reach for my hand.

483
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,032
Come on. Pull him.

484
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,326
Oh, shit.

485
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,786
Here.

486
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,250
Dustin! Come on!

487
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,835
No!

488
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,427
This is...

489
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,018
Eleven.

490
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,758
Oh, shit!

491
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,407
You have a wound, Eleven.

492
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,285
A terrible wound.

493
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,455
The gate, I opened it.

494
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,459
- And it's festering.
- I'm the monster.

495
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,378
And it will grow.

496
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,466
Spread.

497
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,676
Papa!

498
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,932
And eventually, it will kill you.

499
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,394
Jane!

500
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,228
You did good, kid.

501
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,315
You did so good.

502
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,578
Since the release
of the incendiary tape,

503
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,123
the once quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana,

504
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,917
has spent time in a place
it never expected.

505
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,377
The national spotlight.

506
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,756
Under mounting pressure,
several high-ranking members

507
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,216
from the U.S. Department of Energy

508
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,678
have admitted involvement
in the death and cover-up

509
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,889
of Hawkins resident Barbara Holland
who died due to exposure

510
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,642
to an experimental chemical asphyxiant,

511
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,061
which had leaked
from the grounds of the lab.

512
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,940
We sent our own April Kline to Hawkins
to speak to residents,

513
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,819
residents who told us
they thought they lived in a safe town.

514
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,739
The kind of town where,
they say, nothing ever happens.

515
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,670
Chief-o.

516
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,881
- How's the leg?
- Better.

517
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,883
Pretty sure my football career is over.

518
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,011
Want some? No way I'm gonna finish it.

519
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,054
No. I'm, uh... on a diet.

520
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,432
Well, you're a better man than me.

521
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,101
Hey, got a little something for you.

522
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,778
I thought...

523
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,239
Sometimes I impress even myself.

524
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,451
Still, I'd let things cool off
for a while, if I were you.

525
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,661
How long is a while?

526
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,897
Want to be safe? I give it a year.

527
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,956
A year?

528
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,421
What about one night out?

529
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,547
One night?

530
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,925

00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,087
Yeah. There.

627
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,672

Okay.

629
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,260
You know,
out of all of my brother's friends,

630
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:24,928
you're my favorite.

631
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,598
- You've always been my favorite.
- Really?

632
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,683
Yeah.

633
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,899
Girls this age are dumb.

634
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,569
But give them a few years,
and they'll wise up.

635
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,365
And, uh, you're gonna drive them nuts.

636
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,827
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

637
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,593
- Hey.
- Hey.

638
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,471

639
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,934

some space, so...

I'm giving him a few feet.

641
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,690
What do you say?

642
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:24,946
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Cooper retired
in the '70s, so...

643
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,199
we might be okay.

644
