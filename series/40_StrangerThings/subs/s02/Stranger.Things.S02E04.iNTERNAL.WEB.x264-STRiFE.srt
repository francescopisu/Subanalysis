2
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,234
Will!

3
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,237
Will!

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,864
- Dustin!
- Mrs. Byers?

5
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,741
What's going on? Where's Will?

6
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,826
The field!

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,749
Will. I just found him like this!

8
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,500
I think he's having another episode!

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,588
Will! Will! Will!

10
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,424
Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom!

11
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,383
Will!

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,515
Will, wake up!

13
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,808
Can you hear me?

14
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,981
Will, please, just wake up.

15
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,065
Please, wake up!

16
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,819
It's Mom!

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,489
It's me!

18
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,275
Okay, that totally freaked me out.

19
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,985
Did that not freak you guys out?

20
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,363
- Two episodes in two days.
- It's getting worse.

21
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,115
You think it's True Sight?

22
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,491
What's True Sight?

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,369
It's nothing.

24
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,960
I can't remember.

25
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,713
I need you to try.

26
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:57,218
I... I was on the field and...
and then it...

27
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,847
it all just went blank, and...
and then you were there.

28
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,351
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.

29
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,228
I am.

30
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,078
This shape, I saw it on the video tape
from Halloween night.

31
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,414
It's the same shape as... as your drawing.

32
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,252
These episodes that you're having,
I think Dr. Owens is wrong.

33
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,670
I think they're real.

34
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,965
But... but I can't help you
if I don't know what's going on.

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,010
So, you have to talk to me. Please.

36
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,514
No more secrets, okay?

37
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,018
Okay.

38
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,813
Did... did you see this thing again
on the field?

39
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,069
Yes.

40
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,697
What... what is it?

41
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,827
I don't know.

42
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:09,082
It's almost
more like a feeling.

43
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,835
Like the one you had
that night at the arcade?

44
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,341
Yes.

45
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,344
What does it want?

46
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,140
I don't know.

47
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,310
It came for me, and...

48
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,395
Go away!

49
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,732
And I tried. I tried to make it go away.

50
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,443
But it got me, Mom.

51
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,736
Well, what does that mean?

52
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,323
I felt it... everywhere.

53
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,200
Everywhere.

54
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,078
I... I still feel it.

55
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,665
I just want this to be over.

56
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,210
It's okay. It's okay. Hey.

57
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,170
Listen. Look, look at me.

58
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:01,217
I will never, ever let anything bad
happen to you ever again.

59
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,972
Whatever's going on in you,
we're gonna fix it. I will fix it.

60
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,309
I promise. I'm here.

61
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,021
"Friends don't lie."
Isn't that your bullshit saying?

62
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,815
Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!

63
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,446
Where'd you go
on your little field trip, huh?

64
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,197
Where?

65
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,743
Did you go see Mike?

66
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,661
He didn't see me.

67
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:15,208
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter
did and they called the cops.

68
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,503
Now, did anyone else see you?

69
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,421
Anyone at all?

70
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,256
Come on, I need you to think!

71
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,425
Nobody saw me!

72
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,386
You put us in danger.

73
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,764
You realize that, right?

74
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,974
You promised...

75
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,019
I go!

76
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,729
And I never leave!

77
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,023
Nothing ever happens!

78
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,443
Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!

79
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,405
You lie!

80
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,368
I don't lie!
I protect and I feed and I teach!

81
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,831
And all I ask of you is
that you follow three simple rules.

82
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,999
Three rules. And you know what?

83
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,211
You can't even do that!

84
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,135
You're grounded.

85
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,637
You know what that means?

86
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,432
It means no Eggos...

87
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,146
And no TV for a week.

88
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,779
All right, knock it off. Let go.

89
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,909
Okay.

90
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,578
Two weeks.

91
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,289
Let go!

92
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,876
- A month!
- No!

93
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,087
Well, congratulations.

94
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:48,217
You just graduated from no TV for a month
to no TV at all!

95
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,594
No!

96
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,264
No! No. No!

97
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,894
You have got to understand that
there are consequences to your actions.

98
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,937
You are like Papa!

99
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,230
Really?

100
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,025
I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch?

101
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,153
Wow! All right.
You wanna go back in the lab?

102
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,614
One phone call. I can make that happen.

103
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,240
I hate you.

104
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,242
Yeah, well,
I'm not so crazy about you, either.

105
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,119
You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.

106
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,454
You know what that word means?

107
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,582
How about that be your word
for the day, huh? Brat.

108
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,710
Why don't we look it up? B-R-A-T.

109
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,794
Brat.

110
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,301
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

111
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,846
Hey!

112
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,140
Hey!

113
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,392
Hey! Hey!

114
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,021
Open this door!

115
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,023
Open the damn door!

116
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,733
You wanna go out in the world?

117
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,401
You better grow up!

118
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,278
Grow the hell up!

119
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,096
Mom?

120
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,599
Will?

121
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,396
Hello?

122
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,644
Do you like those grapes, Holly?

123
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,773
Hey, Mom, I was thinking about
staying the night at Stacey's tonight?

124
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,483
We were gonna have a girl's night.

125
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,278
Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip...

126
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,196
Sure! That sounds like fun.

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,075
Toast? No?

128
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,296
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,799
Did you see your mom?

130
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,552
No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.

131
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,307
You don't have to do this, you know.

132
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,184
Stop saying that.

133
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,491
- Hawkins Police.
- Flo, it's Joyce again.

134
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,576
Oh, hi, Joyce.
Listen, I gave him your message...

135
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,370
- He's still not there?
- No, but...

136
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,122
Did he get any of my messages
from yesterday? Did you give...

137
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,668
- Yes, do you wanna talk to...
- No, no, I need Hopper.

138
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,172
Just tell him to call me
the second he gets in. Please.

139
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,965
- Thank you.
- Bye.

140
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,556
Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead?

141
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
- Any better?
- Mmm-mmm.

142
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,394
Same as last night? Still weird?

143
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,561
Yeah.

144
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,313
All right.

145
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,565
Hmm.

146
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,072
Okay, let me see.

147
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,830
Is it a fever?

148
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,043
No. Uh, actually, it's cold.

149
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,420
Do you feel cold?

150
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,132
No. Just a little out of it.

151
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,634
Like I haven't really woken up yet.

152
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,012
You promised no doctor.

153
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,056
And I meant it. No doctor.

154
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,724
You know what?

155
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,227
I'm gonna run you a nice bath
and it'll warm you up

156
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,895
and hopefully get you feeling better.

157
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,022
How's that sound? Okay.

158
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,747
Morning, Dart.

159
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,417
Got you some breakfast.

160
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,877
Your favorite.

161
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,007
I gotta go to school,

162
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,176
but I'll be back soon. Sound good?

163
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,531
Stop being a baby
and do it already!

164
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,075
This is so disgusting.
Is this really necessary?

165
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,913
What the hell's going on?

166
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,123
What do you think? We're looking for Dart.

167
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,750
- Jesus!
- Oh!

168
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,043
Ugh!

169
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,379
Well, well, well.

170
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,757
Look who finally decided to show up.

171
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,676
After I drew the short straw.
Real convenient.

172
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,678
You stink!

173
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,391
Hi, Max.

174
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,227
Hi.

175
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,688
- Where's Will?
- He'll be here.

176
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,482
Are you just gonna stand there?

177
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,234
Or you gonna help?

178
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,574
All living things,
from complex mammals

179
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,827
to single-celled organisms,
instinctively respond to danger.

180
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,873
Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical,
and it will flee.

181
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,543
Or deploy some other defense mechanism.

182
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,046
We're very much the same.

183
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,510
When we encounter danger,
our hearts start pounding.

184
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,725
Our palms start to sweat.

185
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:20,067
These are the signs of the physical
and emotional state we call...

186
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,528
fear.

187
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,107
Hey, you reached Jim.

188
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,162
I'm probably doing something
incredible right now and I can't...

189
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,206
Mom.

190
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, sweetie, what is it?

191
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,334
It's too hot.

192
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,637
I... I can cool it down
a little bit, baby,

193
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,931
- but we gotta get your body temp back up.
- No.

194
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,726
What?

195
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,770
He likes it cold.

196
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,298
Hey, kid.

197
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,806
Listen, um...

198
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,727
about last night, I, uh...

199
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,069
I want this place cleaned up
by the time I get back

200
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,363
and then maybe I'll consider
fixing the TV.

201
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,656
You hear me?

202
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,624
Come in, Hop.

203
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,460
Come in, Hop.

204
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,171
Come in, Hop.

205
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,508
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm on my way in,

206
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,344
and, yes, I do know what time it is.

207
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,848
Joyce Byers has called
eight times already this morning.

208
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,475
Eight times.

209
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,895
For my sake, please deal with her!

210
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,737
Let's go. Pass it up now.
Get open!

211
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,200
All right! All right, all right!

212
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,661
King Steve. King Steve, everyone.

213
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,579
I like it. Playing tough today.

214
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,331
Jesus! Do you ever stop talking?
Come on!

215
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,958
What?

216
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,711
You afraid the coach is gonna
bench you now that I'm here? Huh?

217
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,637
You were moving your feet.

218
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,974
Plant them next time, draw a charge.

219
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,070
Don't sweat it, Harrington.

220
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,864
Today's just not your day, man.

221
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,949
Yeah. Not your week.

222
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,588
You and the princess break up for one day,

223
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,370
she's running off
with the freak's brother.

224
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,417
Oh, shit. You don't know.

225
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,588
Jonathan and the princess skipped
yesterday. Still haven't shown.

226
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,632
But that must just be
a coincidence, right?

227
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,596
Don't take it too hard, man.

228
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,849
A pretty boy like you has got
nothing to worry about.

229
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,518
Plenty of bitches in the sea.

230
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,980
Am I right?

231
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,360
I'll be sure to leave you some.

232
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,085
It's 15 past.

233
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,711
Yeah, I know.

234
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,422
Just give him time.

235
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,386
That guy. There.

236
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,766
- What?
- He just... just talked to himself.

237
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,490
Duck, duck, duck,

238
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,409
duck, duck...

239
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,044
Duck, duck, duck...

240
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,010
Duck, duck, duck...

241
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,722
Duck...

242
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,102
Duck, duck...

243
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,645
Goose!

244
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,188
I think we should go.

245
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,430
Trouble with your car, miss?
I can give you two a lift if you like.

246
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,683
Jonathan.

247
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,402
You sure you don't need that ride?

248
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,800
Hello?

249
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,344
Leave it open.

250
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,805
Where the hell have you been?

251
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,226
I overslept. What the hell's going on?
It's freezing.

252
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,899
Hey! Knock, knock.

253
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,361
We have a visitor.

254
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,160
So this thing, this shadow thing.

255
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,996
You told your mom it likes it like this.
It likes it cold?

256
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,998
Yeah.

257
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,251
How do you know that?

258
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,003
I just know.

259
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,717
Does he talk to you?

260
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,220
No. It's like...

261
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,972
I don't have to think.

262
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,723
I just know things now.

263
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,434
Things I never did before.

264
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,233
And, uh...

265
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,402
what else do you know?

266
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,655
It's hard to explain.

267
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,200
It's like old memories
in the back of my head,

268
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,537
only... they're not my memories.

269
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,414
Okay.

270
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,002
I mean, I don't think
they're old memories at all. They're...

271
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,548
they're now-memories,
happening all at once, now.

272
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,883
Can you describe these now-memories?

273
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,473
I don't know.
It's... it's hard to explain.

274
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,601
I know it's hard
but can you just... Can you try?

275
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,353
For us?

276
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,898
It's like...

277
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,028
They're growing and spreading...

278
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,363
killing.

279
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,282
The memories?

280
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,659
I don't know.

281
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,954
Oh!

282
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,874
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie.

283
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,466
Hey, hey, sweetie...

284
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,719
what if you didn't have to use words?

285
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,747
Hey,
you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...

286
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,752
Anything?

287
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,506
We need to talk. AV room. Right now.

288
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,884
Party members only.

289
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,053
Come on, Mike.

290
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,846
No! This is non-negotiable.

291
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,808
- Sorry, Max.
- Sorry.

292
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,358
Will didn't want me to tell anyone,

293
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,945
but on Halloween night
he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.

294
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,863
A shadow?

295
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,573
What kind of shadow?

296
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,408
I don't know. But it scared him.

297
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,161
And if Will really has True Sight...

298
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,455
I mean, if he can really see
into the Upside Down,

299
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,541
maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.

300
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,086
- So that's why he was frozen like that?
- Maybe.

301
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,170
Can it hurt him?

302
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,006
I mean, if this shadow thing
isn't from our world...

303
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,758
I'm not sure. Dustin?

304
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,218
Well, if you're in another plane,

305
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,137
you can't interact
with the material plane,

306
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,305
so theoretically,
no, the shadow can't hurt him.

307
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,015
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.

308
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,685
This isn't D & D. This is real life.

309
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,769
So what do we do?

310
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,563
We acquire more knowledge.

311
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,149
I'll go to Will's after school.
See what's going on.

312
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,552
You guys stay here and find Dart.

313
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,318
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?

314
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,945
Will heard him in the Upside Down.

315
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,448
I don't know how yet,
but he's gotta be connected to all this.

316
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,616
He's gotta be.

317
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,786
If we find Dart,
maybe we can solve this thing.

318
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,205
Maybe we can help Will.

319
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,700
Hey! Hey, assholes!

320
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,827
Let us out of here!

321
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,871
Oh!

322
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,833
Not very pleasant in here, is it?

323
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,129
Sorry about that.
Hospitality's not our strong suit.

324
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,131
You know, scientists and all.

325
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
Yeah. Okay.

326
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,347
You up for a little walk?

327
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,644
I'm assuming you're behind me.

328
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,064
"Men of science have made
abundant mistakes of every kind."

329
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,649
George Sarton said that.

330
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,569
You guys know who George Sarton is?
Doesn't really matter.

331
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,113
The point is,
mistakes have been made. Yes.

332
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,489
- Mistakes?
- Yes.

333
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,699
You killed Barbara.

334
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:01,619
Abundant mistakes, but,
the men involved with those mistakes,

335
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,623
the ones responsible for what happened
to your brother and Miss Holland's death,

336
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,418
they're gone.
They're gone, and for better for worse,

337
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,621
I'm the schmuck they brought in
to make things better.

338
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,840
But I can't make things better
without your help.

339
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,550
You mean without us shutting up?

340
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,928
She's tough, this one.
You guys been together long?

341
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,765
- We're not together.
- Wanna see what really killed your friend?

342
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,229
Teddy, I brought you an audience today.
I hope you don't mind.

343
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,522
More the merrier, sir.

344
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,445
I'd call it one hell of a mistake.

345
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,030
Wouldn't you?

346
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:45,497
See, the thing is,
we can't seem to erase our mistake...

347
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,999
but we can stop it from spreading.

348
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,086
Like, it's like pulling weeds.

349
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,298
But imagine for a moment
if a foreign state,

350
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,843
let's say, the Soviets...
If they heard about our mistake...

351
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,097
do you think they would even
consider that a mistake?

352
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,392
What if they tried to replicate that?

353
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,776
The more attention we bring to ourselves,
the more...

354
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,237
the more people like the Hollands
know the truth,

355
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,531
the more likely that scenario becomes.

356
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,285
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

357
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,329
Just, same as those weeds there.

358
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,750
By whatever means necessary.

359
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,009
So, we understand each other now,
don't we?

360
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,452
This is more of the same.

361
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,788
Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.

362
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,623
Wait!

363
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,959
- What? What?
- Wait.

364
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,379
- Wait. These black lines, see?
- What?

365
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,174
Look, they connect.

366
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,137
They connect.

367
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,564
Does this mean anything to you?

368
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,649
No.

369
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,611
I mean,
is it some sort of maze or a road?

370
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,908
I mean, it's sort of forking
and branching like... like lightning.

371
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,159
You think it's that storm?

372
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,788
No, the storm he drew was
completely different. He used red.

373
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:36,000
And this is all blue
and it has some weird dirt color.

374
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,795
I mean, maybe it's roots.

375
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,422
'Cause remember,
he was saying it was spreading and...

376
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,882
Killing.

377
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,551
He said they were killing.

378
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,887
Vines.

379
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,271
He's drawing vines.

380
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:03,236
Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin?
We're supposed to meet after class.

381
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,197
Max!

382
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,702
Hey, Max! Hey, where you going?
Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.

383
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,161
Yeah, good luck with that.

384
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,332
What is wrong with you?

385
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,251
What is wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

386
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,338
- I don't understand.
- No! I don't understand!

387
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,299
You guys act like
you want me to be your friend

388
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,842
but then you treat me like garbage!

389
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,635
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is!

390
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,012
You go and hide in the AV Club,

391
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,389
keeping secrets like we're
in second grade or something.

392
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,892
You know, I thought you guys wanted me
in your party.

393
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,394
- We do. But it's...
- But what?

394
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,564
There... there are just things.

395
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,066
Things we can't tell you, all right?
For your own safety.

396
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,860
- My own safety?
- Yes!

397
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,280
- Because I'm a girl?
- What? No!

398
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,157
Did you keep secrets from El?

399
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,160
How do you know about El?

400
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,578
Did you?

401
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,872
That was different. Trust me. Okay?

402
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,957
That was just... just different.

403
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,460
Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay?

404
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,463
I don't wanna be in your
stupid party anyway. I'm out.

405
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,632
Have a nice life.

406
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,720
- Max!
- You still stink, by the way!

407
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,766
Oh, shit!

408
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,697
That kid you were talking to, who is he?

409
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,240
He's no one.

410
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,368
- No one?
- This kid from my class.

411
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,805
Why was he talking to you?

412
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,640
It was just about
a stupid class assignment.

413
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,476
- Then why're you so upset?
- I'm not!

414
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,560
He causing you trouble?

415
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,396
Why do you care?

416
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,272
Because, Max, you're a piece of shit,

417
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,775
but we're family now
whether we like it or not,

418
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,694
meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.

419
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,088
- What would I ever do without...
- Hey!

420
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,782
This is serious shit, okay?

421
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,409
I'm older than you.

422
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,785
And something you learn

423
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,163
is that there are a certain type of people
in this world that you stay away from,

424
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,874
and that kid, Max...

425
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,877
That kid is one of them.

426
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,755
You stay away from him, you hear me?

427
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,716
Stay away.

428
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,353
"Ives.

429
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,190
Terry."

430
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,918
Jane.

431
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,184
Papa.

432
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,517
President Reagan's...

433
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,394
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

434
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,745
Rainbow.

435
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,041
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

436
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,464
Rainbow.

437
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,424
Three to the right.
Four to the left.

438
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,259
Four-fifty...

439
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,351
Jane.

440
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,940
Mama?

441
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,455
Mama!

442
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,962
Mama?

443
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,053
Mama!

444
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,764
Mama!

445
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,561
Mama...

446
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,619
Mama!

447
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,964
Hello?

448
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,173
Will!

449
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,759
Mrs. Byers?

450
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,886
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.

451
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,638
- Is Will here?
- You know what?

452
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,098
Now is not a really good time.

453
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,266
Is he okay?

454
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,313
Yeah. You know, he's...
he's just not feeling real well.

455
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,524
He's laying down,
so I'll tell him you stopped by, okay?

456
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,862
It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?

457
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,040
Have a nice day.

458
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,078
Doesn't really matter.
The point is, mistakes have been made.

459
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,329
- Yes.
- Mistakes?

460
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,172
The men involved
with those mistakes,

461
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,376
the ones responsible
for what happened to your brother

462
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,045
and Miss Holland's death, they're gone...

463
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,507
the ones responsible
for what happened to your brother

464
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,051
and Miss Holland's death, they're gone.

465
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,056
You still wanna do this?

466
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,935
Let's burn that lab to the ground.

467
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,159
Mew-mew, dinner!

468
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,912
Where are you? Mew-mew!

469
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,331
- Hey, Dusty!
- Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.

470
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,917
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.

471
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,590
Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy.

472
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,176
It's about my friend, Will.

473
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,053
I think...

474
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,777
What the hell?

475
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,076
Dart?

476
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,146
Oh, Jesus.
