1
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:14,014
Mama? It's me. Jane.

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,391
I'm home.

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,268
No.

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,643
Breathe.

5
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,811
Sunflower.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,146
Rainbow.

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,192
- Four-fifty. Three to the right...
- Breathe.

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,111
Four to the left. Sunflower.

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,988
- Four-fifty. Rainbow.
- Breathe.

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,031
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Breathe.

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,634
Four-fifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,166
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,627
Three to the right. Four to the left.

14
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,465
Okay. You okay?

15
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,092
And it just kept repeating?

16
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,762
Repeat?

17
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,891
Like a circle? Just showing you
the same image over and over?

18
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,935
She kept showing the girl in the room.

19
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,063
The rainbow room?

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,651
What did the girl look like?

21
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,990
- Different.
- Different than you?

22
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,746
I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,165
To show you the girl?

24
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,384
I think she wants me to find her.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,765
When Terry was looking for you,

26
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,227
she kept these files
of other missing kids.

27
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,771
Kids she thought were like you.

28
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:52,695
Maybe that girl is in here somewhere.

29
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,779
Here.

30
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,919
Does anyone look familiar?

31
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,935
Is that her?

32
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,497
Did you find her?

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,711
No.

34
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,514
Hello?

35
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,491
Becky! Becky, I found her.

36
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,577
I just...
I didn't know who else to call.

37
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,706
He gave me this number,
and he came here looking for her.

38
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,792
I thought maybe he could help me.

39
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,922
Yeah, Jim Hopper, he came here
with some woman named Joyce Byers?

40
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,134
Well, that's a little hard to explain.
Uh...

41
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:24,806
There's another girl, and she's missing,
and I think she's in trouble.

42
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,600
I just... I didn't know who to call.

43
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,186
Thank you, thank you. And you are?

44
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,772
Florence...

45
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,985
I'm gonna have to call you back.

46
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,868
Jane? Jane?

47
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,496
Jane?

48
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,164
Jane!

49
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,333
Jane!

50
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,502

You should do stand-up, Axe.
There's a spot a few blocks away.

69
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,027
Hello?

70
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,155
Well, well...

71
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
What do we have here?

72
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,077
What is she wearing?

73
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,662
What are those, overalls?

74
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,914
There aren't any cows
to milk here, kid.

75
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,666
Go on back to the farm now.

76
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,417
I'm looking for my sister.

77
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,713
Aw... Shirley Temple lost her sister.
So sad.

78
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,424
I saw her. Here.

79
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,387
Uh-uh. Hand out of pocket. Slow.

80
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,557
Give me that shit.

81
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,106
- Is that Kali?
- Kali?

82
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,649
How did you find us?

83
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,860
- Who else knows you're here?
- No one.

84
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,823
So, what then? Poof! You just show up
like magic with that picture?

85
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,408
Stay calm. She's just a kid.

86
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,034
A kid who could get us all killed.

87
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,371
If I have to ask again, Shirley,
you'll start losing things.

88
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,614
Starting with those pretty little locks
of yours. Yeah?

89
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,041
Come on, Axe. Put down the knife.

90
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,543
How did you find us?

91
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,544
- I saw her.
- Axe!

92
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,627
That's not an answer.

93
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,050
Jesus. Jesus Christ!

94
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,723
Get off! Shit! Shit!

95
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,350
You're a terrible dancer, Axel.

96
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,566
I told you, stay out of my head.

97
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,027
So, we're threatening little girls now,
are we?

98
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,196
- She knows about you.
- She had this.

99
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,869
Where did you get this?

100
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,330
Mama.

101
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,875
Your mother gave this to you?

102
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,668
In her dream circle.

103
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,047
Dream circle.
I think she's a schizo or something.

104
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,342
- Says she's looking for her sister.
- Yeah. Like I said, schizo.

105
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,385
Jesus!

106
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,683
I saw you.

107
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,685
In the rainbow room.

108
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,482
What is your name?

109
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,692
Jane.

110
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,959
Sister.

111
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,422
Sister.

112
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,777
And this memory
your mother shared...

113
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,446
that is your only memory of me?

114
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,282
Yes.

115
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,035
And how long have you been
with this policeman?

116
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,879
Three hundred
and twenty-seven days.

117
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,789
And this policeman, he thinks

118
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,251
he can work out some sort of deal
with these men to set you free?

119
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,252
Yes.

120
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,421
- He says soon.
- He's naïve then.

121
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,507
We'll always be monsters to them.
Do you understand?

122
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,638
Let me guess. Your policeman,
he also stops you from using your gifts?

123
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,184
What you can do is incredible.

124
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,854
It makes you very special, Jane.

125
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,021
Wait.

126
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,110
- Do you have a gift?
- Different.

127
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:20,322
I can make people see, or not see,
whatever I choose.

128
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,368
Is that why you made the man
with the crazy hair dance?

129
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:29,540
- Axel is not so fond of spiders, so...
- You made him see spiders?

130
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,753
But it doesn't have to be scary.

131
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,592
This butterfly, it isn't real.

132
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,887
I've just convinced your mind it is.

133
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,185
Think of it as a kind of magic.

134
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,573
Are you real?

135
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,325
Yes, I'm real.

136
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,807
What's wrong?

137
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,560
Nothing is wrong.

138
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,651
I just feel... whole... now.

139
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,613
Like... a piece of me was missing,

140
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,574
and now it's not.

141
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,868
Does that make sense?

142
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,704
Yes.

143
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,541
I think your mother sent you here
for a reason.

144
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,336
I think she somehow knew
that we belong together.

145
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,548
I think this is your home.

146
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,509
Home.

147
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,720
Yes. Home.

148
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,396
This is car 13,
responding to a 245 at 31 Ashbury.

149
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,817
suspect under surveillance.

150
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,028
Shit.

151
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,994
How's your white hick sister?
You tuck her in real tight?

152
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,830
Yeah, what about a lullaby?
Did you sing her one?

153
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,250
- ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪
- Yeah.

154
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,460
♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

155
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,172
♪ And on his farm he had a cow ♪

156
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,549
She found me with only this.

157
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,553
What's that mean?

158
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,222
It means she can find people
without moving.

159
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,932
With nothing but an image.

160
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,477
You telling me Shirley's a human
radar detector or some shit?

161
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,979
Or some shit, yes.

162
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,647
Come on. No way.

163
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,149
We'll find out soon enough.

164
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,401
I want to do one. Tomorrow.

165
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,486
- You serious, Kal?
- We're way too hot right now.

166
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,570
Paranoid.

167
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,992
Realistic. You don't kill their men
and expect them to look the other way.

168
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,453
If they find us, they will unleash hell.

169
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,621
So we give in to fear?

170
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,207
She's in pain. She needs this.

171
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,377
We go out tomorrow.

172
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,091
Swear to God,
Shirley Temple's gonna get us all killed.

173
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,434
It's me.

174
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,108
I know that I've been gone too long,
and, uh...

175
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,823
I just want you to know
that it's not because of you.

176
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,242
And it's not because of our fight.

177
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,455
Something came up,

178
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,794
and, uh, I'll explain everything soon.

179
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,253
I just, um...

180
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,550
I want you to know that I'm not...
I'm not mad at you. I...

181
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,596
I'm just sorry.

182
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,725
It's okay. It's only me.

183
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,229
Bad dream?

184
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,897
What time is it?

185
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,524
It's late.

186
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,067
You slept well. Come.

187
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,861
It's time you meet my friends.
Properly this time.

188
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,705
We need more money, Kal.
I can't keep eating this garbage.

189
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,416
- This is Axel.
- The spider hater?

190
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,626
Yes, the spider hater.

191
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
This is Dottie, our newest.

192
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,213
Like you, she just left home.

193
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:50,384
- You mean the loony bin.
- Mick, our eyes, our protector.

194
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,387
This is Funshine, our warrior.

195
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,683
Don't let his size frighten you.
Fun's a teddy bear.

196
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,476
Nice to meet you, Miss Jane.

197
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,064
If you're looking for a number,
you won't find one.

198
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,443
They're not like us.

199
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,321
No, not in that way.
But like us, they're outcasts.

200
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,614
Outcasts?

201
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,825
- Freaks.
- Speak for yourself.

202
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:19,163
Society left them behind,
hurt them, discarded them.

203
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,331
We were dead, all of us.

204
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,170
Kali saved us. Here. And here.

205
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,255
Don't get all mushy on us now, Fun.

206
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,300
No, not mushy. True.

207
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,509
Now we help her.

208
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,596
In this life, kid,
you roll over or you fight back.

209
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,556
We're all fighters here.

210
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,641
Fight who?

211
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,147
Everyone you see here was
in some way responsible

212
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,356
for what happened to us.

213
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,820
You hurt the bad men?

214
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,907
No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.

215
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,581
You kill them?

216
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,251
They're criminals.
We simply make them pay for their crimes.

217
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,003
Boom.

218
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,257
Damn, Shirley. What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

219
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,301
We can't all be fighters, I guess.

220
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,055
I'm a fighter. I've killed.

221
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,813
These men you killed, did they deserve it?

222
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,107
They hurt me.

223
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,944
And they still want to hurt you.
To hurt us.

224
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,113
We're just making the first move.

225
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,823
Come.

226
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,661
I was just like you once.

227
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,330
I kept my anger inside.

228
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:48,085
I tried to hide from it,
but then that pain festered.

229
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,671
Festered?

230
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,800
It spread.

231
00:18:55,425 --> 00:19:00,055
Until finally I confronted my pain,
and I began to heal.

232
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,109
- Do you see that train?
- Yes.

233
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,361
I want you to draw it to us.

234
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,897
I can't.

235
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,859
Last night you told me
you lifted a van once.

236
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,945
Yes.

237
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,739
The bad men were trying
to take you again,

238
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,449
and that made you angry.

239
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,952
Good. So, find that anger,

240
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,623
focus on that, not the train,
not its weight.

241
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,465
I want you to find something
from your life.

242
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,468
Something that angers you.

243
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,055
Now channel it.

244
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,936
Dig deeper.
Your whole life you've been lied to...

245
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,063
- Do I have a mother?
- She's not around anymore.

246
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,776
imprisoned.

247
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,487
Don't walk away from me!
Grow the hell up!

248
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,158
The bad men took away your home,

249
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,827
your mother...

250
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,997
Jane.

251
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,543
They took everything from you.

252
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,628
Papa!

253
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,838
They stole your life, Jane.

254
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,632
I want you to find them.

255
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,523
Yeah!

256
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,566
Yeah, Jane!

257
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,073
So, how do you feel?

258
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,077
Good.

259
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,001
These are the bad men, as you call them.

260
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,504
The one's we believe are still alive.
Do you know any?

261
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,055
Him.

262
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,351
Four-fifty...

263
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,647
He hurt Mama.

264
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:59,818
His name is Ray Caroll.
And he did more than hurt your mother.

265
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,323
The bad men like Ray, they know about us.

266
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:08,368
It's made them hard to track.
But maybe not anymore.

267
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,156
"Gramercy Apartments.
Washington and Bethel."

268
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,365
That's gotta be it. Right?

269
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,452
- "Lilburn." Where is that?
- About an hour east.

270
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,287
We don't even have a new ride.

271
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,456
So we swap plates.
We have plates, right?

272
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,374
- Yeah.
- It's risky.

273
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,335
Where's the fun if there's no risk?

274
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,505
We want to give my sister
a memorable first day, right?

275
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,673
I'm in. For Miss Jane.

276
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,594
Yeah, sure. Why not? Mick?

277
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,890
Screw it!

278
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,422
Bitchin'.

279
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,633
Bitchin'.

280
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,236
Get off me! Get off me!

281
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,952
What are we doing?

282
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,454
Stocking up.

283
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,461
Hey, your bathroom is leaking.

284
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,464
Oh, shit.

285
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,548
Yes.

286
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,341
Shit.

287
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,389
Okay, contestants,
you have a minute and a half,

288
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,725
let's begin your supermarket sweep!

289
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,751
Hey! Put that back,
or I'll blow your head off.

290
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,047
- You hear me, freak?
- Put the gun down.

291
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,757
Stay back. Stay back.

292
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,718
Darrel, your money is insured.

293
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:58,515
We're only stealing from the war criminal
billionaires who own this place.

294
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,017
- You won't even lose a dime.
- I said stay back.

295
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,687
We're on the same side.

296
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,565
- I promise.
- Stay back.

297
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,323
Damn, Shirley.

298
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,951
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

299
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,662
Mick! We gotta go, Mick!

300
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:51,526
We should case the place,
stick to the routine. We have time.

301
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,321
We also have her. Can you look?

302
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,209
- He's watching television.
- Is he alone?

303
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,130
I saw him. No one else.

304
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,425
- Good enough for me.
- Me, too.

305
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,426
Let's do this.

306
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,219
- Keep it running.
- Meet you around back.

307
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,531
Punky, what's the matter?

308
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,615
A nightmare.

309
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,660
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.

310
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:46,873
All of a sudden, he's started to give me
my shot in my arm.

311
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:51,127
Then the needle got bigger
and bigger and bigger...

312
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,478
Hello, Ray.

313
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,190
Jesus Christ!

314
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,277
Sit down. Please.

315
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,613
- I said sit.
- Please...

316
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,992
Just, please... just take what you want.

317
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,702
Oh, we will.

318
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,538
Where's your wallet?

319
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,707
- Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans.
- Come on.

320
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,836
Yes.

321
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,588
Got it.

322
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,984
Do you remember us?

323
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,243
What about us?
Do you remember us, Ray?

324
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,666
Please. Please.

325
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,377
You hurt Mama.

326
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,676
Wait.

327
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,386
Please. Listen...

328
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,223
I just did what he told me to do.

329
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,560
He said she was sick.

330
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,937
You had a choice, Ray.

331
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,815
And you chose to follow a man
you knew was evil.

332
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,485
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!

333
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,198
I can help. I can help you find him.

334
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,617
- Find who?
- Brenner!

335
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,203
I can take you to him.

336
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,538
Papa is gone.

337
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,582
No, he is alive.

338
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,251
Do not lie to us, Ray.

339
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,795
I'm not lying!

340
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,381
I swear...

341
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,549
He trusts me.

342
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,095
I'll take you to him.

343
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,014
If he's alive, Jane will find him.

344
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,849
Just as she found you.

345
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,518
Do it, Jane.

346
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,646
- Do it.
- Wait.

347
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,113
Not too quick.

348
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,282
He wasn't so generous with your mother.

349
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,188
Sweetie, just stay calm.

350
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,678
Oh, shit!

351
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,888
The police are on their way, honey. Okay?

352
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,772
What's wrong?

353
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,149
- What's wrong?
- We got a problem.

354
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,819
Kids in the apartment.

355
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,280
Please...

356
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,575
- Did he show your mother mercy? No.
- Please. No.

357
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,371
- I'm sorry.
- He took her from you, without hesitation.

358
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,331
Please don't. Please.

359
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,667
We got to go, K.
They called the cops.

360
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,919
We finish this first.

361
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,170
- Kali!
- Jane, now!

362
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,131
Please, don't...

363
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,383
Please. Please.

364
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,435
Kali, we gotta go!

365
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,840
- Shit!
- Go, go, go!

366
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,195
Shit!

367
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
Come on. Get in!

368
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,787
If you wanted to show mercy,
that is your choice.

369
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,291
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.

370
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,252
Do you understand? Do you understand?

371
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,435
I see you, and I raise you ten.

372
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,979
How ya like that?

373
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,737
That was a mistake right there, girl.
A mistake.

374
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,031
I think you're full of shit.

375
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,303
May I sit?

376
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,774
I was once just like you, you know that?

377
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:10,446
But that's why I'm hard on you,
because I see in you my past mistakes.

378
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,366
They were kids.

379
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,412
Does that excuse that man's sins?
Were we not also children?

380
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,793
I remember the day I came
to the rainbow room and you were gone.

381
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,423
So, when my gifts were strong enough,
I used them to escape.

382
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,632
And I ran.

383
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,759
I ran away as far as I could.

384
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,808
And it was there, far away,
that I found a place to hide.

385
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,644
A family.

386
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,229
A home.

387
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,650
Just like you and your policeman.

388
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,903
But they couldn't help me.

389
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,240
So, eventually, I lost them, too.

390
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,205
So, I decided to play the part.

391
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,666
To stop hiding.

392
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,544
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.

393
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,298
You're now faced
with the same choice, Jane.

394
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,926
Go back into hiding
and hope they don't find you.

395
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,888
Fight, and face them again.

396
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,222
Face who?

397
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,559
The man who calls himself our father.

398
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,855
Papa is dead.

399
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,578
That man tonight disagreed.

400
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,156
You're not real.

401
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,827
All this time?
And you haven't looked for me?

402
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,787
Why?

403
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,333
Because you thought I was dead?

404
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,628
Or because you were afraid
of what you might find?

405
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,880
Go away.

406
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,258
You have to confront your pain.

407
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,679
You have a wound, Eleven,
a terrible wound.

408
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
And it's festering.

409
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,354
Do you remember
what that means? Festering?

410
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,108
It means a rot.

411
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,068
And it will grow.

412
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,946
Spread.

413
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,034
- Get out of my head.
- And eventually, it will kill you.

414
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,246
Get out of my head!

415
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,217
This isn't a prison, Jane.

416
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,470
You're always free
to return to your policeman.

417
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,723
Or stay, and avenge your mother.

418
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,645
Let us heal our wounds together.

419
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,373
- Full house.
- Screw this. I'm out.

420
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:11,961
Out of money, you mean. You are broke!

421
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,633
- You want in, Mick?
- Nope.

422
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:22,096
- Aw, come on! Just one hand.
- You're the worst.

423
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,347
How am I the worst?

424
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,558
Because, one hand leads to two hands,

425
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:29,145
two hands leads to three.
Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.

426
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,022
- Are you in or out?
- Out.

427
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,525
Today, tomorrow, the next day.

428
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,714
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

429
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,552
You'd better run!
She's our friend, and she's crazy!

430
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,554
No, El, you're not the monster.

431
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,767
You saved me, you understand?
You saved me.

432
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,477
Compromise?

433
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,022
It's something that's kind of
in between. Like halfway happy.

434
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,443
Once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice. Real nice.

435
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,237
This is your new home.

436
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:44,136
That's where I was.
It's a damn graveyard.

437
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,015
I need to get through!
I need to get through!

438
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,810
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I need to warn them. It's a trap!

439
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,896
I need to get through. It's a trap.
I need to tell them it's a trap.

440
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,983
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

441
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,151
Mike!

442
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,195
Mike! Mike!

443
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,282
Mike! Mike, where are you?

444
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,867
Mike! Mike!

445
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,169
Go, go, go!

446
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,427
Let's go.

447
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,888
Don't move!

448
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,726
- The hell's going on?
- They found us!

449
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,436
- Jesus! Jesus Christ!
- No, no, no.

450
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,729
Shh...

451
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,327
- Spread left.
- Right.

452
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,102
Let's go! Now!

453
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,937
- Hey! Hey!
- Jane, come on!

454
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,565
Come on, hurry!

455
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,817
Look out! Look out!

456
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,858
Get down! Get down!

457
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,957
Do something, Kal.
Do something!

458
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,896
Jane, get in.

459
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,565
It's a damn graveyard.

460
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,527
- Mike!
- It's a trap! It's a trap!

461
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,532
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but I have to go back.

462
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,035
My friends... My friends are in danger.

463
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,122
This isn't time for a talk.
We got to go right now!

464
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,000
Your mother sent you here
for a reason, remember?

465
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,503
We belong together.

466
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,339
There's nothing for you back there.
They cannot save you, Jane.

467
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,173
No.

468
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,804
But I can save them.

469
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,893
Jane. Jane!

470
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,354
Jane!

471
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,730
Jane!

472
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:01,333
The hell was that? What's wrong with her?

473
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,855
You all right, sweetie?

474
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,819
You were looking a little forlorn there.
You mind if I join you?

475
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,409
Hmm.

476
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,250
You are awfully young
to be traveling alone, aren't you?

477
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,089
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.

478
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,760
So, where are you headed?

479
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,888
To your parents, I hope?

480
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm going to my friends.

481
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,149
I'm going home.

482
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:19,173
