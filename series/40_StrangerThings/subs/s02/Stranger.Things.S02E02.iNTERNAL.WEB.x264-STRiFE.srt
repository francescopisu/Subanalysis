1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,843
Goodbye, Mike.

2
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:45,867
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Show</b>.</font>

3
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,297
Mike?

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,225
Mike?

5
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,733
Mike? Mike!

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,735
Mike!

7
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,653
Mike!

8
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,307
Bravo team, check in.

9
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,214
What about the Russians?
What if they come looking for her?

10
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,411
They don't know where she is.

11
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,580
And she can't contact you
without us knowing.

12
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,876
The most important thing
is for you to try to go on with your lives

13
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,088
- and to keep all of this...
- Top secret. Yeah.

14
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,967
Understood.
We're all patriots in this house.

15
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,154
- Go back to the beginning.
- I told you everything.

16
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,807
- I understand this is difficult, Michael.
- I don't know where she is.

17
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,892
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.

18
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,561
I would never tell you.

19
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,855
I know it's difficult to accept,

20
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,149
the stories she told you
were not true.

21
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,652
She's a very dangerous individual.

22
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,154
If she contacts you,
you must tell us.

23
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:45,493
Otherwise, you're putting yourself
and your entire family at risk.

24
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,872
Do you understand, Michael?
Do you understand?

25
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,041
Michael?

26
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,794
Michael?

27
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,634
Fan out.

28
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,053
Somebody check the left side,
I'll check the right side.

29
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,299
Oh, Jesus!

30
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,385
Ghost.

31
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,512
Yeah, I see that.

32
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,306
- Halloween.
- Sure is.

33
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,269
But right now, it's breakfast, okay?
Come on, let's eat.

34
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,603
They wouldn't see me.

35
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,274
- Who wouldn’t see you?
- The bad men.

36
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,734
What are you talking about?

37
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,612
Trick or treat.

38
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,783
You want to go trick-or-treating?

39
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,788
You know the rules.

40
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,665
- Yes, but...
- Yeah, so you know the answer.

41
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,460
- No, but they wouldn't see me.
- No. Hey. I don't care.

42
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,920
- But they wouldn’t see me.
- I don't care, all right?

43
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,923
You go out there,
ghost or not, it's a risk.

44
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,384
We don't take risks. All right?

45
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,054
They're stupid, and...

46
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,806
We're not stupid!

47
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,767
Exactly.

48
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:02,398
Now, you take that off, sit down and eat.
Your food's getting cold.

49
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,371
All right, look...

50
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:23,377
How about I get off early tonight,
and I buy us a bunch of candy,

51
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,423
and we can sit around and get fat,
and we watch a scary movie together?

52
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,717
How's that for a compromise?

53
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,011
"Compromise"?

54
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,725
C-O-M-promise. Compromise.

55
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,562
How about that's your word
for the day? Yeah?

56
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,108
It's something that's kinda in-between.
It's like halfway happy.

57
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,654
By 5-1-5?

58
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,241
5:15. Yeah, sure.

59
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,368
Promise?

60
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,330
Yes.

61
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,707
I promise.

62
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,128
Halfway happy.

63
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,772
Will?

64
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,983
Come on, honey, up and at 'em.

65
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,652
Will?

66
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,405
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?

67
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,657
Where's Will?

68
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,867
- What?
- Where's Will?

69
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,452
- He's not in his room?
- No.

70
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,954
Uh...

71
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,205
Will?

72
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,833
What are you doing?

73
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,918
Peeing?

74
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,920
Okay.

75
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,173
Okay.

76
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,136
Let's get this... on.

77
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,095
Oh!

78
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,888
You need some tape. Hold on.

79
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,486
What's this?

80
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,699
Nothing.

81
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,328
Did you have another episode?

82
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,414
No, it's just, um...
a sketch for a story I'm writing.

83
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,376
All right.

84
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,297
Three, two, one...

85
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,860
Great. Hold up the proton blaster.

86
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,053
All right, now turn to the light.

87
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,433
Oh! I want to see those pearls. Yeah!

88
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,893
Who you gonna call?

89
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,063
Oh!

90
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,650
Adorable, baby. Just adorable!

91
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,862
- God. You are such a nerd.
- Shut up.

92
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,198
No wonder you only hang out with boys.

93
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,909
- Erica!
- Just the facts.

94
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,869
Nerd.

95
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,152
My God,
I love this costume. Keep it up.

96
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:08,292
- All right, that's the last one.
- No, just one more. Come on, please?

97
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,544
Ah!

98
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,004
- Can I go to school?
- Wait, wait.

99
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,923
- Okay, say, "Who you gonna call?"
- No!

100
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,848
- ♪ Who you gonna call? ♪
- ♪ Ghostbusters! ♪

101
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,058
Hey, Spengler!

102
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,851
- Egon! Yeah!
- Venkman!

103
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,935
Whoa! Whoa!

104
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,938
- What?
- Why are you Venkman?

105
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,898
- Because I'm Venkman.
- No, I'm Venkman.

106
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,483
Why can't there be two Venkmans?

107
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,986
Because there's only one Venkman
in real life. We planned this months ago.

108
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,365
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz,
you're Egon, and you're Winston.

109
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,201
- I specifically didn't agree to Winston.
- Yes, you did!

110
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,703
- I don't think he did.
- No one wants to be Winston, man.

111
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,122
What's wrong with Winston?

112
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,208
What's wrong with Winston?
He joined the team super late,

113
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,335
he's not funny,
and he's not even a scientist!

114
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,505
- Yeah, but he's still cool.
- If he's cool, then you be Winston.

115
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,798
- I can't!
- Why not?

116
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,301
- Because...
- Because you're not black?

117
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,178
- I didn't say that!
- You thought it.

118
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,015
- I didn't say that!
- Mike!

119
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,018
Guys... Guys! Guys!

120
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,399
Why is no one else wearing costumes?

121
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,026
Crap.

122
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,864
Oh, my God!

123
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,074
When do people make these decisions?

124
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,993
Everyone dressed up last year.

125
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,245
- It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you.
- Just be cool.

126
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,622
Who you gonna call?
The nerds!

127
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,262
- We gonna do this?
- Not right now. We look like morons.

128
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,905
Maybe she likes Ghostbusters?

129
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,516
Of course she likes Ghostbusters,
but that's not the point.

130
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,060
The point is
we're dressed up and she isn't.

131
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,904
I didn't bring
regular clothes. You?

132
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,855
No.

133
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,733
Then we have no choice.
We gotta do this. It's now or never.

134
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,985
- Right.
- Let's engage.

135
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,866
We could ask her after class.

136
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,117
- Yup.
- Okay.

137
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,415
See? It's an exact match.

138
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:20,090
- But... why would he lie to me?
- He's a kid, Joyce.

139
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,552
I mean, you heard him
describe these episodes.

140
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:28,599
It's not like he's describing a nightmare.
He talks about them like they're real.

141
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,976
Yeah, because they're not nightmares,
they're flashbacks.

142
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,646
I know a couple guys
who have had these things,

143
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,691
and it feels like you're there,
like it's happening.

144
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,820
- Then what the hell is this?
- Owens said it would get worse.

145
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,424
- That place...
- What do you wanna do?

146
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,032
You wanna take him back to Chicago?

147
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,118
Well, there's that guy in Boston
that's supposed to be...

148
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,537
They're all a bunch of quacks.

149
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,248
They'll all tell you the same thing,
just cost you more money.

150
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:59,088
I think he's right... about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.

151
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,968
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you... Will most of all.

152
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,430
I think we just gotta get through
the next few weeks.

153
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,145
Nothing's gonna go back
to the way that it was.

154
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,730
Not really.

155
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,190
But it'll get better.

156
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,360
In time.

157
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,702
- Here.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,916
Jesus! Hopper...

159
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,043
Brings me back to old times.

160
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,127
What?

161
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,591
- Sharing my cigarettes between...
- Fifth and sixth period.

162
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah, under the steps.

163
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,970
Mr. Cooper caught us that time, remember?

164
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,472
He was like,
"Hey, assholes."

165
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,392
We ran. We just ran.

166
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,449
God, I want this to be over.

167
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
I know.

168
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,209
How's it looking out there, cowboy?

169
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,962
Uh, you know, Doc. The usual.

170
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,756
Nice and nasty
with a chance of radioactivity.

171
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,188
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right.
Anyone hungry?

172
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,944
And...

173
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,906
we're back on!

174
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,954
There was this storm.

175
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,457
Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

176
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,085
I felt frozen.

177
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,422
Actually frozen? Cold?

178
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,844
No, like how you feel
when you're scared,

179
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,014
and you can't breathe
or talk or do anything.

180
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,142
I felt... I felt this evil...

181
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,626
Nancy, this isn't you.

182
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,008
Barb, just go ahead
and go home, okay?

183
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,802
Nancy?

184
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,345
Nancy!

185
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,265
Nancy.

186
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,101
What's going on? Are you okay?

187
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,276
- I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

188
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,696
- Pretending like everything's okay.
- What are you talking about?

189
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
Barbara.

190
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,742
It's like everyone forgot.

191
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,620
It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.

192
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,623
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance...

193
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,792
And they're going to spend
the rest of their lives looking for her.

194
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,335
- I know.
- It's destroying them.

195
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,422
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen,
there's nothing we can do about it.

196
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,133
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.

197
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,930
- Well, you know that we can't do that.
- We don't have to tell them everything.

198
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,725
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any...

199
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,235
They could put us in jail. Okay?
Or worse, they could destroy our families.

200
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:36,031
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.

201
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,285
Hey...

202
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,413
Hey, hey...

203
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,917
Hey, it's...

204
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,337
It's hard, but let's...

205
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,175
let's just go to Tina's stupid party...

206
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,762
wear our stupid costumes

207
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,723
that we've been working on
for a stupid amount of time,

208
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,978
and just pretend
like we're stupid teenagers, okay?

209
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,857
Can we just do that, just for tonight?

210
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,027
Okay.

211
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,238
Come here.

212
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,296
Um...

213
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,591
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is...

214
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,259
- Lucas.
- Yeah, I know.

215
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,427
The stalkers.

216
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,763
Uh, no. Actually...

217
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,932
We weren't stalking you.

218
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,853
No, we were just concerned because,
you know, you're new and all.

219
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,313
Yeah, for your safety.

220
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,232
Mmm-hmm.
There are a lot of bullies here.

221
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,319
- So many bullies, it's crazy.
- Yeah.

222
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,781
- Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
- Well, these don't function. But...

223
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,912
I do have this
handy-dandy little trap here.

224
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,332
And look, it even opens and closes.
Look, look, look...

225
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,918
Voilà!

226
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,127
It's cool, right?

227
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
No? Okay. But, um...

228
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,507
So, we were talking last night,
and you're new here,

229
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,345
so you probably don't have any friends
to take you trick-or-treating,

230
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,473
and you're scared of bullies,
so we were thinking

231
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,767
that it would be okay if you come with us.

232
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,019
- "It'd be okay"?
- Yeah. Our party's a democracy,

233
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,462
the majority voted you could come.

234
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,240
Didn't realize it was such an honor
to go trick-or-treating with you.

235
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,192
We know where to get
the full-sized candy bars.

236
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,610
We figured you'd want in.

237
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,278
That's presumptuous of you.

238
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,451
Yeah. Totally.
Uh, so, um... you'll come?

239
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,666
We're meeting
at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00.

240
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,167
That's 7:00 on the dot!

241
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,879
"Presumptuous."

242
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,798
That's a good thing, right?

243
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
Is it bad?

244
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,891
Lucas, is it bad? Lucas?
Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?

245
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,189
How does it feel?
Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.

246
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,025
Inhuman. Relentless.

247
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,904
Arnold Schwarzenegger is... The Term...

248
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,615
Well, I'm stunned.
I don't know what to think.

249
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,843
- Don't you love me?
- Of course I love you.

250
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,621
It's just that it's so sudden.
I mean, it's not like you.

251
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,291
Erica, I am this way because of you.

252
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,709
- Me?
- "Me?"

253
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,668
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,212
You have made me wild and impetuous,

255
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,630
- just like you.
- "Impetuous."

256
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,173
People are going to be aghast.

257
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,097
- "People are going to be aghast."
- They're gonna love it.

258
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,390
I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town.
The whole world!

259
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,144
Erica, tell me that you will marry me,
in this house, tonight...

260
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey.

261
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,496
I'm not gonna hurt you.

262
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,290
What's your name?

263
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
What're you doing out here in the cold?

264
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,256
So, you're telling me that
Merrill poisoned your farm,

265
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,092
because he thinks you poisoned his,
which, of course, you didn't?

266
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,345
No, sir. And I got me an alibi
the night he accuses me.

267
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,056
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.

268
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,977
- Did you actually see Merrill?
- No need. That man done lost his mind.

269
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,771
Went around slandering me,
threatening all sorts of madness.

270
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,273
A pumpkin conspiracy.

271
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,899
Hawkins' very own Chinatown.

272
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,278
Merrill threatening to do something
and him actually doing something

273
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,571
are two very different things.

274
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,739
- You got a better explanation?
- Cold weather.

275
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
- It's October.
- Yeah, it's a cold one.

276
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,162
- You see these hands?
- Yeah.

277
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,248
- You know why they look like that?
- Because you're old?

278
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,792
You're damn straight.

279
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,628
And I've been doing this
a long time, Chief. A long time.

280
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,089
And I ain't never seen
anything the likes of this.

281
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,800
- None of us have.
- None of us?

282
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,179
Merrill didn't just hit me last night.
He hit damn near everyone.

283
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,430
What are you talking about?

284
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:38,226
Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling,
Rick Neary, the Christensens.

285
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,104
All of their crops, dead.

286
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,400
Give me those names again.

287
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,125
You're late again.

288
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,462
- Yeah, I had to get catch-up homework.
- Jesus. I don't care.

289
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,547
You're late again,
and you're skating home.

290
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,632
Do you hear me?

291
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,521
God, this place is such a shithole.

292
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,315
- It's not that bad.
- No?

293
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,362
Mmm!

294
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,740
You smell that, Max?
That's actually shit.

295
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,617
- Cow shit.
- I don't see any cows.

296
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,744
Clearly, you haven't met
the high-school girls.

297
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,623
- So what, you like it here now?
- No.

298
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,875
- Then why are you defending it?
- I'm not.

299
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,168
Sure sounds like it.

300
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,339
- It's just we're stuck here, so...
- Hmm.

301
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,758
You're right. We're stuck here.

302
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,803
And whose fault is that?

303
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,637
Yours.

304
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,474
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

305
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,519
- Did you say it's my fault?
- No.

306
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,814
You know whose fault it is.

307
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,565
Say it.

308
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,111
Max...

309
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,571
say it.

310
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,158
Say it!

311
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,380
Really, everyone dressed up last year.

312
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,840
Billy, slow down.

313
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,301
- Oh, these your new hick friends?
- No! I don't know them.

314
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,052
I guess you won't care
if I hit 'em, then?

315
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,263
I get bonus points,
I get 'em all in one go?

316
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
No, Billy, stop. It's not funny.

317
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,270
Hey, guys?

318
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,274
Billy, come on, stop it.
It's not funny. Stop!

319
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,359
- Go!
- Mike, you need to haul ass!

320
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,361
Billy, stop it!

321
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,071
Whoa!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

322
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,700
Yeah! That was a close one, huh?

323
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,869
Holy shit!

324
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,996
Was that...

325
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,957
Mad Max.

326
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:38,281
Now, you tryin' to tell me,
with a straight face, cold did this?

327
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,284
How far does it go?

328
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,903
Hey, Chief, you copy?

329
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,181
Uh...

330
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,307
Hey, Chief.

331
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,975
How's it looking over there?

332
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,229
Like a giant pissed
all over Jack's bean field.

333
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,940
Smells, too. It smell over there?

334
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,650
Uh, yeah, little bit.

335
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,653
Smells like a nursing home, man.

336
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,280
Listen. I want you guys to track the rot,
see how far it goes.

337
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,866
Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.

338
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,577
- That's gonna take some time.
- So take it.

339
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,247
And, look, we don't know what caused this.
Could be poison.

340
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,249
So don't touch anything without gloves.

341
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,878
Copy that, Chief.

342
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,674
You got any marking flags?

343
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:55,233
So you hit "T" to zoom in,
and "W" zooms back out.

344
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,360
See? Easy-peasy.

345
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,029
Just make sure to turn off the power
to save energy there.

346
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,574
Listen. Stay close to your brother, okay?

347
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,367
And listen, listen, listen...

348
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,912
If you get a bad feeling or anything,
you tell him to take you straight home.

349
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,664
- You promise?
- Okay.

350
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,207
- Are you ready, bud?
- Yeah.

351
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,544
Be safe.

352
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,088
I hope it doesn't suck!

353
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,679
I just don't get
what she sees in him.

354
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,805
What?

355
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,599
Bob.

356
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,976
At least he doesn't treat me different.

357
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,022
I mean, I can't even go trick-or-treating
by myself. It's lame.

358
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,316
What? You think I'm lame?

359
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,696
No, but it's not like Nancy's coming
to watch over Mike, you know?

360
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,330
Will! Hey!

361
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,793
Hey, don't cross the streams.
Don't cross the streams!

362
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,342
Hey, listen.

363
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,302
Yeah?

364
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:09,682
If I let you go on your own,
you promise to stay in the neighborhood?

365
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,560
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, totally.
- And be back at Mike's by 9:00.

366
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,896
- 9:30?
- 9:00.

367
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:15,855
- Yeah.
- Deal?

368
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,106
- Yeah, deal.
- All right.

369
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,110
Hey, Will. Don't let any of your
spazzy friends use this, all right?

370
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,403
Okay.

371
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,364
I hope it doesn't suck.

372
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,534
Will!

373
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,995
- Egon!
- Yeah! You ready for tonight, man?

374
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:37,836
Awesome!

375
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,972
thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty,
forty-one, forty-two!

376
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,560
- Yeah!
- Forty-two!

377
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,938
We got ourselves a new Keg King!

378
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,358
- Billy! Billy! Billy!
- That's how you do it, Hawkins!

379
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,694
Billy! Billy! Billy!

380
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,550
We got ourselves a new Keg King,
Harrington.

381
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,386
- Yeah, that's right!
- Yeah. Eat it, Harrington.

382
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,737
What's in this?

383
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,032
Pure fuel! Pure fuel!

384
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,241
Whoo!

385
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,206
Hey... Whoa, whoa!
Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy.

386
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,292
Take it easy. Nance, Nance, Nance...

387
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,837
We're just being stupid teenagers
for the night. Wasn't that the deal?

388
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,822
Yeah.

389
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,038
- No. No, no.
- Come on. Yes.

390
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,208
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Come on.
- No. No. No.

391
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,044
Oh, there it is.

392
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,256
You playing Frankenstein to my Dracula?

393
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,386
- Come on, you're stiff as a board. Relax.
- I'm sorry. It's...

394
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,099
He's fine. Okay? Jonathan's with him.

395
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,767
I know.

396
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:03,147
It's just every time he's away from me,
it's like I can't function.

397
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:09,278
- I know it sounds silly.
- No, it's not silly. It's not silly.

398
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,203
What if we were to move out of Hawkins...
together?

399
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,413
- What?
- I know.

400
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,332
Whoa, Nellie, right? No, I just...

401
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,518
I've been thinking about what you said.

402
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,212
About how we've got
all these memories here,

403
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,297
and you wish you had enough money to move.

404
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,009
Well, my parents
are selling their house in Maine.

405
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,928
There's a RadioShack nearby.
I'm sure they'd take me on.

406
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,054
We could just...

407
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,602
- My turn to be silly now.
- Bob...

408
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,522
No, it's fine. Wine makes me crazy.

409
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,192
Oh, it's just so hard to explain.

410
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:54,407
It's just this...
This is not a normal family.

411
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,118
It could be.

412
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,246
It could be.

Huh?

418
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,847
Victims.

419
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,561
Trick or treat!

420
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,271
Oh!

421
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,733
Well, aren't you cute?
The little exterminators.

422
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,489
If I get another
3 Musketeers, I'm gonna kill myself.

423
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,533
- What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?
- "What's wrong with 3 Musketeers?"

424
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,952
- No one likes 3 Musketeers.
- Yeah, it's just nougat.

425
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,454
Whoa. "Just nougat"?

426
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,915
Just nougat? It is top three for me.

427
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,583
- Top three?
- Top three!

428
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,959
Oh, God. Give me a break.

429
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,587
Seriously, I can just eat a whole bowl
of nougat. Straight up.

430
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,719
Holy shit! You should have seen
the look on your faces.

431
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,473
And you? Who screams like that?
You sound like a little girl.

432
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,312
Hey, you guys coming or not?
Oh, I heard we should hit up Loch Nora.

433
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,773
That's where the rich people live, right?

434
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,526
Yeah!

435
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,577
You're dead.

436
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,453
Yeah, you got me, kid.

437
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,166
Happy Halloween.

438
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:18,259
Oh, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

439
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,454
Hey, kid. Give me some
of that candy, would you?

440
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,289
No way.

441
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,544
All right. How about now?

442
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,589
Who are you? I'm Maria.

443
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,259
Will you play with me?

444
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,389
Would you like one of my flowers?

445
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,403

446
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,489

E.

449
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,248

- Wait. You're not rich, right?
- No, I live up Old Cherry Road.

455
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,655
Oh.

456
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,158
No, it's fine. I mean,
the street's good for skating.

457
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,284
Hmm.

458
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,744
Yeah, totally tubular.

459
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,665
What? Did I say that right?
Or is it, like, tubular.

460
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:58,669
It's, like, totally tubular.

461
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,589
- Totally tubular!
- What a gnarly wave, dude.

462
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,176
- Totally brodacious, bro!
- Stop. My ears are hurting.

463
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,769
- Did you agree to this?
- What?

464
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,896
To her joining our party.

465
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,690
- It's just for Halloween.
- You should have checked with me.

466
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,777
Well, they were excited.
I guess I thought you'd be okay with it.

467
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,612
She's ruining the best night of the year.

468
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,292
Watch it, Zombie Boy.

469
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,920
Trick or treat, freak.

470
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,046
Boo!

471
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,188
Mike?

472
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,732
Mike?

473
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,655
Mike!

474
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,367
Will!

475
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,662
Will, what's wrong?

476
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,289
I couldn't find you. Are you hurt?

477
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,374
Holy shit!

478
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,019
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

479
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,755
I'm gonna get you home, okay?
I'm gonna get you home. Hold on.

480
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,883
- All right, take it easy.
- I got him.

481
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,967
Mike?

482
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,428
Keep trick-or-treating. I'm bored anyways.

483
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,056
What's wrong with him?

484
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,674
Nice costume.

485
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,928
- Huh?
- Nice costume.

486
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,805
Oh, uh, yeah. I'm going
as a guy who hates parties.

487
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,392
- I'm Samantha.
- Uh, Jonathan.

488
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,030
Kiss?

489
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,074
The band.

490
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,370
- No, no, no.
- Get off.

491
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,914
- No, you've had enough, okay?
- Screw you!

492
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,751
Nance, I'm serious. Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop.
No, I'm serious.

493
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,336
- Put it down.
- No!

494
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,129
- Nance, put it down.
- Steve! Stop.

495
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,923
Stop. Stop.

496
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,887
What the hell?

497
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Nance.

498
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,943
Nance, I'm sorry.

499
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,322
- That's not coming off, Nance.
- It's coming.

500
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,033
Come on. Let me just take you home, okay?
Come here.

501
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,953
- Let me take you home. Come on.
- You wanted this.

502
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,122
No, I didn't want this.
I told you to stop drinking.

503
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,457
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit. Okay?

504
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:10,671
- No, it's not bullshit, Nancy.
- No, you. You're bullshit.

505
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,590
What?

506
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,552
You're pretending like everything is okay.

507
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:22,433
You know, like we didn't...
like we didn't kill Barb.

508
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:29,023
Like, it's great. Like, we're in love
and we're partying.

509
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:34,153
Yeah, let's party, huh?
Party. We're partying.

510
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,156
This is bullshit.

511
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,118
"Like we're in love"?

512
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,247
It's bullshit.

513
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,918
You don't love me?

514
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,046
It's bullshit.

515
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,827
It's like... like I'm stuck.

516
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,705
Like, like,
stuck in the Upside Down?

517
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:28,998
No.

518
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,878
You know on a View-Master,
when it gets, like...

519
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,963
- Caught between two slides?
- Yeah. Like that.

520
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,342
Like one side's our world,
and the other...

521
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,553
The other slide is the Upside Down.

522
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,433
And...

523
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:51,939
And there was this noise
coming from everywhere.

524
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,735
And then I saw something.

525
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,281
- The Demogorgon?
- No.

526
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:07,413
It was like this huge shadow in the sky.

527
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:12,793
Only, it was alive.

528
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,213
And it was coming for me.

529
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,176
Is this all real?

530
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,055
Or is it like the doctors say,
all in your head?

531
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,016
I don't know. Just...

532
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,979
Just please don't tell the others, okay?

533
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,648
They won't understand.

534
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,278
Eleven would.

535
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,155
She would?

536
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,198
Yeah.

537
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,909
She always did.

538
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,874
Sometimes I feel like I still see her.

539
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:57,171
Like she's still around, but she never is.

540
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,925
I don't know.
Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy.

541
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,428
Me, too.

542
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,102
Hey, well, if we're both going crazy,
then we'll go crazy together, right?

543
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:16,607
Yeah. Crazy together.

544
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,628
Jonathan?

545
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,975
Hey, kid. Open up, all right?
Look, I know I'm late.

546
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,812
I got candy here, all right?
I got all the good stuff.

547
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:27,988
Please, will you open the door?
I'm gonna freeze to death out here.

548
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,258
Hey, kid. Open up, would you?

549
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:56,058
I got, uh... stuck somewhere,
and I lost track of time.

550
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,437
And I'm sorry.

551
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,524
El, would you please open the door?

552
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,818
El?

553
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,241
All right.

554
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:19,498
I'm just gonna be out here
by myself, eating all this candy.

555
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,041
I'm gonna get fat.

556
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,544
It's very unhealthy to leave me out here.

557
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,131
Could have a heart attack or something.

558
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:32,511
But, you know, you do what you want.

559
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,726
One quarter pound of all-American beef,

560
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,480
fresh-cut tomato,
and four strips of crispy bacon.

561
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,483
Did somebody say bacon?

562
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,336
Refreshing lemon...

563
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,862
and they're perfect
for dunking. Mmm!

564
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,066
It's day 353.

565
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,533
I had a bad day today. I don't know. I...

566
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,412
I guess I wish you were here.

567
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,373
I mean, we all do.

568
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,421
If you're out there,
just please give me a sign.

569
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,471
Mike.

570
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,516
Eleven?

571
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,364
Tubular.

572
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,283
Tubular.

573
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,619
Tubular.

574
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,585
Mews, is that...

575
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,889
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

576
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,785
