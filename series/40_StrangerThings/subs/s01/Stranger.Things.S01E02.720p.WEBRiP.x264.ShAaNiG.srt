1
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:15,885
Is there a number we
can call for your parents?

2
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:17,936
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

3
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,229
Did you run away?

4
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:21,312
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Is that blood?

5
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,383
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!
- She's freaking me out!

6
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:25,616
I bet she's deaf.

7
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:28,571
Not deaf.

8
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,950
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

9
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,416
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

10
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:52,415
No, no, no!

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,097
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,433
- See over there?
- That's the bathroom.

13
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:59,519
Privacy.
Get it?

14
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,910
You don't want it closed?

15
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,746
No.

16
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,915
Oh, so you can speak.

17
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:23,209
Okay, well...

18
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:27,297
Um, how about we just keep the door...

19
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,134
just like this.

20
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,345
- Is that better?
- Yes.

21
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:42,103
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.

22
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,064
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

23
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,858
She tried to get naked.

24
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,621
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

25
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,155
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like...

26
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,698
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

27
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,409
- From where?
- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

28
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,172
- You got a lot of family there?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,204
Seriously though, think about it.

30
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,333
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

31
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,576
Why she went like...

32
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:07,420
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

33
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,505
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly!

34
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,174
We should've never brought her here.

35
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,217
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

36
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,428
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

37
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,511
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.

38
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:19,265
- Who's crazy now?
- How is that crazy?

39
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,934
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

40
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,354
- So?
- So if I tell my mom

41
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:26,272
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

42
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:28,608
- Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.

43
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,277
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

44
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,573
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

45
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,784
- You're letting a girl...
- Just listen!

46
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,827
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

47
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,954
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

48
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:43,878
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

49
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:46,315
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

50
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:47,598
We'll be totally in the clear.

51
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,253
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

52
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,714
And this time, we find Will.

53
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,346
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

54
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,723
You really think she's psycho?

55
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,392
Wouldn't want her in my house.

56
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,439
Mental.

57
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,777
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

58
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,494
Is that real?

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,584
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

60
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,212
What's it mean?
Eleven?

61
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,675
That's your name?

62
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,846
Eleven. Okay.

63
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,266
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

64
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,561
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

65
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,024
Um, well, okay.

66
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,193
'Night, El.

67
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:57,739
'Night, Mike.

68

69
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,815
All right, Mom. Breakfast is ready.

70
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,693
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

71
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,653
- I can't eat.
- I just need you to eat, Mom.

72
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,156
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,658
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to go alone...

74
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,021
No, I know. I told you, I got it.

75
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:09,523
... so I'm gonna have Karen take
you, 'cause I should be here.

76
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,789
- Okay.
- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

77
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,232
- How much is a copy?
- Yeah, okay.

78
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,475
- Okay, Mom. Mom.
- Ten cents?

79
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,877
- If we... Ten cents...
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

80
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,213
You can't get like this, okay?

81
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,716
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

82
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,597
We've been waiting six hours.

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,390
I know. I came as soon as I could.

84
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,058
Six hours.

85
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,269
A little bit of trust here, all right?

86
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,314
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

87
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,065
- And?
- Nothing.

88
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,567
God.

89
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,654
Flo says you got a phone call?

90
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,906
Oh, yeah.

91
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,885
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

92
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,335
- The storm?
- What else?

93
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:00,338
You're saying that that's not weird?

94
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:02,089
No, it's weird.

95
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,675
Can we, like, trace who
made the call? Contact the...

96
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,761
No, it doesn't work like that.

97
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,596
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

98
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,519
Because Flo said you
just heard some breathing.

99
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,588
No. It was him. It was Will.

100
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:18,522
And he was scared. And then something...

101
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,442
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

102
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,605
- Who would do that?
- Well, this thing's been on TV.

103
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:26,530
It brings out all the crazies, you
know. False leads, prank calls, uh...

104
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,617
No, Hopper, it was not
a prank. It was him.

105
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,328
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here?

106
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:35,623
What, you think I'm...
I'm making this up?

107
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,306
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

108
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,710
All I'm saying is it's
an emotional time for you.

109
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:43,089
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

110
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,799
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

111
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:01,857
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
- No.

112
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,401
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

113
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,070
Oh, come on!

114
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,239
You're wasting your time.

115
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,951
Hey, Hopper.

116
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,203
Hopper.

117
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,538
Let me go.

118
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,958
- I'm sorry?
- To Lonnie's.

119
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,919
You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

120
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,422
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

121
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,215
He'll... He'll hide.

122
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,009
- You know, he's good at hiding.
- Yeah?

123
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,429
Well, cops are good at finding. Okay?

124
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,180
Stay here with your mom.

125
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,474
She needs you.

126
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,829
Slow down, Mike. That's disgusting.

127
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,166
Do a lot of studying last night?

128
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,835
Yeah, actually, I did.

129
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,296
What was your test on
again? Human anatomy?

130
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,091
Hey, what's going on?

131
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,594
Nothing.

132
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,398
Hey, you found my supercomm.

133
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,649
Pretty cool, huh?

134
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,610
I talk to my friends with it.

135
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,570
Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close.

136
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,738
Signal's pretty weak.

137
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,118
Got you breakfast.

138
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,664
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

139
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,188
but I just need you to go out there.

140
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,293
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

141
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,922
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

142
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:52,134
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

143
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:53,219
Understand?

144
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:55,721
Really, it's no big deal.

145
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,932
We'll just pretend to
meet each other again.

146
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,602
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

147
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,106
No.

148
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,525
No?

149
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,360
No.

150
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,781
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

151
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,122
You're in trouble, aren't you?

152
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,001
Who...

153
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,130
Who are you in trouble with?

154
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,425
Bad.

155
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:34,593
Bad?

156
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,762
Bad people?

157
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,476
They want to hurt you?

158
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,978
The bad people?

159
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,406
Understand?

160
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,993
Michael, where are you?
We're going to be late.

161
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,996
- Let's go!
- All right, I'll be back.

162
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,771
Just stay here, okay? Stay here.

163
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,380
When was this?

164
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,090
Last night. Less than two miles away.

165
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,967
- And the boy?
- Still missing.

166
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,762
It was my son. I know it.

167
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,140
And I... I heard something else.

168
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,600
Something else?

169
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,313
It was like, uh,
some kind of animal.

170
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:30,900
I don't know. Just
please tell Hop to hurry.

171
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,903
Will! Will Byers!

172
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,655
Will Byers!

173
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,493
- Will!
- Will!

174
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,330
Hey! Anything?

175
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,332
You?

176
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,543
No, nothing but a dead phone.

177
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:50,628
Joyce?

178
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,464
About one step from
falling off the edge.

179
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,966
She's been a few steps for
a while now, hasn't she?

180
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,801
Kid's missing, man.

181
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,178
Show a little class.

182
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,681
All right. Come on, let's go!

183
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,017
We got a lot of ground to cover.

184
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,519
The chief and her, they've
screwed before, huh?

185
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,732
Will!

186
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,275
That a "yeah" or did they...

187
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,403
- Will!
- Will!

188
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:27,373
"When alpha particles go through
gold foil, they become... "

189
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,000
- Unoccupied space.
- "A molecule that can... "

190
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,168
- Hey!
- I don't know,

191
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,731
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

192
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:35,215
- Steve...
- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

193
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,091
Don't worry. Now, on to
more important matters.

194
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:40,135
My dad has left town on a conference
and my mom's gone with him,

195
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,638
- 'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
- Good call.

196
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,722
So are you in?

197
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,224
In for what?

198
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,059
No parents? Big house?

199
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,852
A party?

200
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,854
Ding, ding, ding!

201
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,398
It's Tuesday.

202
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,941
It's Tuesday! Oh, my God.

203
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,359
Come on.

204
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,194
It'll be low key. It'll just be us.

205
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,655
What do you say? Are
you in or are you out?

206
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,575
- Um...
- Oh, God. Look.

207
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,286
Oh, God, that's depressing.

208
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,750
- Should we say something?
- I don't think he speaks.

209
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,585
How much you want to bet he killed him?

210
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,920
Shut up.

211
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,721
Hey.

212
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,389
Oh, hey.

213
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,640
I just...

214
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,103
I wanted to say, you know, um...

215
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,105
I'm sorry about everything.

216
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,821
Everyone's thinking about you.

217
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,617
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,372
I'm sure he's fine.

219
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,124
He's a smart kid.

220
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,920
I have to go. Chemistry test.

221
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,005
Yeah.

222
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,548
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

223
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,889
Attention, faculty and students.

224
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,434
At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be
an assembly on the football field

225
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,853
in support of Will
Byers and his family.

226
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,064
All are encouraged to attend.

227
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:19,318
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties
are still available in the office.

228
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,700
Oh, this is weird.

229
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,162
- He's never this late.
- I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

230
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,497
I thought you liked his plan.

231
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,916
Yeah, but obviously it was
stupid, or he'd be here.

232
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,959
If his mom found out a
girl spent the night...

233
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,544
He's in deep shit right about now.

234
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:40,297
Hey, what if she slept naked?

235
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:42,299
Oh, my God, she didn't.

236
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,593
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

237
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,554
- No way. Mike would never rat us out.
- I don't know.

238
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,849
All that matters is, after school, the
freak will be back in the loony bin,

239
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:54,061
and we can focus on what
really matters, finding Will.

240
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,562
You want anything to drink?

241
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:14,255
We have OJ, skim milk... What else?

242
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,875
Um, we have...

243
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,546
Oh, this is my living room.

244
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,172
It's mostly just for watching TV.

245
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,800
Nice, right? It's a 22-inch.

246
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,969
That's, like, ten times
bigger than Dustin's.

247
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,691
- Pretty.
- I guess.

248
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,192
That's my sister Nancy.

249
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,902
And that's baby Holly.

250
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,362
And those are my parents.

251
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,156
What are your parents like?

252
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,199
Do they live close?

253
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,203
That's our
La-Z-Boy.

254
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,165
It's where my dad sleeps.

255
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,959
You can try it if you want.

256
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,627
Yeah.

257
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:02,963
It's fun.

258
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,427
Just trust me, okay?

259
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,966
See? Fun, right?

260
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,812

No, but... I don't know.

- It's fun to go with him sometimes.
- Come on.

278
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,729
Has he ever done anything with
you that you actually like?

279
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,565
You know, like the arcade or something?

280
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,068
- I don't know.
- No, all right? He hasn't.

281
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,991
He's trying to force you
to like normal things.

282
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,115
And you shouldn't like things because
people tell you you're supposed to.

Okay?

284
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,994
Especially not him.

285
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,248

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,418
- I brought Jeffrey in to cover.
- I'm not here to work.

292
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,919
I...

293
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,130
The storm last night, I...

294
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,924
I need a new phone.

295
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,554
Okay, that looks like $22.56.

296
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,431
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

297
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,808
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

298
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,685
for the copies for the posters.

299
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,147
Uh, I need an advance.

300
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,566
Yes, well, of course.

301
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,234
- Of course.
- Thank you.

302
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,659
Yeah, uh, I was thinking, two weeks?

303
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,162
Um...

304
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:27,292
Yes, I understand, but, you know,
I have to pay Jeffrey for covering...

305
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,377
Donald.

306
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,672
I've been here ten years, right?

307
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,717
Have I ever called in sick
or missed a shift once?

308
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:39,179
I've worked, uh, Christmas
Eve and Thanksgiving.

309
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,683
I don't know where my boy is.

310
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:43,975
He's gone.

311
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,105
I don't know if I'm... gonna ever
see him again, if he's hurt...

312
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,191
I, uh...

313
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:56,446
I need this phone and
two weeks' advance.

314
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,827
And a pack of Camels.

315
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,131
- We're all clear.
- Copy that.

316
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,106
Extraordinary.

317
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,945
Ready are you? What knows you of ready?

318
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,389
His name's Yoda.

319
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,533
He can use the Force to move
things with his mind, like this.

320
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,951
Whoosh!

321
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,413
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

322
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,497
Look, he has a speaker in
his mouth so he can roar.

323
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,384
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

324
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,804
We got first every year.

325
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,598
Except for last year when we got third.

326
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,767
Mr. Clarke said it
was totally political.

327
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:09,871
You know Will?

328
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:15,043
Did you see him? Last
night? On the road?

329
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,717
We gotta go.

330
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,306
I bought pizza and macaroni.

331
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,933
- Okay.
- Okay.

332
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,564
Ted? Is that you?

333
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:36,856
Just me, Mom!

334
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,609
- Mike? What are you doing home?
- One second!

335
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,949
In here. I'll be right back, okay?

336
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,743
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

337
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,787
Do you understand?

338
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,455
I won't tell her about you. I promise.

339
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,915
Promise?

340
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,001
It means something that you can't break.

341
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,003
- Ever.
- Michael?

342
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,671
Please?

343
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,732
Pop!

344
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,279
Papa!

345
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:26,865
Papa!

346
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,283
No!

347
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,327
Papa!

348
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,746
No! No! No!

349
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:38,585
Papa!

350
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,337
Papa!

351
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,838
Papa!

352
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,007
Papa!

353
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,258
Papa!

354
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:49,888
Papa.

355
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,900
I just... I don't feel good.

356
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,653
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

357
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,976
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

358
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,590
but the last time I told you I was sick

359
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:10,714
- you made me go to school anyway, and...
- Michael.

360
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:13,328
- Yeah?
- I'm not mad at you.

361
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:16,706
- No?
- No, of course not.

362
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,961
All this that's been going on with Will,

363
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,172
I can't imagine what
it's been like for you.

364
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,966
I just...

365
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,511
I want you to feel
like you can talk to me.

366
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:33,348
I never want you to feel like
you have to hide anything from me.

367
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,558
I'm here for you. Okay?

368
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,312
Is there someone else here?

369
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,023
No.

370
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,527
Eleven?

371
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,195
Is everything okay?

372
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,321
El?

373
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,703
- Mike.
- Is everything okay?

374
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,124
Are you sure?

375
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,793
Promise.

376
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,332
- Will Byers!
- Will!

377
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,023
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.

378
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:47,255
I need you alive for the
next few days, at least.

379
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,591
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

380
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,802
What? George Burness made the jump.

381
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,221
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

382
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,306
George is a liar.

383
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,267
You make that jump from this
height, that water turns into cement.

384
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,950
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

385
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,149
Nah.

386
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,026
Chief, you copy?

387
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,112
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

388
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,948
Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.

389
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,867
I think you need to
get there right away.

390
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,308
Ugh, Jesus!

391
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,607
Suicide?

392
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,568
Mmm-hmm.

393
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,737
Missing kid, suicide...

394
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:55,532
You must feel like a big
city cop again, huh, Chief?

395
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,994
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

396
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,249
Benny was my friend.

397
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,328
Hello?

398
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,831
Yeah.

399
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:50,253
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

400
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,338
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
- To look around.

401
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,924
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
- I'll be fast.

402
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,342
Hey, Will?

403
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,802
Will!

404
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,971
Will, you here? Will!

405
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,102
Get off!

406
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,855
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

407
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,065
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

408
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,320
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

409
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,404
My oldest.

410
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,367
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.

411
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,841
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen to me.

412
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,925
- You are out of your mind!
- She knows about Will.

413
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,659
What do you mean she knows about Will?

414
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,682
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

415
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,646
- You could tell?
- Just think about it.

416
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,937
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

417
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,647
the same place where Will disappeared?

418
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,024
- That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.

419
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,402
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

420
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,864
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us?

421
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,077
Do you know where he is?

422
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,560
Do you know where Will is?

423
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,979
- Stop it, you're scaring her!
- She should be scared!

424
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:10,541
If you know where he is, tell us!

425
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,420
This is nuts. We have
to take her to your mom.

426
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,923
No! Eleven said telling any
adult would put us in danger.

427
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,425
- What kind of danger?
- Her name is Eleven?

428
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,011
- El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger?

429
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,721
Danger danger.

430
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,479
No, no, no!

431
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,315
We're going back to plan
A. We're telling your mom.

432
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,995
No.

433
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,920
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

434
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,880
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

435
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,759
Really? You want to
check up my ass, too?

436
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,267
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

437
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,930
he's not here and he never has been.

438
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:09,017
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?
- I don't know, I just...

439
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,602
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

440
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,229
You know, he was lost or something.

441
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,566
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

442
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,777
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

443
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,195
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

444
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:26,409
Tell your mother she's gotta
get you out of that hellhole.

445
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,453
Come out here to the city.

446
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,163
People are more real here, you know?

447
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,957
And then I could see you more.

448
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,587
- What, you think I don't want to see you?
- I know you don't.

449
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,714
See, that's your mother
talkin' right there.

450
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,091
She even know you're here?

451
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,135
Oh, great.

452
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,929
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

453
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,806
Some real fine parenting right there.

454
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,643
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe
I'm not the asshole, all right?

455
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,025
In case you forgot what he looks like.

456
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,364
He's kinda cute, hmm?

457
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,491
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

458
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,631
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

459
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,458
You, uh, notice anything...

460
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,877
odd about him the last few weeks?

461
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,214
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

462
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,424
I mean, he was lookin'
forward to it. I know that.

463
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,718
He got any enemies you might know about?

464
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,887
I mean, people who might
not want him around?

465
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,973
The exes didn't like him
much. That's for sure, but...

466
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,518
nah.

467
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:37,355
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

468
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,690
- Just you and the boys?
- Yep.

469
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,859
Me and Henry and...

470
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,696
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

471
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,824
No kid did this.

472
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:49,826
Kid?

473
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:52,703
What are you talking about?

474
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:57,708
Yeah. At lunch, uh, there
was this boy that, uh...

475
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,545
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

476
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,004
Can you imagine that?

477
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,008
This kid...

478
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:08,761
what'd he look like?

479
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:13,224
Well, he was about yea
high. You know, tiny like.

480
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,987
I didn't get a good look at him,
though. He was back in the kitchen.

481
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,471
He look like this?

482
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,940
Oh, no, that's... That's
Lonnie's missin' kid.

483
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,067
No. This was a different kid.

484
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,610
This one had really short hair.

485
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,779
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

486
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,490
Yeah, well, let's... You know,
let's forget about the haircut.

487
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:32,660
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

488
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,120
could it be Lonnie's kid?

489
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,165
Well, I... I didn't
get a good look at him.

490
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,127
About the right height, though.

491
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,879
I mean, could've been.

492
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,631
Yeah, that's...

493
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:46,716
Could've been.

494
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,930
Because I don't want to go by myself.

495
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:56,184
Barb... Barb, it's not rocket science.

496
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:59,645
You just tell your parents you're
gonna stay at my place afterwards.

497
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,607
No, tell them we're... studying.

498
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,400
Nancy! Dinner!

499
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:06,194
Coming!

500
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,946
Look, I gotta go. I'll
see you in an hour.

501
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,291
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

502
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,212
Oh, no, I had two bologna
sandwiches for lunch.

503
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,006
I don't know why.

504
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,966
Me, too.

505
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,512
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

506
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,972
So, there's this...

507
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,558
special assembly thing tonight...

508
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:39,936
for Will at the school field.

509
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,020
Barb's driving.

510
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,272
Why am I just hearing about this?

511
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,191
I thought you knew.

512
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:48,361
I told you, I don't want you out
after dark until Will is found.

513
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:51,781
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

514
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,908
I mean, everyone's going.

515
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,080
Just... be back by 10:00.

516
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,818
Why don't you take the boys, too?

517
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:03,052
- No! -
Mmm-mmm.

518
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,712
Don't you think you
should be there? For Will?

519
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,010
Sorry. Spasm.

520
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,141
Oh...

521
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,434
It's okay, Holly.

522
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,353
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.

523
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,357
Will!

524
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,654
Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

525
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,875
Hey, you think Earl really saw Will?

526
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,920
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

527
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,589
And stealing food from Benny?

528
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,341
Tell you what, when
we find him, we'll ask.

529
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,051
Can't ask a corpse questions.

530
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,928
Hold up!

531
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,471
You got something?

532
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,768
- Hey, what do you got?
- Not sure.

533
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:04,770
Maybe nothing.

534
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,772
I found this. In there.

535
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,654
No way a kid crawls through there.

536
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,407
I don't know...

537
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,867
a scared enough one might.

538
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,328
His brother said he was good at hiding.

539
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:57,448
El?

540
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,207
No adults. Just us and some meatloaf.

541
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:12,797
Don't worry. They won't
tell anyone about you.

542
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,299
They promise. Right?

543
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,927
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

544
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,304
Ow!

545
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:25,017
What Dustin is trying to say is that
they were just scared... earlier.

546
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:26,143
That's all.

547
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,145
We just wanted to find our friend.

548
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:29,772
"Friend"?

549
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,733
Yeah, friend. Will?

550
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:36,112
What is "friend"?

551
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,613
Is she serious?

552
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,701
Um, a friend...

553
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,536
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

554
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:46,747
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

555
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,124
And they never break a promise.

556
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,126
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit?

557
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:53,963
A spit swear means...
you never break your word.

558
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,464
It's a bond.

559
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:59,218
That's super important,
because friends...

560
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,554
they tell each other things.

561
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,389
Things that parents don't know.

562
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,273
- Barbara, pull over.
- What?

563
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,649
Pull over!

564
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,237
What are we doing here?

565
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,905
His house is three blocks away.

566
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,449
We can't park in the driveway.

567
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,575
Are you serious?

568
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:23,858
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

569
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:26,579
This is so stupid. I'm
just gonna drop you off.

570
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,497
Calm down, Barb. Come on.

571
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:31,125
You promised that
you'd go. You're coming.

572
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,460
We're gonna have a great time.

573
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,086
He just wants to get in your pants.

574
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,796
No, he doesn't.

575
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,174
Nance... seriously.

576
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,343
He invited you to his house.

577
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,345
His parents aren't home.

578
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,681
Come on, you are not this stupid.

579
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:47,767
Tommy H. And Carol are gonna be there.

580
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,936
Tommy and Carol have been having
sex since, like, seventh grade.

581
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,898
It'll probably just
be, like, a big orgy.

582
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,942
- Gross.
- I'm serious!

583
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:58,319
All right, well...

584
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,573
you can be, like, my
guardian. All right?

585
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:05,117
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

586
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,202
Ugh.

587
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,748
Is that a new bra?

588
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:13,542
No.

589
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:27,973
Barb, chill.

590
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,267
I'm chill.

591
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,732
Hello, ladies.

592
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,307
What are you doing?

593
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,810
It's freezing.

594
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:20,067
You ever feel cursed?

595
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:26,574
You know, the last person to
go missing here was in, uh...

596
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,952
the summer of '23.

597
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,914
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

598
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,672
When'd the last person freeze to death?

599
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,386
Hey, come back inside.

600
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,471
Warm me up. Just...

601
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,684
Just give me a minute out here.

602
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,129
What's the weirdo doing?

603
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,219
El?

604
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:43,901
Will.

605
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,569
Superpowers.

606
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,621
Did you see him? On Mirkwood?

607
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,248
Do you know where he is?

608
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,849
I don't understand.

609
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:17,935
Hiding.

610
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,687
Will is hiding?

611
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:26,026
From the bad men?

612
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,614
Then from who?

613
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:35,804
Where are you?

614
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,169
One! Two!

615
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,922
- Three!
- Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

616
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,674
You're such an asshole, Tommy.

617
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:29,608
Is that supposed to impress me?

618
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,487
- You're not?
- You are a cliché, you do realize that?

619
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,613
You are a cliché.

620
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,116
What with your... your
grades and your band practice.

621
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,617
I'm so not in band.

622
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,620
Okay, party girl. Why don't you
just, uh, show us how it's done, then?

623
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,704
Okay.

624
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:51,957
- You gotta make a little hole right in...
- I got it.

625
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:54,191
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

626
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,806
Chug, chug, chug.

627
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,349
Chug. Chug. Chug.

628
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,155
Barb, you wanna try?

629
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,532
What? No.

630
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:19,867
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

631
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,076
- Come on.
- Yeah...

632
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,494
- Come on. Yeah.
- Nance, I don't want to.

633
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:24,288
- It's fun! Just give it a...
- Nance...

634
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:26,039
Just... Just give it a shot.

635
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,293
Okay.

636
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:36,008
So you just...

637
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,764
- Gnarly.
- Are you okay?

638
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,488
- Yeah.
- Barb, you're bleeding.

639
00:44:44,512 --> 00:44:46,351
I'm fine. Where's your bathroom?

640
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:49,021
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down
past the kitchen, to the left.

641
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,689
Okay. Thanks.

642
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,193
Oh.

643
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:07,205
Oh, my, God! What the hell, Tommy?

644
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:08,290
No!

645
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,835
Whoo!

646
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,043
Hello?

647
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,839
Hello.

648
00:45:57,923 --> 00:45:59,758
Who is this?

649
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,097
Will?

650
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:09,309
Will, it's me.

651
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:11,144
Talk to me.

652
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:12,604
I'm here.

653
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:14,564
Just tell me where you are, honey.

654
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,608
I can hear you. Please.

655
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,277
Mom?

656
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:20,737
Will!

657
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,449
Yes, it's me. It's me.

658
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,827
Where are you? Where are
you? Just talk to me...

659
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:30,539
Oh, no, no!

660
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,665
No!

661
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,250
No!

662
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,044
Oh, no! No, no...

663
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,215
No!

664
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,181
No!

665
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:06,074
Jonathan?

666
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:09,703
What...

667
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:42,444
Will...

668
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,208
Will...

669
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,002
Will, is that you?

670
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:23,652
Oh, my God.

671
00:48:26,363 --> 00:48:27,948
Oh, God...

672
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,036
Oh, my God...

673
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,124
I'm freezing.

674
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:23,503
Hmm... well, I hear his
mom's room has a fireplace.

675
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:25,227
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, yeah?

676
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:27,257
Okay, well, you know, you
are cleaning the sheets.

677
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,592
- You all right?
- Yeah.

678
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:31,344
Yeah? Come on, let's
get you some dry clothes.

679
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,185
Nance!

680
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,603
Nancy.

681
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:42,314
Where are you going?

682
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,440
Nowhere.

683
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,358
Just... upstairs.

684
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,068
To change.

685
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,905
I... fell in the pool.

686
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,534
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

687
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:56,995
I'll just... I'll get
a ride or something.

688
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,455
Nance...

689
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:00,916
Barb...

690
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,584
I'm fine.

691
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,086
This isn't you.

692
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:07,839
I'm fine.

693
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:11,509
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

694
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,656
Thanks.

695
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:38,995
Um...

696
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,705
some privacy, maybe?

697
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:42,290
Oh...

698
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:44,000
Yeah, right. Sorry.

699
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:49,798
Steve?

700
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:04,980
Damn.

701
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,566
Shut up.
