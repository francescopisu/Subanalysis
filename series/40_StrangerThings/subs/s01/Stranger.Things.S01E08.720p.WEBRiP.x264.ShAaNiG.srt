1
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,834
Let me out of here!

2
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:26,546
Somebody, please!

3
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,759
Let me out!

4
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:53,573
Your son.

5
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,868
We know you've been in contact with him.

6
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,998
- You have to let me...
- When...

7
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,710
and how did you make contact with him?

8
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:08,505
- What?
- Hmm?

9
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:11,799
Six.

10
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:14,177
What?

11
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:16,804
Six.

12
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:21,100
Six people have been taken this week.

13
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,730
This... thing that took your son...

14
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:29,758
we don't really understand it.

15
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,362
But its behavior is predictable.

16
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:36,532
Like all animals...

17
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:39,869
it eats.

18
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,122
It will take more sons.

19
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,208
More daughters.

20
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:47,877
I want to save them.

21
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,422
I want to save your son.

22
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,092
But I can't do that.

23
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,243
Not without your help.

24
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:57,554
Stop.

25
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:03,226
I know who you are.

26
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,770
I know what you've done.

27
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:10,048
You took my boy away from me!

28
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:13,886
You left him in that place to die!

29
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,989
You faked his death!

30
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,183
We had a funeral.

31
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:21,661
We buried him.

32
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,832
And now you're asking for my help?

33
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:31,504
Go to hell.

34
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,037
Okay, now what do you know?

35
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,723
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,808
Did I stutter?

37
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:46,919
I told you.

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,378
Everything.

39
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,051
What do you know?

40
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:58,055
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

41
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,533
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

42
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,185
And I know you went a
little too far this time

43
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:05,204
and you messed up in a big way.

44
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:09,316
I mean, you really messed
up, didn't you? Big time.

45
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,336
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

46
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:15,364
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

47
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,866
You made it look like that
little girl just ran away.

48
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,385
See, I told you.

49
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:23,056
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

50
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,332
Nobody.

51
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,584
But I did give all this over
to my friend at the Times.

52
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,488
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

53
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,846
You're just a junkie.

54
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:43,642
A small town cop who
had a really bad week.

55
00:03:43,643 --> 00:03:45,995
Took one too many pills this time.

56
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,858
You made a mistake coming back here.

57
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,544
No, I didn't.

58
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,881
Here's what's gonna happen.

59
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,510
You're gonna let me
and Joyce Byers go...

60
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,787
you're gonna give us anything we need,

61
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,932
and we're gonna find her son.

62
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,711
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

63
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:12,939
Oh, is that right?

64
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,525
Yeah.

65
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,695
That's right.

66
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,419
Nancy? Jonathan?

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,329
- They're gone.
- What?

68
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,745
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.

69
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,529
They're probably just
sucking face somewhere.

70
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,373
- Gross.
- No. No way!

71
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:49,541
Did they go with the chief?

72
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,643
I don't know.

73
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,353
No.

74
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,732
What? Did you see them? Do
you know where they went?

75
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,026
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

76
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,156
Demogorgon.

77
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,807
Where's the girl?

78
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:02,275
You gotta give me your word.

79
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,362
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

80
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:11,117
And those other three kids, those
boys, you're gonna leave them alone.

81
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,246
Then I'll tell you.

82
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:20,543
Tell you where your little
science experiment is.

83
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:47,052
I don't understand.

84
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,804
We came to an agreement.

85
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,472
What?

86
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:53,376
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

87
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:54,601
we don't talk about.

88
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:55,912
You want Will back?

89
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,623
This place had nothing to do with it.

90
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:02,251
That's the deal. You got it?

91
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,161
What is this?

92
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:16,081
Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.

93
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:18,542
But my son's in there. He...

94
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,769
Put it on.

95
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,862
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.

96
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,989
It's gone. Isn't that what you wanted?

97
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,480
And if they find the boy?

98
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,166
That's not gonna happen.

00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:35,008
_

101
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:03,331
Hey, you all right?

102
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:04,457
Yeah.

103
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,239
I need you to relax, okay?

104
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:09,713
I want you to slow down your
breathing, take deep breaths.

105
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,899
In and out.

106
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,693
Deep breath in...

107
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:16,779
and out.

108
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:20,407
In and out.

109
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,728
- In and out.
- It's troll's favorite food!

110
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,552
- Princess!
- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

111
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,841
Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!

112
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,608
No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

113
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:35,029
Whoa, hey!

114
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,448
Hey.

115
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:38,192
You all right?

116
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,284
- What's going on?
- Whoa.

117
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,785
- What happened? What happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

118
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:43,955
Hey, you all right?

119
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,081
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

120
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:47,167
Relax, relax. Honey, honey.

121
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,169
Honey, just breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

122
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,963
In and out. Slow, slow, slow.

123
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,550
In and out with me.

124
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,652
In...

125
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,680
- You okay?
- Yeah.

126
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:01,907
Yeah.

127
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:23,661
Remember...

128
00:12:23,662 --> 00:12:26,498
- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

129
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,999
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,560
Then...

131
00:12:31,295 --> 00:12:32,521
All right.

132
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,440
You ready?

133
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,234
Ready.

134
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:40,446
On three.

135
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:42,489
One...

136
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,159
two...

137
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,393
You don't have to do this...

138
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,478
Jonathan, stop talking.

139
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,396
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

140
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:53,441
Guys, guys! This is crazy.

141
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,818
We can't just wait around.

142
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,195
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

143
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,759
The bad men are still looking for us.

144
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,743
Yeah, and we don't even
know where your sister is.

145
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:01,699
El can find them.

146
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,801
Mike, look at her.

147
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:05,644
I still think we should
stick to the chief's plan.

148
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:09,207
Exactly. We stay here, keep El
out of sight and keep her safe.

149
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,084
That's the most
important thing, remember?

150
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,086
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

151
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,606
Yeah, and she's kind
of a badass now, so...

152
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:18,967
Well, where are you going? You
just said stick to the plan!

153
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:21,427
I am. I'm just gonna go
get some chocolate pudding.

154
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,596
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady
Phyllis hoards that shit.

155
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:24,931
Are you serious?

156
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:26,700
El needs to be recharged!

157
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:48,931
Did you hear that?

158
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,185
It's just the wind.

159
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:00,300
Don't worry.

160
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:03,720
My mom, she said the
lights speak when it comes.

161
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:04,905
Speak?

162
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,015
Blink.

163
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,201
Think of them as alarms.

164
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:19,754
Is that too tight?

165
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,113
No, it's fine.

166
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,424
Thanks.

167
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:35,978
Nancy?

168
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:39,440
Yeah?

169
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,386
Jonathan?

170
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:47,823
Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!

171
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:50,391
Listen, I just want to talk!

172
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,122
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

173
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:55,868
You need to leave.

174
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,607
I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

175
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,311
I don't care about
that. You need to leave.

176
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,278
No, no, no. Listen, I messed up, okay?

177
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,030
I messed... I messed up.

178
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,114
Okay?

179
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:06,950
Really. Please.

180
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:08,594
I just want to make things right.

181
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:11,972
Okay? Please. Please...

182
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,458
Hey, what happened to your hand?

183
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:16,793
Is that blood?

184
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:18,628
Nothing. It was an accident.

185
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,588
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

186
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,465
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

187
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,860
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

188
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:27,887
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

189
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,764
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

190
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,391
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

191
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:33,295
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

192
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,687
Wait. What? What is going on?

193
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,063
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

194
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:38,847
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

195
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:40,441
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

196
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:42,145
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

197
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,778
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

198
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,589
Nancy! The lights.

199
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,449
- It's here.
- Wait, what's here?

200
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,534
- Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

201
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,119
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

202
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,287
I don't know. I don't see it.

203
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,371
Where is what?

204
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:56,225
Hello? Will someone please explain
to me what the hell is going...

205
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:01,597
No!

206
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:03,840
Go! Go! Run! Go!

207
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,276
Get out of here!

208
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,322
- Jump!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

209
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:13,808
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

210
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,512
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up!

211
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:24,253
What's it doing?

212
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:26,463
I don't know.

213
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
Do you hear anything?

214
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:43,463
No.

215
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:42,146
Will!

216
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,749
Will!

217
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,547
Will!

218
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,637
Will!

219
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:11,509
"I asked Mrs. Spencer what made
them red and she said she didn't know

220
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,469
and for pity's sake not to
ask her any more questions.

221
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,453
She said I must have asked
her a thousand already.

222
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:16,556
I suppose I had, too,

223
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:19,642
but how are you gonna find things
out if you don't ask questions?

224
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,602
And what does make roads red?

225
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,438
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.

226
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:26,167
It just makes me feel
glad to be alive...

227
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,461
it's such an interesting world."

228
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:47,813
Will!

229
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,568
Will!

230
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,837
This is crazy. This is
crazy. This is crazy.

231
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:32,190
This is crazy! This is
crazy! This is crazy!

232
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,303
What are you do... What are
you doing? Are you insane?

233
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:38,554
It's going to come back!

234
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,389
So you need to leave.

235
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,367
Right now.

236
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,208
Where is it?

237
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:10,586
Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch.

238
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:12,588
- You see it?
- No. Where...

239
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:13,774
Come on.

240
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,485
Where are you? Come on!

241
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,558
Jonathan!

242
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,370
Jonathan!

243
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:28,563
Jonathan!

244
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,961
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

245
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,937
Steve!

246
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,241
He's in the trap!

247
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,787
- He's stuck!
- Jonathan, now!

248
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,238
Did you hear that?

249
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:28,306
Get back!

250
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,810
- Where did it go?
- No.

251
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,329
It has to be dead.

252
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:53,582
It has to be.

253
00:22:02,783 --> 00:22:04,241
Come on.

254
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,219
Is that my house?

255
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:40,152
It was hurt.

256
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,563
Mom.

257
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,583
Is that you?

258
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,127
Mom.

259
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,297
Jonathan?

260
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:29,886
Joyce, come on.

261
00:23:41,214 --> 00:23:43,066
Where's it going?

262
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,486
I don't think that's the monster.

263
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:54,143
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.

264
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:55,561
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

265
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:57,104
Always lying, saying she's out.

266
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,772
Bald-faced liar.

267
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:02,151
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

268
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,628
Okay!

269
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:05,922
Are you feeling any better?

270
00:24:09,075 --> 00:24:11,327
What's "putting"?

271
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:13,037
Pudding, it's...

272
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,898
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

273
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:16,207
Don't worry,

274
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,671
when all this is over, you won't
have to keep eating junk food

275
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,211
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

276
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:22,463
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.

277
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:24,048
She can make you whatever you like.

278
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,424
Eggos?

279
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,778
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

280
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:32,598
See, I was thinking,

281
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,935
once all this is over and Will's
back and you're not a secret anymore,

282
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,521
my parents can get you an
actual bed for the basement.

283
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:40,314
Or you can take my room if you want,

284
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,942
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

285
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,152
My point is, they'll take care of you.

286
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:46,946
They'll be like your new parents,

287
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:49,799
and Nancy, she'll be
like your new sister.

288
00:24:50,617 --> 00:24:52,660
Will you be like my brother?

289
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:55,454
What? No, no.

290
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,081
Why "no"?

291
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,558
Because...

292
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,668
'cause it's different.

293
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:02,002
Why?

294
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:05,148
I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.

295
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,525
It's stupid.

296
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:09,802
Mike?

297
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,053
Yeah?

298
00:25:11,054 --> 00:25:13,281
Friends don't lie.

299
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,575
Well...

300
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:17,952
I was thinking...

301
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,247
I don't know...

302
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:24,066
maybe we can go to
the Snow Ball together.

303
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,110
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

304
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:28,904
where you go in the gym and
dance to music and stuff.

305
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:31,805
I've never been, but I know you're
not supposed to go with your sister.

306
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,493
- No?
- I mean...

307
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:36,704
you can, but it'd be really weird.

308
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:40,475
You go to school dances with
someone that, you know...

309
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,043
someone that you like.

310
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:45,087
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

311
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,565
Uh... uh...

312
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,235
Uh, someone like a...

313
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,235
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back.

314
00:26:08,236 --> 00:26:09,671
Stay here.

315
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,271
Go!

316
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,773
You two, on me.

317
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:34,011
This will charge your battery
right up, I'm telling you.

318
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:36,555
- Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

319
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:39,224
They found us.

320
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:40,952
We know they're here.

321
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:45,582
Be advised, west side
of the building is clear.

322
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:51,028
Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.

323
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:56,634
Nothin'.

324
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:00,954
Keep it locked down.

325
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,265
All right.

326
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,392
Kitchen.

327
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,715
How did they find us?

328
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:13,579
I don't know, but they
knew we were in the gym.

329
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,848
Lando.

330
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:18,097
- Got 'em!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

331
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:19,348
Come on!

332
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:22,501
- There they are. Freeze.
- Back! Go back!

333
00:27:22,502 --> 00:27:24,396
Go, go! Go left!

334
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,276
El, are you okay?

335
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:56,927
El!

336
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,591
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

337
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,764
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!

338
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,534
El! El!

339
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,954
There's more blood.

340
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:14,587
Oh, my God.

341
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:19,300
This way.

342
00:29:15,048 --> 00:29:17,091
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

343
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,193
Leave her.

344
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:24,056
- Step away from the child.
- No!

345
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,849
You want her, you have to kill us first.

346
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,726
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

347
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:29,621
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

348
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:32,040
- You idiot!
- No!

349
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:35,251
- Get off me!
- Ow! Let go!

350
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:38,487
Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?

351
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:39,631
Eleven?

352
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,573
Papa?

353
00:29:41,574 --> 00:29:44,118
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

354
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,582
- Get off of me.
- I'm here now.

355
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,164
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

356
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,001
Shh, shh, you're sick.

357
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:55,170
You're sick, but I'm
going to make you better.

358
00:29:55,171 --> 00:29:59,091
I'm going to take you back home,
where I can make you well again.

359
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:01,093
Where we can make all of this better,

360
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:03,112
so no one else gets hurt.

361
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,618
Bad.

362
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:11,788
Bad.

363
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,694
Mike. Mike.

364
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:20,445
Mike.

365
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:26,952
Blood.

366
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:28,263
What?

367
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:29,889
Blood.

368
00:30:48,808 --> 00:30:49,993
Demogorgon.

369
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,248
Go, go, go, go, go!

370
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:00,685
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go!

371
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,738
Oh, my God.

372
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:35,390
Will! Will!

373
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,042
Will! Oh, my God!

374
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:41,461
Will! Hopper!

375
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:44,399
Oh, my God! You need
to help get him out!

376
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:46,813
Get him out!

377
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,043
Oh, Jesus.

378
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,203
Come on, come on!

379
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:08,905
Oh, my God!

380
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:15,096
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost
there. We're almost there.

381
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:20,017
Come on. Come on.

382
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:22,961
Help, help.

383
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:24,713
Come on, get her on the table.

384
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,427
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

385
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:33,305
He's gone. The bad man's gone.

386
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:36,492
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

387
00:33:37,143 --> 00:33:39,078
she'll get you your own bed.

388
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,664
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

389
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,877
And we can go to the Snow Ball.

390
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,299
Promise?

391
00:33:52,408 --> 00:33:54,552
Promise.

392
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:13,237
Is... Is it dead?

393
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,517
Go, go, go, go!

394
00:34:18,518 --> 00:34:20,741
Get the wrist rocket!
Get the wrist rocket now!

395
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:22,729
Go, go, go, go, go!

396
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,481
- Go, go, go.
- Take it out now!

397
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,690
Get the rocks, get the
rocks, get the rocks!

398
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:26,775
Getting the rocks!

399
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:28,235
- Give me one.
- Come on!

400
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:29,859
- Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it!
- Fire! Fire!

401
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:32,697
- Give me another one.
- Kill it! Bastard!

402
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,866
- Kill it! Go, go, go, go!
- Kill it now!

403
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,119
Get, get, get... Come
on, kill the bastard!

404
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,203
It's not working!

405
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:40,038
- Hit him again.
- Kill him!

406
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,082
- Keep going! Come on!
- Get, get, get...

407
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,227
- Come on, kill it!
- Come on! Go, go, go!

408
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,919
Eleven, stop!

409
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:42,118
Goodbye, Mike.

410
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,139
No more.

411
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:58,611
El? El?

412
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:00,554
- El!
- Eleven!

413
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,657
- Eleven!
- El!

414
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:04,993
El, where are you?

415
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,120
Eleven!

416
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,455
El?

417
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,085
Oh, God.

418
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:19,155
He's not breathing, he's not breathing.

419
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,838
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen
to me, listen to me, listen to me.

420
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,715
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

421
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,537
- and lift his chin.
- Okay.

422
00:37:25,538 --> 00:37:27,122
One, two, three, four.

423
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,206
Now when I tell you,

424
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:32,085
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,
and breathe into his mouth...

425
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:34,087
- twice.
- Okay.

426
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,213
One second...

427
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,798
then pause.

428
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:38,550
22, 23.

429
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:39,676
- Then one second.
- Okay.

430
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:41,761
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

431
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,740
29, 30. Now! Go!

432
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:50,506
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

433
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,397
Come on, kid.

434
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:53,607
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

435
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,899
Will, listen to me.

436
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,235
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

437
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:58,445
I love you so much.

438
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:01,740
I love you more than
anything in the world.

439
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:03,742
Please...

440
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:06,363
Blood pressure keeps dropping.

441
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:09,289
Her pulse ox is falling.

442
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,084
I love you so much. I love you
more than anything in the world.

443
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,920
Please, please come back to me. Just...

444
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,173
- Come on, kid!
- Please, please wake up.

445
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:19,466
Please, please.

446
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,468
Breathe, Will, come on!

447
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,821
Flatlining!

448
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,549
Come back to me, breathe.

449
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,185
I need you to wake up now.

450
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,620
I need you to breathe.

451
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:33,247
Please breathe!

452
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:36,066
Please!

453
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:39,235
That's it.

454
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:42,464
Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.

455
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,034
That's it, baby. Breathe.

456
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:48,244
Breathe. All right. Come on.

457
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,704
Come on.

458
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,873
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

459
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:53,667
Good, good, good, good.

460
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:56,854
Just breathe, Will, breathe.

461
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:29,804
Michael?

462
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,057
Michael!

463
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,062
Michael?

464
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,259
Oh, my God.

465
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,820
Oh, my God.

466
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:47,947
You're okay.

467
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:50,658
You're okay.

468
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:29,679
Hey.

469
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,574
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey.

470
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,519
Where... where am I?

471
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:41,542
You're home. You're home now.

472
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,401
You're safe.

473
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:45,129
Jonathan.

474
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,841
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

475
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,720
We missed you.

476
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,639
We really missed you.

477
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,183
Are you okay?

478
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:00,561
What, this?

479
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:03,772
It's just a cut. It's nothing.

480
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,693
You're worried about my hand.

481
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,365
Oh, hey, uh...

482
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,058
We, uh...

483
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:17,369
We brought you some stuff...

484
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,039
so you don't get bored in here.

485
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:21,874
So...

486
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,921
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

487
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:30,424
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

488
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,163
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will
is up. Guys, Will's up.

489
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:21,976
Guys, come on.

490
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:26,629
Byers!

491
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,506
Be careful. Be careful with him.

492
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,174
- Move.
- Guys, guys.

493
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:32,027
Go easy on him.

494
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:34,596
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

495
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:36,306
- It was mental.
- You had a funeral.

496
00:42:36,307 --> 00:42:38,224
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

497
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,976
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

498
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,120
Yes!

499
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,585
You okay?

500
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,670
It got me.

501
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:51,821
The Demogorgon.

502
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:53,364
We know.

503
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,449
It's okay.

504
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,909
It's dead.

505
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,118
We made a new friend.

506
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,180
She stopped it. She saved us.

507
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,141
But she's gone now.

508
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,793
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

509
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:07,128
Well, we call her "El" for short.

510
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,296
She's basically a wizard.

511
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,547
She has superpowers.

512
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,632
More like a Yoda.

513
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,258
She flipped a van with her mind,

514
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,509
and these agents were
trying to shoot us...

515
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,595
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

516
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,722
And blood was pouring
out of their faces.

517
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:19,140
It was pouring out of their eyes.

518
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,204
Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

519
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,825
... shot out of the wall...

520
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:51,023
Something is coming. Something angry.

521
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:52,358
Hungry for your blood.

522
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:54,277
It is almost here.

523
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:56,446
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

524
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,613
It's not the thessalhydra.

525
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,240
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

526
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:00,783
The thessalhydra!

527
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,452
- Damn it.
- It roars in anger!

528
00:45:02,453 --> 00:45:04,245
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

529
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:06,056
Fireball him!

530
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,227
Fireball the son of a bitch.

531
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:15,923
Fourteen!

532
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,843
Direct hit. Will the Wise's
fireball hits the thessalhydra.

533
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:20,928
It makes a painful...

534
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,973
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

535
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:27,435
Its clawed hand reaches
for you one last time

536
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:29,103
and, and, and...

537
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,605
and...

538
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,113
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

539
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:41,199
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

540
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,493
You carry the heads out
of the dungeon, victorious,

541
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:45,161
and you present them to King Tristan.

542
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:46,865
He thanks you for your
bravery and service.

543
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:49,665
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, that's not it, is it?

544
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,042
No, there's a medal ceremony...

545
00:45:51,043 --> 00:45:53,294
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

546
00:45:53,295 --> 00:45:55,338
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

547
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:56,964
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

548
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:58,188
But it doesn't make any sense.

549
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,593
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

550
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,136
And the proud princess?

551
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:03,659
And those weird flowers in the cave?

552
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,744
I don't know, it's...

553
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,058
Jeez, what's that smell?

554
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:08,810
Have you guys been playing
games all day, or just farting?

555
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:10,353
Oh, that's just Dustin.

556
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,604
He farted.

557
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,040
- Dustin farted.
- Okay.

558
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:14,357
- Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

559
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:15,483
Oh.

560
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:17,026
- Will.
- Shut up.

561
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:18,690
- Come on.
- Dustin farted!

562
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:20,793
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Will.

563
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:22,865
See you, Will.

564
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:25,284
- Stop.
- No, you stop.

565
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,638
No, you stop.

566
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:31,600
Yeah, scream! You're like a little girl.

567
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,554
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

568
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:45,680
Hey, boys.

569
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:46,764
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

570
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,850
Hey, wish your mom a Merry
Christmas for me, okay?

571
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,768
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, Merry Christmas.

572
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,204
Merry Christmas.

573
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:54,856
- So, uh, you win?
- Yeah.

574
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,626
- Awesome.
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

575
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,823
- Uh...
- Merry Christmas.

576
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:05,592
Thanks, um...

577
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:08,077
I... I didn't get you anything.

578
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,079
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

579
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,101
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

580
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:18,313
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

581
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:27,990
Merry Christmas.

582
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,909
- You ready? Let's go.
- Yeah.

583
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,249
All right. Buckle up.

584
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:43,588
Can I open it?

585
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:46,133
Yeah, sure.

586
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,202
Whoa.

587
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:51,304
Pretty cool.

588
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,683
Yeah.

589
00:47:55,584 --> 00:47:57,978
Yeah, pretty cool.

590
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,202
Did you give it to him?

591
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,329
Yeah.

592
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,885
You leaving already, Chief?

593
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:49,538
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted

594
00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:51,263
to come to this thing?
I was just hungry.

595
00:48:51,264 --> 00:48:52,682
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

596
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:55,768
Well, your wife doesn't have time to
cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

597
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,623
Merry Christmas, Hop.

598
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,250
Mmm.

599
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:12,720
What you got there?

600
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:13,846
That one of yours?

601
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,949
- Yeah.
- Looks pretty big.

602
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,620
Be careful. You'll break it.

603
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,818
What are you... What are you doing?

604
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:29,320
Documenting.

605
00:50:29,321 --> 00:50:30,780
Oh, why?

606
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:32,239
Because...

607
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,493
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

608
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,120
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

609
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,540
- They're so runny.
- Mom, it's gonna be great.

610
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:44,126
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

611
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,503
The green present. It's an Atari.

612
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,231
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

613
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:51,175
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

614
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:56,555
We'll have to see, won't
we? Hey, no more snooping.

615
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:58,808
No, I forgot to wash my
hands. I'll be right back.

616
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:00,119
Okay.

617
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:03,246
He's washing his hands?

618
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:45,288
Thanks.

619
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:49,668
Are you okay?

620
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:52,587
Yeah, I'm okay.

621
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:54,381
Mmm. Very good, Mom.

622
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:58,576
Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will
tell you about, uh, the game?

623
00:51:58,577 --> 00:51:59,827
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

624
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,204
I threw a fireball at him and... dead.

625
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:04,582
Wait, what is... You mean, this is...

626
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,167
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

627
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,002
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.
