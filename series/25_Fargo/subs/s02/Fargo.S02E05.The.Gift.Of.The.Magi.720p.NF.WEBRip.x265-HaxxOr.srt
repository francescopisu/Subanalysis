1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,900
Erstwhile on "Fargo"...

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,860
We need to find Rye,
bring him home.
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,240
You know him, do you?

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,400
Ed? Oh, yeah. He's a butcher.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,460
I ran over him. Hit and run.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,570
His name was Rye Gerhardt,

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,510
and his family hurts people
for money.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,700
If you did something, you made
a mistake, you panicked,

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,560
you maybe covered it up,
now is the time to say.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,410
But that window's closin',
and you may already be dead.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,160
We're asking you to leave.

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,710
Management says acquire
the territory, we acquire it.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,830
Whether that's cash down
or sending bodies to the morgue,

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,870
that's up to the krauts.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,910
Joe bulo says hi.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,660
Your counter
has been rejected,

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,670
and now we're lowering our price
by $2 million.

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,610
Anything other than
unconditional surrender,

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,700
and we'll wipe
every last Gerhardt

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,200
off the face of the earth.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,860
My father was a salesman.

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,040
Ladies shoes.

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,610
It's fair to say
during the depression

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,130
that he struggled,

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,770
like a lot of people
on the rock river

26
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,540
in Dixon, Illinois.

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,770
But I've never been one
to focus on life's downs.

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,940
I was a lifeguard
in high school,

29
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,770
and where some saw
a drowning man,

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,940
I saw a life to save...

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,160
...which I did,
77 times in 5 years.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,000
They put up a plaque
after I became governor,

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,530
and, uh...
Well, I'd have to say

34
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm prouder of that
than just about anything.

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm gonna call you chief wigwam,
you bring that thing.

36
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,810
Any man can fire a gun.

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,360
The longbow is an art.

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,960
Well, you're all set.

39
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,240
Everything okay?

40
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,360
Just a little housekeeping.

41
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,170
Let's kill ourselves some deer.

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,670
My friends, we have
in our lifetime fought harder,

43
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,240
paid a higher price for freedom

44
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,530
and done more to advance
the dignity of man

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,740
than any people who ever lived
on this earth.

46
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,110
But if you look around,

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,400
you may not see many signs
of that dignity.

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,730
Crime is up. Jobs are scarce.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,710
You have to stand in a line
just to fill up your car.

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,340
How?

51
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,030
Run down in the street

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,540
and finished off
at a second location.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,330
You're sure?

54
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,240
Who?

55
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,100
Butcher.

56
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,330
A butcher?
Down in luverne.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,960
Like the law said, Rye followed
the judge, shot up the place.

58
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,670
Got killed after.

59
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,140
By a butcher?

60
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,770
That's his name.

61
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,670
Butcher of luverne.
That's what they call him.

62
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,440
Contract man outta...

63
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,630
Outta Kansas City.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,610
I wanna hear it from him.

65
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,240
Kid was marked

66
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,060
probably the day he left.

67
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,610
Butcher ambushed him

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,830
after the judge tried
to grab him, probably.

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,440
He got in some licks.

70
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,230
Things went downhill.

71
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,630
Why?
Ma, it's war.

72
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,340
You said yourself.

73
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,230
They're jackals, came here
talking about a settlement.

74
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,700
Meanwhile, the kid is
already dead.

75
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm asking him.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,970
He's a bargaining chip, yeah?
Rye.

77
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,670
Kansas City thinks
if they grab him up,

78
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,040
then come to you with that
leverage, you'll sell for sure.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,870
Instead, they kill him,
they panic, cover it up,

80
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,170
knowing once you find out,
sale's dead, no question.

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,540
See?

82
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,640
The citizens
of this great nation

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,570
want leadership, yes,
but not a man on a white horse,

84
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,840
demanding obedience
to his command.

85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,310
They want someone who believes

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
they can begin the world
over again...

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,230
I'm saying, the age of
the local mom and pop is over,

88
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,630
and what comes next,
commissioner,

89
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
the era of big business,

90
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,660
is gonna make a lot of people
very rich.

91
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,140
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

92
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,810
And you're saying
you can deliver leaders

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,530
on the state and local level?

94
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,540
Joe, there's not
a politician in this state

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,040
wouldn't take my call
in the middle of dinner.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,770
Well, then, you and me
are really gonna be pals.

97
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,860
...a leader who will unleash
their great strength

98
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,810
and remove the roadblocks
government has put in their way.

99
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,640
Watch and learn, Joe.

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,710
I believe this nation hungers
for a spiritual revival...

101
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,630
Watch and learn.

102
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,610
Uhh!
What the...

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Move! Gerhardt!

104
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,070
...that we, all of us,

105
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,610
hunger to, once again,

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,460
see honor placed above
political expediency...

107
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,370
...to see government

108
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,270
once again
the protector of liberties,

109
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,340
not the distributor
of gifts and privilege.

110
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,260
Government should uphold
and not undermine

111
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,970
those institutions

112
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,710
which are custodians
of the very values

113
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,300
upon which civilization
is founded...

114
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,130
Religion, education,

115
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,810
and above all, family.

116
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,800
Aah!

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,200
Wait.

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,530
Uhh!

119
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,870
Uhh!

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,830
We, who are privileged
to be Americans,

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,710
have had a rendezvous
with destiny

122
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,760
since the moment in 1630
when John winthrop,

123
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,710
standing on the deck
of the tiny arbella

124
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,360
off the coast of Massachusetts,

125
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,440
told that little band
of pilgrims,

126
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,500
"we shall be
as a city upon a hill."

127
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,900
A troubled and afflicted mankind
looks to us,

128
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,160
pleading for us to keep
our rendezvous with destiny,

129
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,840
that we will uphold
the principles of self-reliance,

130
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,270
self-discipline,

131
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,070
morality, and above all,

132
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,710
responsible liberty
for every individual...

133
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:38,340
That we will become
that shining city on a hill.

134
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,560
My friends, I believe
that you and I together

135
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,870
can keep this rendezvous
with destiny.

136
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,070
Thank you.

137
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,340
God bless you.
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,300
Thank you very much.
Thank you. God bless you.

139
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,160
Okay. Okay.

140
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,910
Son of a bitch is
charismatic, I'll give him that.

141
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
But I'm not shaking his hand.

142
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,500
Why not, Karl?

143
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,900
Because, Sonny, the man made
a movie with a monkey.

144
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,960
It wouldn't be dignified.

145
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,810
Well, hello.
Oh, hey.

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,600
I loved you in
"cattle queen of Montana."
Well, thank you.

147
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,960
Not many people liked that film.

148
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,670
Hello, little girl.

149
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,670
Governor, I'll be escorting
your bus to the next stop,

150
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,810
so whenever you're ready.
Well, all right.

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,730
Ya got drafted?
Yeah, captain called.

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,510
I offered we had murders
to solve, but --

153
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,560
he knows best, probably.

154
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,270
Said he did, anyway.

155
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,970
Anyway, just gotta take him
as far as the state line,

156
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,740
so be home by dark.
Okay.

157
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,270
Bye. Mwah!

158
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,640
Bye.
Bye.

159
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,140
If you get the chance,

160
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,570
ask him if it's true
that Joan Crawford had crabs.

161
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,740
Yeah,
I'm not gonna do that.

162
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,350
We got 'em.

163
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,520
Bulo, too?

164
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,710
Oh, yeah.

165
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,110
Milligan?

166
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,240
No, he wasn't there.

167
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,280
You can bet they're gonna
come back at us hard.

168
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,620
I thought they'd negotiate.

169
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,750
That's the feminine side, ma.

170
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,250
It was always gonna be war,
them knowing Rye was dead.

171
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,120
Killing him, I mean.

172
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,910
I want this butcher dead.

173
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,510
In luverne.

174
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,780
No mercy.

175
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm sending Virgil.

176
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,940
Hon?

177
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,380
Hon?

178
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,150
Sorry.
Are we are out of coffee?

179
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,750
What?
What?

180
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,220
Uh...

181
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,710
Did you...

182
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,640
You weren't in bed, so I --

183
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,490
I know. I was just thinkin'.

184
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,840
What?

185
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,250
What we should take.

186
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,020
Take where?

187
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,370
When we go.

188
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,150
Where are we going?

189
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,380
To California.

190
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,220
What are you --
what are you talking --

191
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,910
when we run, I mean.

192
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,710
You heard what Lou said.

193
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,580
I-I mean, if we've just
messed things --

194
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,240
if I've just messed things up
from the start,

195
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,650
if -- if this is
still not over,

196
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,690
just the tail
of the snake...

197
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,040
What --
what are you sayin'?

198
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,690
I mean, what was he even doin'
in the road, for shit sake?

199
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,140
That fella.

200
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,220
All those dead people,
and...

201
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,410
And he had a car, so why was he
standing in the road?

202
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,310
I-I don't know.

203
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,910
But...
Constance saw.

204
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,940
Saw what?

205
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,650
The car,

206
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,620
after ya cleaned it,
but before we crashed it again.

207
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,540
She knows
about the accident.

208
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,050
Shit.

209
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,050
She drove me home the night I...

210
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,750
The night
you got rid of the...

211
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,220
And, uh, had to use
the bathroom.

212
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,270
I was gonna
walk her right out,

213
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,220
but then I heard music
coming from the garage,

214
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,610
and she came up by me
and saw.

215
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,780
Well, I mean,
what did she say, though?

216
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,610
I...
I don't think she'll tell,

217
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,540
but how can we know for sure,
ya know?

218
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,050
And plus now
with the law enforcement

219
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,790
askin' questions,
suspectin'.

220
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,510
And -- and these ghouls
on the come, Lou said.

221
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,210
Hon, we can't stay here.

222
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,610
No.

223
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,270
Hon?

224
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,820
No.

225
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,010
You said. We agreed.

226
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,370
Clean it up,
and everything'd be --

227
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,890
I know. Hon?
No.

228
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,540
We -- we did this
for a reason, peg.

229
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,350
For the shop and the kids.

230
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,790
For a reason, so we could stay.
That's the only --

231
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,510
hon, you got --
you gotta be realistic.

232
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,480
No, no.
I -- w-we're stayin'.

233
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,310
That was...

234
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,010
Whatever comes,

235
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,110
we'll deal with it,
or it'll deal with us.

236
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,980
But I'm buying the shop,
and we're starting a-a family.

237
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,340
But...How?

238
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,120
It's too late to get
the money back for the course.

239
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,170
And -- and -- and you said
bud had to have it by Friday.

240
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,320
We'll figure it out.
That's what people do.

241
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,710
They figure things out,
stay together, make it work.

242
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,600
I can help.
Do your chores, kid.

243
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,780
I'm serious.
Playtime's over.

244
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,010
I can do it. You saw.

245
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,710
Luverne, Minnesota,
ed blumquist.

246
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,450
He's posing as the town butcher.

247
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,000
This is baloney.

248
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,010
I'm not just some crippled kid
can't shoot straight.

249
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,050
Ask your dad. If he says
you can go, you can go.

250
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,340
It should be us.

251
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,840
A Gerhardt.

252
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,470
He killed a Gerhardt,
so it should be one of us.

253
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,310
A real boss'd know that.

254
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,750
You're taking the kid.

255
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,500
You're the boss.

256
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,110
You walk him in,
he pulls the trigger.

257
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,450
Anything goes wrong...

258
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,100
You fix it, you understand?

259
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,250
Where do you think
you're goin'?
Got an errand.

260
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,600
Send one of the boys.
I can run my own errand.

261
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,750
It's not safe.

262
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,680

You okay?

286
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,010
My mother could find the cloud
in every silver lining.

287
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,680
That's cute.

288
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,850
Mine smiles all the time,
like some ghoul.

289
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,170
I think it's 'cause dad hits her
when she looks sad.

290
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,470
I see thing one.
Where's thing two?

291
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,050
Dead.

292
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,800
Your Indian killed him.

293
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,680
Killed a lot of people.

294
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,350
I didn't know
that was happening.

295
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,370
Nobody told me.

296
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
You believe me?

297
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,580
Right?

298
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,610
What are we,
in your mind?

299
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
Romeo and Juliet?

300
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,580
No.

301
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,040
I don't know.

302
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,110
She was a true gloom,
my mother.

303
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,250
We used
to eat in the dark.

304
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,200
For a laugh,
I wrote on her tombstone,

305
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,450
here lies Barbara milligan,
happy till the end."

306
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,800
Me, on the other hand,

307
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,910
I'm an optimist.

308
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,450
So when I see this...

309
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,650
Ugh! Oh!

310
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,940
Oh!

311
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,280
I don't think the sky
is falling.

312
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,100
I think that, sir, is the sound
of opportunity knocking.

313
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,700
Not so much,
my young friend.

314
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,480
It's not my fault.

315
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,950
They had a meetin' without me.

316
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I woulda said.

317
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,750
If you want me
to take you seriously,

318
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,370
you have to be
a serious person.

319
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,110
Have a beer,

320
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,210
do a line,

321
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,780
blow your load.

322
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,780
All that's fine,

323
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,750
but it's not the point.

324
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,640
What's the point?

325
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,540
I wanna know what they're
gonna do before they do it.

326
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,600
Every time.

327
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,780
Otherwise, you can die
with the rest of them.

328
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,210
State car 1-8, come in, over.

329
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,050
This is 1-8. Go ahead.

330
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,920
I got Fargo P.D. On the line
looking for ya.

331
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,990
Yeah, okay. Patch it through.

332
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,240
Hey, how's your day then?

333
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,690
Uh, peachy. You?

334
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Oh, it's a shit sandwich
up here.

335
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,690
Got 12 dead in the woods --

336
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,180
half Gerhardt,
half Kansas City,

337
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,840
plus the local
zoning commissioner

338
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,450
with half his face
in the bushes.

339
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,550
Good Christ.

340
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,720
Yeah, this thing's gonna get
worse before it gets better.

341
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,120
Well, on my end,
we think we know

342
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,880
what happened
to Rye Gerhardt.

343
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,110
Run over
by a local beautician.

344
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,110
Got stuck
in her windshield.

345
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,240
We think, uh, she
and her husband panicked

346
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,590
and dumped the body
someplace.

347
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Meanwhile, we've got visitors
from both factions

348
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,080
most likely
looking for revenge,

349
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,610
so little like
the Cuban missile crisis.

350
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,550
Well, my captain thinks
I should try to intervene,

351
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,590
seeing as how
my mom knows Floyd,

352
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,110
and maybe cooler heads
can prevail, et cetera,

353
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,840
which, well, you saw how well
that went over last time, huh?

354
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,750
Sounds like maybe I should
come up.

355
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,620
I wouldn't mind the company.

356
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,490
Well, I'm stuck
in this Reagan detail today,

357
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,310
so assuming we survive
the night here,

358
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,780
I'll, uh,
drive up first thing.

359
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,510
Thanks.

360
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,790
Okay, I'll try to keep the pot
from boiling over

361
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,240
in the meantime.

362
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,990
Yeah. Over.

363
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,620
No, I -- yeah, that's,
uh, I understand.

364
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,990
It's a -- it's a...Recession.

365
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,790
No, I-I appreciate it, and...

366
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,580
Okay. Okay, say hi
to aunt velma for me.

367
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,590
Nothin'?

368
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,850
Personally not sure why you're
makin' all this effort.

369
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,690
Gonna buy the shop,

370
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,080
be my own boss.

371
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,810
And?
And what?

372
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,620
That's the American dream.

373
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,850
What's the point?

374
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,420
Just gonna die, anyway.

375
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,920
W-what do you mean?

376
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,650
Camus says knowing we're all
gonna die makes life a joke.

377
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,690
So what, you just --
you just give up?

378
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,980
You could kill yourself,
get it over with.

379
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,150
Okay, that -- that's not...

380
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,150
I-I mean, come on,
you gotta -- you gotta try.

381
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,490
No.

382
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,710
You go to school,
you get a job,

383
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,990
you start a family.

384
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,340
Die.
That's --

385
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,890
would you please
stop saying that?

386
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,680
I'm gonna live
a long, long life.

387
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,510
My -- my grandpa was 96.

388
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,350
At which point he did what?

389
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,750
Died.
Noreen.

390
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,680
Well, okay, uh...

391
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,580
I'm gonna go
in the back now,

392
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,710
away from this nonsense.

393
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,990
Would you please let me know
if bud's back?

394
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,240
I will.

395
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,120
Unless I'm dead!

396
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,940
What are you waiting for?

397
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,790
You want that I should
carry you over there?

398
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,040
No, I-I just, uh...

399
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,320
Well, do I, uh...

400
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,440
You know, shoot him
in the head or in...

401
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,220
don't overthink it.

402
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,710
Just point and shoot.

403
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,890
If he keeps moving,
you shoot him again.

404
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,440
Simple.

405
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,820
Kid?

406
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,650
One more thing.

407
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,790
No witnesses.

408
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,480
Oh. Sorry.

409
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,980
I didn't hear ya.

410
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,180
Uh, what kind of meat
do you want?

411
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,710
We got pig meat,

412
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
cow meat, chicken meat.

413
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,390
Um, bud won't let us
sell fish,

414
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,680
even though Jesus says
eat it on Fridays.

415
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,920
Uh, the, um...

416
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,790
Looking for the butcher.
Blumquist.

417
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,580
Yeah.
He's not the butcher.

418
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,280
More the assistant butcher,

419
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,040
though that's gonna change,
I think.

420
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,120
Buying the place.

421
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,210
Uh, you need to...

422
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,780
He's in the back.

423
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,010
Buzz him for you.

424
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,990
Oh, hey. I read that.

425
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,510
Oh, yeah?

426
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,290
Last year.

427
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,010
It's...Pretty depressing.

428
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,450
Really?

429
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,590
See,
I think it's beautiful.

430
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,080
But then, everyone always says,
"Noreen, you're morose."

431
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,580
Halloween is
my favorite holiday.

432
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,990
I like easter.

433
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,780
Of course.
The resurrection.

434
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,610
It's like why everyone
loves "rocky,"

435
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,690
even though
it's a boxing picture.

436
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
The comeback.

437
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,320
Except he loses in the end.

438
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,780
Well...
Now you ruined it.

439
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,580
Sorry.

440
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,950
Just kiddin'.

441
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,810
Oh.

442
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,350
Here's ed now.

443
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,390
Sorry. Was just in the middle
of a hog.

444
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,340

I just --
I'm here for my car.

463
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,080
Yeah? So, she's all fixed,
front and back.

464
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,280
Put a new windshield on her.
She's a sweet car, really.

465
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,840
Okay.

466
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,550
So is that gonna be cash or --
I wrote out a check.

467
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,690
Maybe don't cash it till the end
of the week, though, huh?

468
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,380
Payday.
Oh, yeah, that's no problem.

469
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,280
You, uh, you goin' somewhere?

470
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,610
Well, I guess so.

471
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,190
You know, for the best.

472
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,210
Best what?

473
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,910
Just...

474
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,240
Wait till the end of the month
to cash that check, okay?

475
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,890
Yeah, sure thing.
You take care.

476
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,510
You wanna buy my car?

477
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,590
What do you mean?

478
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
Well,
you said it was sweet,

479
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,980
and you know, we gotta buy
the shop, the butcher shop,

480
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,280
so we could use the money.

481
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,820
What about your trip?

482
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,080
Decided not to go.

483
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,980
Just now?

484
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,540
Moments ago.

485
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,690
Well, I...

486
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,710
Couldn't give you any more
than $700 for it.

487
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,310
Okay.

488
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,840
Are you sure? It's --
it's worth at least $1,400.

489
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,520
Yeah, well,

490
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,210
$700 today is better than
$1,400 tomorrow.

491
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,080
So, can we do it now?

492
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,410

Killed a few, lost a few.

502
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:02,040
But you delivered
the message?

503
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,310
I wanna thank you
for your service to this family.

504
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,240
Me and mom.

505
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,980
Ever since my dad took you in
8, 9 years old,

506
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,640
you never complained
or made demands.

507
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,920
It might not feel like it
all the time --

508
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,820
to me...

509
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,880
You're part of this family.

510
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,340
Not that dodd would ever
tell you that.

511
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,890
Which, I know you're mostly
his guy,

512
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,010
but I just want you to know,

513
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,720
there's a place for you at our
table, with or without him.

514
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,680
All you gotta do
is be straight with us.

515
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,840
Am straight.

516
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,020
Well, of course,
it's just...

517
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,820
We just escalated this war...

518
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,210
On account of what you...

519
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,640
The information you found out
about Rye.

520
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,690
Mom's real upset,

521
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,440
but I have to just double check
the veracity of...

522
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,220
Before it's too far
over the breach.

523
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,980
My daughter back?

524
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,280
What the hell are you doin'?

525
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,010
Get back to work.

526
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,950
That's my man.

527
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,720
You need to talk to him,
you talk to me first.

528
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,180
Last time I checked,

529
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,240
everyone here worked for
one person -- ma.

530
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,090
You actually like it, huh,
taking orders from a woman?

531
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,440
Was that how it was
in the bedroom with Kathy?

532
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,920
don't you talk about her.

533
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,120
She strap one on,
bend you over the bed,

534
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,250
and show you who's boss?

535
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,010
There's gonna be a reckoning
one day, brother.

536
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,050
All souls are called to account
for their actions.

537
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,950
In the end,

538
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,850
we all get what we deserve.

539
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,950
You keep
telling yourself that.

540
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,590
The eyes of all people
are upon us,

541
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,610
so that if we shall deal falsely
with our god

542
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,910
in this work
we have undertaken,

543
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,390
and so cause him to withdraw
his presence him from us,

544
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,510
we shall be made a story
and a byword

545
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,280
throughout the world.

546
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,910
A troubled and afflicted mankind
looks to us.

547
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,320
My friends, I believe
that you and I together

548
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,240
can keep this rendezvous
with destiny.

549
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,320
Thank you.

550
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,280
God bless you,
and god bless America.

551
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,580
Ooh.

552
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,440
Ooh, that's good.

553
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,950
Been holding it
since ortonville.

554
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,820
My wife puts this potpourri
in the bus toilet.

555
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,740
Can barely breathe in there.

556
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,090
They do like their scents.

557
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,410
Where'd you serve, son?

558
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,250
Um, mekong delta.

559
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,190
Swift boat patrol,
two tours.

560
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,240
Well, I sure appreciate
your service.

561
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,950
Every generation
has their time.

562
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,820
I remember back in '42,
America just joined the war.

563
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,440
I was working on, uh...

564
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,320
"Operation eagle's nest"
for Paramount.

565
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,110
I got dropped
behind enemy lines

566
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,950
trying to rescue Jimmy Whitmore
and laraine day

567
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,320
from this s.S. Commando.

568
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,580
Bob stack was on loan
from Selznick.

569
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,740
That Nazi bastard
had us cornered.

570
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,150
We were done for,
but in the end,

571
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,590
with a little
American ingenuity,

572
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,910
we managed to, uh...

573
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,310
Oh, no.
No, no, wait a minute. Um...

574
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,740
Come to think of it,

575
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,320
I don't think we made it out
of that one.

576
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,340
Or did we?

577
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,020
Oh, shit, I can't remember.

578
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,520
Well, either way,
it was a fine picture.

579
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,190
Um...

580
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,480
Um...

581
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,390
Governor,
I don't mean to, uh...

582
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,480
What we did over there,
the war?

583
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,740
Um...And now?

584
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,850
My wife's got lymphoma.
Uh, stage III.

585
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:18,990
And, uh, lately,
the state of things, uh...

586
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,040
Well, sometimes, I...
Late at night...

587
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,050
I wonder if maybe
the sickness of this world,

588
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,990
if it isn't inside my wife
somehow.

589
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,940
The -- the cancer.

590
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,320
I don't -- I don't know

591
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,380
what I'm saying, except...

592
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,210
Do you really think we'll get
out of this mess we're in?

593
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,250
Son, there's not a challenge
on god's earth

594
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,320
that can't be overcome
by an American.

595
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,980
I truly believe that.

596
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,110
Yeah.

597
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,590
But how?

598
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,990
Mommy.
Sorry.

599
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,480
Poppa's here.

600
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,940
Your dad is...
No.

601
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,920
No, just me.

602
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,950
Saw Molly in the window.

603
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,390
I knocked.

604
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,980
You, uh, you didn't hear?

605
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,640
No.

606
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,390
Well, got worried,
so I let myself in.

607
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,380
Mm.

608
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,740
You feeling okay?

609
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,390
Oh, sure.

610
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,890
Little tired.

611
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,980
Yeah. Just talked to Lou.
Probably got another two hours

612
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,810
on this Reagan detail...
Oh?

613
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,090
So I thought maybe I'd just
stop by and make a nuisance.

614
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,490
Are you -- are you hungry?
I-I can fix you somethin'

615
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,140
you're sweet.

616
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,250
I'm just now trying to decide
if I'm hungry

617
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,050
or if I want to throw up.

618
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,420
don't normally confuse
the two.

619
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,090
Well, nausea's a side effect
of this drug they gave me.

620
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Which would mean they actually
gave me the drug and not candy.

621
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,810
There's candy?

622
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,390
Eat something green,
and we'll talk.

623
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,140
So, we're, uh, rooting for
nausea there, huh?

624
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,490
Well, okay. Um...

625
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,850
I'm just all left thumbs
when it comes to this stuff.

626
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,290
Mm, you're doing great, dad.
No, I don't know about that.

627
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,980
Your mom were here,
she'd know just what to say.

628
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,710
Me?

629
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,350
I can fix the toaster.

630
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,150
Well, maybe just, uh...

631
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,220
Do you think maybe...
You could watch Molly for a bit?

632
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,310
I just don't --
I'm not sure

633
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,220
if I can keep my eyes open
right now...
Okay.

634
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,350
For some reason.

635
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,850
Watch who?

636
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,290
Me!

637
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,180
Who?
Me!

638
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,540
Well, what the heck?

639
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,850
Thank you, dad.

640
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,150
Hmm. Yeah, sure.
You get some rest.

641
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,550
We'll just be here, uh,
eatin' sugar cereal

642
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,720
and playing
with my service weapon.

643
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,220
What the heck is that?
A rhinoceros?

644
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,120
Yeah, it's Charlie.

645
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,690
I'm looking for dad.

646
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Well, is he --
when's he coming back?

647
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,750
No, that's --

648
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,880
J-just tell him that I'm --
I'm ready for school,

649
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,680
to go back.

650
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,110
I want to go, like he said.

651
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,220
Okay, then.

652
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,810
Ed!

653
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,590
Ed!

654
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:40,920
Oh, no! No!

655
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,040
Uhh!

656
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,540
Aah!

657
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,610
Noreen. Noreen, you okay?

658
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,820
You okay?
Come on. Come on.

659
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,050
Ed!

660
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,780
Ed!

661
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,190
Ed!

662
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,010
Ed! Come on!

663
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,350
Leave him.
No!

664
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,050
No, he's still alive.
We gotta take him.

665
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,390
Ed, please.
Okay.

666
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,690
Call the fire truck!

667
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,440
Ed, what happened?

668
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,250
I saved the kid, didn't I?

669
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,190
Didn't I?

670
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,540
Yeah.

671
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,520
And he shot first.
Can you tell the cops that?

672
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,920
And the big guy, he came at me,
and it was self-defense?

673
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,690
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.

674
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,110
Of course!

675
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,590
But...

676
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,340
But...Ed!

677
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,950
Ed!

678
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:03,840
Where you been?

679
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,570
I just met a-a friend.

680
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,020
Mm.

681
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,640
You think you're grown,
is that it?

682
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,880
What?

683
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,870
With your clothes
and your hair and no bra?

684
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:48,050
Like you know somethin'
about the world?

685
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,080
Being grown's got a price.

686
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,550
Kid gets slapped
when he's bad.

687
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,520
When you're grown,

688
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,710
you get the fist.

689
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,570
Or the knife.

690
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,680
Son.

691
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,340
You let that girl alone.

692
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,420
Get upstairs now, darling.

693
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,220
- Hon?
- Hon?

694
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,970
Hon, where's the luggage?
We need to pack.

695
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,820
Hon?

696
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,070
Hon, we -- we...
Hon?

697
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,420
Yeah, we -- we need --

698
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,740
I got a surprise for ya.

699
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,420
That's -- o-okay,
but we need to go.

700
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,570
No, we don't gotta go,
no, listen, I wanna talk to ya.

701
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,580
I been thinkin' a lot about what
you said and how I've been,

702
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,280
and -- and sit, sit.

703
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,580
No, this is important.

704
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,920
What I'm trying to say is,
you were right.

705
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,910
I mean, we were both right,
but -- but you also

706
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,740
is what I'm -- not just me,
in other words.

707
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,950
And -- and what you said
about the shop and the money,

708
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,220
that was -- it was selfish
of me to...

709
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:11,940
Without even askin'.

710
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:15,850
And also, we -- we gotta fight,
fight for what we want.

711
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,680
Okay, but --
you know, and I can
see that now, so...

712
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,480
Hon, hon.

713
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,120
Ta-da!

714
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,710
I...
I sold the car.

715
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,670
What car?
My car.

716
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,350
I-I went to the shop,
and -- and -- and Sonny,

717
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,520
you know, he said how much
he loved it, and so I...

718
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,540
And I-I know that, um,
I could have gotten more for it,

719
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,520
but it's enough
is what matters.

720
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,970
Enough to buy the shop...

721
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,320
Because you were right.

722
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:44,510
This was our dream, you know,
and so now...

723
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,970
Now we can do it.

724
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,020
The shop burned down.

725
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,310
What?

726
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:53,810
And I killed another fella,
maybe two.

727
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,840
And Lou...
Lou was right.

728
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,680
They came. They came.

729
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,780
The other fella that you hit,
his family? They -- they came.

730
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,780
Oh.
So this is...

731
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,950
That's great.
You know, thank you.

732
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:06,880
But...We gotta go.

733
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,680
You need to pack.
Okay? Okay?

734
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,150
Okay, okay.
