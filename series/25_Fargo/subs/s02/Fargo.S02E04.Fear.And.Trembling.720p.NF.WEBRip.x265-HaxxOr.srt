<i>of the state
and defense department,</i>

10
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:45,914

Man:

<i>is now experiencing strange
astronomical phenomena.</i>

15
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>Reports have come in

00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,614
<i>of inexplicable objects

17
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,081
Got to check you, Otto.

18
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:08,780
Man ♪2:
<i>Surely you're not telling me</i>

19
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,181
<i>a scientist like yourself
believes such nonsense?</i>

20
00:01:11,182 --> 00:01:12,781
<i>No, I'm not telling you that.</i>

21
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:28,947
Dodd.

22
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:31,281
Like the heads of easter island.

23
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,814
What?

24
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:34,915
Not a sound.

25
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,681
Cheech says
we're going to the moon.

26
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,514
You and cheech?

27
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,514
No, you moron...
America.

28
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:54,847
I told him,
"don't be stupid."

29
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,014
We got too many gooks to kill.

30
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:02,014
That mao zedung thinks
he's gonna run the whole show,

31
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:03,548
be king of the world.

32
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:05,381
Is that what you want?

33
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:08,880
Be king like your dad?
Sit on<i> my</i> throne?

34
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:12,047
The way I see it,
you're on<i> his</i> throne.

35
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,880
Hey, kill the king, be the king.

36
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,081
That's the world.

37
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:20,082
If you're feeling sour about it,
write a letter to Napoleon.

38
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:27,047
Or maybe you've come
to get your revenge.

39
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,980
Me? Nah.

40
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,247
I just want a seat at the table.

41
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,314
Ain't no table.

42
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,814
There's me.

43
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:39,047
Everybody else sits
on the floor.

44
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:40,980
So, what are you waiting for?

45
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,980
Sit, avert your eyes.

46
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,081
<i>What purpose?</i>

47
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,347
Woman:
<i>Careful, father!</i>

48
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,581
<i>Look, the light went out.</i>

49
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,649
I love this part.

50
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:58,147
Stupid to bring your kid.

51
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:01,147
The boy's got to learn
how men are.

52
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,780
Yeah.

53
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,261
But it's the last lesson
he'll ever...

54
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,614
Dodd.

55
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,947
Dodd.

56
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:34,315
Dodd!

57
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,714
Thought hanzee goes with you
on jobs?

58
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,481
Half-breed's in Luverne,
looking for your uncle.

59
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:47,648
You're what, 15 now?

60
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,381
17.

61
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:52,281
Small for your age.

62
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,714
And, what, your dad wants you

63
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:56,847
to be some kind of...
Professional?

64
00:03:56,848 --> 00:03:59,614
You know, a lawyer probably.

65
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,181
Yeah. Suppose we could use
a lawyer.

66
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,047
That what you want, though?

67
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,548
Punch a clock?

68
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,181
Always thought I could do
what you do.

69
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,980
Ha ha! Bust heads?

70
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,880
How's that work with one arm?

71
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,381
I can shoot a gun.

72
00:04:14,382 --> 00:04:18,114
Yeah, but... What happens
when you need to reload?

73
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,382
I'll show you.
Pull over.

74
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:23,281
Pull over.

75
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:25,848
Okay, "wild bill."
How's this work?

76
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:42,314
Ready?

77
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,449
Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,247
Look at you.

79
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,614
So? What do you need me
to do?

80
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:05,415
Get in the car, tough guy.

00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,348

It's on them.

109
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:06,814
Dr. emilious:
Well, it's a war.

110
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:08,814
Nixon declared it.

111
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,814
The war on cancer.

112
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:13,014
As long as it's not a war on me.

113
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,880
No, no,
it's not a war against you.

114
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,648
It's a war against your body.

115
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,847
Well,
that doesn't sound, um...
our...
our doctor said that...

116
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:25,314
That's, uh, uh, uh,
Dr. gerber?

117
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:29,980
Mm-hmm.
Right, Dr. gerber said
few weeks of chemo.

118
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,980
He said
they caught it early.
Mm-hmm.

119
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,880
Uh, and he thought
a few weeks of chemo and...

120
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,914
Well, he thought
she'd be out of the woods.

121
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,880
Your blood work
and your x-rays,

122
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:41,915
these are not,
as they say, good.

123
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,980
I'm getting worse.

124
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:50,648
Well, if by worse
you mean the cancer's
spreading, then... Yes.

125
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,648
But there is a trial,
clinical trial,

126
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,147
that, uh, might be beneficial.

127
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:58,047
Yeah.

128
00:07:58,048 --> 00:07:59,281
Yeah, of course.

129
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:01,214
Mm-hmm.
We'll try anything.

130
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,780
It's a new drug.

131
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,581
Let's call it "xanadu."

132
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,448
Is that its name?

133
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,281
No, that... that's just
what they're calling it

134
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:10,147
for the trial.

135
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:13,281
This drug, xanadu, it...
It has shown promise.

136
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,581
And I'll be getting that drug...

137
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,814
As part of the trial?

138
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,714
Yes.
That or a placebo.

139
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:23,980
A placebo? Um...

140
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,980
Uh, yeah, I don't understand.

141
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:30,081
You see, in order to ascertain
the effectiveness of a drug,

142
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:32,947
it has to be judged
in a controlled setting

143
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,880
against an equal number
of patients

144
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,747
that are not getting the drug.

145
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:40,648
And those patients, the ones not
getting the drug, they get...

146
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,081
Well, it's like a smartie.

147
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:43,914
You know smarties.

148
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,481
Well, hold on.
I'm confused.

149
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:49,047
You said Betsy would be
part of the trial, so...

150
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:53,815
Am I getting the real drug
or the fake drug?

151
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,847
That I can't say.

152
00:08:57,848 --> 00:09:00,282
Shall I sign you up?

153
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,515
Ed:
Oh, okay, I'm close.

154
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:31,282
Geez.
It's happening.

155
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,780
That one stuck for sure.

156
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,281
Peggy: Ed.
Yeah?

157
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,814
I got to pee.

158
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,381
Oh. Sure.

159
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,548
Oh.

160
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,780
Pbht!

161
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,347
Pbht!

162
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,681
Might just have ourselves
a fall baby if we're...

163
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:05,981
I mean, can you imagine,
you, me, and a baby?

164
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:11,880
And I'll buy the shop and...

165
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,282
And we'll live
like three pigs in a blanket.

166
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,047
Ed: Probably need
more space, though.

167
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:29,847
What's that, hon?

168
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:31,947
Bigger house.

169
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:39,047
Not right away, of course,
but, I mean, if we have two,

170
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:44,481
let's say a boy and a girl,
then they'll need their own...

171
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:49,082
You know,
a yard if we get a dog.

172
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,915
Anyway, might have to wait
on that seminar.

173
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,748
What?

174
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,614
Yeah, I thought about it,
and, uh...

175
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,414
We just can't afford it
right now, not with the...

176
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,947
Buying the butcher shop.

177
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:10,880
It's $500.

178
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:13,914
I mean, unless we find
a cheaper one.

179
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:16,014
A cheaper course?

180
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,347
Yeah.

181
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:20,081
Well, what,
so I can be a less-good me?

182
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,747
What? N-no.

183
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,548
I...

184
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,415
I-i-I'm saying...

185
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:33,947
on... on the list
of priorities...

186
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:38,281
You know, th-this is our future,
the shop,

187
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,780
and, you know,
all that other stuff...

188
00:11:40,781 --> 00:11:42,214
The knittin' class or...

189
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,014
It's not a knittin' class.

190
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:47,114
It's gonna help me reach
my full potential.

191
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,747
Of course, and I know that.

192
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:53,314
But, hon, you're so great now,

193
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:56,015
I'm not sure if I could handle
it if you got any better.

194
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:05,081
Well...

195
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:08,181
Better get dressed, yeah.

196
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:11,780
Now that we got
all that mess cleaned up,

197
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:14,815
today's the first day
of the rest of our lives.

198
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,024
Help ya?

199
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,791
Got some cars for sale
around back.

200
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,624
This one's a repair.

201
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:04,557
'65 corvair... "light-handed,
light-footed, lighthearted."

202
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:05,992
I'm not sure what that means.

203
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,390
Oh, uh, no.

204
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,024
Can't have ya looking inside.

205
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,524
See, I'm entrusted

206
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:15,891
with the safety of
the customer's effects, so...

207
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:20,724
It's part of the,
uh, code, so...

208
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,223
Excuse me. All right?

209
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:26,391
That's, uh... like I said,
what's for sale's outside.

210
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,824
He known to you?

211
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,323
Oh, ed? Yeah.
Yeah, he's the butcher.

212
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:35,824
I mean, uh... No.

213
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,223
Uh, no, no.

214
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,724
Never seen him before.

215
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:40,690
Butcher where?

216
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,457
All right, see, that's...

217
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,891
Now you got me thinking you're
up to some shady doings, mister.

218
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:48,858
And, uh... all right.

219
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:53,223
Look,
i-i was in 'nam, yeah?

220
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:55,090
Out there, they called me
"mad dog,"

221
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,857
so you just...
You watch your, uh...

222
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,190
Do you miss it?

223
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,857
What?

224
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,924
Well,
the... the country...

225
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:06,690
You know, the wet, the heat,
the bugs?

226
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,024
Do you miss that?

227
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:09,390
God, no.

228
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,390
It's this quiet
i can't get used to,

229
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:15,123
this...
Frozen winter.

230
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:18,457
Yeah, well...
Can't argue with ya.

231
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,590
Did you work the tunnels?

232
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:24,424
The...

233
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:27,257
"send the Indian," they'd say.

234
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:31,123
"Who cares about booby traps?

235
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,090
Give hanzee a flashlight
and a knife

236
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:36,457
and send him down
into the black echo."

237
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,524
Moving through the earth
like a rat,

238
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,490
killing off Charlie,
taking his ears...

239
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:43,924
Ears?

240
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:46,157
You got to push their faces down
into the dirt

241
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:48,024
so they don't scream
and wake the others.

242
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:51,424
Karl: Whoo!

243
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:55,324
Where on god's green earth
do you keep the plunger?

244
00:16:56,858 --> 00:17:00,190
Is there a problem here, Sonny?

245
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:03,690
I don't know.
'Course you don't.

246
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,323
Friend, is there a problem?

247
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:07,524
He's got a knife, Karl.

248
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,257
Yeah, Sonny, i got eyes.

249
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:12,858
I said, do we got a problem?

250
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,924
He seemed real angry.
Yeah, I got that part.

251
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:32,757
Any other Einstein insights
you can share with me?

252
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:36,157
An Indian...
I think.

253
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:38,323
Get the phone, kid.

254
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:41,857
We'd better alert
the local constable.

255
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:44,024
The...?
The sheriff, you idiot.

256
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:45,825
Yeah. Okay.

257
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:36,180
Surprised me there at the end...
Your finger.

258
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,613
You like that?

259
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:42,614
Didn't say I liked it.
Said you surprised me.

260
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:50,014
You got that bump, then?

261
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm worried your family's

262
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,546
gonna go the wrong way
on this thing.

263
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,913
Floyd's smart.
She'll take the money.

264
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:12,746
And what about your dad?

265
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:14,913
Him?

266
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:18,181
You probably got to kill him.

267
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,447
And you're okay with that?

268
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:27,379
You know what depresses me?

269
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:34,280
I missed the '60s...
Free love, drop acid, Woodstock.

270
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:35,880
Wake up one day,

271
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:39,280
decide you want to call yourself
flower rainblossom,

272
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:43,013
you just call yourself
flower rainblossom.

273
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,213
Yeah, but the '70s
were always coming,

274
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:48,613
like a...
What do you...

275
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,847
A hangover.

276
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,714
And you know what happened
to flower rainblossom?

277
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,846
She's on methadone in bismark,

278
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:09,181
turning tricks
for breakfast meat.

279
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,746
I know.

280
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:19,947
But at least I would've
had fun, be free...

281
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,714
Like how you get to dream
before you wake up.

282
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:30,846
I saw the Indian
left town yesterday.

283
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,379
Hanzee?

284
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,646
Dad sent him to find Rye.

285
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:38,446
He shot a judge, i heard.

286
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:43,113
So he's either hiding out now
or dead.

287
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:46,947
Either way,
could be gone for good.

288
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,346
You're boring me.

289
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,113
I thought
we were gonna have some fun.

290
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:56,113
We had fun, darling.

291
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:59,114
How I know is I can still feel
your finger in my ass.

292
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:03,281
That was my thumb.

293
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,780
So,
the sit-down today,

294
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:10,813
you think Floyd says yes...

295
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,147
Takes the deal?

296
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:17,180
What I hear,
she's got a compromise.

297
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:21,479
Give some, keep some.

298
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,613
Is that Otto's idea?

299
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:26,946
Grandpa? No.

300
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:28,913
He's a legume.

301
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,646
They're taking him
to the doctor later,

302
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:33,413
see if they can stop
the droolin'.

303
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:36,680
Is that right?
Mm.

304
00:21:36,681 --> 00:21:38,347
Which doctor?

305
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:16,080
Thought I'd take Molly
ice fishing this weekend.

306
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:17,579
Mm.

307
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,513
Bring something more
than just jerky this time.

308
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:22,646
That's what my dad brought.

309
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:27,047
Yeah, but she's 6,
and she's a girl.

310
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:29,547
Gonna have to learn this stuff.

311
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:34,480
Hey, so...

312
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:39,413
Should I be, uh...
I don't know...

313
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:42,213
Uh, treating you any different?

314
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:44,646
Please don't.

315
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:46,379
Well, you let me know.

316
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,747
Mm-hmm.

317
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,714
Better get inside
and take my sugar pills.

318
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:59,413
Dispatch:
State car 18, come back. Over.

319
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,280
Uh... That's me.

320
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:03,379
Yeah, I know.

321
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,780
Go.

322
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:06,580
I'll be fine.

323
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:19,913
Indian buck...
Had like a rat face.

324
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,913
Didn't much like
the look of him.

325
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:24,446
Scared me...
A little.

326
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:25,980
Sorry.

327
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:28,313
Took Betsy to a specialist.

328
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:30,047
And?

329
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,446
Uh, well, uh, there's a trial...

330
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,780
Um, clinical.

331
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:40,646
New drug, so, uh,
we signed up for that.

332
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:42,680
Okay.
What'd I miss here?

333
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,113
Uh, well, uh...

334
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:48,213
This... this Indian fella
put a scare to Sonny.

335
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:51,680
Luckily, Karl was nearby,
stressin' the plumbing.

336
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,047
Scared the Indian off.

337
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:56,213
What was he doing exactly,
this, uh, Indian?

338
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:57,780
Well, I found him
out here in the bay,

339
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,213
looking over Ed's car...
Seemed real interested.

340
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:01,213
Ed renner?

341
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:02,479
No, ed blumquist...

342
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,813
You know,
works bud's butcher shop.

343
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:05,680
Yeah.
Wife's car,
technically.

344
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:08,048
Got some front-end damage
you can see.

345
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:15,047
As in...
Front-end damage

346
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:16,980
like the kind you get
running down a gunman

347
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:19,013
who just shot up three people
at the waffle hut?

348
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,880
The what now?

349
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:24,680
Uh, no, no, this was,
uh, from an accident yesterday.

350
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:26,379
Bluth took the report.

351
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,147
Said the blumquists hit a tree
off ice patch junction,

352
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:33,479
tree branch went through
the window...

353
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Lucky the wife wasn't killed.

354
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:40,513
Hit it coming and going?

355
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,680
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

356
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,913
Sonny: Peggy said
garage door bit her in the back.

357
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:48,880
But I, uh, found bits of wood
in the bumper, so...

358
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:53,213
Not saying she's lying,
but, you know, uh...

359
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:55,713
Ed: Hey.
Burning it
at both ends, huh?

360
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,681
Uh, yeah.

361
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:04,414
You gonna get that?

362
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,847
Yeah.

363
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:11,609
Thank you for sitting with me
here today

364
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,109
and for giving us time
to consider your offer.

365
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,743
I've asked the bank
to arbitrate as neutral party.

366
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:20,742
Whatever makes you comfortable.

367
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:21,877
This is your town.

368
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:24,876
Where's Mr. Milligan?

369
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:28,043
Another matter,
back in Kansas City.

370
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,742
So, we've given you 48 hours
to consider.

371
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:34,009
Do we have a deal?

372
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,509
No.

373
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,976
But I have a counteroffer,
a respectful one.

374
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:43,476
Instead of a straight sale,
us to you,

375
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,943
we pay you $1 million cash money

376
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:51,043
plus 20% of our territory
in Minnesota.

377
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,876
We also discount
transportation fees

378
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:57,442
on all Kansas City merchandise,
25% for the first 5 years.

379
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,876
In exchange,

380
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:03,976
we retain full control
of our remaining operations...

381
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:08,109
The Gerhardt family
still runs north Dakota

382
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,776
but with Kansas City.

383
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:18,442
Partnership, not a sale...
That's our offer to you.

384
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:20,276
And we believe
it's more than fair.

385
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:24,476
I see.

386
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,810
Now...

387
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:30,776
I don't know.

388
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:33,843
Maybe, when you look at me,
you see an old woman,

389
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:36,709
and I am 61.

390
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,409
I've borne six children,
had three miscarriages.

391
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,342
Two of my sons are here today.

392
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:46,509
Two were stillborn.

393
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,742
My firstborn, elron,
killed in Korea...

394
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:56,576
Gook sniper
took off half his head.

395
00:27:56,577 --> 00:27:59,609
The point is...

396
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,175
don't assume, just because
I'm an old woman,

397
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:08,242
that my back is weak
and my stomach's not strong.

398
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:11,943
I make this counter because a
deal is always better than war.

399
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:14,676
But no mistake...

400
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:18,543
We'll fight to keep what's ours
to the last man.

401
00:28:22,376 --> 00:28:25,576
You're a good woman.

402
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:27,709
I wish I'd known your husband.

403
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,342
No.

404
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:31,342
My husband would've killed you
where you stood

405
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,676
the first time you met.

406
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:37,009
So be glad
you're talking to his wife.

407
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,443
And that's what I'm glad for.

408
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:48,776
And if it were up to me,
i would take your counter...

409
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,943
Partner up...

410
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:55,076
Except I got to admit,
i-i just wonder,

411
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:59,242
if we make this deal,
split the territory,

412
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:01,409
we move in,

413
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,609
can you guarantee
your boys will abide?

414
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,742
My sons listen to their mother.

415
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:10,109
Good.

416
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,009
Okay.

417
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,476
Except here are two of my men

418
00:29:16,477 --> 00:29:20,442
assaulted just this morning in
the appropriation of doughnuts

419
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:22,909
by your oldest...

420
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,109
Attacked in peacetime,

421
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,642
during a period of deliberation,

422
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:31,142
without provocation.

423
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:32,909
Oh, I was provoked.

424
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,976
Hush.

425
00:29:33,977 --> 00:29:36,476
My sons will abide.

426
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:38,909
Ah, s-s-see,
that... that...

427
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,342
That's the problem
with a family business.

428
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:47,142
Now, if one of my men defies me,
puts a deal in jeopardy,

429
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:49,342
I take his arm.

430
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:52,509
If he talks out of turn,
i take his tongue.

431
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,742
But you... your children,
your grandchildren...

432
00:29:56,743 --> 00:30:01,342
What are you willing to do
to show us you're committed?

433
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,943
I'll deal with my son.

434
00:30:03,944 --> 00:30:05,442
This partnership will hold.

435
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,309
Oh, come on, you're gonna
let this guy come here

436
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,843
and disrespect us,
disrespect pop?
Floyd: Quiet!

437
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:12,776
Bunch of fruits in ties
and pocket protectors.
Take him out now!

438
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,609
I'll pick my teeth
with you.
Take him out!

439
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,476
I'll pick my freakin' teeth
with you!

440
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:17,844
Get off me!

441
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,809
I apologize.

442
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,242
He's a proud man.

443
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:31,442
His father built an empire,
and he just wants what's his.

444
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:33,676
He'll fall into line.

445
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:35,409
No.

446
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,710
I don't think he will.

447
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,877
Hold up.

448
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,143
Who's the dumbass?

449
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:08,309
Go around to the passenger seat.

450
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,210
Slide across.

451
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,676
Hurry up.

452
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,877
Yeah, yeah.

453
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:01,576
Ollie:
Well, what's the holdup?

454
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:03,610
Think maybe I flooded it.

455
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,044
Take him inside! Go!

456
00:32:47,543 --> 00:32:50,977
Joe bulo says hi.

457
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,081
Your counter has been rejected,

458
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:26,914
and now we're lowering our price
by $2 million.

459
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:30,114
But because I respect you
and your family,

460
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:32,448
I'm gonna give you the night
to think it over.

461
00:33:32,449 --> 00:33:35,848
Anything other than
unconditional surrender,

462
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,948
and we'll wipe
every last Gerhardt

463
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,915
off the face of the earth.

464
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:07,360
Hiya, bud.

465
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:09,793
Bud: Where the heck
did<i> you</i> go yesterday?

466
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:12,693
Yeah. I, uh...
I'm real sorry about that.

467
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:16,693
Peg had a kind of...
Emergency, and, you know? Yeah.

468
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:20,527
Well... You know that check
you gave me

469
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:21,759
for the down payment?

470
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,093
Yeah.

471
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,060
Yeah, it bounced.

472
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,593
No, that's not...

473
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:31,093
I-i checked the account
myself.

474
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:32,826
Bud, I got the funds.

475
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:34,593
Well, i don't know about that.

476
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,959
It's just the check you gave me
didn't clear.

477
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,093
So, you know, there's this
other buyer up in sleepy eye,

478
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:44,193
wants to be closer
to his sick mother.

479
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:48,260
Yeah, he offered
more than you and...

480
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:50,326
I'm moving to Florida so...

481
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:52,026
B-bud, no.

482
00:34:52,027 --> 00:34:54,026
I got the funds.

483
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:56,026
Yeah, just let me call
over there,

484
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,260
straighten this thing out.

485
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,293
Yeah, so, it's Tuesday.

486
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:03,093
Figure we'd agree Friday.

487
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:04,793
If you don't got the money,

488
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:08,926
I'll go ahead and sell to him,
the other buyer.

489
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:11,361
Like I said,
he's up in sleepy eye.

490
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,993
Take a look at that grinder,
will you?

491
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,794
It's making a funny noise.

492
00:35:27,194 --> 00:35:30,060
Geez, hon.
Where's your coat?

493
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,393
Hon, did... did you...

494
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:35,693
We talked about this.

495
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:38,727
Yeah, we... didn't w...
Didn't we talk about this?

496
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:47,160
What happened?
Something with the car?

497
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:48,726
Did they find blood?
The car... no, no.

498
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:52,826
This is about the shop, yeah?

499
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:55,593
And... and we...
We shook on it, bud and me.

500
00:35:55,594 --> 00:35:58,726
I-i wrote a check
for the down payment,

501
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,759
and... and now
i-i-I'm hearing...
Hon.

502
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,560
That... he said
the check bounced...

503
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:05,893
Insufficient funds.

504
00:36:05,894 --> 00:36:08,093
So I call over there, and...

505
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:11,527
W-we agreed, right?

506
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:13,093
W-well, we never...
I thought...

507
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:16,527
You told me, but I never...

508
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,060
Well, now there...

509
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:19,427
There's another buyer
up in sleepy eye,

510
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,226
and he's gonna get the shop.

511
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:23,427
Well, he can't do that.
You shook on it.

512
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:28,826
Yeah, but the check bounced...
Insufficient funds.

513
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:32,160
We talked about this.

514
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,726
Well, if you mean
y-you talked

515
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:39,126
and then I also talked,
then, yeah, I guess.

516
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,794
But not really sure
you heard anything I said.
Yeah, I...

517
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:01,660
Hon, I'm sorry.

518
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:02,826
I am.

519
00:37:02,827 --> 00:37:04,560
But, you know, this course,

520
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:09,793
the one I've been
telling you about, lifespring,

521
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,993
it's real important.

522
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:14,593
Yeah, more important
than the shop?

523
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:16,893
Maybe?

524
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:19,160
I mean, to<i> me.</i>

525
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:21,226
Well...

526
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:24,326
Y-you got to get the money back
right away.

527
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,126
I mean, just call them
and tell them you're sorry,

528
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:28,826
but... but you need the money
for...

529
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:30,560
Ed, it's...

530
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:33,393
'cause on Friday he sells
to the fella up in sleepy eye,

531
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:37,126
and then we're...
We're s...

532
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,960
Screwed.

533
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,660
Constance:
Everything okay?

534
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,660
I need the money back
for the course.

535
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,026
Sent that on already.

536
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:48,793
I need it back!

537
00:37:48,794 --> 00:37:50,460
Ed says we could lose the shop.

538
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,460
Oh, ed says?
Well, then, stop the presses.

539
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:55,460
Come here.

540
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:57,126
Sit down.

541
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:59,859
I...

542
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,893
Look in that mirror, hon.

543
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:03,894
Tell me what you see.

544
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:07,493
I don't know. A girl?

545
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,226
You get your period?

546
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:10,793
Then what girl?

547
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:14,793
That's a woman... a strong,
beautiful, vibrant woman.

548
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:17,193
And no man should be able
to tell you what to do,

549
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,293
not with your body
or your money.

550
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:21,293
How much i been paying you here?

551
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:23,826
$600 a month.
And you've been saving.

552
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:25,493
Ed and I put away
one-third every week,

553
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:26,959
minus the occasional...

554
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,093
So $200, and you gave me $500
for the course,

555
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:32,893
so that's 2h months' savings,
your money,

556
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,527
for you to spend as<i> you</i> please.

557
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:37,593
But I get it.

558
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:39,427
It's what we do.

559
00:38:39,428 --> 00:38:41,893
We surrender our needs
to the needs of men

560
00:38:41,894 --> 00:38:43,959
to our great detriment.

561
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,759
But no more.
Say it with me.

562
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,427
No more.
No more.

563
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:49,726
That's right.

564
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,060
You're gonna go to sioux falls,

565
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:52,793
and you're gonna take
this course,

566
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:57,460
and you're gonna be the best
Peggy blumquist you can be,

567
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:02,927
and no one's ever gonna tell ya
how to live your life again.

568
00:42:58,756 --> 00:43:01,523
What the heck?

569
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:24,656
Ooh.

570
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:34,089
You need to invite me in.

571
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:43,054
I could make some coffee.

572
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:45,955
Uh, none for me, thanks.

573
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:56,755
I saw your car at the shop.

574
00:43:56,756 --> 00:43:59,555
Yeah, I slipped on some ice
on the way to work.

575
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:00,988
My fault, really.

576
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:03,255
I was going on about something.

577
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:07,788
Ran right off the road
into a... Tree.

578
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:10,422
Lucky Peggy wasn't killed,
you know.

579
00:44:11,756 --> 00:44:14,222
Hmm.

580
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,489
Something wrong?

581
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:23,989
No, i-i just...

582
00:44:26,022 --> 00:44:27,522
I'm sorry.

583
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:29,656
Uh, come in, sit down, please.

584
00:44:31,889 --> 00:44:35,021
I want to be clear
about something.

585
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:39,355
I can help, but you
got to be straight with me.

586
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:41,556
Well, what, uh...

587
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:48,555
If I check the car,
the interior,

588
00:44:48,556 --> 00:44:50,788
I'm not gonna find blood?

589
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:52,221
Oh.

590
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,188
Well, ed hurt his neck...

591
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,656
That's why I got the...
But no blood.

592
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:01,054
You didn't fight, did you, ed...
In the war?

593
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,988
No, sir.

594
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:05,888
4-f on account
i got the one kidney.

595
00:45:05,889 --> 00:45:08,555
So...

596
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:11,355
There's a look a boy gets
when he's been shot

597
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:15,622
or a... or a land mine
takes off his legs,

598
00:45:15,623 --> 00:45:18,655
and he's laying there
in the mud, trying to get up,

599
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:22,021
'cause he doesn't feel it yet.

600
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:25,255
I, uh, don't...
his... his brain hasn't
caught up with the reality,

601
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:29,722
which is...
He's already dead.

602
00:45:29,723 --> 00:45:31,421
Ed.

603
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:34,755
He's scaring me.

604
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:39,054
But we see it, the rest of us.

605
00:45:39,055 --> 00:45:43,054
And we lie.

606
00:45:43,055 --> 00:45:48,523
We say, "lay still.
You're gonna be fine."

607
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,522
If you'd been to war,
you'd know the look.

608
00:45:54,523 --> 00:45:59,788
See, you and Peggy,
you got the look.

609
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:02,255
You still think it's Tuesday.

610
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:06,954
You have no idea what's coming.

611
00:46:06,955 --> 00:46:09,421
Lou, I'm...

612
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:11,755
Really trying to be straight
with you here.

613
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:13,888
We hit some ice.
And...

614
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:16,622
That's all. I mean,
it could've happened to anyone.

615
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:18,188
Ed wasn't even speeding.

616
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:21,388
That man you hit,
his name was Rye Gerhardt.

617
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:24,256
Hit a tree...
We told ya.

618
00:46:26,189 --> 00:46:29,954
I-i mean, we were arguing,
and ed turned his head.

619
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,255
It happened in a flash.

620
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:34,788
Rye Gerhardt.

621
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:38,255
And his family hurts people
for money.

622
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:40,488
And they're coming.

623
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:43,155
May be here already.

624
00:46:43,156 --> 00:46:48,921
And my point is
'cause I'm tired of talking...

625
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:52,255
If you did something, you made
a mistake, you panicked,

626
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:56,088
maybe covered it up, now is
the time to say... right now.

627
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:58,622
'Cause we can still fix this.

628
00:46:58,623 --> 00:47:02,954
But if I'm right,
that window's closing,

629
00:47:02,955 --> 00:47:06,289
and you may already be dead.

630
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:15,155
Look...

631
00:47:15,156 --> 00:47:17,622
This is...

632
00:47:17,623 --> 00:47:19,288
You're out of line.

00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:22,488

but we're asking you to leave.

Is that true, ed?

637

Ed? Is that true?
You asking me to leave?

00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:41,422
You know, Lou, that's probably
for the best, yeah.

639
