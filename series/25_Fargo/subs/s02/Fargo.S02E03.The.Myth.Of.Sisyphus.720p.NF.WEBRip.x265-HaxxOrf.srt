1
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,767
My husband wants
to thank you for coming.

2
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:12,334
Of course. We know what side
of the bread gets buttered.

3
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,201
We know how
to butter bread!

4
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,467
You don't have to yell.
He's not deaf.

5
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:18,834
Oh, I -- I didn't --

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,900
what's wrong
with him, then?

7
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,834
-He had a stroke.
-A mild stroke.

8
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,334
He can't walk or talk.

9
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:28,201
For now, he can't.

10
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:29,900
One day, though.

11
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,967
He's still...
Same lion inside.

12
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,234
But until he's better,
you talk to me.

13
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,800
Bear: That's right.

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,734
Talk to ma.

15
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,167
She's in charge.

16
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:48,067
Also, we want to thank you
for your cards and letters.

17
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,967
Are you kidding me?
Cards and letters?

18
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:52,533
We're in a state of siege,
and you're talking about --
boys.

19
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,234
You know about the offer
on the table?

20
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:56,967
Floyd: Kansas City?

21
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:59,301
The money's good,
you know?

22
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:01,034
More than fair.

23
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,367
Sure, but what they don't
tell you is after you sign,

24
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,201
they take your balls
with a straight razor

25
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,834
and fatten you up
like a housecat.

26
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,734
-Language.
-Give me a break.

27
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm saying --
this is our business.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,567
We built it
with blood and muscle.

29
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,934
It's earned.

30
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,700
And you can't just
write a check --

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,067
-this family has been --
-you can't just write a check.

32
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,767
Floyd: This family has been a
peace-time family since Kennedy.

33
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,400
You think we just,
out of the blue,

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,034
pick up our guns
and it's high noon?

35
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,900
We're talking about
the Kansas City mafia.

36
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,800
They're like all the sharks
in the sea.

37
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,767
And we're...

38
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:41,101
Let's be honest,
we're small-time.

39
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,034
"Know thyself."

40
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:47,834
What are you on about?

41
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:51,600
It's in the Bible.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,633
I'm saying we hit 'em
and hit 'em hard.

43
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,367
Otherwise, wither and die.
Right, pop?

44
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,301
Look, it's not
just the business.

45
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,734
It's the country.

46
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,734
This no-brains Jimmy Carter
with his stupid peanut grin,

47
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,267
and now I got to wait in line
to fill my tank?

48
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,201
Dodd: Exactly.
Where does it end?

49
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,301
Enough -- all of you.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,201
It may be we have to fight,
and I'm not afraid of a war.

51
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm not.

52
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,700
But on my terms --
as a last resort.

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
So I need to know now --

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,267
are you with me?

55
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:43,700
Well, look.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,301
We talked.

57
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:48,000
And we're not saying
"yes, we're going to war."

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,201
But we recognize
promises were made

59
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:56,201
in blood,
generations ago.

60
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,400
What he's saying is

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,334
we're not gonna make
the first move.

62
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:08,201
But if these Kansas City mooks
come at you shootin',

63
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,967
we'll cut the goddamn nose
off their face.

64
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,034
Uh-huh.

65
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:30,500
Late.

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,067
Sorry.

67
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,700
Couldn't get the shampoo
out of my hair.

68
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,201
Soft water.

69
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,600
Say what?

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,334
This goddamn northern water.

71
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,700
It's slick to the touch.

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,467
I thought
it was the shampoo.

74
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,767
It could be that, too.

75
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,400
I always carry my own.

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,900
Agree.

77
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,433
Agree to what?

78
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,101
That's the brand --
agree.

79
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:02,433
No additives. It works --
hard water or soft.

80
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,667
Feel my hair.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,101
Yeah, that's nice.

82
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,400
So update's this --

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,301
nothing on the Gerhardt frau
as to "yes" or "no".

84
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,234
I didn't expect it,
but still.

85
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:20,800
Research thinks
that they'll stall, then pass.

86
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
So we kill 'em.

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,734
Maybe.

88
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:26,800
If the market says kill 'em,
we kill 'em.

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,301
The market says
offer more money,

90
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,633
we offer more money.

91
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:32,134
Whatever the pluses
and minuses dictate.

92
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:38,934
And on the Gerhardt kid --
this Rye?

93
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,433
Get this.

94
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:44,567
He gunned down a judge --
some small hick town

95
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,567
a couple hours south
from here -- then disappeared.

96
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:51,334
On the run now,
we're thinking.

97
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,400
On the run is good.

98
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,301
On the run we can use.

99
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,633
Find him.
You, not them.

100
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,533
Then he's leverage
over the frau,

101
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,301
and maybe turn things
our way

102
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,400
without buying a bunch
of extra bullets.

103
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:23,201
Dispatcher: Car 18, over.

104
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,633
This is 18.
Over.

105
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,834
I got the rock county sheriff
on the line.

106
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,467
Hold. Over.

107
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:32,067
Hank:
Went by the house.

108
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,467
Betsy says you're up
in Fargo.

109
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,067
Yeah, I went to see about
our judge's caseload.

110
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,734
Maybe there's a connection
to our shooter. Over.

111
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,667
Well, I'm callin'
'cause we got a print match

112
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,334
off of that gun you found.

113
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:49,034
Right index belonged
to one Rye Gerhardt,

114
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,433
which, I looked up,

115
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,934
is the youngest male heir

116
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,433
to that Gerhardt syndicate
out of Fargo.

117
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,734
You don't say.

118
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,367
Over.

119
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,067
Yup, so there's that.

120
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,533
Okay, well, I'll mention that
to Fargo pd.

121
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:10,201
Uh, I'll probably be back
late tonight, though.

122
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:13,134
You want to tell Betsy
not to wait up for me? Over.

123
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:15,067
Okay, then.

124
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,567
Sounds good.
Over.

125
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,967
Over and out, I guess.

126
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,567
How ya doing?

127
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,600
You know, waitin'.

128
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,301
Lou Solverson,
Minnesota state police.

129
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:45,301
I drove up from Luverne.

130
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,201
Ben Schmidt.

131
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,834
Forensics is inside.

132
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,834
Ah.

133
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:54,367
Takin' their time.

134
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,800
Yeah.

135
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:03,934
Heard the crime scene
was a deal.

136
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,367
Mm.

137
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:08,034
I'm working things
up here.

138
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:13,834
Thought maybe tomorrow,
I'd drive down, take a look.

139
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:16,433
You're welcome to.

140
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,800
Or I can send ya the photos.
They're pretty thorough.

141
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,301
Three dead,
including the judge.

142
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:23,700
Fry cook and a waitress,
also.

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,433
Shot multiple times.

144
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,533
Got the prints back
on the gun just before.

145
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,000
Rye Gerhardt.

146
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,767
That bad, huh?

147
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,267
I'm not saying
your life would be easier

148
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,000
if it was your own prints
on the gun,

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
but that's the lines along
which you should be thinkin'.

150
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,533
Distribution, right?
Gerhardts?

151
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,433
Yeah.

152
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,201
Dieter --
that's Otto's dad --

153
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,533
started running booze
during prohibition,

154
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,700
ended up building
a truckin' empire.

155
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,467
1951, he gets 19 bullets
in the head.

156
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:05,467
That's when the son, Otto,
he takes over, which is like --

157
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,467
the good news is,
world war I is over.

158
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:12,101
The bad news is,
"say to hello to Adolf Hitler."

159
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,467
And the shooter
is Otto's youngest?

160
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah.

161
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,301
Yeah, the runt --

162
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,167
mm, basically wind
and swagger,

163
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,467
except, I guess he's more
than that now.

164
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:24,467
Say...

165
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:27,367
You ever heard of, uh...

166
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:30,667
Mike Milligan
or the kitchen brothers?

167
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,834
Out of Kansas City.

168
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:37,967
We caught them sniffin'
around the crime scene,

169
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,533
but nothing
to hold 'em on, so...

170
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,767
You, uh --
you in the service?

171
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:49,067
Navy -- two tours.

172
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:52,000
Swift boat --
i was a lieutenant.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,067
Infantry for me,
outside da nang.

174
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:59,500
And we had a saying --
fubar.

175
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,767
Yeah, we had that, too.

176
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,334
So when you put a dead judge,
the Gerhardt family,

177
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:13,034
and some hitters from Kansas
in a bag together,

178
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,201
I go back to thinking
it might be best

179
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:17,367
just to confess
to the crime myself --

180
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,201
go live a long life
in a cell somewhere

181
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,767
with hot and cold
running water.

182
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:40,102
Hanzee: He got a place in town,
then -- your uncle?

183
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,436
Simone: Rye.

184
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:42,969
Something
he doesn't tell people,

185
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,336
where he can do
his business?

186
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:47,503
-You mean nail girls?
-Girls, drugs.

187
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:51,102
I don't know.

188
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:57,436
I don't.

189
00:11:57,436 --> 00:12:00,969
I mean...Maybe.

190
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,202
Okay.

191
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:06,202
Maybe I been there
with a boy

192
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:07,436
or to score some weed.

193
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,302
No drugs, your dad says.

194
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,503
Says anyone sells to you
gets the axe.

195
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:15,436
Geez, you're all
a bunch of squares.

196
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:20,169
Sometimes a girl just wants
to bust a nut, ya know?

197
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:29,536
It's over
on 13th somewhere.

198
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:32,703
Near the train station,
i think.

199
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:36,169
Not like I memorized
the address.

200
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,269
Show me.

201
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:55,369

209
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:18,703
Betsy: It's supposed
to fall out, they say.

210
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,902
With the chemo.

211
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:24,236
Donna Pearlman
lost hers overnight.

212
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,935
Woke up and thought there was
a dog sleepin' on her pillow.

213
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,002
Not everyone loses it.

214
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:33,202
We could just wait
and see.

215
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:36,569
Part of ne thinks I should
just shave it off --

216
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,269
be bald.

217
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,603
My cousin had a melanoma --
didn't lose a single hair.

218
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:44,169
Lost her eyebrows,
though.

219
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,503
Now,
that'd a horror show.

220
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:50,302
So I decided.

221
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:51,669
I want to do it.

222
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,569
What's that, hon?

223
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,002
The seminar.

224
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,736
I thought about it,
and I think I should.

225
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,436
I'm so happy.

226
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:02,136
-So happy.
-What seminar?

227
00:14:02,136 --> 00:14:03,935
It's called lifespring.

228
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:06,102
I did it last year
in mankato.

229
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:09,336
-Amazing.
-Oh.

230
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,002
Yeah, and I just,
you know,

231
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,336
I want to be the best me
i can be, ya know?

232
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,269
Constance:
Good for you.

233
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,169
What did ed say
when you asked him?

234
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,835
You didn't, did you?

235
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:25,169
You naughty girl.

236
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:26,569
We were busy.

237
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:30,436
Ladies.

238
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,736
Hi, dad.

239
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,503
Spoke to your man
on the wireless.

240
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,569
Said to say
he's gonna be late tonight.

241
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:37,236
Oh, yeah.
I thought he might.

242
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:39,102
Whatcha got there?

243
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:41,902
Uh, Connie, you mind if I put
one of those up in your window?

244
00:14:41,902 --> 00:14:43,503
Constance: Nope.

245
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,569
Okay, Mrs. blaycock.

246
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,703
You can head to the dryer.

247
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:50,835
Is that him -- the one
that killed those poor people?

248
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:53,136
We think so.
Yeah.

249
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,369
City boy, turns out.

250
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:56,869
Rye Gerhardt --

251
00:14:56,869 --> 00:15:00,136
raised without the proper
moral fiber, I'm thinking.

252
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:03,503
I mean, to kill all
those people, and for what?

253
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,469
You know,
a little money?

254
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:08,336
You know,
i was thinking last night --

255
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:12,902
that shoe you found
in the tree.

256
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,669
What if that's got something
to do with the murders?

257
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,136
Something how?

258
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:19,469
Well, you said yourself,

259
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,369
the shooter
left his vehicle behind,

260
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:24,902
so, I'm thinking...

261
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:26,835
What if he walked out
onto the road

262
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,469
and got himself hit
by a car.

263
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,636
-Like a hit and run?
-Yeah.

264
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:33,469
I mean, you found glass
in the road, right?

265
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:35,835
-Yeah, yeah.
-And, uh, skid marks?

266
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,902
So, I'm thinking,

267
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:42,269
what if the killer
goes after poor Denise,

268
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,802
shoots her
in the parking lot,

269
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:47,469
and then inadvertently
gets himself struck

270
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:48,902
by a passing motorist?

271
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:51,536
Hey, peg,
didn't you say that --

272
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:53,769
I'm sorry,
but that just don't make sense.

273
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,935
I mean, how come
the motorist don't stop?

274
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,469
If they hit a person --
run 'em over, I mean?

275
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:04,536
Yeah, I'm inclined
to agree with Peggy.

276
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:07,869
It's not like
you're gonna just drive home

277
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,802
with a Gerhardt
in your windshield

278
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,536
and, you know,
start supper.

279
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:14,636
Betsy:
All I'm saying is --

280
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:16,736
maybe rather
than looking for a man,

281
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,436
you should be looking for a car.

282
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:28,935
-We got to --
-hi, Peggy.

283
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,136
Hey, Noreen.

284
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,236
Ed, we got to --
get your coat.

285
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,736
Hi.

286
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:35,069
-Hi.
-What's --

287
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,603
Noreen, hon,
we've got a -- well,

288
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,869
it's a family crisis
is what it is.

289
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,035
So I need to --
will you tell bud

290
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,769
I'll have him back
after lunch, okay?

291
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,002
Whatever.

292
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:46,703
-Slow down.
-They know.

293
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:48,669
-Know what?
-About the accident.

294
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:50,835
There's a theory --
Betsy Solverson.

295
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:53,935
She said hit and run,
so we got to deal with the car.

296
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,802
O-okay, yeah,
but just slow down.

297
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:57,869
I don't understand
what you're --

298
00:16:57,869 --> 00:17:00,136
I can't slow down.
The clock's goin'.

299
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,636
Like I said,
there's a theory.

300
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:03,069
So we got to deal
with the car.

301
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:04,302
Now -- today.

302
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:07,636
Deal how?
It's broad daylight.

303
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:36,739
Sorry, officer.

304
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,138
Did I --
am I in a loading zone?

305
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,639
Sir,
let me see some I.D.

306
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:44,138
Yeah.

307
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:46,505
Is there --

308
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:49,405
am I in trouble, or...?

309
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,038
Skip --
that's your Christian name?

310
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,971
Yes, sir, skip sprang --
carriage typewriters.

311
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,739
Grand re-opening,
coming soon.

312
00:18:57,739 --> 00:18:59,172
Re-opening?

313
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,505
Well, we're still open,
technically.

314
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,639
That is -- if you're looking
for a classic, can't do better.

315
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:10,472
But the new models are --
they'll be in any day.

316
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:12,871
Beauties --
all electric.

317
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:14,338
State of the art.

318
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:16,305
They're not just
for women anymore, ya know?

319
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:17,672
Mm.

320
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:19,805
And what's got ya here
at court today?

321
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:24,739
Well, sir, uh, had a hearing,
but, uh, it's been postponed.

322
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:26,805
Hearing on...?

323
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:30,639
Small bother --
back taxes.

324
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:33,672
Nothing scandalous,

325
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,871
but time sensitive, if you get
my -- on account of --

326
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:44,071
I need, you know, cash,
to cover the new models, see?

327
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:47,338
Is that why you went
by judge mundt's office?

328
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,672
Did what?

329
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:54,205
Oh, uh, yeah.

330
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:58,138
I, uh, heard, uh,
what happened about the --

331
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:02,005
and, I mean, condolences
to the family and all.

332
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:05,905
But -- like I said --
lives hang in the balance here.

333
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,639
And time is, ya know,
tickin' down

334
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:12,472
to get the typewriters --
spaceships, really --

335
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:16,472
out of, ya know...

336
00:20:16,472 --> 00:20:17,739
Hock.

337
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,705
What do ya think?

338
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:28,038
- He's a squirrely fella.

339
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:32,838
Might be worth bringing him down
to the station, diggin' down.

340
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:36,572
Ya, I don't --

341
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:39,705
I mean, how many cases
she have, our judge?

342
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,938
Can't go diggin' down
on every sad sack --

343
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,871
yeah, exactly.
You said it.

344
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:46,372
A few back taxes.
It's not like I'm even --

345
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:48,639
-sir.
-Yeah, okay.

346
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:59,705
Okay, Mr. sprang.

347
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,372
You have a nice day.

348
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:05,639
Okay, then.

349
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,572
Uh, thanks much.

350
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,105
Spaceships, really.

351
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,205
They're just
for women anymore?

352
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:30,772
Gerhardts?

353
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:33,705
No avoiding it,
i suppose.

354
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:46,672
Rye!

355
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,105
Come on!

356
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:51,005
Open the -- it's --

357
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,272
let me in!

358
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:59,772
And here I was sitting
on my hands.

359
00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:02,438
Now look
what Santa brought me --

360
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:05,772
a little man.

361
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:07,971
Whatcha doin' here,
little man?

362
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:12,205
I'm, uh --
I'm looking for Rye.

363
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,038
You look like
you could use a drink.

364
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,938
Uh --
or at least watch me
drink mine.

365
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,938
It gets so lonely here
by myself.

366
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:28,838
Hell,
i may even dance for ya.

367
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:31,772
♪ Joe Henry had his say ♪

368
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:33,472
♪ he wouldn't set me free ♪

369
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,705
Oh, geez.

370
00:22:35,705 --> 00:22:38,572
-Who's --
-don't worry about him.

371
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:41,272
He's boring.

372
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:44,005
Let me guess.

373
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:46,272
You're the partner.

374
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,005
Uh, the, uh --

375
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:50,438
Rye said,
"i got this new deal.

376
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:52,905
Workin'
with a fella downtown."

377
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:56,071
So, I'm thinking
you're the fella downtown.

378
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:57,372
No.

379
00:22:57,372 --> 00:23:01,172
Not -- I'm --
my name is skip.

380
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,838
I just come to, uh...

381
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:05,539
Pay off some debts.

382
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:09,005
Gamblin' -- ponies.

383
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:12,105
Oh, okay, then.
Pay me.

384
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:15,038
Well, uh,

385
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,405
I don't actually have
the money on me.

386
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:22,572
I was just -- come by to say,
ya know, I'll have it soon.

387
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:27,372
So, you came by
to not pay my uncle.

388
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,038
And you're a patriot
to boot.

389
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,938
Well, I mean...

390
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:38,772
Greatest country on earth,
yeah?

391
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,971
Uh, my tie.

392
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:46,639
I think you and me
should go for a drive.

393
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,905
Like, I said, I -- you know --
there's some appointments.

394
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,138
Sucks
to your appointments.

395
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:55,071
I say
let's have some fun.

396
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:57,105
What do you say,
red man?

397
00:23:57,105 --> 00:23:58,805
Should we have some fun?

398
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,305
You betcha.

399
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:24,238
Ed: Well, that's the tree
i was thinking.

400
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:28,505
You want me to do it?

401
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:31,438
No, it's better me.

402
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:39,205
You sure about this plan?

403
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:42,138
It'll work.

404
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:44,405
Like I said,

405
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:47,138
my uncle used to drive his truck
and drink old Milwaukee.

406
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:49,238
And, you know,
insurance don't want to pay

407
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:53,138
for accidents when you're drunk,
so he came up with this plan.

408
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,639
Every crack-up,

409
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:56,472
he'd drive his truck
to some deserted spot

410
00:24:56,472 --> 00:24:59,005
till he sobered up,
fake a new accident

411
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:01,338
to cover the damage
he did drinking.

412
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:05,338
Well, it's creative.

413
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,338
So, that's what we do.

414
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:10,172
We cover the damage,
file a report,

415
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,971
and then, I mean,
that should do it.

416
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,172
We got rid of the --
i mean, the guy's all ground up,

417
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:18,539
and you burned his clothes,
you said,

418
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:23,138
so, once the car's fixed,
it's --

419
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,205
we're free.

420
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,905
You been a real paladin.

421
00:25:34,905 --> 00:25:37,905
A -- what's that?

422
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:40,572
It's like a knight.

423
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,938
My knight.

424
00:25:44,438 --> 00:25:48,739
Oh, well --
i mean, you're my wife.

425
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,905
Okay, so, you should
probably get out.

426
00:25:57,905 --> 00:26:00,971
You got
the one shiner already.

427
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:02,338
Okay.

428
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:03,838
Okay.

429
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,238
Watch your toes, now.

430
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:39,639
I mean, what are the odds?

431
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:44,272
Black ice and you doing a 180,
hitting a tree with the back?

432
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:46,338
You could run
that scenario 1,000 times

433
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,605
and never end up
with these circumstances.

434
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:51,138
Yeah, I got it right
the second time, though.

435
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:53,539
Yeah, you did.

436
00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,805
I think
i got the whiplash.

437
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:01,871
Come on, hon.

438
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:05,505
If they ask, I backed
into the garage door, okay?

439
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:25,321
Still going, huh?

440
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,321
Grandma's
working it out.

441
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:30,154
She thinks maybe
we can maybe sell Kansas City

442
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:33,188
a piece of the business,
not all.

443
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,520
They didn't look like fellas
who want to own half a car.

444
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:45,021
I need you to go back
to school tomorrow.

445
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:46,554
Dunlop will drive you.

446
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:48,520
No way.

447
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,654
It's gonna get hinkey
around here

448
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:54,188
for a while,
most likely.

449
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:56,821
Can't be worried
you're gonna catch a stray.

450
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:59,254
I can help.

451
00:27:59,254 --> 00:28:00,954
No.

452
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:03,954
I promised your ma
I'd keep you out of it.

453
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:05,254
Get you good
and educated

454
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:06,821
so you can make something
of yourself.

455
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:09,487
I am something already,
though, aren't I?

456
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:10,854
A Gerhardt.

457
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:16,254
We're not negotiating.

458
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:19,587
This is
a top-down decision.

459
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,520
Grandma agrees.

460
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,754
Uncle dodd says --

461
00:28:22,754 --> 00:28:24,654
dodd's got nothing
to do with it.

462
00:28:24,654 --> 00:28:26,321
You're<i> my</i> son.

463
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,421
He's got his girls,
so he decides

464
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:30,854
what happens to them,
but you're mine.

465
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:33,821
Like I said,

466
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:36,754
grandma agrees.

467
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:42,987
Dispatcher:
Come in, car 22. Over.

468
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,987
Man: This is car 22,
copy.

469
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:47,887
Yeah, car 22,
got a situation...

470
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:50,121
Not too late
to go to the movies.

471
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:53,254
We can -- we can drive over
there, if you'd like. Over.

472
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:55,221
Copy that.

473
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:43,121
Gonna need your guns.

474
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:45,654
I'll hold onto mine.

475
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:48,821
It's got
sentimental value.

476
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:53,321
Well, you're not getting inside
with that on your hip.

477
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,087
Am I the only one here
who's clear

478
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,620
on the concept
of law enforcement?

479
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,821
Is that Ben Schmidt?

480
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:09,720
Mrs. Gerhardt.

481
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,054
Oh,
i heard about Otto.

482
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:15,221
We're beset
on all sides.

483
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,254
How's your mother?

484
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:18,954
Off the crutches,
thanks.

485
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,787
Who's that?

486
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:28,121
Lou Solverson,
Minnesota state.

487
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:30,054
Up from Luverne.

488
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:32,121
Yeah, they had
some senselessness there

489
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,954
a few days back I'm afraid
we're gonna have to talk about.

490
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:36,887
What kind
of senselessness?

491
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:39,887
Three dead,
including a state judge.

492
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:42,054
A judge mundt.

493
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,520
Everything okay, mom?

494
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,121
Not sure yet --
something about a dead judge.

495
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,421
Not sure how it falls
to us.

496
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:02,921
Ma'am we found the murder weapon
at the scene.

497
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,454
Prints came back
this morning.

498
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:07,054
And?

499
00:31:07,054 --> 00:31:10,787
We're gonna have to talk
to Rye.

500
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,687
That's not gonna happen.

501
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:17,021
You need to leave.

502
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,954
Mrs. Gerhardt,
if either of these men draw,

503
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:22,787
I'm gonna be forced
to shoot some people,

504
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,954
and I don't want to do that.

505
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:27,887
Now, your son's wanted in
connection with three murders.

506
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,954
And I'm guessing
that's not the first time
you heard somebody say that,

507
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:32,787
so however it is you want
to handle this,

508
00:31:32,787 --> 00:31:35,121
you need to handle it now,
or it'll get handled for you.

509
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,587
Schmidt:
Everybody go easy.

510
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,520
You okay, ma?

511
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,687
Maude Schmidt's boy here
is trying to tell me

512
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,121
your brother killed
a judge.

513
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,754
Nobody killed a judge.

514
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,087
We own all the judges.

515
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,388
What'd be the point
of killing one?

516
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:52,954
-Now, dodd.
-don't you "dodd" me.

517
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,454
We're not friends.

518
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,054
We found Rye's prints
on the gun.

519
00:31:58,054 --> 00:31:59,520
You're gonna find my boot
on your neck,

520
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,054
you keep talking
like that.

521
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:03,520
Well, now, to be fair --
I'm the one who found the gun,

522
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,620
so I think you're dancing
with the wrong girl.

523
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:12,288
What'd you say?

524
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,221
I says, I'm the one
who found the gun,

525
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:16,921
so you should be talking
to me.

526
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:19,620
And I'm from out of town,

527
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,620
so forgive me
if I should be terrified,

528
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,587
but in Minnesota,
when a police officer says talk,

529
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:27,954
you talk.

530
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:30,787
You want to dance?

531
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,620
Let's dance.

532
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,787
Floyd: Ben, you need to teach
your friend some manners.

533
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:40,921
How about Mike Milligan
out of Kansas City?

534
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:43,154
You know
where we can find him?

535
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:45,687
Pretty sure he's looking
for your brother, too.

536
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:50,787
Uh, uncle dodd?

537
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:54,620
Uncle dodd, hanzee called.

538
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,354
-Not now.
-Said it's real important.

539
00:32:57,354 --> 00:33:00,454
Wants you to meet him
at the dig.

540
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:10,087
We're done here.

541
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:11,854
Floyd:
You heard my son.

542
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,954
We've said all we're gonna say.

543
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:16,687
Give him his gun back.
Get him out of here.

544
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,987
Okay.

545
00:33:18,987 --> 00:33:21,587
Time to go.

546
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:42,727
Well,
we could get a warrant.

547
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:45,560
From what judge?

548
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,827
You heard dodd.
They own most of the town.

549
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:59,093
Hey, pull over, huh?

550
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,694
-The typewriter guy?
-Yeah, like I said.

551
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:09,193
He was squirrely.

552
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:13,994
Hey, I -- I got to get back,
talk to my boss,

553
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:16,861
but, uh, station's just
a few blocks if you want to --
no, sure.

554
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:18,394
Sure, sure.

555
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:20,527
Thanks for showing me
around today.

556
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:21,761
Yeah.

557
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:27,394
Unh-unh.

558
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,827
What are you,
having a baby in there?

559
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:37,127
Hello.

560
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,027
You didn't tell me your family
was in from out of town.

561
00:35:40,027 --> 00:35:41,994
Unh-unh.

562
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:44,360
Whoops.

563
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,160
Got to ask you
your business here.

564
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,527
-Maybe I'm the owner.
-Nope.

565
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,961
Met the owner
this morning.

566
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:56,894
Is that right?

567
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:58,927
Maybe tell us
where he is.

568
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:00,427
Make a few bucks.

569
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:03,727
I was gonna ask you
the same.

570
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:07,961
Say, you wouldn't by any chance
be Mike Milligan

571
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:10,861
and the kitchen brothers,
would you?

572
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:15,460
You make us sound like
a prog rock band.

573
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,961
Ladies and gentlemen,

574
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:21,060
introducing Mike Milligan
and the kitchen brothers.

575
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:26,694
Double whoops.

576
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:28,527
Easy.

577
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:32,060
Minnesota cop.

578
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,794
You do know you're
in north Dakota, right?

579
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,127
Must have got lost
on the way to the lake.

580
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:41,394
So where'd you say
you saw old skip?

581
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:42,894
At your mother's house.

582
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:45,894
I think,
going in the back door.

583
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:49,027
I like him.

584
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:51,961
I like you.

585
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:54,894
Met another fella
from Minnesota yesterday.

586
00:36:54,894 --> 00:36:57,193
Big guy.
Sheriff, I think.

587
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:00,227
I liked him, too.

588
00:37:00,227 --> 00:37:02,227
We're
a very friendly people.

589
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:05,427
No, that's not it.

590
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:08,861
Pretty unfriendly, actually.

591
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:12,027
But it's the way
you're unfriendly --

592
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:15,093
how you're so polite
about it,

593
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:17,794
like you're doing me
a favor.

594
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:28,427
Well, this has been enjoyable,
but I better get going.

595
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:30,260
What did Nixon call it?

596
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,994
Peace with honor.

597
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:35,761
Something like that.

598
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,260
Naw.

599
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,694
You stay.

600
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:45,160
We've seen everything
there is to see.

601
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,193
I am not a crook.

602
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,894
Rapid fire.

603
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:58,961
Some round,
some oval.

604
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,027
What's that, friend?

605
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:02,761
Circular patterns --

606
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:08,160
unnatural, bright,
hovering in the sky.

607
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,827
You know, they come only
in the odd months --

608
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:12,560
the visitors.

609
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,093
Always in sets of three.

610
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:17,694
Such a night
was two nights past.

611
00:39:17,694 --> 00:39:20,394
Reports from mankato
to vermillion.

612
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:23,327
Visitors?

613
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,027
From above.

614
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:27,160
Some say they take you
to their ship

615
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,994
and probe you in places
you don't want to mention.

616
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:33,894
I believe their purposes
are more benevolent.

617
00:39:33,894 --> 00:39:37,160
As the caretaker
to the zoo,

618
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,861
strange happenings occur,
they are near.

619
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,894
Strange happenings, huh?

620
00:39:45,894 --> 00:39:49,394
I wondered
what was causing that.

621
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:09,459
Ed:
You think it worked?

622
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:11,625
Peggy:
What's that, hon?

623
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,459
I said
you think it worked?

624
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:18,292
Today, with the car?

625
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,725
It worked.

626
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:25,958
I don't know
how you can be so sure.

627
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:31,025
It worked.

628
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,758
Hiya, hon.

629
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,158
Dad's here.

630
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,691
Oh.

631
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,592
Hank.

632
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,725
Hank: Uh, I should go.

633
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:05,359
Sit.

634
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,125
Let me
get you some divinity.

635
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,925
Ooh,
i won't say no.

636
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:17,125
You go see
the gerhardts, then?

637
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,258
It's been real "high noon",
my day.

638
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,325
Gerhardts,
and I ran into

639
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:25,592
those Kansas City fellas
you pulled over.

640
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:29,492
Milligan, and, um...

641
00:41:29,492 --> 00:41:31,192
What do ya --
the bathroom brothers.

642
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,058
Yeah.
The ones that don't talk.

643
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,725
Yeah.

644
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,025
We pointed our weapons
at each other

645
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:39,192
for a bit
before calling it a day.

646
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:42,891
Maybe two pieces of cake,
then.

647
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,925
Sounds right.

648
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:47,492
Mm.

649
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:49,559
-Hiya.
-Hi.

650
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,325
You okay?

651
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:54,158
Yeah.
No complaints.

652
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:01,125
Mm.

653
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,192
Playing cribbage,
you hold your horses there.

654
00:42:03,192 --> 00:42:05,992
Yeah.
You-know-who's cheating.

655
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:07,658
Who's cheating, dad?

656
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,058
--Huh?

657
00:42:09,058 --> 00:42:10,359
No, come on.

658
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,258
By the way,
i looked at your hand.

659
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,658
Get back
in the goddamn truck.

660
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:35,725
What are you
talking about?

661
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:38,258
I got him.

662
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,459
And button up that coat.

663
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:42,758
You're embarrassin' me.

664
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,592
Yeah?

665
00:42:56,592 --> 00:42:59,425
You want
to hit me again?

666
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:01,559
Is that getting you
hard?

667
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:14,925
I wanted a boy.

668
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,559
What did god give me?

669
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,425
Four goddamn girls.

670
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:20,225
Please, sir,
this is a huge misunder--

671
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,092
shut up.

672
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:24,392
We know about the judge
and the typewriters
and the taxes,

673
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:26,225
and we know you were putting
ideas into his head.

674
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:28,625
And all I want to hear
out of your mouth right now

675
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,359
is where he is.
-Who?

676
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:42,658
If you knew
the day I'm havin' --

677
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,858
tell him.

678
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:53,058
Why would I go
by Rye's place

679
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:55,492
yellin' his name
if I knew where he was?

680
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:56,825
You talk to the cops?

681
00:44:03,425 --> 00:44:05,158
In the hole.

682
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:10,125
What?

683
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:26,725
Look, I can find him.

684
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:29,858
I can -- if you give me
a day -- two days --

685
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:36,258
lie down.

686
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:37,925
On the ground?

687
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,125
Please!

688
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:00,625
I -- I -- I --
I'm not the one you want to --

689
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,058
talk to Milligan!
They got him.

690
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:08,092
What'd you say?

691
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:11,425
Came by yesterday
looking for Rye.

692
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:13,691
Probably --
they found him.

693
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:17,225
I'm just...

694
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:18,891
I could call.

695
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:21,459
Make a deal.
I got capital.

696
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:24,492
You don't know anything.

697
00:45:26,025 --> 00:45:28,625
No, no!

698
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,492
No, no!

699
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:42,791
You're gonna drive down to
that shithole Minnesota town,

700
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,825
and you're gonna bring
my brother back tonight.

701
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,492
Judge or no judge.

702
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:49,858
If Kansas City gets in your way,
if the cops get in your way,

703
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:53,258
if anybody gets in your way,
you kill 'em dead.
