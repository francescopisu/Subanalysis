1
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:51,847
They won't. She won't stop, you know?

2
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:54,347
Day after...

3
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,646
I was a maker.

4
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,645
I hope they do it tonight...

5
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:01,245
When she's sleeping.

6
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:03,611
But I'm scared...

7
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:38,583
She said that I gotta make a meat loaf.

8
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:42,415
I said we'd bring jell-o
salad, but Kitty said meat loaf.

9
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:44,315
So...

10
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:45,914
Hon.

11
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,246
So what's that, hon?

12
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:51,079
I said it's Gordo's birthday tonight.

13
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:52,912
We're supposed to be at
your brother's at 4:00,

14
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,078
with meat loaf.

15
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,277
Sounds, uh, different today...

16
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,409
don't ya think?

17
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:00,843
Like, angry?

18
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,008
I'm washing towels. It's a towel sound.

19
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,840
Huh.

20
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:08,906
Kitty said they just got

21
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,873
one of those fancy
European all-in-ones.

22
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,872
Says it washes and dries. One machine.

23
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,039
Can you believe that?

24
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:16,971
Bet that set them back a penny.

25
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,404
He can afford it, your brother.

26
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:20,037
Kitty said he just got a big promotion

27
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,870
after only working there a year.

28
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:23,235
Kitty said they also got

29
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:28,868
one of those fancy new
surround sound systems.

30
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:31,733
Guess I married the wrong Nygaard.

31
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,767
Oh! Heh heh heh.

32
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,366
That's what I said. We had a good laugh.

33
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:39,064
Well, it's just slow now at the shop.

34
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:42,297
Oh, hon. That's what ya always say...

35
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,563
"slow."

36
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,894
Well...

37
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:53,794
better get back to it.

38
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:01,158
You make your own wins.

39
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,490
That's what Kitty said Chaz told her.

40
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:06,323
Salesmen make their own wins.

41
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:09,888
You gotta try harder, hon.
Smile, for Pete's sake.

42
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:12,854
Maybe wear a nicer tie.

43
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,720
You gave me this tie.

44
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,226
Well, if you were a better salesman,

45
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:19,885
I'd have bought you a nicer tie.

46
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,852
At least take a look.

47
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,251
I keep thinking maybe it's the settings.

48
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:29,850
Kitty says Chaz fixes things
around the house all the time.

49
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:33,215
Says he took the toaster
apart over the weekend.

50
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:37,247
Now it's good as new.
Browns to beat the band.

51
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,065
So that's, uh...

52
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,499
like I said, there's two kinds of policies

53
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,231
you should be thinking about.

54
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,196
You got your whole life and...

55
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:36,196
your whole life plus, which covers

56
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,062
the same benefits of whole life

57
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,161
plus... a heck of a lot more.

58
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,328
Well, we just came in to get
Charline on my health care.

59
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,664
On account of I'm having a baby.

60
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,493
Yeah. A boy, we're hoping.

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,105
Or a little girl.

62
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:52,605
I'd just about hug the
pants off a little girl.

63
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:55,470
Oh, yeah? Well, uh...

64
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,936
Even more...

65
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:00,369
all... all the more reason to, uh...

66
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:03,368
because what happens... what happens

67
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:06,034
if you have an accident at your job?

68
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,233
- I work at the library.
- Okay.

69
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,100
What happens if you have a car crash

70
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,099
and go out the windshield?

71
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,864
O... or say you're up a ladder,
cleaning out the gutters,

72
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:19,097
and you fall off the darn
thing and break your neck?

73
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,929
These things happen every day.

74
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:25,229
And people fall asleep smoking in bed.

75
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,728
They burn to death.

76
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:30,126
What I'm saying is the
morgue is... is full of guys

77
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,060
thought they didn't need life insurance.

78
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,226
For... for peace of mind, I'm saying,

79
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,391
to know that your little boy... or girl.

80
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,891
Right. Or little girl is taken care of.

81
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,455
We're supposed to be at my mom's by 4:00.

82
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:46,889
Yeah. So we're gonna...

83
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,889
Oh! O... okay.

84
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,387
Well, at least let me give you a brochure.

85
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,888
Or... or I got these pens.

86
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,719
I got these nif-nifty
pens. Look at that, huh?

87
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:57,452
With most of the colors...

88
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,351
Okay, well, if you
change your mind then, uh,

89
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,585
give me a...

90
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,217
Aw, heck.

91
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:20,012
Will ya look at that?

92
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,046
- What is it, dad?
- Yeah, dad.

93
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:25,178
- What is it?
- Oh, h... hey, Sam.

94
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,876
That, there, boys... is a black man.

95
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,908
He don't look black, dad.

96
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,908
Yeah, dad, he don't look black.

97
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:35,208
- More like a big pumpkin.
- Ha ha. Yeah!

98
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,207
Yeah, like a big, stupid pumpkin.

99
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,207
Lester... Niggered.

100
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:43,072
Now, come on, Sam, it... it's Nygaard,

101
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,204
just like in high school.

102
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:47,537
You went to high school
with a black man, dad?

103
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:50,536
- Yeah, dad, did you?
- Shut up.

104
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,569
How you been, Lester?

105
00:07:52,637 --> 00:07:53,869
- Oh, yeah, real good.
- Yeah?

106
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,202
Yeah. Me too.

107
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,201
Yeah, trucking company's doing super.

108
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,700
Got rigs all over the Great Lakes.

109
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:03,799
Just bought a summer house up Bear sland.

110
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,965
It's pretty sweet.

111
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,556
Hey, you remember the story I told you

112
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,788
of the boy I put in the oil drum

113
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:18,722
and rolled onto the highway?

114
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,887
- Is that him, dad?
- Yeah, dad, is that him?

115
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,886
Oh, you betcha.

116
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,619
Betcha.

117
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:30,051
Good old Lester pencil dick.

118
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,584
- Oh... Ahem.
- Hey, say, Lester,

119
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:36,583
what was the name of that girl
you went with in high school?

120
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,382
You know, uh... the curvy one.

121
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,748
- It's Pearl, yeah.
- Yeah.

122
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:47,113
Pearl... what a rack on that girl, huh?

123
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,945
Dad's saying she had big titties.

124
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,912
Yeah, I know what "rack"
means, you fairy...

125
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,078
- Ow.
- Yeah, dad, ow!

126
00:08:55,145 --> 00:08:57,577
You know, she gave me a tug once.

127
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:01,675
Homecoming senior year,
with the nice, fat hands.

128
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:04,008
Real soft.

129
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,173
We're married now. Going on 18 years.

130
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:09,006
Oh, dad, that's embarrassing.

131
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:11,673
Yeah, dad, super embarrassing.

132
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,738
18 years, huh?

133
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:16,238
Yeah. That's something.

134
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,704
Never knew what she saw in you, really.

135
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:21,204
Oh, well, I...

136
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,102
No, I mean... help me out.

137
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,434
Is it your stupid pencil dick

138
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:28,567
or your little rat face?

139
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,033
Yeah, well, uh...

140
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,265
I should get back to it.

141
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:37,765
Oh, come on.

142
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,530
Did I ever tell ya how I used
to beat this little guy up

143
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:44,262
in high school?

144
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,895
And write my name on my fist
in sharpie 'fore I'd punch him,

145
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:51,228
so everyone else would know who did it.

146
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:54,560
- That's a good one, dad.
- Yeah, dad, real good one.

147
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,458
Remember?

148
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,556
Yeah, I... it's a long time ago, but...

149
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,286
Oh, what a day.

150
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:34,247
Excuse me... Miss?

151
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:37,280
Do you think, uh... will it be much longer?

152
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,246
This thing hurts like the dickens.

153
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,271
- We'll call your name.
- Yeah, but I've been here

154
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:44,411
- an hour already.
- We'll call your name.

155
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:06,039
- Could I have a sip?
- Hmm?

156
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,538
Oh.

157
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,370
Heck, take the whole can.

158
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:14,202
Can't drink the darn thing without a straw.

159
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,399
Ahh.

160
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,931
Whew.

161
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,398
ICU resident on call,

162
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,063
please contact...

163
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,229
Obliged.

164
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:36,395
Mm.

165
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:41,794
What happened to your nose?

166
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,460
Oh, it was, uh...

167
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,893
It was just a...

168
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:49,059
misunderstanding.

169
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:53,258
Now, was this you
misunderstanding the other fella,

170
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:56,557
or him misunderstanding you?

171
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,756
Pardon?

172
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:01,189
Who misunderstood whom?

173
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:03,854
Oh, no, what I'm saying...

174
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:06,387
It's, uh...

175
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:10,185
it's not good to dwell on these things.

176
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:11,519
Why?

177
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,019
Pardon?

178
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:15,251
Why is it not good to
dwell on these things?

179
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,383
Especially things that
put you in the hospital.

180
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,681
Uh...

181
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:26,681
Well, I was... ahem... I was outnumbered,

182
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:29,514
if you wanna know the truth.

183
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,679
Three to one.

184
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,878
I mean, big... big guys
too... well, one of them.

185
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,745
Other two were just kids,

186
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:40,376
but big for their age, you know?

187
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,276
If I was any kind of man,

188
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,408
I'd have shown that Sam what's what.

189
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:55,272
Sam?

190
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:59,371
Hess.

191
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,637
The bully in high school,
and he's a bully now.

192
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:06,137
So why didn't ya?

193
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,235
Show him what's what?

194
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,834
Well, his...

195
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:15,066
he had his sons with him and...

196
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:18,198
You let a man beat you
in front of his children

197
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:21,331
- to send them a message?
- No, that's not...

198
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:25,163
Heck.

199
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:27,363
Just...

200
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,195
heck.

201
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:31,028
In my experience,

202
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:33,361
if you let a man break your nose,

203
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:37,660
the next time, he tries
to break your spine.

204
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,826
Sam... no way. Mm-mm.

205
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:41,725
I mean, I don't think...

206
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,025
It just, uh... I guess I, uh,

207
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:46,890
embarrassed him in front of his boys.

208
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,023
- You embarrassed him?
- Yeah. By, uh...

209
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,889
He was telling me about a
time where he and my wife,

210
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,521
they were, uh... hmm.

211
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,021
But he didn't know she
was my wife is the thing,

212
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,520
and when I told him...

213
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,453
- wha...
- This man has slept with your wife,

214
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:02,952
and you're worried about embarrassing him.

215
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,319
Uh-uh. Not slept. No, they didn't, uh...

216
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:08,617
He said it was just...

217
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:11,682
she has soft hands,
see, and, uh, I guess...

218
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,682
No, mister, we're not friends.

219
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,316
I mean, maybe we will be someday.

220
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:17,448
But I gotta say,

221
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:21,179
if that were me in your position...

222
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,846
I would have killed that man.

223
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:32,977
Well, now...

224
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:34,977
Come on.

225
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:44,474
You said he bullied you
in high school, right?

226
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,373
Four years.

227
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,370
Gave me an ulcer.

228
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,904
You know what, one time,
he put me in an oil barrel

229
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:57,203
and rolled me in the road.

230
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,603
Seriously?

231
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,134
And now he tells you that...

232
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:07,266
he had relations with your wife.

233
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:11,931
He bullies you again in
front of his children.

234
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:16,497
This is a man who doesn't
deserve to draw breath.

235
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:20,130
Yeah, okay, but, uh...

236
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,628
- Here's the thing.
- No. That is the thing.

237
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:27,694
Well, heck!

238
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,460
I mean, o... okay.

239
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,659
Okay. But...

240
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:33,659
What am I supposed to do?

241
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,625
Heck, you're so sure about it,

242
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,991
maybe you should just kill him for me.

243
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,021
You're asking me to kill this man.

244
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,288
No, that was... I was joking.

245
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:51,353
Mr. Nygaard?

246
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:55,152
Uh, y... yeah, that's
me. Ju... o... one second.

247
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,217
We... we... we... we're just
two fellas talking, right?

248
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,951
We're just... blowing off steam.

249
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:05,283
- Sir, it's real busy.
- Like I said, one second.

250
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:07,082
Sam Hess.

251
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,414
No, just... just one second. That is not...

252
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:12,447
Sir!

253
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:17,080
Just one word. Yes or no.

254
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:18,778
Sir, I'm going to give your spot...

255
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,744
Yeah! Aah! Yeah, I'm coming, for...

256
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,910
Pete's sake.

257
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,596
Cold enough for ya, Chief?

258
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,728
Supposed to get down to -10 later.

259
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:16,962
Yeah. Heard that.

260
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,061
Don't much like the sound of negative.

261
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:22,293
Thought I'd strip down to my shorts,

262
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,892
work on my tan.

263
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,791
So what's this here then?

264
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,957
Chief, I arrived on
the scene at 1300 hours.

265
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:31,091
Found this '93 New Yorker.

266
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,889
Looks like she fled the
road and crashed the fence.

267
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:36,423
I found a set of footprints
leading away from the car.

268
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,088
Thought possibly our
driver injured, you know,

269
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:41,754
got confused, wandered into the woods.

270
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:43,120
I was just about to investigate.

271
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,753
There's blood here. Hair too.

272
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,985
Yeah. Saw that.

273
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,451
I was thinking maybe a deer, but, uh,

274
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,984
couldn't find the evidence, so...

275
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:08,712
Here it is.

276
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,078
Son of a gun.

277
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,911
Blood on the steering wheel.

278
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,209
Driver could have hit his head.

279
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,709
Or her head.

280
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,274
You check the trunk?

281
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:26,207
No, sir.

282
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,907
Huh.

283
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,538
So you wanna take a look
at those footprints then?

284
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:38,238
Sounds good.

285
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:46,935
How's Ida?

286
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:48,601
Any day now.

287
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,600
You got a name picked out?

288
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:52,266
Can't get that woman

289
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:56,899
to decide what color to paint the nursery.

290
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,931
Can't believe I missed
that deer in the trunk.

291
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,830
Don't take it hard. Been
doing this a long time.

292
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,163
Never checked for a deer in the trunk.

293
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:06,162
Or any wildlife.

294
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,661
Chief.

295
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,690
Hi, hon.

296
00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:27,256
In the kitchen.

297
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,519
Something smells good.

298
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,851
Your boy wanted a hamburger.

299
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,683
Sounds like my boy.

300
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:04,112
Molly found a wreck out on 71.

301
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,544
How's she doing?

302
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:06,877
- Molly?
- Mm.

303
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:09,111
- Yeah, good.
- I always liked her.

304
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:11,709
Yeah, she's a peach. Anyhoo,

305
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,908
looks like the driver
tried to head out on foot.

306
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:17,541
He got lost and froze
to death in the woods.

307
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:19,540
- Oh, my.
- Yah.

308
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:23,072
Funny thing is, the fellow
was just wearing underpants.

309
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,806
- That so?
- Yah.

310
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:27,738
- No I.D., nothing.
- Hmm.

311
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:30,604
Couldn't find his clothes anywhere.

312
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,136
Maybe he ate 'em.

313
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:36,902
Hmm.

314
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,966
I was thinking maybe blue.

315
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,065
- For the nursery.
- Oh, yeah?

316
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,398
Mm. Earlier I was thinking maybe blue.

317
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:55,762
- Then I changed my mind.
- Blue's nice.

318
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,762
Maybe green.

319
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:03,227
Well, I'm ready to get painting.

320
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,694
Soon as you decide.

321
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,926
You're a good man, Vern Thurman.

322
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:12,891
My sister was crazy
telling me not to marry you.

323
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,556
Your sister is crazy.

324
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,190
Mm.

325
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:33,552
Ha ha.

326
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,551
Dad said we could take turns.

327
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:37,550
Yeah? Dad said that he also thinks

328
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:40,116
you've got a potato brain, so...

329
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:42,116
Hey...

330
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,048
Shut up!

331
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:52,447
You're doing it wrong.

332
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:56,045
You need to press your forearm
into the back of his neck,

333
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:57,711
grab your elbow with the other hand

334
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:58,778
to choke him right out.

335
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:00,877
W... what you want, mister?

336
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,709
Yeah, mister. What do you want?

337
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:08,508
Sign outside says Hess & Sons.

338
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:13,007
- Which one's the older boy?
- Me.

339
00:22:13,074 --> 00:22:14,873
I'm Mickey.

340
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:19,172
You know, so... that leaves
me in charge when dad is gone.

341
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:20,671
Are not! Mom said...

342
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:23,071
Mom has nothing to do with it, sister!

343
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:26,337
Hey!

344
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:29,002
Help you with something?

345
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,069
Sam Hess?

346
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,667
Who wants to know?

347
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,865
Me.

348
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:45,064
Only two reasons to
come to my shop, friend.

349
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,529
Either you need a truck
or you drive a truck, huh?

350
00:22:48,597 --> 00:22:50,528
You a truck driver?

351
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:53,694
I was just talking to your boys.

352
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:56,227
I think the younger one's a little dim.

353
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,625
What did you say?

354
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:03,624
His IQ seems low, I'm saying.

355
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:06,124
Have you had him tested?

356
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,123
Hit him, dad!

357
00:23:08,191 --> 00:23:10,056
Yeah, dad, hit him!

358
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:20,320
I'm gonna restrain myself...

359
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:23,019
you know, on account of you
got an obvious head injury,

360
00:23:23,087 --> 00:23:25,884
and not beat you to death with a tire iron.

361
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:28,717
But I'm gonna ask you again...

362
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,483
what the heck do you want?

363
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,715
I just wanted to have a look at ya.

364
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,481
Okay. That'll do it.

365
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:54,343
How does a grown man
fall over his own feet?

366
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:57,009
It was ice. I slipped on ice.

367
00:23:57,077 --> 00:24:00,108
- We should have canceled.
- Oh, don't be a baby.

368
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,140
Hi! Hey, we're here.

369
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,470
- We're here.
- Hi!

370
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:20,335
Come on in. Chaz is working the ham.

371
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:21,868
Oh.

372
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,800
Took the whole team down to Duluth Tuesday.

373
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,133
Big spread at the marriott.

374
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,465
Oh, I always wanted to stay there.

375
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,631
Yeah, it's real sweet... king-size bed,

376
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,463
view of the lake... you name it.

377
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:39,829
- Boss took me out for dinner.
- Just the two of 'em.

378
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:41,629
Steak big as a catcher's mitt.

379
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:44,962
Said, "Chaz, you're going
places in this world."

380
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,327
Gave him a raise and a corner office.

381
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:49,326
Yeah. Hear that, Lester?

382
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:50,827
A corner office.

383
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:53,659
- Yeah. Real good.
- And him, your younger brother.

384
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:56,225
- Yeah, I said I heard.
- Vice president, sales.

385
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:57,990
Midwest region.

386
00:24:58,058 --> 00:24:59,617
Bought the surround sound to celebrate.

387
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,590
I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?

388
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:04,089
You're gonna have to marry that ham,

389
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,588
you get any more familiar with it.

390
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,454
Saw it on Rachael Ray.

391
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:11,753
She said that massaging
breaks the muscle down,

392
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:13,086
makes the meat juicier.

393
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:15,953
Lester never wants to try new things.

394
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:17,818
Now, hold on. That's not true.

395
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:20,818
We make Gordo try stuff all the time.

396
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:23,450
Chaz says we have to open his horizons.

397
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:26,316
Broaden his horizons.

398
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:27,783
It's a big world, you know.

399
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,147
There is more to life than just Minnesota.

400
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,346
Took a real tumble, huh?

401
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:40,112
There's a... a spot over
by the fire station...

402
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,112
it's always icy.

403
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,776
Don't know what the heck I was thinking.

404
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,176
Lester.

405
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,276
Ohh! Come out to the garage.

406
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,441
Help me get some more beer.

407
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,939
Took Gordo to a specialist last month.

408
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:02,071
Think he might have the autism.

409
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:03,338
Hmm?

410
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:04,905
Won't stop drawing on
the walls, and Kitty...

411
00:26:04,972 --> 00:26:08,270
she said she found a
mason jar in his closet.

412
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:11,568
I guess that he pees in it at night.

413
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:15,401
Huh. What's that about?

414
00:26:18,002 --> 00:26:21,900
Hey, wanna see something cool?

415
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:23,732
Sure.

416
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:31,296
Sweet!

417
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:32,996
Yeah, not those.

418
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,994
- Aw, jee... what is that?
- That there...

419
00:26:39,061 --> 00:26:42,593
is your m249 S.A.W. light machine gun,

420
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,259
sometimes referred to as "the piglet."

421
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:47,791
Are you allow... c...
can you even have that?

422
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:50,758
Is it legal? Technically, no way.

423
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:53,590
But I got a buddy works
supply over at Camp Ripley,

424
00:26:53,657 --> 00:26:55,423
and, heck, I'm an American.

425
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,589
I pay my taxes.

426
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:59,921
You wanna take a look?

427
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,688
It's gas-operated, air-cooled.

428
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:05,687
Shoots 725 rounds per minute.

429
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,285
Oh!

430
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,051
Oh. Oh, jeez.

431
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:14,716
You should've told me it was so heavy.

432
00:27:14,784 --> 00:27:16,250
- Is it okay?
- No, Lester!

433
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:18,383
It's not okay! You...

434
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,548
Here...

435
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:23,381
You broke the darn...

436
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,713
Why are you such a G-D screw-up?

437
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,380
Hey, now. Ever since you were...

438
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:31,545
And now Kitty... she said
she talked to Pearl last week,

439
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:33,778
and she's had it... your wife.

440
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:37,744
Said you been acting plain
weird... just moping around.

441
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:39,743
Said she caught you
standing in the bathroom

442
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,908
with your toothbrush in your
hand just looking in the mirror.

443
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,941
Said foam was coming out of
your mouth like a rabid dog.

444
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,740
Oh, come on! That's... not...

445
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:51,073
How I may or may not be feeling.

446
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,572
And for your information,

447
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:55,405
I hadn't had a lot of
sleep the night before,

448
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,104
so... so the toothpaste,
that was just nothing!

449
00:27:57,172 --> 00:27:59,238
Did you really trip on the
ice and break your nose?

450
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,570
Yeah. Yes.

451
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,669
I... I told you, outside the fire station.

452
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,736
You know they run the
hoses and wash the trucks,

453
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:08,234
and it gets all slippery and wet.

454
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:10,700
Ohh, you know guys at work...

455
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:13,367
they talk about how they
look up to their brothers.

456
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,599
Their older brothers.

457
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,197
Sometimes I tell people you're dead.

458
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,529
I mean, heck, Lester, you're 40 years old.

459
00:28:22,597 --> 00:28:25,695
When are you gonna get your act together?

460
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:29,694
Your own brother?

461
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:32,760
You didn't have to hit him.

462
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:38,025
I mean, seriously, what
is the matter with you?

463
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,924
Your own brother!

464
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:55,437
Yes, one more.

465
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,202
Yes, one more time.

466
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,602
Before the 17th.

467
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:02,100
Do you need this to look like an accident?

468
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:04,400
Figure it out and call me back.

469
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,564
- Realty.
- It's me.

470
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:16,096
St. Paul. Your call was expected yesterday.

471
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:17,963
I got delayed.

472
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,662
Problems?

473
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,262
Car troubles. Fixed now.

474
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,428
But you finished the assignment.

475
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,094
Of course.

476
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:28,260
And when can they expect you in Duluth?

477
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:30,258
The new client is anxious to begin.

478
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:33,091
Soon. I took a detour.

479
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,124
And the nature of this... detour?

480
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,490
It's personal.

481
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:40,756
Shouldn't be more than a day or two.

482
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,822
I'll let Duluth know.

483
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:44,588
All right.

484
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,780
Okay.

485
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,845
Yah.

486
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:18,511
Oh, yah, big fella.

487
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:21,311
Uhh! Oh, yah.

488
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:24,675
Yah. Oh. That's good.

489
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,174
Oh!

490
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:34,473
Uh...

491
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,172
Aah!

492
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:42,004
Yeah? No.

493
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:50,335
Yep?

494
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:56,433
Aw, jeez, where?

495
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay.

496
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:01,332
Pick me up, huh?

497
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:07,330
- Gotta go?
- Mm.

498
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,263
Homicide.

499
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,262
Molly's coming to get me.

500
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,429
Go back to sleep, hon.

501
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:16,927
- Love you.
- Love you too.

502
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:33,455
- Thanks.
- Ida sleeping?

503
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,322
Yep.

504
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:42,119
What you want me to write
for "cause of death"?

505
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:45,318
Put "self-explanatory."

506
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:50,184
You okay there, Bill?

507
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:53,116
Oh, yeah. Threw up a bit ago.

508
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,449
- Not in here, I hope.
- Oh, no.

509
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:58,082
Went out to the parking lot.

510
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,281
Wife made spaghetti for dinner.

511
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:02,248
Seemed a shame to barf it up.

512
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:07,913
I'm okay now, so long as I don't look.

513
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:15,243
Aw, heck.

514
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,909
That's Sam Hess.

515
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:21,409
Hess that owns the trucking company?

516
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:25,140
Yeah, with the two boys
both dumb as a dog's foot.

517
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,407
Hold on. Isn't Hess tied

518
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:29,740
to that syndicate of fellas out of Fargo?

519
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:31,738
Gunrunners and such?

520
00:32:31,805 --> 00:32:35,670
So they say. Never seen the proof.

521
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,936
Well, jeez, you... I mean,
you think this could be,

522
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,435
like, an organized crime thing?

523
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,935
You know, a hit or the like.

524
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,434
I don't know what I think yet,

525
00:32:45,502 --> 00:32:48,100
except I was warm in bed half an hour ago.

526
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:59,597
How many times I gotta tell ya?

527
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:02,364
You can't just take the
sheets off of one bed

528
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,862
and stick 'em on another.
It's "unsanitory."

529
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:06,694
I shake 'em out first.

530
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:10,094
You don't have the sense
God gave a clam, do ya?

531
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:12,893
Go shovel the walk.

532
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,557
- I need a room.
- Just you?

533
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,889
- Pardon?
- Is it just for you, the room?

534
00:33:24,957 --> 00:33:26,222
What difference does that make?

535
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:27,888
It's a different rate for two.

536
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:31,555
And if you got pets... dog,
cat... it's an extra 10 bucks.

537
00:33:31,622 --> 00:33:33,954
What if I got a fish?

538
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,720
'Scuse me?

539
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:38,118
Would a fish cost me $10?

540
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:42,984
Or what if I kept spiders or mice?

541
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,151
What if I had bacteria?

542
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,950
Sir, bacteria are not pets.

543
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:48,983
- Could be.
- Sir, perhaps

544
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,113
you'd be happier in a different motel?

545
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,413
I just wanna know the policy.

546
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:59,179
You see, I'm a student of institutions.

547
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,845
Sir, do you have a pet or not?

548
00:34:02,912 --> 00:34:06,844
Oh, no. It's just me.

549
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,903
Why do you let her talk to you like that?

550
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:29,937
Aw, she's not that bad.

551
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,569
Son, she compared you to a clam.

552
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:36,435
Well, what should I do?

553
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:39,067
A guy insulted me once.

554
00:34:39,135 --> 00:34:42,099
I pissed in his gas tank.

555
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,365
Car never drove straight again.

556
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:09,158
Leroy's Motor Inn.

557
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:12,325
Oh, yes, ma'am, I'm looking out my window,

558
00:35:12,392 --> 00:35:15,989
and there's a young fellow
urinating in the gas tank

559
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:17,989
of a red Cavalier.

560
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:20,155
Son of a...

561
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,687
Hey! Hey!

562
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:26,687
You little...

563
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,338
- Warm ya up, hon?
- Yeah, thanks, dad.

564
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,670
Whatcha looking at?

565
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:41,837
Murder file.

566
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:43,836
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

567
00:35:43,904 --> 00:35:46,336
Sam Hess got himself killed last night

568
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,335
over at the Lucky Penny.

569
00:35:48,403 --> 00:35:49,335
You don't say.

570
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:51,700
Knife in the head.

571
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:54,200
You didn't hear that from me.

572
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:58,464
Hey, there, Molly, Lou.

573
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,965
- Coffee?
- Sure.

574
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,297
- Eggs over medium?
- Won't say no.

575
00:36:02,364 --> 00:36:04,163
- How's the leg?
- Eh.

576
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:06,963
Goes from my ass to the
ground just like the other.

577
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,362
Thinking of doing some
ice fishing this weekend.

578
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,529
Sorry to hear it.

579
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:12,184
- Interested?
- No, sir.

580
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:16,722
The only thing I ever caught
fishing in winter was a cold.

581
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,456
Say, Chief, listen, I been thinking

582
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:20,441
about that fella in the
snow with the underpants?

583
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:21,721
Something odd about that.

584
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,108
You're saying other than the fact

585
00:36:23,122 --> 00:36:24,887
- that he was just wearing panties?
- Yeah.

586
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:27,786
See, we know from the wreck
that whoever was driving

587
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,252
cracked their head on
the steering wheel, right?

588
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,453
- But the fella in the snow...
- No head injury.

589
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,151
- Yeah. So you see...
- That's some good

590
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:36,417
- police work there, Deputy.
- Oh, thanks.

591
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:40,083
But if he's not the driver,
I guess we gotta ask...

592
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,616
Who is he?

593
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:43,415
Ran his prints. Nothing.

594
00:36:43,483 --> 00:36:45,415
Plus, turns out the car was stolen.

595
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:47,981
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, over in Grand Forks.

596
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:51,746
I called the local pd. I'm
just waiting on a callback.

597
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,912
Any thoughts there on Hess?

598
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,744
Uh, no, not as such.

599
00:36:57,812 --> 00:37:01,010
The, um... lady that Hess was with?

600
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:02,776
Didn't get a good look
at the fella killed him

601
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:04,609
on account of all the
blood in her eyes, but, um,

602
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:06,942
you know, we're checking
the knife for prints.

603
00:37:07,009 --> 00:37:08,608
Oh, also, Bill's going
around to local stores,

604
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:11,940
see if maybe the knife
was bought here in Bemidji.

605
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:16,306
You'll make a good chief one day.

606
00:37:16,374 --> 00:37:18,618
Me?

607
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:21,220
What about Bill? He's got seniority.

608
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,885
Bill cleans his gun with bubble bath.

609
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:26,251
No, it'll be you.

610
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:28,383
If you want.

611
00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:39,047
When you talk to the
police, just keep it simple.

612
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:41,046
"Thanks, but no thanks," in other words.

613
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:42,713
I've already talked to Fargo,

614
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,379
and they want to deal with this themselves.

615
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:46,545
They're sending guys.

616
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:50,777
Deal with what? He was in a whorehouse.

617
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:52,210
Glad he's dead.

618
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:54,143
Ma, don't talk like that.

619
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:56,209
Yeah, ma, don't talk like that.

620
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,042
Makes me live in the North Pole,

621
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,708
and then he's got the nerve to...

622
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:03,140
I'm not kidding.

623
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:07,006
I'm gonna sing at his funeral.

624
00:38:08,306 --> 00:38:11,070
♪ La la la la la-la-la-la-la-la ♪

625
00:38:22,736 --> 00:38:25,399
Mr. Mickey, you have a phone call.

626
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:29,498
She said me, you doofus.

627
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:32,199
- Can I come?
- No!

628
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,431
Jeez! Just stay here with ma.

629
00:38:38,397 --> 00:38:41,195
- Hello?
- Mickey? Lewis Grossman.

630
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:43,095
Your dad's estate attorney.

631
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:44,695
First of all,

632
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:48,694
I'd like to say how
sorry I am for your loss.

633
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,260
Okay.

634
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,693
Next thing is

635
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,458
I'm responsible for overseeing

636
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:58,957
the dispersal of your dad's vast estate.

637
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:02,269
- You mean the money?
- Right.

638
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,603
Money, real estate, holdings,

639
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:07,703
automobiles and, uh...

640
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:11,702
Well, there's no delicate way to put this.

641
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,567
The will was very clear.

642
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:17,066
Your dad decided to give everything

643
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:18,566
to your younger brother Moe.

644
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:21,133
- Are you kidding?
- I know it's hard to hear.

645
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,631
But the will was very specific.

646
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:28,730
"I leave the entirety of my vast estate

647
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:30,895
to my second-born

648
00:39:30,963 --> 00:39:34,061
and favorite son Moe."

649
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:35,560
That's sweet.

650
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:38,727
He must have really loved that boy.

651
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,292
Anyway, that's it.

652
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,059
Once again, I'm sorry for your loss.

653
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:44,626
If you have any questions,

654
00:39:44,693 --> 00:39:48,056
please don't hesitate to call me.

655
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:52,656
Well, like I said, Mrs. Hess,

656
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,589
we're checking some things on our end,

657
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:56,422
but if there's anything you could tell us

658
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,121
- about your husband's business...
- Appreciate the visit, Chief,

659
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,587
but Mrs. Hess had no kind of
involvement with Sam's business.

660
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,586
Frankly, she's mystified,

661
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,085
her husband being a pillar
of the community and all.

662
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:08,951
I mean, heck,

663
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,750
voted Bemidji businessman
of the year, 1996 and '98.

664
00:40:11,818 --> 00:40:14,249
Who was it?

665
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:17,749
- Yah.
- Like I said, it's a puzzler.

666
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,747
Course, we both know some of your boys

667
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:21,780
have had run-ins with
the law in the past...

668
00:40:21,848 --> 00:40:23,779
stolen merchandise charges and the like.

669
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:26,113
And, you know, the staties had that case

670
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,458
as to maybe your outfit's got
ties to that crime syndicate

671
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,582
- out of Fargo.
- Whoa, wh...

672
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,531
You're gonna stand here...
let me get this straight.

673
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,195
You're gonna stand here and
call the victim a criminal

674
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:37,696
in front of his wife, his kids?

675
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:39,361
Well, no, no one's
calling anyone a criminal.

676
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:41,861
Just trying to figure out what happened.

677
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:44,561
Chief! 217! 217!

678
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:49,026
Uhh! Ugh!

679
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,095
Don't need me to tell you
it was a cold one out there.

680
00:41:01,163 --> 00:41:03,161
And as of right now,
nothing much has changed.

681
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:05,660
So let's take a look at where we are...

682
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:08,126
What the heck...

683
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:11,092
We got 5 degrees in Duluth...

684
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:26,840
- Hey, Lester.
- Oh, hiya, Bo.

685
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:29,041
Jeez, what happened to your face there?

686
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:31,839
You know that spot near the fire station?

687
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,838
- Where they wash the trucks?
- Yep. Slipped on the ice.

688
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,170
Oofta.

689
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:42,336
Say, Lester, I need you to
pull the file on Sam Hess.

690
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:44,335
On... who now?

691
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:45,668
Sam Hess, you know,

692
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,502
owns the truck depot over on winslow.

693
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,034
You know, big fella?

694
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:52,666
Yeah, well, he's dead.

695
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,432
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, shame.

696
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,432
It's a big policy.

697
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,965
Murder, they're saying.

698
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:00,930
Stabbed to death is what I heard.

699
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:05,963
You okay there, Lester?

700
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:08,462
Sure. Uh...

701
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,828
Sure. Y... you know I went
to high school with him?

702
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,627
You don't say. Well, anyway,

703
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,126
I need you to pull the policy on that.

704
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:16,960
I have to get on the
phone with his wife later.

705
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:51,483
Uh...

706
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,915
Did you...

707
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,482
Jeez.

708
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:58,147
Did you really kill him? Sam?

709
00:42:58,214 --> 00:43:00,413
Oh, my God.

710
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:03,245
Is Sam dead?

711
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:05,911
How do you feel about that?

712
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,278
Well, I mean...

713
00:43:08,346 --> 00:43:09,944
of course, it's,

714
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:12,143
you know, a tragedy.

715
00:43:12,211 --> 00:43:13,442
Well, why'd you kill him then?

716
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,942
Now hold on a second!

717
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:18,140
I never...

718
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,307
Well, actually, you did.

719
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:21,940
Remember, yes or no?

720
00:43:22,007 --> 00:43:24,673
- I never said yes.
- Didn't say no.

721
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,939
No. That won't... come on.

722
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:30,137
That won't... in a court of law...

723
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:32,137
Who said anything about a court of law?

724
00:43:32,204 --> 00:43:33,936
I just mea...

725
00:43:34,004 --> 00:43:35,769
I... jeez.

726
00:43:37,669 --> 00:43:41,468
And he had a wife, you
know, and those boys.

727
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,533
Lester, he put you in a barrel

728
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:46,199
and rolled you in the road.

729
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:48,699
Your problem is you spent your whole life

730
00:43:48,766 --> 00:43:51,631
thinking there are rules.

731
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,964
There aren't.

732
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,930
We used to be gorillas.

733
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:58,896
All we had is what we
could take and defend.

734
00:43:58,964 --> 00:44:01,128
The truth is, you're more of a man today

735
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:03,793
than you were yesterday.

736
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:05,560
How do you figure?

737
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:08,459
It's a red tide, Lester,

738
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:11,392
this life of ours.

739
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,258
The shit they make us eat...

740
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:20,923
day after day, the boss,
the wife, et cetera,

741
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,422
wearing us down.

742
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,287
If you don't stand up to it,

743
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:26,620
let 'em know you're still an ape

744
00:44:26,688 --> 00:44:29,153
deep down where it counts,

745
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,419
you're just gonna get washed away.

746
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:45,915
Phone call, Chief.

747
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,248
It's the wife.

748
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:52,279
- Hey, hon.
- White.

749
00:44:52,347 --> 00:44:53,712
- White what?
- I decided

750
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,245
we're gonna paint the nursery white.

751
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:59,044
- It's already white.
- Well...

752
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,044
I wanna paint it again.

753
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:04,376
The baby's room should have
a new coat, don't you think?

754
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:07,375
I do. Any particular shade?

755
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:09,574
- What do you mean?
- Well, you got

756
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:12,041
your bright white, your snow white...

757
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:13,706
Eggshell.

758
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:17,239
Right. There's eggshell.

759
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:20,305
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

760
00:45:20,372 --> 00:45:22,405
I tell you what... why
don't I stop by the hardware

761
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,570
and pick up some different shades,

762
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,737
and we'll figure it out tonight?

763
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,269
We're having a baby, Vern.

764
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:28,235
That's true.

765
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:30,568
No. I mean it's finally sinking in.

766
00:45:30,636 --> 00:45:32,401
We're gonna have a baby.

767
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,567
I can't wait.

768
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:37,266
I'll see you soon.

769
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,464
Is there anything else you need there?

770
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,797
Nope. I'm good.

771
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,362
Come in, Chief.

772
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:54,895
This is Vern. Go ahead.

773
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:56,560
Chief, I'm over at the hospital.

774
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,359
I was checking on the Hess boy, and, uh...

775
00:45:58,428 --> 00:45:59,992
- How is he?
- Oh, you know,

776
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,025
broken collar bone, got
his bell rung pretty good.

777
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:05,591
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

778
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:08,024
Hey, so I got to talking to Sue Roundtree,

779
00:46:08,091 --> 00:46:10,557
and I asked her if they had
any head injuries lately...

780
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:13,188
you know, my theory about
the driver and the wreck...

781
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,687
and she says they did, yesterday.

782
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:18,354
Real peculiar fella,
she says. Real intense.

783
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:20,087
And here's where it gets interesting.

784
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,420
'Cause she says the
fella with the head injury

785
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:25,219
was talking to another
fella about Sam Hess.

786
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:27,584
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

787
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,118
Says the two was thick as thieves.

788
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:30,717
So suddenly I'm thinking,

789
00:46:30,785 --> 00:46:33,049
maybe these two cases,
maybe they're connected, huh?

790
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:35,616
Could be.

791
00:46:35,683 --> 00:46:37,549
She say who the other fellow was?

792
00:46:37,616 --> 00:46:39,882
Uh, Lester Nygaard.

793
00:46:39,949 --> 00:46:41,247
Really?

794
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:44,380
- Oh, you know him?
- Sure, I know Lester.

795
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,713
Sells insurance over at Bo's shop.

796
00:46:46,781 --> 00:46:49,245
Yeah. Yeah, I called
over, and they're closed,

797
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:51,877
so I was gonna go by Lester's place.

798
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:54,144
No, I know Lester. I'll do it.

799
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,310
You call it a day. Good work.

800
00:47:13,138 --> 00:47:17,069
- Lester?
- In the basement.

801
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:30,699
Whatcha doing, hon?

802
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:33,698
I'm, uh, trying to fix the darn thing.

803
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:37,230
It looks like the motor mount broke.

804
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:40,196
You sure you know what you're doing?

805
00:47:40,264 --> 00:47:43,095
Seems pretty straightforward.

806
00:47:43,162 --> 00:47:45,228
So wanna give her a try?

807
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:46,561
There's nothing in it.

808
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:49,227
For... for a test, I'm saying.

809
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,854
Turn it off.

810
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:13,687
Turn it off!

811
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:28,648
You killed it.

812
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:31,148
- You killed my washing machine.
- No, I was...

813
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:33,047
it was the...

814
00:48:33,115 --> 00:48:34,380
the tide, you know?

815
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:36,646
I... I was, um, standing up to the...

816
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,880
I was...

817
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:40,545
I was being a man.

818
00:48:41,746 --> 00:48:43,544
But you're not a man, Lester.

819
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:46,677
You're not even half a man.

820
00:48:46,745 --> 00:48:49,509
Honestly, I don't know what
got into me marrying you.

821
00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:52,075
My mom said, "don't do it, Pearl."

822
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:55,774
She said, "he's the kind of
boy that loses all the time."

823
00:48:55,842 --> 00:48:58,607
"And you know what those
boys grow up to be, don't ya?

824
00:48:58,675 --> 00:49:00,605
Losers."

825
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:02,138
Take that back.

826
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,005
Or what?

827
00:49:04,073 --> 00:49:06,503
What are you gonna do?

828
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,435
You can't even face me
when we're having sex.

829
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:11,801
Now, hold on! That is you not facing me!

830
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:14,501
That's so I can picture a real man.

831
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:17,467
Oh!

832
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:18,699
Hmm.

833
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,366
You take that back.

834
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:24,832
Or what? What are you gonna do?

835
00:49:26,432 --> 00:49:29,296
Oh! You gonna hit me?

836
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:31,163
That's a lau...

837
00:49:35,696 --> 00:49:37,294
Oh.

838
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,458
Aw, jeez.

839
00:49:50,391 --> 00:49:52,656
Aw, jeez. Oh, jeez.

840
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:54,971
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

841
00:50:00,842 --> 00:50:02,573
Oh, God.

842
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:04,240
Oh, God.

843
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:04,389
Uh, yeah, it's me.

844
00:51:04,456 --> 00:51:06,720
You gotta help me out.
I've done something bad.

845
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:08,221
Leroy's Motor Inn.

846
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:11,887
Oh! Hi. Can I have room 23, please?

847
00:51:17,352 --> 00:51:18,617
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

848
00:51:18,685 --> 00:51:21,384
Yeah, it... it's me. It's Lester.

849
00:51:21,451 --> 00:51:24,716
Uh... she's, uh... my
wi... my wife, she's, uh...

850
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:27,448
Oh, hell. Um...

851
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:31,314
Look, I think I, uh...
she's in the basement dead,

852
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:34,080
and, uh, look, I'm freaking out here.

853
00:51:34,148 --> 00:51:36,613
I don't know what to do.

854
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,444
Lester, have you been a bad boy?

855
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:40,811
Ha...

856
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:42,577
jeez.

857
00:51:42,645 --> 00:51:45,077
Yeah.

858
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:46,777
The hammer and, uh... look...

859
00:51:46,844 --> 00:51:49,575
can you come over? I'm
on Willow Creek Drive.

860
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,908
Number 613.

861
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,340
Please!

862
00:51:53,408 --> 00:51:55,073
Please?

863
00:51:57,307 --> 00:51:58,905
Sure, Lester. I'll be right there.

864
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:01,572
Thank you! Thank you.

865
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:06,437
Here we go.

866
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:25,398
What did you do?

867
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:29,430
You killed her!

868
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,061
What did you do?

869
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:40,060
You killed her.

870
00:53:04,654 --> 00:53:06,519
You killed her!

871
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:09,552
Hey, there, Lester.

872
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:18,106
It'll get down to -10 tonight I hear.

873
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:24,237
- Is Pearl home?
- Uh, no, no.

874
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:27,704
She's at my brother's. Okay, then.

875
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,369
How's the nose?

876
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:31,435
Ah, this, uh...

877
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,702
It hurts.

878
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:35,534
How'd it happen anyway?

879
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:37,234
Slipped. Over by the fire station.

880
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:39,733
Ouch. You go to the hospital?

881
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,732
Yeah. They set it.

882
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,598
You talk to anyone while you were there?

883
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:46,731
Uh... What do you mean?

884
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:49,863
Well, the reason I'm here...
I'm not sure you heard.

885
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:52,396
Sam Hess got killed last
night at the Lucky Penny.

886
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:55,028
- Oh... Yeah.
- Nasty business.

887
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:58,027
And, well, I heard you were
talking to another fella

888
00:53:58,095 --> 00:54:00,493
about Hess before he died.

889
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:02,993
Over at the hospital.

890
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,993
No. I don't think so.

891
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,992
What was his name again? The other fella?

892
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:13,855
Ha ha!

893
00:54:13,923 --> 00:54:15,422
You okay, Lester? You seem a bit...

894
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:17,021
seem a bit jumpy.

895
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:19,421
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
just, you know, um...

896
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:23,020
Pearl is gonna be home soon, and, um...

897
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,350
Lester, listen to me very carefully.

898
00:54:30,418 --> 00:54:32,184
I need you to get down on the ground.

899
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:34,184
Now, wait... wait just a second.

900
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,849
- Lester, on the ground.
- This is not what it looks like. Now, hold on.

901
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:39,082
Hold on. Don't...

902
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,682
don't... don't go down there.

903
00:54:40,749 --> 00:54:42,682
Don't... there's nothing down...

904
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,181
that's not... I didn't do nothing.

905
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,713
I didn't... I just got
home. I just got home and...

906
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:47,213
there's nothing down th...

907
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:49,046
that's not... I didn't do nothing.

908
00:54:49,113 --> 00:54:50,312
I didn't do nothing! I didn't do nothing!

909
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,811
I just came home. I just came home.

910
00:54:54,379 --> 00:54:56,710
This is Chief Thurman. I'm
at 613 Willow Creek Drive.

911
00:54:56,778 --> 00:54:59,177
Requesting backup, 613 Willow Creek...

912
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:05,207
Chief.

913
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:07,307
Chief?

914
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:08,707
Chief?

915
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:22,335
Any more?

916
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:27,501
Lester, are there any more cops?

917
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:49,494
What did you tell him?

918
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:50,927
Nothing.

919
00:55:50,995 --> 00:55:54,293
He asked about Sam.

920
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:57,125
You got any more shells for this thing?

921
00:55:57,193 --> 00:55:58,691
No.

922
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:00,958
Is that the basement?

923
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,957
Mm.

924
00:56:18,386 --> 00:56:20,785
Ow, ow. Ow.

925
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:38,813
The police are here.

926
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,979
I said the police are here!

927
00:56:42,046 --> 00:56:44,511
What do we d... do...

928
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:03,606
Officer down.

929
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:05,838
613 Willow Creek Ddrive.

930
00:57:05,905 --> 00:57:08,104
Roger that. Confirming code 3.

931
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:11,604
Bemidji police!

932
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,935
All units, officer in need
of immediate assistance

933
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,934
at 613 Willow Creek Drive.

934
00:57:32,265 --> 00:57:33,997
Bemidji police!

935
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:36,029
If there's someone in the house,

936
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:39,129
come out with your hands up.

937
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,252
Okay.

938
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:41,477
- Molly!
- Oh, God.

939
00:58:41,544 --> 00:58:44,809
Down here!

940
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:48,109
Husband's alive.

941
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:50,408
Oh.

942
00:58:50,476 --> 00:58:52,873
Aw, jeez!

943
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:53,017
Dad. Come in, dad. Over.

944
01:00:55,751 --> 01:00:58,916
Yeah, dad here. Come back.

945
01:00:58,984 --> 01:01:01,515
My team's up by 13. Over.

946
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,013
What happened? Over.

947
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:07,680
Kicked in another field goal. Over.

948
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:11,345
Sweet. You brush your teeth? Over.

949
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:13,511
Yeah. Over.

950
01:01:13,579 --> 01:01:15,844
Homework? Over.

951
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:18,843
Uh, did my math and science.
I still have to do English.

952
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:20,076
Over.

953
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:21,942
Okay, well, as soon as the game's over.

954
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,041
Over.

955
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:42,352
Evening, Officer.

956
01:02:42,419 --> 01:02:43,751
Evening.

957
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:46,517
License and registration, please.

958
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:49,283
We could do it that way.

959
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:51,116
You ask me for my papers.

960
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:54,615
I tell you it's not my
car, that I borrowed it...

961
01:02:54,682 --> 01:02:57,614
see where things go from there.

962
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,279
We could do that.

963
01:02:59,347 --> 01:03:03,311
Or you could go get in
your car and drive away.

964
01:03:04,912 --> 01:03:07,644
Now, why would I do that?

965
01:03:07,712 --> 01:03:10,977
Because some roads you shouldn't go down.

966
01:03:11,045 --> 01:03:15,141
Because maps used to say,
"there be dragons here."

967
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,974
Now they don't.

968
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:23,640
But that don't mean the
dragons aren't there.

969
01:03:23,707 --> 01:03:26,971
Dad. Come in, dad. Over.

970
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,703
You step out of the car, please, sir.

971
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:35,836
How old's your kid?

972
01:03:35,903 --> 01:03:37,836
I said step out of the car.

973
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:40,334
Dad, come in. Dad, over.

974
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:44,666
Let me tell you what's gonna happen...

975
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:47,465
Officer Grimly.

976
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:49,665
I'm going to roll my window up,

977
01:03:49,732 --> 01:03:51,598
then I'm going to drive away,

978
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,930
and you're gonna go home to your daughter,

979
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,663
and every few years, you're
gonna look at her face

980
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:58,762
and know that you're
alive because you chose

981
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,994
not to go down a certain
road on a certain night,

982
01:04:02,062 --> 01:04:03,794
that you chose to walk into the light

983
01:04:03,862 --> 01:04:06,260
instead of into the darkness.

984
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,290
Do you understand me?

985
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:18,656
Sir...

986
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:21,455
I'm rolling up my window.

987
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:47,815
Dad. Come in, dad.

988
01:04:47,882 --> 01:04:49,747
Over.

989
01:04:52,314 --> 01:04:54,912
Dad? Are you there?

990
01:04:54,979 --> 01:04:57,579
Over.

991
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:56,959
So I got two kinds of
sandwiches... tuna and turkey.

992
01:05:57,027 --> 01:05:58,759
Tuna's for the fish.

993
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:01,592
Unless you think they'd
think that's cannibalism.

994
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:05,624
You know... I been looking for
more help in the restaurant.

995
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:09,623
You know, someone to seat
customers and answer the phone.

996
01:06:09,691 --> 01:06:12,089
- A hostess.
- That what they call it?

997
01:06:12,157 --> 01:06:14,555
Yah. Huh.

998
01:06:15,822 --> 01:06:17,287
Anyway...

999
01:06:17,354 --> 01:06:21,720
not sure if that's something
you might be interested in.

1000
01:06:21,788 --> 01:06:24,252
I'm a police officer, dad.

1001
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,251
Well, sure, I know that.

1002
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:27,797
I also know that people in this world

1003
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:30,749
are less inclined to shoot a hostess

1004
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:34,449
than, say, an officer of the law.

1005
01:06:34,517 --> 01:06:36,582
That's true. So...

1006
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:40,414
That mean you're gonna
help your old man out?

1007
01:06:40,482 --> 01:06:42,980
Nope.

1008
01:06:43,048 --> 01:06:46,578
But maybe you could put that in the ad.

1009
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:50,510
Listen, on second thought,

1010
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:53,177
I think I'm gonna head into work.

1011
01:06:53,244 --> 01:06:56,043
Rain check on the fishing?

1012
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:58,876
Sounds good.

1013
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,075
Love you, dad.

1014
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:03,607
Love you too, hon.
