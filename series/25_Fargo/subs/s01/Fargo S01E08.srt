1
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,487
Mr. Nygaard?

2
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,923
Oh, you betcha.

3
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,596
- She's a beaut.
- Yeah.

4
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:09,599
Got the low water feature
but don't skimp on torque.

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,100
Am I taking the old one?

6
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,501
Yeah, if that's...

7
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,403
They said on the phone
it'd be no problem.

8
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:17,840
Oh, sure. It's no problem.

9
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:19,042
The T-160, huh?

10
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:20,576
- Mm.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:22,478
Jeez.

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,647
See why you're trading her in.

13
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,347
She's a real lemon.

14
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:28,617
Motor mount. Chinese
used plastic screws.

15
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,885
Bet she bucked like a bronco.

16
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:32,188
You do not know the half of it.

17
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,856
Stopped making 'em pretty quick.

18
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:35,792
Recalled, I think.

19
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:39,162
Surprised to see
her, truth be told.

20
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:41,463
You'd be better off washing
your clothes between two rocks,

21
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:42,933
you know what I mean?

22
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:27,477
They got Chazz up at
Faribault till the trial.

23
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,348
Gordo's at Red Wing, which is...

24
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,918
Well, you know, at
least they're close.

25
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:38,320
His lawyer thinks we can
plea it down to probation,

26
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,923
time served.

27
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,056
For murder?

28
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:43,360
- No, Gordo...
- Oh.

29
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,961
- On the gun charge.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:47,931
Chazz? Well, good riddance.

31
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,133
Don't care what that man gets.
No, sir.

32
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,891
Not after what he did.

33
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,971
Killing my wife, you mean?

34
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:57,106
Oh. Well, yeah.

35
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,407
Yeah, of course that.

36
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:59,643
But also...

37
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:04,713
Well, I mean, look at me.

38
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:08,384
I was Miss Hubbard
County, for Pete's sake.

39
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,987
You don't cheat on
Miss Hubbard County.

40
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,626
I just don't believe
it, you know?

41
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,128
I mean, just three weeks ago,

42
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,532
we were sitting
around the table...

43
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:25,634
eating ham.

44
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:28,204
And now Gordo's having
his night terrors again.

45
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,705
Plus, we have to sell everything

46
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:31,241
to pay the legal bills.

47
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:33,242
Did you know...

48
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,745
Chazz bought a time
share in a boat?

49
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,213
Well, I didn't even
know that was a thing.

50
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,481
Yeah, it's a thing.

51
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:43,819
So if there's anything
from the house you want...

52
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:47,556
you know, like I was thinking
maybe Chazz's hunting gear...

53
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:49,758
I boxed it up for you.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,895
Not sure it's anything you want.

55
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,263
Oh, sure. That'd...
that'd be fine.

56
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:54,497
Thank you.

57
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:11,014
Well...

58
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:13,282
Listen. If there's
anything I can do.

59
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:15,685
Oh, Lester, you are so sweet.

60
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,187
I am the one who
should be saying that

61
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:21,557
after what he did
to you, my husband.

62
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,293
Ooh, what'd you get?

63
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:25,028
New washer.

64
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:26,795
The old one...

65
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:30,432
Well, I had to get rid of
everything from the basement,

66
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,302
you know, on account
of all the...

67
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,404
You deserve it, Lester.

68
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:37,639
All good things, you deserve.

69
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,577
Sync and corrections by
n17t01 www.addic7ed.com.

70
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,786
Back to it, then?

71
00:05:57,788 --> 00:05:59,389
Looks like.

72
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,790
Doc cleared me for duty, so...

73
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:02,925
Ooh.

74
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:07,497
More flowers came for
you from Duluth.

75
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:16,105
A smarter man would think
you were being wooed.

76
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:19,742
I don't know what
you're talking about.

77
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:23,745
Put 'em up where we
can see 'em at least.

78
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,920
So you got a strategy
on this Lester thing?

79
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:34,624
Well, I'm just gonna walk
in and say, "Bill, we... ".

80
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,459
If you think it's best.

81
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:40,129
The direct approach.

82
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,197
Your point being?

83
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,966
Got no point.

84
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,637
Okay.

85
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,805
Bye, dad.

86
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,658
Chief, are you busy?

87
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,192
What's that?

88
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:11,560
Said, "Are you busy?"

89
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:14,297
Got a request for
your attendance.

90
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,865
Can it wait?

91
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,466
I just ate an omelet.

92
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,302
Waiting for it to digest.

93
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:21,303
Oh, yeah? What kind?

94
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,473
Well, it was mushrooms
and cheese.

95
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,343
- Sally make it?
- Yeah.

96
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,411
She wrapped it in tinfoil
to keep it warm.

97
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,915
Molly needs you is the thing.

98
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,819
Asked me to see if you'd
come down to the staff room.

99
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:38,353
She's back already?

100
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:39,988
- Yep.
- Hmm.

101
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,225
Thought I had another day.

102
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:43,759
All right.

103
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,262
Let's go see what
we're gonna do today.

104
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,005
There she is, the gunfighter.

105
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:58,007
Hey, Chief.

106
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,608
Nice collage.

107
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,512
You take up basket weaving
too in your downtime?

108
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:04,514
Yeah, it's just some loose
ends I wanted to...

109
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,882
Molly, before you...

110
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,516
I want you to know...

111
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,351
I'm not too proud to say

112
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:11,420
I was wrong on the Lester case.

113
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,221
I had the wrong idea.

114
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,057
I thought it was
a drifter thing,

115
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,927
which was the wrong
way to go, clearly.

116
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,728
But, you know, some
good police work,

117
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,264
and we caught the guy, so...

118
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,533
Well, that...
that's the problem,

119
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:29,038
actually, is that
you're still...

120
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,206
Still what?

121
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:35,278
Wrong.

122
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,746
I'm sorry... I mean,
no disrespect.

123
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:38,880
It's just...

124
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,649
it doesn't make any sense.

125
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,284
I mean... I mean, the brother?

126
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,553
With all the things
we know are true?

127
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,123
I've been lying in bed
just thinking about this.

128
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,491
And for example, okay,
if it was the brother,

129
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:50,927
then how do we explain
the phone call

130
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,461
from Lester's to the motel...

131
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:54,163
Molly, darn it now, just...

132
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:57,899
You can't keep going over...

133
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,568
It's time.

134
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:01,070
You got to let it go.

135
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,437
We did our job.

136
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,573
The brother Nygaard
killed the wife.

137
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:06,775
And he cornered and
shot the Chief.

138
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:08,110
And Lester was covering for him

139
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,412
on account of the brother thing,

140
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:13,115
which explains...

141
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:14,850
We had drinks to celebrate.

142
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:16,852
I had a Greyhound

143
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,988
and Knutson had... what
was it with the cherry?

144
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,989
A Rob Roy.

145
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,591
Rob Roy. Yeah.

146
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,192
You had a few of them,
if I'm not mistaken.

147
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:24,659
What about the Hess case?

148
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:25,794
What about it?

149
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:26,928
It's still open, yeah?

150
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,764
Yeah, no. See...

151
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,200
we're checking to see if the
hooker had a boyfriend.

152
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,601
Jealous type, you know?

153
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:33,970
Didn't like her
getting tooled by

154
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,203
every Tom, Dick, and
Jane, but otherwise...

155
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,038
- Who's working that now?
- Terry.

156
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,777
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:42,711
Except Terry doesn't always know

158
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:46,682
which end of a mop to
use to wash the floor.

159
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:49,451
He's not the brightest bulb.
I'll give you that.

160
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:51,721
But he's soldiering through.

161
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:54,289
Well, good for him.

162
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,192
Except I'm back now.

163
00:09:56,193 --> 00:09:57,360
- No.
- Chief, please.

164
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,227
No, Molly, Deputy.

165
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,863
Now, I would give it to you,

166
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:04,000
I would, except we
both know in two days,

167
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,735
I'd be back in this room
with you pointing at names

168
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,836
on that whiteboard and
me chewing my tie.

169
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,038
Just please, Chief,
for Pete's sake,

170
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,475
I've got evidence that
puts Lester Nygaard

171
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:15,477
in a room with a known killer
on the day of the Hess murder,

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,679
and then the next night,
Lester called the guy.

173
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:20,316
- He called him at the motel.
- Look,

174
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:24,086
you can't... That's just
how it is sometimes.

175
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,620
Life.

176
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:28,323
You know, you go to
bed unsatisfied.

177
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,559
They're calling lottery
numbers on the TV,

178
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:32,061
and you get the first few,

179
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,562
and already in your mind,

180
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:35,865
you're buying a jet or
a fjord or whatever,

181
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,700
but it's just not meant to be.

182
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,802
It's just not meant to be.

183
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,341
Hey, look.

184
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,344
We're all real glad to
have you back, okay?

185
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,212
You're a heck of a
police officer.

186
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,517
Tell her about the cake.

187
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,919
The guys are gonna have
a cake for you later.

188
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,589
Try to look surprised.

189
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,724
It's... It's really something.

190
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:04,759
It's got an assault rifle on top

191
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,895
made of frosting,

192
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:08,697
which I don't know
how they do that.

193
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,131
But...

194
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,303
Heya, Lester.

195
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:45,873
I like your tie.

196
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,307
Thank you.

197
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,375
I got it online.

198
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:49,644
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,879
- Oh.
- Jacket too.

200
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,682
I was a bit nervous
about it at first.

201
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,884
Had to send the jacket
back once, actually.

202
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,821
It was too big in the arms.

203
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:02,056
Well, I think you look terrific.

204
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:03,490
Oh.

205
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,892
And, um...

206
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:06,594
I was thinking of
making some chili

207
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:07,894
on Saturday night

208
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:10,096
if you maybe wanted to join me.

209
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,966
Where is he?

210
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,501
You son of a bitch.

211
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:16,403
I am gonna bust your balls.

212
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,605
You want me to do it, ma?

213
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:20,607
- Yeah, ma, want us to?
- Shut up!

214
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,909
I am gonna bust your balls.

215
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:24,946
Now, Mrs. Hess, what
can I do for you?

216
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,581
Don't you "Mrs. Hess" me.

217
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:29,115
I was picking your pubes out
of my teeth 12 hours ago,

218
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,448
and then I get this?

219
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:41,725
That is...

220
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,528
This is highly irregular.

221
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,731
I'll make some calls.

222
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,933
- Liar.
- Mrs. Hess.

223
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,134
Liar.

224
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:53,370
- You knew the whole time.
- No, no.

225
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,041
Missus... Gina, this is...
This...

226
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,442
Listen. I'm gonna
make some calls.

227
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,445
Like I said... I was
speaking to the guy

228
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,745
from mid claims just yesterday.

229
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,581
He didn't mention
a single thing...

230
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,917
I let you come inside of me.

231
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,217
Ma, that's really gross.

232
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,120
Yeah, ma, don't talk like that.

233
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,054
Come on, we don't need to bring
that into the conversation.

234
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,157
You are gonna get me my money,

235
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,658
you little shit.

236
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,994
$2 million.

237
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,462
You've got until the
end of the day.

238
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,099
Show him what we'll do.

239
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,168
Jesus.

240
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,105
All right. All right.

241
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,173
Sorry, loser.

242
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,240
Me too.

243
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,580
Yeah.

244
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,782
So are we calm?

245
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,450
Are we calm?

246
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,688
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

247
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,423
I'm gonna make some calls,

248
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,426
like I said.

249
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,461
Because this is the
first that I've...

250
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,432
But if it's true... If Sam
did miss some payments,

251
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,534
then, well, they're
within their rights to...

252
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,774
I think we might
have a problem here.

253
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,532
That was...

254
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,633
Sorry you had to
see that, Linda.

255
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,902
No, I'm... That was...

256
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,605
You're amazing.

257
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,652
He'll be right out.

258
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,205
Follow.

259
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:45,817
Sir, we...

260
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,423
What Agent Pepper
is trying to say,

261
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:52,792
the syndicate spree killing,

262
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:54,427
yes, technically, we were there

263
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:58,096
outside in our car
while it was...

264
00:15:58,099 --> 00:15:59,532
But you have to...

265
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,533
You have to see
it as a positive,

266
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,537
uh, because it leaves us...

267
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:06,706
myself and Agent Budge...

268
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,441
- it leaves us...
- Poised.

269
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:09,607
That's the word we like.

270
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,076
Poised to catch this guy.

271
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:13,546
Because, sir, first of all,

272
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:16,315
we got this photo from an
ATM across the street.

273
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:18,317
It captures our... A
single individual

274
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:20,552
who's clearly armed
and about to...

275
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:22,822
Now, the photo's not
great, but I...

276
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:26,325
We were thinking
definitely white male.

277
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,168
Sir.

278
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,778
Listen, sir.

279
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,947
This is where you work now.

280
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,982
We are highly effective,
highly trained...

281
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:52,908
I have a commendation.

282
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,511
A commendation?

283
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,913
That's your...

284
00:17:04,386 --> 00:17:05,788
Okay.

285
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,190
Okay.

286
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,992
It's...

287
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:13,528
You know, we're still...
We're still good.

288
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,797
We're still alive.

289
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,333
He could have...

290
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,634
It could be worse, right?

291
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:21,804
Much, much worse.

292
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,705
Yeah.

293
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:28,242
This right here...
two weeks, tops.

294
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:30,645
He just wants to see
us sweat a little,

295
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:33,414
feel the...

296
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,751
No, I mean, that's...
It's only fair.

297
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:38,854
I can see that.

298
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,490
I mean, we did...

299
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,491
I mean, 22 people
did get killed,

300
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:47,096
and we were sitting in the
car like a couple of...

301
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:53,368
Yeah, we're okay.
We're all right.

302
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,614
Never heard of a deaf hit man.

303
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,414
Carolina Murphy had
his tongue cut out

304
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:49,050
by an Indian back in the '80s.

305
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:50,419
He worked a little after that

306
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:54,056
but never quite the same.

307
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:56,759
And Buzz Mead... you know Buzz?

308
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:02,131
He was born with just a socket.

309
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,901
Used to take his glass
eye out at parties

310
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,636
and drop it in his drink.

311
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:11,635
He was a shit shot, though.

312
00:20:11,637 --> 00:20:14,605
Now, the other
fella, your partner,

313
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:17,741
he could hear just fine.

314
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:21,746
We had a kind of little chat
before I cut his throat.

315
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:37,662
You're unemployed
now, by the way,

316
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:39,597
in case you don't
read the papers.

317
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:49,473
I watched a bear once.

318
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:52,277
His leg was in a steel trap.

319
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:56,513
It chewed through bloody
bone to get free.

320
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,650
It was in Alaska.

321
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:05,423
Died about an hour later
facedown in a stream.

322
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:11,730
But it was on his own
terms, you know?

323
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:33,817
You got close.

324
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,756
Closer than anybody else.

325
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,499
I don't know if it was
you or your partner,

326
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,166
but look.

327
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,736
If you still feel raw about
things when you heal up,

328
00:21:51,738 --> 00:21:54,538
come see me.

329
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,964
Just me and Bill, right?

330
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,133
Slow night.

331
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,368
And the call comes in.

332
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:26,403
He don't like when
I tell this story.

333
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:29,807
Heard you got some flowers.

334
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,241
Yeah.

335
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:33,178
Some people do love
to flap their lips.

336
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,779
More than once, what I heard.

337
00:22:35,781 --> 00:22:37,781
Well, there's a suitor

338
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,718
is all I'm prepared to say.

339
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:46,790
Vern was so bad at courtship.

340
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:52,262
One time he gave me a
bouquet of poison ivy.

341
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:53,798
Picked it himself.

342
00:22:58,403 --> 00:23:01,605
He's up in Duluth,

343
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:04,142
my gentleman.

344
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:06,478
Has a daughter.

345
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,878
What's his name?

346
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:11,615
They call him Sergio.

347
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,050
He's a pirate, I think.

348
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,318
Very funny, you.

349
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,653
Well...

350
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:18,088
Yours is the one
with the icing clip.

351
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,797
And, Ida, your frosting comes
from the barrel, I think.

352
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,500
Good to have everyone together
again, don't you think?

353
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:29,804
It's like one big, happy, uh...

354
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:35,175
Which is good, is all.

355
00:23:43,352 --> 00:23:45,586
I wanted to thank you

356
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,355
for catching the guy.

357
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:49,857
Not me.

358
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,459
- I was in bed.
- Stop.

359
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:53,862
You were in the
hospital with a bullet.

360
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,663
No.

361
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:56,998
Bill may have made the arrest,

362
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,002
but we both know who
did the real work.

363
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,605
He's not convicted yet.

364
00:24:09,478 --> 00:24:12,747
I mean, not all the evidence...

365
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,883
For me, there are still...

366
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:21,588
But yeah, no, I'm
glad it's behind us.

367
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,441
Deputy Solverson.

368
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:47,509
Yeah, hi. It's Gus.

369
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:48,943
Grimly.

370
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,247
Oh, yeah, hi.

371
00:27:53,784 --> 00:27:55,951
So what's happening, then?

372
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:59,422
You know, on patrol.

373
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:01,990
Oh, sure, yeah.

374
00:28:01,992 --> 00:28:03,425
I helped a fella

375
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:06,295
who got his privates
stuck to a mailbox.

376
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:08,530
Oh.

377
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:10,165
Didn't like his mail?

378
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,035
Something like that.

379
00:28:15,372 --> 00:28:18,106
There's the hearing
tomorrow on the shooting.

380
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:20,875
Oh, yeah.

381
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,510
That's...

382
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:25,815
That's tomorrow.

383
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,883
Well, just tell the truth.

384
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:29,718
Don't you think?

385
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,354
It was a whiteout, and...

386
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:35,523
you saw a shadow,
and you shot at it.

387
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:37,058
But leave out the part...

388
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,626
Yeah, leave out the part

389
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:40,962
where the person
you shot was me.

390
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:47,036
I am really sorry about that.

391
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:52,007
Yeah, I gathered from
the volume of flowers.

392
00:28:53,175 --> 00:28:54,343
Too much?

393
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:56,244
No.

394
00:28:57,314 --> 00:28:58,747
No, it's nice.

395
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:04,420
So, um...

396
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:05,855
I saw in the paper this morning

397
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:08,656
the Logging Festival's coming up

398
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,893
over in your neck
of the, you know...

399
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:12,928
and Greta, you know, she
really likes going to that.

400
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,430
Yeah, me too.

401
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:16,164
Yeah? Good.

402
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,733
Good. Well, maybe, um...

403
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:20,568
I mean...

404
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,938
maybe we'll see you there.

405
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,143
Yeah, a certainty
if we go together.

406
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:30,412
Yeah. Yeah.

407
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:32,114
That's...

408
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,018
You're right about that.

409
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:39,020
And when you're
right, you're right.

410
00:29:39,022 --> 00:29:41,690
On Friday there's
chain saw carving

411
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:44,660
and all you can eat.

412
00:29:44,662 --> 00:29:48,163
And on Saturday they
roast a pig underground.

413
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,432
I've never had it, but
it's supposed to be good.

414
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:51,967
Oh.

415
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:54,068
I didn't know that
you could do that.

416
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:57,839
On Sundays they do a
pie eating contest.

417
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,674
Yeah, yeah. No, I...

418
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:01,977
You know, I like to
just go for the food.

419
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:03,945
Greta likes...

420
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,806
Dad. Come in, dad. Over.

421
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:09,510
Dad here. Come back.

422
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:13,848
What's the deal with dinner?
Over.

423
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:15,651
Yeah, just finishing up.

424
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:18,854
Thought we'd do tacos tonight.
Over.

425
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,521
Okay, don't forget
the red sauce.

426
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:22,790
Over and out.

427
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:59,528
- ♪- ♪ everything was ready ♪

428
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:01,363
I'm home!

429
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:05,034
You forgot the food, didn't ya?

430
00:32:08,104 --> 00:32:09,605
- Mom home?
- Yeah.

431
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:10,739
That your dad?

432
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,108
He remember the red sauce?

433
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:17,578
Ah, shoot. I can go back.

434
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,115
Nah, it's okay. I think we got
some left from last time.

435
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:21,817
Go get changed up,
you, and let's eat.

436
00:32:21,818 --> 00:32:23,218
- I'm starving.
- Yeah.

437
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:27,756
Why don't you just put
'em on the table?

438
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:31,125
- Okay.
- Thanks, Greta.

439
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:32,060
Okay.

440
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:40,458
Dad wants to know about
the game Sunday.

441
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,166
Watch his place or...

442
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:43,801
I thought we could
watch it here.

443
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:45,430
You know, I could make
that pasta thing.

444
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:49,340
- Hmm.
- The one with the peas?

445
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,710
Capers. You liked it last time.

446
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,144
Oh, don't forget,
we got that thing

447
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,346
at Ida's on Saturday,
the anniversary.

448
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:57,115
No, I remember.

449
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,549
It was a week before I met you.

450
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:03,422
Anniversary of what?

451
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,059
Ah, just your, uh...

452
00:33:08,127 --> 00:33:10,095
Molly had a friend of hers
that got killed last year,

453
00:33:10,163 --> 00:33:13,365
so we'll over there
and pay our respects.

454
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,234
It was, um, Vern, right?

455
00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:17,935
Yeah.

456
00:33:18,003 --> 00:33:19,404
He was the chief before Bill.

457
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:21,006
Hired me.

458
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,374
Ida, the lady with the baby...

459
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:24,777
- Yeah.
- Is his wife.

460
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:26,077
Which, speaking of, she asked

461
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:28,747
if we could bring drinks.

462
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:33,251
Yeah, I still got some of
that Halloween beer I made.

463
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:37,155
Seem to remember you
spitting that on the floor.

464
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:38,824
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

465
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,958
I'll go to the store.

466
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:41,059
Mm-hmm.

467
00:33:41,126 --> 00:33:42,193
You okay?

468
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,328
Oh, sure.

469
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:44,363
Just hard to sit that long.

470
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:47,031
Legs go to sleep.

471
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:41,788
FBI.

472
00:34:41,855 --> 00:34:43,322
Hi.

473
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,525
Deputy Solverson again.
Bemidji Police.

474
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:47,592
Yes?

475
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:48,960
Well, I called a
couple times now

476
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:50,829
about the Fargo
syndicate massacre,

477
00:34:50,898 --> 00:34:53,099
how I might know the
fella responsible,

478
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,434
meaning he's a suspect
in a case we...

479
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:56,835
Yeah, I see your name
in the computer.

480
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:58,304
Looks like those suspicions

481
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,539
were investigated and dismissed.

482
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:01,507
Yeah, well, they
sent a fella down,

483
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:03,576
but I'm not sure he really...

484
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,277
Well, do you have any
new information?

485
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,512
No.

486
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,282
No, I just...

487
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:11,617
You know, a lot of
people are dead, so...

488
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:14,253
I'll put a note in
the file you called.

489
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,121
Okay, but...

490
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,222
But I wouldn't expect
a callback, though.

491
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,623
We're pretty busy these days,

492
00:35:18,692 --> 00:35:22,195
with the Patriot Act and all.

493
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:44,483
The file room.

494
00:35:46,652 --> 00:35:49,387
A room with files.

495
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:52,958
Say you took one of them out.

496
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,059
Took it where?

497
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,494
Doesn't matter.

498
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:57,797
Say you took one
of the files out.

499
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,365
Is it still the file room?

500
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:04,003
Pizza today, right?

501
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,271
In the cafeteria?

502
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,873
Or is it meat loaf?

503
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,501
No, I'm saying that
you and I both agree

504
00:36:09,509 --> 00:36:10,876
that the file room

505
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:13,445
minus one file

506
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:15,581
is still the file room.

507
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:18,617
Now, say you took
another one out

508
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:20,219
and then another.

509
00:36:20,286 --> 00:36:23,021
If the file room minus one file

510
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,690
is still a file room,

511
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:27,525
and you keep subtracting
one at a time,

512
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,961
you could end up
with zero files...

513
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,664
I'm saying, logically...
or even negative files,

514
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,800
- and it would still...
- How do you have negative files?

515
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:38,603
No, I'm just...
Logically, I'm saying.

516
00:36:38,672 --> 00:36:41,239
Except no one's taking files.

517
00:36:41,307 --> 00:36:43,041
They just bring more.

518
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,342
What about a cemetery?

519
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,211
I mean, remove one
body from a cemetery,

520
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,480
it's still a cemetery.

521
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:50,248
But a cemetery with no bodies,

522
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:51,516
what's that?

523
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,418
Condos.

524
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:24,483
Okay, this is...

525
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,786
Well, these are my
officers, so...

526
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,221
Where is everybody?

527
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,690
Coffee run. Who's this then?

528
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:34,427
Oh, this is Tahir. He's...

529
00:37:34,494 --> 00:37:36,929
- Hey.
- Hello. I am Tahir.

530
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:39,532
I'm Molly. Deputy Solverson.

531
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, so remember, I told you

532
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:42,568
me and Sally were
taking in a foster.

533
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,269
Uh, yeah, from Africa.

534
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:45,403
Yeah, except...

535
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,039
I am from Sudan.

536
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:48,641
You know, Lost Boy?

537
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,009
I sure do.

538
00:37:50,077 --> 00:37:52,411
Welcome to America.

539
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,878
I thought there was
a problem, though.

540
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:56,614
Oh, I'll say. Kid disappeared.

541
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,951
Disappeared how?

542
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:00,585
Oh, tell her the story.

543
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,686
Oh.

544
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,054
This is the craziest thing.

545
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:05,257
All right, you go on.
You tell her.

546
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,193
In my village, I tend goats.

547
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,427
You know goats?

548
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,929
Uh-huh.

549
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,996
One day, men came

550
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:13,065
and kill everyone.

551
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,934
Mothers, fathers,
brothers, sisters.

552
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,403
Jeez.

553
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:19,405
I alone am free.

554
00:38:19,472 --> 00:38:20,773
Three days I walk.

555
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,543
Then I meet nice people...
Americans.

556
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:27,847
These nice people put me

557
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:30,782
airplane to America.

558
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,052
Land of free.

559
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,619
Home of brave.

560
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,222
Yeah, to us.

561
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:37,456
He's coming to live with us.

562
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,157
Yeah. Go on.

563
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:40,259
At the airport,

564
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:42,994
man says, "Take a bag?"

565
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:46,097
He say he's getting
a car, but...

566
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,900
he doesn't come back.

567
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,902
Guy stole his bag.
Can you believe it?

568
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,570
A refugee.

569
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:53,338
One day and one night

570
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:55,041
I wait at the airport,

571
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:57,510
but this man, he
does not come back.

572
00:38:57,577 --> 00:39:01,447
I have no money and no paper.

573
00:39:01,514 --> 00:39:03,748
Nice woman says,
"Tell policeman,"

574
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:05,885
but I am afraid.

575
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:08,721
I told her I have
a family waiting.

576
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:11,090
Nice family.

577
00:39:11,157 --> 00:39:12,757
American family.

578
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:15,594
But the name is in the
bag and the number.

579
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:18,998
Nice woman give
me coat and money

580
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:19,998
to take the bus.

581
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,333
So not all bad.

582
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,170
I take the bus to the city.

583
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,806
But I am very hungry.

584
00:39:26,873 --> 00:39:29,675
Four days I no eat.

585
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,376
Then I see a store.

586
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:33,344
You know...

587
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,347
July in... January?

588
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,750
Phoenix Farms.

589
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:39,684
Yes! Phoenix Farms.

590
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,588
Should I tell her this?

591
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:43,722
Oh.

592
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,356
So...

593
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,791
he shoplifts.

594
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,494
Takes some food.

595
00:39:49,563 --> 00:39:50,429
In fact, he does it every day

596
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:53,065
for... how long?

597
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:55,534
- Three months.
- Three months.

598
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,369
Meanwhile, we're frantic.

599
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,903
You remember? All
those phone calls?

600
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:00,039
Me raising my voice?

601
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,074
How could you lose
a kid from Africa

602
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:03,809
in freakin' Minnesota?

603
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:06,411
Every day I steal food, but...

604
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,148
I am ashamed.

605
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,916
I don't want to steal.

606
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:15,221
I want to work, but
what work can I do?

607
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,956
Then a week ago,

608
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,958
Sally and I are heading into
the city to the ballet.

609
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,693
You went to the ballet?

610
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,329
Sally likes the ballet, yeah.

611
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:26,231
So... Go ahead. Finish.

612
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,367
I am looking around the store.

613
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,735
Skittles and peanut butter cups.

614
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:34,106
Then this man grabs me.

615
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:35,940
I think I am arrested.

616
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:36,942
It's me!

617
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,677
Is the point of the story.

618
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,211
All those weeks
looking for the kid,

619
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,947
writing letters,
making phone calls,

620
00:40:42,014 --> 00:40:43,748
we even put up flyers.

621
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,451
And then I stop by a supermarket

622
00:40:45,518 --> 00:40:46,985
in a city I don't live,

623
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:49,788
all so Sally can have
Chex Mix at the ballet,

624
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:50,856
and there's the kid.

625
00:40:50,923 --> 00:40:53,159
Like, what are the odds?

626
00:40:53,226 --> 00:40:54,927
I can't even imagine.

627
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,927
I'm so worried

628
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,197
and thinking I am arrested.

629
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,766
But Mr. Bill is

630
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,302
hugging me and crying.

631
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:05,570
Yeah, well,

632
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,306
you know...

633
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:08,407
And...

634
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:10,943
look where I am at,

635
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,813
who I'm with, my
American family.

636
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,920
Sally says it's a miracle.

637
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,815
I don't know. It might be.

638
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:19,385
But don't question the universe.

639
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:20,619
That's my motto.

640
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,623
Sometimes things just work out.

641
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,592
Yeah, I like to
think that's true.

642
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,126
Yeah.

643
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:31,896
We found ya, buddy. We found ya.

644
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,045
It causes you to
have hallucinations.

645
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,815
- What?
- I'll be glad to explain it to you.

646
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,215
It's a sort of a nightmare
where your dreams

647
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:47,684
go pell-mell helter
skelter in a month.

648
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:49,085
Oh, shut up.

649
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:52,556
Pell-mell.

650
00:41:52,557 --> 00:41:54,724
Hello. Inspector
Clancy speaking.

651
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:56,393
You need something?

652
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:59,795
No, I'm good. Go back to sleep.

653
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:00,996
Stand back, everybody.

654
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,199
I got you covered. Stand back.

655
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:04,601
Chief! Chief!

656
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:11,173
Well, what's the
meaning of this?

657
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:12,742
Police parading all
over the hotel.

658
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:14,643
Who sent for you?
Why are you here?

659
00:42:14,646 --> 00:42:15,945
Well, this is Mr.
Williams' suite.

660
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:17,114
Mr. Williams has been murdered.

661
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:18,514
Murdered?

662
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:20,250
- Quiet, everybody.
- You be quiet.

663
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:21,650
And that goes for all of you.

664
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:23,018
Yeah, the Chief is right.

665
00:42:23,021 --> 00:42:24,753
Noise, bed-li-ham,
who can think?

666
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:26,322
Well, you can't, so shut up.

667
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:27,389
Where's the body?

668
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:29,126
In there.

669
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:35,699
Now, what did you do that for?

670
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,690
Well, isn't a girl
supposed to scream

671
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:39,291
'gonna see a dead body?

672
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:42,061
Uh, quiet now. Come on
in here, all of you.

673
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:46,766
We're doing good.

674
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,635
I'm up.

675
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:50,103
I'm sorry.

676
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:03,516
I was just saying
we're doing good,

677
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,485
you know?

678
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:07,387
Mm-hmm.

679
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,722
But it was here, Inspector.

680
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:10,889
Wasn't it, Johnny?

681
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,858
We got everything we need.

682
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,293
Mm-hmm.

683
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:15,594
That's preposterous.

684
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:17,063
No one would dare
commit a murder

685
00:43:17,065 --> 00:43:18,530
in this hotel without
first notifying me.

686
00:43:18,532 --> 00:43:20,467
Are you sure you
weren't seeing things?

687
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:21,568
No, of course he
wasn't seeing things.

688
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,472
Well, I'm going to sleep.

689
00:43:25,474 --> 00:43:27,574
Just as I told you, Inspector.

690
00:43:27,576 --> 00:43:29,509
Remember the old saying,
"Where there's gun smoke",

691
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,744
there's always a murder."

692
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:34,646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:37,349
Yeah, me too.

694
00:43:37,351 --> 00:43:39,219
Oh, it's Jeff, the night porter.

695
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:41,221
I left him here to
watch the body.

696
00:43:42,391 --> 00:43:45,956
What happened?

697
00:43:47,927 --> 00:43:50,327
What happened?

698
00:43:50,329 --> 00:43:52,264
I was standing around,
scared stiff,

699
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,666
and all of a sudden,
the lights went out.

700
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:56,067
Then something hit
me on the head.

701
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,469
Then the lights went out again.

702
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,304
That's all I know,

703
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:01,226
and that's all I'm gonna
wait around to find out.

704
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:29,067
Stun Meadows, everybody.
Give it up.

705
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:33,237
Yowzer. How does he do it, huh?

706
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,940
Check your wallets,
ladies and gentlemen.

707
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,375
Make sure he didn't
make those vanish too.

708
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,246
Well, it's been a big year

709
00:44:41,248 --> 00:44:43,114
for insurance...

710
00:44:43,115 --> 00:44:45,083
a banner year.

711
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:47,152
Reserve trends are up.

712
00:44:47,153 --> 00:44:48,987
And...

713
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:52,623
loss ratios are down
a whopping 17%.

714
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,798
And those are just numbers.

715
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,802
We all know that behind
every insurance policy

716
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:08,405
and the reinsurance policy
covering that policy...

717
00:45:09,608 --> 00:45:11,742
There's a salesman.

718
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:14,311
A man or woman

719
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:16,981
knocking on doors, making calls,

720
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:18,949
matching people and businesses

721
00:45:18,952 --> 00:45:22,320
with the right plan
for their needs.

722
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:25,190
And so without further delay,

723
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:26,824
I give you.

724
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:31,028
Insurance Salesman
of the Year 2007...

725
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,030
Lester Nygaard.

726
00:45:33,632 --> 00:45:35,532
Boy. Come on.

727
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,476
Thank you.

728
00:45:45,478 --> 00:45:47,478
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

729
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,280
Thank you so much. That...

730
00:45:49,282 --> 00:45:53,717
Oh, jeez. That's a real honor.

731
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,853
Now...

732
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,521
See, I knew I should
have memorized this.

733
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:01,192
Suddenly doesn't...

734
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:02,793
Speak from the heart.

735
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:06,063
- Speak from the heart.
- Okay.

736
00:46:07,733 --> 00:46:10,568
Those of you that know me

737
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,471
know it's been a tough
year for me personally...

738
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:17,409
and that I wouldn't
have gotten through it

739
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:18,876
without the love and support

740
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:22,112
of my beautiful wife, Linda.

741
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:23,081
Let's give her a hand.

742
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,817
I love you, Linda.

743
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:36,661
You know, you can go
through your whole life

744
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,898
without a care,

745
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,402
and one day it all changes.

746
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:47,137
People die.

747
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:50,074
They lose their homes.

748
00:46:50,077 --> 00:46:53,577
They go to prison.

749
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:55,679
It's calamity, huh?

750
00:46:55,681 --> 00:46:59,451
I know it, 'cause I lived it.

751
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:01,952
And if this year has
taught me anything...

752
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:03,721
and believe me,
I've seen it all...

753
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:09,059
it's that the worst does happen.

754
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:11,429
And you need to be insured.

755
00:47:11,431 --> 00:47:13,731
Thank you so much.
It's a great honor.

756
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,818
So proud of ya, Lester.

757
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,987
Oh, thanks, hon.

758
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:12,623
You tired?

759
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:14,692
Oh, aren't you?

760
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:15,626
Well...

761
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:20,331
Um...

762
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,599
No, actually.

763
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:24,302
I'm feeling pretty keyed up.

764
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:27,639
You know, I might grab
a nightcap at the bar.

765
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:29,574
You want me to go...

766
00:48:29,576 --> 00:48:30,608
No, no, no. You go up to bed.

767
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,476
I'll be up shortly.

768
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:34,545
Just, you know, it's
my night, you know?

769
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:37,614
I'm sorry I'm such a downer.

770
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:40,318
You're a sunny day.

771
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,922
Go on. I'll be up presently.

772
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:57,202
I was yours, ♪ ♪ and
you were mine ♪

773
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:05,876
♪ I was yours, and ♪
♪ you were mine ♪

774
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:07,744
- Hi.
- Hey.

775
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:09,514
Big night, huh?

776
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:10,581
Salesman of the year.

777
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:11,583
Oh.

778
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,717
Drugs?

779
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:14,719
Insurance.

780
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:15,719
Ah.

781
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:17,155
They really give an award

782
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,690
to the guy who sells
the most drugs?

783
00:49:18,692 --> 00:49:19,824
Pharmaceuticals.

784
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:20,925
Oh, that makes more sense.

785
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:21,992
Yeah.

786
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:24,762
So what are you drinking?

787
00:49:24,764 --> 00:49:27,197
Something dangerous.
Let's have a look.

788
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,766
Uh, oh, a blood and sand.
What's that?

789
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:31,735
Scotch and blood orange.

790
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:32,737
That's the one.

791
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:35,206
All right.

792
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:03,434
I sit down and... Oh, miss,

793
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:06,036
can we have some more
sparkling water?

794
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,139
Thanks.

795
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,507
Um, anyways...

796
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,277
so I say, "Hi, I'm Dr.
Michaelson."

797
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:13,878
"Nice to meet you,"
and everything.

798
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,914
And I get ready to give
him the novocaine shot.

799
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:18,115
Stick it in my own finger.

800
00:50:19,918 --> 00:50:21,998
And it hurt, but I don't
want to look stupid, so I...
