1
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,228
Okay, um...

2
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:52,554
Oh, shit.
Shit! Shit! Shit!

3
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,357
Uh...

4
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,160
<i>No, wait.</i>
<i>T-tell him...</i>

5
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,095
<i>t-tell him</i>
<i>I-I'll pay it all back,</i>

6
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:03,298
I-I swear, and...

7
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,800
Ah. Ah!

8
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,447
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

9
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,771
Please.

10
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:49,844
For the love...
I got kids.

11
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:52,146
Don't move.

12
00:02:52,148 --> 00:02:54,182
Please! Please!

13
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,985
Please!

14
00:02:56,987 --> 00:03:00,221
<i>They won't... She won't stop, you know?</i>

15
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,130
Oh!

16
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:40,755
Chill-Challenge. First prize is
three fun-filled days in Bismarck.

17
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,857
So get your entries in
Lickety-Split...

18
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:07,381
<i>Pleased to meet ya.</i>

19
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:08,883
<i>So is this where he worked?</i>

20
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:11,018
<i>Yeah, in Accounting.</i>

21
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,887
<i>Just typin' away,</i>
<i>and this other fella comes in,</i>

22
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,089
<i>drags poor Phil out</i>
<i>by the necktie.</i>

23
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:19,393
Nice guy too, super.
Such a pity.

24
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,929
- Yeah.
<i>- Gambling problem, I heard.</i>

25
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,164
You don't say.

26
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,799
I heard drugs.

27
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,601
I heard he, like, slept
with a 13-year-old girl.

28
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:29,170
For Pete's sake, Bob,
don't spread rumors

29
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:31,839
about the poor man.

30
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,775
Nah, it was gambling, for sure.

31
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:35,943
I got the security tape
cued up downstairs.

32
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:37,178
Wanna see that?

33
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,647
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

34
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,787
<i>Hard to tell much.</i>

35
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:50,358
Like I said.

36
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,297
Can you freeze it there?

37
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,299
You say you found the victim's
clothes in the garage?

38
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,067
Phil? Yeah.

39
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,136
Lab says the fella
cut 'em off with a knife.

40
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:03,871
Damn peculiar.

41
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:05,873
So you think this is your guy?

42
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,975
The one killed all those people
over in Bemidji?

43
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:11,913
Could be.
He's a nasty enough fella.

44
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:20,822
<i>Who are you?</i>

45
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,227
Great job!
Okay.

46
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:27,762
In through the nose
and out through the mouth.

47
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:30,364
Ladies, you are looking
great, okay?

48
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,766
Keep up the good work.

49
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:35,036
Well, hello, you.

50
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,675
You got bronzer
on your blackmail note.

51
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,414
Listen, listen, listen.
I swear on my...

52
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,550
You couldn't find a smaller room
for us to talk in?

53
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:50,952
What?

54
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,420
- Nothing.
- Look,

55
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:55,189
this... this whole thing,
huge mistake, okay?

56
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,226
I never meant...

57
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:00,061
See, I just... I just...

58
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:03,397
I just wanted something
for... for Don, you know?

59
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,434
You done?

60
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,736
Here it is.
You're screwed.

61
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:11,439
You made a choice,
and this is the consequence.

62
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,107
Me, I'm the consequence.

63
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:16,143
Please.
Please don't tell Helena.

64
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,445
I don't work for Helena.

65
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:18,779
I work for her husband,

66
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:21,749
Stavros Milos,
the Supermarket King.

67
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:26,320
Oh, my God!
Uh... uh... oh!

68
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:26,822
Oh. Oh!

69
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:33,060
- Here, squeeze this.
- Oh!

70
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:35,897
Yeah.

71
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,099
Ugh! Oh, no.

72
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,902
You ready?

73
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:45,172
I've got two questions
and one comment, understand?

74
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:50,478
First question, why $43,613?

75
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,181
Gonna start a Turkish bath.

76
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,917
See, back
in the Ottoman Empire...

77
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,020
Second question,
what do you know?

78
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:01,255
About what?

79
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:04,191
Stavros, the guy
you're blackmailing.

80
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,193
You wrote a note.
"I know about the money."

81
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,762
What do you know?

82
00:08:07,764 --> 00:08:11,532
Uh, well, nothing really.

83
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:15,503
I mean, Helena
told the story so much...

84
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:19,273
about her husband and how
he lies about his money.

85
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,208
So you're blackmailing a guy
for something,

86
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,277
but you don't know what it is?

87
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:28,482
You ready for the comment?

88
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,117
You're an idiot.

89
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,888
Good news, I'm taking over.

90
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,023
Taking over what?

91
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,025
The blackmail.

92
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,394
You work for the guy.

93
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:44,632
Exactly.
And now you work for me.

94
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,835
I'm confused.

95
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:50,071
That's okay, I'm not.

96
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:53,341
The first thing we need
is a new blackmail letter.

97
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:43,145
Hey, Maggie.
Lieutenant in?

98
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,980
Bathroom.

99
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:46,548
What?

100
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,219
He's in the bathroom.

101
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,055
Ah.

102
00:10:00,464 --> 00:10:03,132
Um, Lieutenant?

103
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:07,002
<i>What?</i>
<i>I'm takin' a dump.</i>

104
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:10,572
Uh, yeah, so listen,

105
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:14,409
about that triple homicide
over in Bemidji...

106
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:17,813
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake.</i>
<i>Talk to your Shift Commander.</i>

107
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:21,283
Well, yeah, I would, you know,
but he don't listen to me.

108
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,685
Who is this, Dan Hoskins?

109
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,854
Uh, no, sir.

110
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:28,323
- Gus Grimly.
<i>- Grimly?</i>

111
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,458
<i>For Christ's sake,</i>

112
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,294
<i>aren't you Animal Control?</i>

113
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:36,532
No. I just sub
for those fellas sometimes.

114
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:42,371
So, listen, I pulled this car
over the other night, speeder,

115
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:47,042
and, uh, well, I let
the guy go with a warning,

116
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,510
but then...

117
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:51,847
Well, turns out,
I ran the fella's plates...

118
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:56,552
on account of what you said
at the briefing

119
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,388
about watchin' our Ps and Qs,

120
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,157
and, well, it turns out

121
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,396
that the car belongs
to one of the victims.

122
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:11,500
- One of the...
<i>- What?</i>

123
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,708
Are you kiddin' me?

124
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,743
No sir.
Uh, Lester Nygaard.

125
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:23,645
- That's who the car...
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,014
is registered to,
but he wasn't driving,

127
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:30,852
obviously, so I'm thinking
it may be... might be the killer.

128
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,654
Shut up.
For Christ's sake,

129
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:36,558
you pulled over a stolen car
and let the guy go

130
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,194
- with a warning.
- Well... well, no, see...

131
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:42,764
it wasn't, you know, listed
as stolen, you know, so...

132
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:45,667
and now, I checked this morning,
and it's impounded,

133
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:48,604
- as of yesterday, so...
- Stop!

134
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:51,607
It's goddamn Sioux Falls
all over again.

135
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:54,409
Yes, sir.

136
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,911
W-what's Sioux Falls?

137
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:59,448
Shut up.

138
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,885
You're gonna look through every
goddamn mug book in the state.

139
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:05,921
- Yes, sir.
- And you're gonna find this guy.

140
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,423
- Yes, sir.
- And you're gonna call Bemidji.

141
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:12,961
And you're gonna tell them
that you screwed up... you...

142
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,964
absolving the rest of us
of any dipshittery.

143
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:18,900
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

144
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:19,401
_

145
00:12:35,785 --> 00:12:37,386
<i>He can afford it, your brother.</i>

146
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,887
<i>Kitty said he just got</i>
<i>a big promotion</i>

147
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,656
<i>after only working there</i>
<i>a year.</i>

148
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,224
<i>Kitty said they also got one</i>

149
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,992
<i>of those fancy, new</i>
<i>surround-sound systems.</i>

150
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:47,162
<i>Guess I married</i>
<i>the wrong Nygaard.</i>

151
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:49,498
<i>What? What are you gonna do?</i>

152
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,167
<i>You can't even face me</i>
<i>when we're having sex.</i>

153
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:57,072
<i>Lester, I need
you to get down on the ground.</i>

154
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:58,473
<i>Hold on.
Don't... There's nothing down...</i>

155
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,175
<i>Lester, on the ground.</i>

156
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,044
<i>I didn't do nothing.</i>

157
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,545
<i>I didn't... I just got home.</i>
<i>I just got home and...</i>

158
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,480
<i>Now, hold on.</i>
<i>Hold on, don't...</i>

159
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:08,417
<i>There's nothing down there.</i>
<i>This... That is not...</i>

160
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:10,419
I didn't do nothing!
I-I didn't do nothing!

161
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:14,222
<i>I just came home.</i>
<i>I just came... Oh, jeez.</i>

162
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:33,809
Yeah, so I closed it out
with a spare and a strike, 222.

163
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,043
Oh, yeah?

164
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,945
- Yeah.
- Lester.

165
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:44,653
Well, I'll be.
Hey, uh, Lester.

166
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:47,522
I should've called,
I guess, huh?

167
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:50,625
Please, it...
What can we do for ya?

168
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,595
Well, I thought
I'd do some work.

169
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:55,030
You know, get back to it.

170
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:56,297
You're so brave.

171
00:13:56,299 --> 00:13:58,600
Geez, you think you're ready?

172
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,435
Think so, yeah,

173
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:03,705
I mean, you can't just sit
around the house, you know?

174
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:06,608
Good. Okay.

175
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,843
Uh, you want to do
some filing or...

176
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,479
Uh, I was gonna run out
to see Gina Hess.

177
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:13,648
- Who's that?
- The widow Hess.

178
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,817
I got some papers
for her to sign.

179
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:17,218
Yeah.

180
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,487
On account of Sam, her husband.
He got murdered?

181
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:20,722
Bo!

182
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,691
Sorry, was that insensitive?

183
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,060
Anyways, did you want
to take that over to her?

184
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:26,561
Which'd actually
help me out a lot,

185
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,329
'cause I got a dentist thing,
you know, so...

186
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,564
Um...

187
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:30,999
But, I mean,
if you're not ready...

188
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,702
No, I'll...
It's the 614C, right?

189
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:36,538
And D, yeah.

190
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,073
Did you get the soup
I sent you?

191
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:40,141
Oh, yes, thank you.

192
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:44,713
Well, I better grab
those forms.

193
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,347
Mm-hmm.

194
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:48,349
_

195
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:56,725
Hey, look.
Come on.

196
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,259
Got it.

197
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:04,065
Hey.

198
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,533
What you doing here, loser?

199
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:06,901
Yeah, loser.
What you doing here?

200
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:08,670
Come on, boys.

201
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:09,904
I'm just here to see your mom.

202
00:15:09,906 --> 00:15:11,172
Yeah?
Why, you want to do her?

203
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:12,907
Yeah, loser, you gonna...
Wait.

204
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,542
He's not really gonna
have sex with our ma, is he?

205
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:15,744
He better not.

206
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:17,579

00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:20,515
Goddamn it, get off the guy.

208
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:23,785
And quit shooting up
the lawn sign.

209
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:27,689
Never gonna sell this place,
you keep filling it with arrows.

210
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:33,294
<i>Yeah, they've sure
got a lot of energy, huh?</i>

211
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:36,397
They're wolves.

212
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,632
What do you want?

213
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,367
Well...
well, ma'am, I'm...

214
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:42,937
My name is Lester Nygaard,
and I'm from Munk Insurance.

215
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:44,939
Oh.

216
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,776
Oh, well,
why wouldn't you say so?

217
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:49,744
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:51,246
Do you want a whiskey?

219
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:53,481
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

220
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:55,116
- Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

221
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:57,418
Sorry about the boys.
They're animals.

222
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,820
- Oh.
- Really,

223
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:03,625
they fart on everything...
the walls, each other.

224
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:06,294
When do I get my money?

225
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:08,263
Uh...
Can I... can I...

226
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:11,666
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Well, um,

227
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:14,969
first of all, I would just like
to say how sorry I am...

228
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:17,105
- Mm.
- ...about your husband.

229
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,174
Uh, he... We went to high
school together, and...

230
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:22,343
Yeah, that's sweet,
but about the money?

231
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,114
Yeah.
Uh, well,

232
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:29,584
I have some forms.

233
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:33,154
Now, in cases where the deceased
was killed... murdered, I mean...

234
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:34,856
- Mm-hmm.
- Um,

235
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,692
the process
is a little different.

236
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,194
- What do you mean?
- Well... And I'm

237
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,461
going through this myself...
we have to wait

238
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:41,696
for the coroner to...

239
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:46,000
Wait a minute, you're that guy.

240
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,302
I saw you at the cemetery.

241
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:48,536
Oh, yeah, that's...

242
00:16:48,538 --> 00:16:50,205
Your wife was killed, right?

243
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,273
And the Chief of Police.

244
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,975
He was murdered
at your house, right?

245
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:57,111
Yeah.
Mm-hmm, yeah.

246
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:02,984
I think you better have
that whiskey.

247
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:07,055
You should get back out there.
You know, date.

248
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,492
You're not a bad looking guy.

249
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:13,394
Little small maybe.

250
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,702
Did you like her?
Your wife.

251
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,504
My husband was...

252
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:27,508
Well, you knew him, right?
Didn't get better.

253
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,811
Yeah.
How did you...

254
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,512
- In Vegas.
- Oh.

255
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:34,382
I was a dancer.

256
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:37,719
Well, a stripper,
if we're being honest.

No. No.

- No, I-I mean,

wanted to, but...

261
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,332
Well, I was good.

Shotgun, machete, some Bactine.

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,966
It's a side business.

306
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:13,568

about what happened.

324
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:15,797
The murders.

325
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,332
- Geez.
- Oh.

326
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,701
Yeah, yeah.
It's a muddy road, so...

327
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,871

328
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,439
You dating anyone?

329
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,274
Me? No.

330
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:28,643
No, you know me,
just an old ship captain.

331
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:34,382

I'm married to the sea.

332
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:35,884
So you live

333
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:38,386
Yeah, moved, like,
right after high school.

00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:41,323

336
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:44,960
And Ted got the job.

337
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,394
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>How's Ted?</i>

338

339
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:51,032

on account of

340
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:53,335
he had intercourse
with his physical therapist.

341
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:56,705
- Aw, geez.
<i>- But I'm doing good.</i>

342
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,139
<i>Great, really.</i>

346
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:07,849
Really? Cause sometimes,
you know, you hear stories, so...

347
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:12,654
Well, from time to time,
you get a bad egg.

348

had a harelip.

349
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:21,696
And another stole
all my panties.

350
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,903
- But then I met Roger.
- Mm.

351
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:31,172
And we've been dating
about six months now.

352
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:34,409
He took me to...
♪ Acapulco ♪

353
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,411
- Ooh.
- Yeah!

354
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:41,950
Mm, except he got a spider bite,
like, on his neck.

355
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,718
And at first, we thought
it was a mosquito,

356
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,589
but it turns out the spider
laid eggs in there or something,

357
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:50,358
'cause we were
in the middle of doin' it,

358
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,428
and all these baby spiders
popped outta his neck.

359
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,397
I'm sorry.

360
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:56,631
- Geez.
- Yeah.

361
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:58,199
Lesson learned, you know?

362
00:22:58,201 --> 00:23:02,037
From now on, I am staying
right here in Minnesota.

363
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,638
Sounds right.

364
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,650
So you girls ready
to order some food?

365
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,206
<i>King! Here, King!</i>

366
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:43,111
King!

367
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:47,082
<i>Here, King!</i>

368
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:54,522
<i>Kingy, The King!</i>

369
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:02,364
King!

370
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,534
Here, boy!
Here, King!

371
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:07,902
King!

372
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:17,579
<i>Come to daddy.</i>

373
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,511
<i>Kingy, The King!</i>

374
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:23,980
Where's my little monster?

375
00:24:35,164 --> 00:24:37,432
<i>Here, boy!</i>

376
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:42,170
Come on, King.

377
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:47,008
King!

378
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,740
What the hell?

379
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,290
King!

380
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:45,228
<i>Before the worst happens,</i>

381
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,797
<i>call the best,</i>
<i>Bo Munk Insurance.</i>

382
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,700
<i>So come on down to Bo Munk</i>
<i>Insurance and see me,</i>

383
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:53,669
<i>Bo Munk, before it's too late.</i>

384
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:10,588
Geez.

385
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:18,194
Ooh.

386
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,498
Oh.

387
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,801
<i>All right, then.
That's lunchtime.</i>

388
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:28,304
Oh, God.
<i>Gotta get my roast beef on.</i>

389
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:33,509
Ah... oh.

390
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,826
<i>Lester?</i>

391
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:52,462
<i>Uh, we're all of us</i>
<i>going for Arby's.</i>

392
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:56,532
<i>Do you... Can I</i>
<i>bring you anything?</i>

393
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:59,135
Uh, no.
No, thank you.

394
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:02,572
<i>Okay, well, see you</i>
<i>in a bit then.</i>

395
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,450
Oh!

396
00:27:17,122 --> 00:27:20,656
You scared me there.
I thought the place was...

397
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,827
I-I-I was in...

398
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:33,647
Oh. Uh...

399
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:41,978
Huh.

400
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,613
It's...

401
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:46,315
Excuse me.

402
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:47,583
- Yello.
<i>- Uh, Mr. Nygaard.</i>

403
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:49,185
This is Lester.

404
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:50,820
<i>Yeah, Mr. Nygaard,</i>
<i>this is Duluth Impound.</i>

405
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:52,622
<i>Just want to let you know</i>
<i>we got your car.</i>

406
00:27:52,624 --> 00:27:54,056
Uh, pardon?

407
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:57,160
<i>Your car, license 628633QI,</i>

408
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,996
<i>got towed yesterday</i>
<i>from Phoenix Farms on Elm.</i>

409
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:01,998
- In Duluth?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

410
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,333
Oh, just take
anything you like.

411
00:28:04,335 --> 00:28:05,701
- So what do I gotta...
<i>- Just need proof</i>

412
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:07,436
<i>of current registration</i>
<i>and $150</i>

413
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:08,838
<i>and we'll release</i>
<i>the car to you.</i>

414
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,206
- O-okay, well...
<i>- Cash only, of course.</i>

415
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,674
Thanks for calling.

416
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,942
<i>Yeah, remember, cash only.</i>

417
00:28:12,944 --> 00:28:14,377
Yeah.

418
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:19,215
So, uh, what can I do
for you fellas then?

419
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:23,352
Cause, uh, we're...
kind of busy right now.

420
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:24,587
Hmm?

421
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,592
What's that?

422
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,502
No, sorry, I'm...

423
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:41,070
Sam Hess.

424
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,643
Are you fellas, uh,
family of his?

425
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:00,423
- Lester.
- Hmm?

426
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:01,891
We saw you with the widow.

427
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,226
Looked like you
were having a party.

428
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:05,695
Were you celebrating, maybe?

429
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:08,497
Come on.

430
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,833
Guy...

431
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,704
I got a deaf cousin.

432
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:19,175
Oh, uh, hi.

433
00:29:19,177 --> 00:29:23,546
Uh, excuse me.

434
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,382
Uh...

435
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:30,519
Sorry about the door.
Not sure how that happened.

436
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,255
Not interrupting anything?

437
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:34,690
No, no, no,
just giving these guys a quote.

438
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:39,428
So, like I said, you know,
it's 300 a year...

439
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,763
- Mm-hmm.
- ...plus 200 up front.

440
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,031
- Okay.
- Look through that,

441
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,266
- and give me a call.
- Sounds good.

442
00:29:43,268 --> 00:29:45,434
Talk soon, Lester.

443
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:48,304
Deputy.

444
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,575
Who are those fellas, then?

445
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:54,610
What's that?

446
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:55,878
Not from around here,
I'm guessing.

447
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,113
Oh, yeah, yeah.

448
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,448
From the city, I think.

449
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,585
Said they were going to...
where was it again?

450
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:04,487
Mexico, yeah.

451
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:07,723
Had some questions
about vacation insurance.

452
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:11,227
So speaking of insurance.

453
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:12,895
Now, look,
I-I talked to Bill,

454
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:14,297
so if this is about
the case then...

455
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:16,766
Oh, no. I'm just looking
for a little advice.

456
00:30:16,768 --> 00:30:19,135
With Vern dead... and I know,
we're not talking specifics...

457
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:20,903
but with him dyin',
I got to thinkin'.

458
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,472
You know, I'm a...
single person,

459
00:30:23,474 --> 00:30:25,675
but I got my dad and stuff.

460
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:27,443
So I got to thinkin',
what would happen to him then?

461
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:29,745
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

462
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:32,748
No... Yeah, uh, very...

463
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,350
Because a lot of girls
your age, they...

464
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:37,019
they don't think
about these things.

465
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,955
You know, the...
posthumous and so on.

466
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:43,326
So I thought I'd come see you,
you know, maybe buy a policy.

467
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:44,994
- Oh.
- And I got all my info here,

468
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:47,263
you know, Social Security
and the like.

469
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:49,131
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.

470
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:50,499
Need some help with that?

471
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:54,103
No, I-I got it.

472
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:03,646
Okay, well, uh...

473
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:07,516
Okay, wow. Uh...

474
00:31:07,518 --> 00:31:09,318
I mean, I-I got
a lot of... you know,

475
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,655
there are lots of choices,
policy-wise.

476
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:16,092
Course, I could give you
the whole long speech.

477
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:17,560
<i>Please, I got time.</i>

478
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:19,228
Well, I could give you
the whole long speech,

479
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,297
but... meh, you know,
it's... it's... it's...

480
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:22,565
it's all in here,
all the details, really.

481
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:23,833
Oh.

482
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,334
Oh, and...

483
00:31:25,336 --> 00:31:28,804
I gotta close up real soon.

484
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,643
Okay.

485
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,047
Thank you for your time.

486
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:40,349
That's okay.
Uh...

487
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:43,486
look over all that stuff,
and give me a call.

488
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:54,130
Bye.

489
00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:38,470
He killed my goddamn dog.

490
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:41,640
You said you were
gonna find him.

491
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,108
He raised his price.

492
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,910
A million dollars?

493
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,945
He killed my damn dog and now
he wants a million dollars?

494
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:49,315
"Eat a turd" is my response.

495
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:50,949
And if it's your ex-wife?

496
00:32:50,951 --> 00:32:53,452
Son, you think my ex-wife
killed the damn dog?

497
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,354
It wasn't the wife,
ass-hat.

498
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,623
She's mean, but she got
a human heart in her chest.

499
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,458
Hell, she loved the damn animal
more than me.

500
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,126
No, this is different.

501
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:05,698
Some sick bastard gets off
on hurting little things.

502
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,001
Who else knows about the money?

503
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:13,172
Nobody.
Nothing to know.

504
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:15,441
Must be something,

505
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:17,276
or he wouldn't be
blackmailing you.

506
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,813
No, nobody knows.

507
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,082
Nobody can know.
It's impossible.

508
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,951
<i>Meaning?</i>

509
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,864
You like that?

510
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:43,168
Saint Lawrence.
Patron saint of hard asses.

511
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,171
Burned alive by the Romans.
You know what he said?

512
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:49,842
"Turn me over.
I'm done on this side."

513
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:52,911
That's a goddamn saint.

514
00:33:52,913 --> 00:33:55,914
You Greek Orthodox?

515
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:59,418
Why, cause I'm Greek?

516
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,323
Let's just say
God and I have a...

517
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:07,259
You ever make
a New Year's resolution?

518
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:11,930
Stop smoking, lose weight,
and then...

519
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:19,204
Hell, I don't know.
You're the expert.

520
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:23,409
I want the damn
dog killer found.

521
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:24,843
I'd like to move
onto the property

522
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,612
until this thing's over.

523
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:30,149
He came to the house once.
He might do it again.

524
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:36,688
There's an in-law
next to the garage.

525
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,524
Semenchko will show you.

526
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:41,527
But I am losin' patience.
Get it done.

527
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,509
Goddamn hot in here.

528
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:12,357
You looked through all those?

529
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,515
What?

530
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:41,453
It's just...

531
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:51,029
Your dad made a mistake.

532
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:55,601
I let a guy go
that I shouldn't have.

533
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:59,304
And now, I gotta call
this other, uh, jurisdiction

534
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:03,809
and tell 'em that, uh,
'cause of me,

535
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:08,614
um, their suspect got away.

536
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:11,850
Hmm.

537
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:15,120
Probably better to do it
in person, don't you think?

538
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:25,034
_

539
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:30,903
What's this then?

540
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,705
- Our suspect.
- Oh, yeah?

541
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:35,774
<i>Security camera caught him</i>
<i>kidnappin' the naked fella.</i>

542
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,776
- Kidnapped him naked?
<i>- No, dressed.</i>

543
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,611
<i>Phil McCormick.</i>

544
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:41,480
<i>Our perp cut his clothes off</i>
<i>in the parking garage.</i>

545
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:43,181
No kiddin'.

546
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:46,852
Yeah, so here's the thing,

547
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,688
I took the photo
and I showed it to Lester.

548
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,323
- Did what?
- Not officially.

549
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:53,158
No, I told him I was interested
in some insurance,

550
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,927
which is true, and then
I just happened to let him

551
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:57,763
see the photo, and you
should've seen his face.

552
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,064
I mean, it's like
he saw a ghost.

553
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:00,566
Lester knows this fella,
all right,

554
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:03,068
and not from some casual chat.

555
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,072
Gotta say,
I'm super ticked here.

556
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:08,340
Yeah, okay, but before you...

557
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:10,075
I told you,
don't pester the guy...

558
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:12,444
I said he's not a...
And then what do you...

559
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:13,745
I never said he was...

560
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:16,181
And then what do you do?
The next day even?

561
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,717
Yeah, but, I mean, what if he
is involved, you know?

562
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,952
I mean, think about it.

563
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:21,820
No!

564
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,789
The guy just lost his wife,
and you're boxin' his ears.

565
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,257
- Yeah, I know, but...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

566
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,292
Solve the naked guy.
That's the case I gave you.

567
00:37:27,294 --> 00:37:28,894
- But...
- If this is your suspect,

568
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:30,762
put out an APB
and we'll get him in.

569
00:37:30,764 --> 00:37:33,699
Sure, but, you know,
what if he and Lester are...

570
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,537
You know, just tell them
the truth, you know,

571
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:53,805
and say you're sorry.

572
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:55,239
What you always tell me.

573
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:56,608
You're a good girl.

574
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,309
As far as you know.

575
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:00,378
All right, just sit there.
I'll... I'll be back.

576
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,548
Yeah, hi. I'm...

577
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,783
I just drove over
from Duluth PD.

578
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:09,587
I need to speak with someone
about Lester Nygaard.

579
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:14,559
Hey. Yeah, hi.
I'm Deputy Solverson.

580
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:15,793
What can I do for you?

581
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:19,197
Well, um...

582
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,266
Maybe we should talk
at my desk.

583
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:25,203
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

584
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,309
Have a seat.

585
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,810
You want some coffee?

586
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:35,647
The guys just brewed
a pot, so...

587
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:40,284
Uh, no,
I-I just got to...

588
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:43,621
- I'm good.
- Okay.

589
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,125
So, uh...

590
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,260
three days back,
I'm on patrol, you know,

591
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:52,430
and pull this guy over.

592
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:57,201
Silver Taurus, ran a stop sign,

593
00:38:57,203 --> 00:39:01,973
and I, uh...

594
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:06,344
I gave him a warning, see,
but then...

595
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:09,981
I don't know, I just...
I had a feelin'.

596
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:11,849
What kind of feeling?

597
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:15,219
A bad feelin',
real suspicious-like.

598
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:18,690
So I ran his plates,
and it turns out

599
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:22,860
that the car was registered
to one of your victims.

600
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:27,331
- What?
- Yeah, Lester Nygaard.

601
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,668
Son of a...

602
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,837
He told me his car
was in the shop, so...

603
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:36,507
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

604
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:40,878
Well, here's the thing.

605
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,715
Lester wasn't driving.

606
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,918
Now, I know that now
because I checked the plate,

607
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,555
- but at the time, I...
- This fella maybe?

608
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:54,392
Holy cow.
Yeah.

609
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:59,330
That's...
I-I think that's him.

610
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:01,432
- How did you...
- Security camera,

611
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,668
caught him over St. Paul
kidnapping an accountant.

612
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,537
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

613
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:11,375
So, listen, one thing
I'm not quite clear on,

614
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:13,277
you said
you only found out later

615
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,348
that it wasn't Lester driving,
but... I mean,

616
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,586
you checked the fella's license
and registration, didn't ya?

617
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,522
Well, um...

618
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:32,096
You see, uh...
I, uh, I asked,

619
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,299
but he...

620
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:40,972
threatened me, and I...

621
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:42,707
It's... it's... it's...

622
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,643
I know, it's no excuse,
but, um,

623
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:49,113
I... He was a really
dangerous looking fella,

624
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:53,951
and he had these really scary,
uh, eyes, and I just...

625
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,119
<i>Dad?</i>

626
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,554
Yeah?

627
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:58,923
Could I get a dollar
for the vending machine?

628
00:40:58,925 --> 00:41:02,994
Yeah, um...

629
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:04,962
Hold on.

630
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:10,268
Actually, they...
they give us these tokens.

631
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,603
Just put that in the coin slot.

632
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:16,107
Great, thanks.

633
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:23,748
How old?

634
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,119
Greta? Yeah, 12.
She's a real good kid.

635
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:30,154
Her mom at home?

636
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,789
No.

637
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:36,260
It's just us.
Ten years now.

638
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,363
They're out of M&M's.

639
00:41:39,365 --> 00:41:41,966
<i>Ah.</i>

640
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:47,205
So you two drove
all the way from Duluth, huh?

641
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:50,041
Yeah.

642
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:53,611
Well, uh...
I was gonna grab dinner.

643
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:55,313
There's a good burger
place nearby,

644
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:59,851
so you two want to join me
before you head back?

645
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,187
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We don't want to be a bother.

646
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:04,989
It's no bother.

647
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:07,992
We'll talk about the guy,
you know, see what you remember.

648
00:42:07,994 --> 00:42:09,393
Maybe a clue drops out.

649
00:42:09,395 --> 00:42:10,895
It's Lou's.

650
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:12,330
It's just a couple blocks
up the street.

651
00:42:12,332 --> 00:42:13,965
Let me just put an APB
out on this guy,

652
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:17,468
and I'll...
I'll be right there.

653
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:24,475
She seemed nice, huh?

654
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,044
What?

655
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:28,479
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

656
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,083
Just you two?

657
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:36,888
No, a very pretty lady
will be joining us.

658
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,056
Duluth PD.

659
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,324
Yes, sir.

660
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:42,526
You associated
with Ben Schmidt?

661
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:44,095
Think he's a lieutenant now.

662
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:46,264
Yes, sir.
He's my boss.

663
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:47,765
Kind of a prick.

664
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:49,066
That's the one.

665
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,668
Yeah.

666
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,537
Yeah, we had a deal together
once in Sioux Falls.

667
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,273
Joint task force situation.

668
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:57,408
Boy, that was a rodeo.

669
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,576
<i>Hey, dad.</i>

670
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:00,344
Hey, sweetie.

671
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:02,914
Think I'm gonna need
a milkshake tonight.

672
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,849
Better make it a double.

673
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:06,851
Me too?

674
00:43:06,853 --> 00:43:09,954
Yeah, okay.
You gotta eat something green.

675
00:43:09,956 --> 00:43:12,623
Same here, and some burgers
all around.

676
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,160
Sounds good.

677
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,102
So it's a bit strange, huh?

678
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:28,272
This Lester fella never
reporting his car was stolen.

679
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:29,807
It is, yeah.

680
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:33,444
Pretty sure he's mixed up
in some nasty business.

681
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:37,048
So you got a boyfriend, then?

682
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,917
No.

683
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:41,819
Pretty girl like you?

684
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:46,123
Too young for a boyfriend.

685
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,826
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

686
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:51,495
Hey, you ever heard
of a spider layin' eggs

687
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:52,663
in a person's neck?

688
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:54,165
What's that now?

689
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:55,666
Friend of mine said it happened
to a friend of hers.

690
00:43:55,668 --> 00:43:56,934
Gross.

691
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:59,770
Yeah.
Said they were...

692
00:43:59,772 --> 00:44:04,608
He was sleepin', and all these
baby spiders just ran right out.

693
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:08,479
Not sure I want to live
in a world

694
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,449
where something like that
can happen to a person.

695
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,291
I put bourbon in one of 'em.
Whoever finds it wins a prize.

696
00:44:20,293 --> 00:44:23,327
He's only kidding.

697
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,830
Oh, wait.

698
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:27,631
No, I win.

699
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:28,866
Burgers'll be right up.

700
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:31,702
Thank you.

701
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:12,877
Oh.
Hey there, Lester.

702
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:16,580
Hey. So...

703
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:19,016
which one makes
the biggest hole?

704
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,164
<i>"And behold, the
daughter of Pharaoh</i>

705
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,133
<i>came down to wash herself</i>
<i>in the river,</i>

706
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:38,502
<i>and her maids</i>
<i>walked by the river's brink,</i>

707
00:45:38,504 --> 00:45:41,072
<i>and when she saw the basket</i>
<i>in the sedges,</i>

708
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:44,608
<i>she sent</i>
<i>one of her maids for it.</i>

709
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:47,011
<i>And when it was brought,</i>
<i>she opened it,</i>

710
00:45:47,013 --> 00:45:50,247
<i>and saw within</i>
<i>an infant crying.</i>

711
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:53,117
<i>And having compassion on it,</i>
<i>she said,</i>

712
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,987
<i>'This is one of the babes</i>
<i>of the Hebrews.'</i>

713
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:05,029
<i>and she adopted him for a son,</i>
<i>and called him Moses,</i>

714
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:08,532
<i>saying, 'Because I took him</i>
<i>out of the water.'</i>

715
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:13,204
<i>one day,</i>
<i>after Moses had grown up,</i>

716
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:18,342
<i>he went out among his people</i>
<i>and saw their affliction.</i>

717
00:46:18,344 --> 00:46:23,681
<i>He saw an Egyptian beating</i>
<i>a Hebrew, his brethren.</i>

718
00:46:23,683 --> 00:46:28,018
<i>Looking this way and that way,</i>
<i>and seeing no people,</i>

719
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,556
<i>Moses slew the Egyptian</i>
<i>and hid him in the sand."</i>
