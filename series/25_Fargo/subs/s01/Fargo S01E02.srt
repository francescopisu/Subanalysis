1
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,351
We're here about Hess.

2
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:59,918
Oh, yeah, you want Gold...
Max Gold.

3
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,250
He's on his way.

4
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,912
You Gold?

5
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:18,178
Yeah. And you're...

6
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,643
We're from Fargo.

7
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,677
Good. They said
they were sending someone.

8
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,410
They were right.

9
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:30,109
There's no library
in this town.

10
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,307
Why is there no library
in this town?

11
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:35,107
Uh... cutbacks?

12
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:47,002
He thinks every town
should have a library.

13
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,202
I agree.
Tell him I agree.

14
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,665
Fargo sent us to find out
what happened to Hess.

15
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,098
He got stabbed
in the back of the head

16
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,028
at a strip club,
is what happened to him.

17
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:26,655
Okay.

18
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,787
Okay.
Okay, all right.

19
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,451
Do you believe this was
connected to the business?

20
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:38,217
I...
Things have been quiet.

21
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:39,951
No labor BS,

22
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:43,316
no skirmishes with other
trucking concerns.

23
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:44,882
So?

24
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:48,582
There was a guy...
I told this to Fargo...

25
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,147
came by the garage
the day it happened.

26
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:55,145
Brown hair, just under 6 feet,
not young, not old.

27
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:58,212
Had a cut
on his forehead, here.

28
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,043
Said he just wanted
to take a look at Sam,

29
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:02,643
which he did, then he left.

30
00:03:05,744 --> 00:03:06,974
Look...

31
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,406
Hold on a second.

32
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:22,137
He was my friend, okay?

33
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,104
Sam.

34
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:28,001
Sure, he was a jerk,
but deep down...

35
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,299
All I'm saying is,
you're gonna find him, right?

36
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:35,632
The... the guy who did it.

37
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:51,995
We'll find him.

38
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:11,556
How's your head, then?

39
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:15,187
Oh, yeah, it's okay.
Aches still, but...

40
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,887
You try that hot dish?

41
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,753
Oh, yeah.
Real good.

42
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:21,018
Yeah.

43
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,017
So, you know,
kitty and I were talking,

44
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,683
and we think you should move
in here for a while.

45
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,384
Just stay with us, you know,

46
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,348
until you get the house
cleaned up or sold.

47
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,715
Why the heck
would I sell the house?

48
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,748
Oh.

49
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,581
I'm not saying
you have to go that way.

50
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,945
Just, you know, stay a few days
until we get it cleaned up.

51
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,577
Cops left a real mess.

52
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,777
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:47,711
Yeah, the crime scene and all,

54
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:50,108
really turned the place
upside down.

55
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,308
Looking for clues, I suppose.

56
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:10,634
_

57
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,179
How are you doing?
All right?

58
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,812
Thank you.
Okay.

59
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,310
You don't have to do that.

60
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,809
They're piling up.

61
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:04,473
Vern told me this story once.

62
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,537
When he was a rookie,
had a boss

63
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,137
couldn't tell his shoe
from his foot.

64
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,403
Got killed by a hail stone.

65
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:14,402
Just standing in the parking lot
of the Dairy Queen,

66
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,135
having a milkshake,

67
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:17,968
hail stone comes down,
size of a softball,

68
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,934
crushes his skull.

69
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:24,566
What flavor?

70
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,798
Strawberry, I think.

71
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,565
I was thinking
about when my dad got shot.

72
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,829
Traffic stop, yeah?

73
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,395
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

74
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:36,061
He pulled over the fellas
that robbed Callihans

75
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:37,396
and stole the snow plow.

76
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,993
They came to tell me at school.
I was in Algebra.

77
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:46,059
And he's okay, you know?

78
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:49,792
Got the limp, of course,
but they caught the guys, so...

79
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:53,023
The little one,
he even got probation.

80
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:55,489
Convinced the jury it was
a Stockholm Syndrome deal,

81
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,289
you know.

82
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,653
Okay, we got now a list of
who'll come by when and do what.

83
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,653
This is on the due date,
you know.

84
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:04,486
Get you to the hospital,
bring you home,

85
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:06,352
so you're covered.

86
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:07,951
Say, Bill, I was thinking,

87
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:11,451
we should talk to Lester Nygaard
first thing.

88
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,950
Lester? Well, he already made
a statement

89
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,317
back at the hospital.

90
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,383
Yeah, I know, I read it,
but see, thing is,

91
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:19,149
Vern was on his way
to Lester's house

92
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:20,848
to talk to him
about Hess' murder,

93
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,848
you know, how possibly
Lester was involved.

94
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,047
Lester?

95
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,347
Uh...

96
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,212
went to high school
with Lester.

97
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:31,044
Had to dissect a mouse
in Mrs. Knutson's class,

98
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,877
and poor Lester fainted.

99
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,776
Oh. Yeah, okay, but...

100
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,042
<i>Girl had her monthly once</i>
<i>in gym class,</i>

101
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,109
there goes Lester,
fainting again.

102
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,209
Right, so he doesn't
like blood, but still...

103
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,975
Plus, this Hess murder,
got to believe

104
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,873
that's about the cutthroat world
of regional trucking.

105
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,806
Yeah.

106
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:52,706
So it's just coincidence,
you're saying?

107
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,402
Hess gets killed, and then
the massacre at Lester's house

108
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,869
- the next day?
<i>- Exactly.</i>

109
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,637
See, I'm thinking
this is home invasion.

110
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,934
You know, it's a drifter
or some such.

111
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:07,500
Drug related maybe, but not,
you know, Lester Nygaard.

112
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,766
Am I right, Ida?

113
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:12,032
You're not not right.

114
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:14,764
But on these
high-profile deals, Bill,

115
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:18,830
it never hurts to talk
to the eyewitnesses yourself.

116
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,164
"Take control of the facts."

117
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,328
That's what Vern
always used to say.

118
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,694
Okay. Okay, good.

119
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:32,025
We go see Lester,
but I do the talking.

120
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,985
_

121
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:16,271
_

122
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:48,002
Heya, Lester.

123
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:49,635
Bill.

124
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,067
Mr. Nygaard, we got
some questions we'd like...

125
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:53,899
- This is Molly.
- Deputy Solverson.

126
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,766
Sure, nice to meet ya.

127
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,998
Like I was saying,
we got some questions, so...

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,499
How you holding up, Lester?
How's the head?

129
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:02,964
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it hurts.

130
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:06,462
I got a little...
double vision still.

131
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:09,629
Jeez, well, you know,
if now's not a good time...

132
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:13,760
No, no, I was just about to...
I want to help, you know,

133
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:15,893
it's just, there's
so much work to do.

134
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:17,492
Yeah, sure,
it'll only take a second.

135
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:19,858
Oh.

136
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,272
All I got's grape juice.
Hope that's okay.

137
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,704
Pearl says it reminds her

138
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,370
of being a kid.

139
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,868
Said.

140
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,568
Remember that gum?

141
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,867
That grape gum

142
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,568
that they had
when we were kids?

143
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,866
Heck...

144
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,265
what was that called?

145
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:50,298
Uh, so we got your statement
from the hospital.

146
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,965
Oh, yeah.

147
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,799
Yeah, I-I was real thorough
with those fellas.

148
00:11:55,801 --> 00:12:00,028
I mean, what I could remember.
Doctor says I got a concussion.

149
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,395
Says if I was hit any harder,
my brain could've swole up

150
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:03,695
and leaked right out my ears.

151
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:07,292
Thank gosh that didn't happen.

152
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,259
In your statement,
you said that you came home

153
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,358
and found your wife, that...
that she was already dead.

154
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,790
Uh-huh, downstairs, yeah.
I heard the washer going...

155
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:21,022
spin cycle, and I...

156
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,355
well, you know,
she was on the floor,

157
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:25,021
you know,
and there was a lot of...

158
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:29,588
I never even heard the guy.
Uh, just one minute, I'm...

159
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,718
uh, looking at her,
and the next...

160
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,951
So, uh, you don't remember

161
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,684
Chief Thurman
coming to the house, then?

162
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:40,250
Oh, no. No, I feel sick
about that, really.

163
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,214
I guess he saw the guy
breaking in.

164
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:44,081
Uh, no, Mr. Nygaard.

165
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,415
Chief Thurman
came to talk to you

166
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,147
about a man you may have met
in the Emergency Room

167
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:51,746
<i>the day previous.</i>

168
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:53,512
Hmm, you don't say?

169
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:55,579
Look, Lester...

170
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,378
if this is too hard for you,

171
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,778
you can just give us
the bare bones...

172
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,576
We got a witness says
that, uh, she saw you

173
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:05,275
and this other fella
arguing about Sam Hess.

174
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,273
Who?

175
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,906
Sam Hess.

176
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:15,072
You remember Sam... he used to
beat you up in high school.

177
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:16,739
What?

178
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:19,938
Oh, yeah, Sam had a thing
for ol' Lester here.

179
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,670
Used to chase him
around the schoolyard

180
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:23,570
till one or the other
ran out of gas.

181
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:24,569
You remember...

182
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,870
big kid.

183
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,367
What was that name
he called you?

184
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,600
Uh, Lester Nig...

185
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,667
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Sam.

186
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:32,366
Yeah.

187
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,997
That was a long time ago.

188
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,830
But you were talking about him
in the Emergency Room,

189
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,197
so what's the story there?

190
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,994
Well, I, uh...

191
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:57,659
Hmm, it's real fuzzy,
but I might have said,

192
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,759
"My face is a mess."

193
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:03,024
<i>"Mess" sounds like "Hess."</i>
<i>Probably, your...</i>

194
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,156
The witness just misheard.

195
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,922
Yeah, that's possible.

196
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:10,022
Can you describe the fella?

197
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:13,021
Height, eye color,
that kind of thing?

198
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:15,653
You know, the last few days,
they're real fuzzy.

199
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,153
Reason we asks is,

200
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,552
we got an operating
theory, okay?

201
00:14:19,554 --> 00:14:24,584
This being the work
of a drifter, or drifters,

202
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:26,217
possibly drug-related.

203
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:29,582
See, I'm thinking this fella
you met at the hospital,

204
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,714
- maybe he followed you home.
- That's not...

205
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:33,381
- We don't both share that theory.
- Yeah. No, but...

206
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:34,747
- So...
- Yeah.

207
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:40,679
I-I'm a little, uh,
scrambled right now.

208
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:43,644
I-I got a concussion.
I'm not sure if I said that.

209
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:47,278
So, yeah, thi-things...

210
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,642
<i>things are kind of fuzzy.</i>

211
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,641
Well, you know what?

212
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,842
I'm satisfied.

213
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:57,072
I've actually...

214
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:58,373
I got a few more quest...

215
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,405
Yeah, thanks for
the grape juice, Lester.

216
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,472
Takes me back, I tell ya.

217
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:05,538
And I'm gonna look up the name
of that gum when I get home.

218
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,803
Hubba Bubba.

219
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:10,068
Hubba Bubba, yeah.

220
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,536
Yeah, Hubba Bubba.
We used to crack up about that.

221
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,966
- Do you remember Hubba Bubba?
- No.

222
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,866
<i>If you need anything,
Lester, you give us a call,</i>

223
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:22,132
'cause I'll tell you what,
this is a tragedy.

224
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:27,196
Straight-up,
dyed-in-the-wool tragedy.

225
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,463
She was a good woman, you know.

226
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:34,161
Good wife.

227
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:38,360
I-I just keep
asking myself,

228
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:40,993
"Who could've done
a thing like this?"

229
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:01,510
_

230
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:14,249
Good morning, young fella.

231
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,716
You have a package for me.

232
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:17,381
All righty, what's your name?

233
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:19,813
Why?

234
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:23,180
So I can find the package.

235
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,679
Duluth.

236
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,379
I'm sorry?

237
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:28,844
The package is addressed
to "Duluth."

238
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:31,710
That's a city.
I need your name.

239
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:33,476
I told you my name.

240
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:37,675
Your name's "Duluth"?

241
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:40,441
Well, I'll need to see some ID.

242
00:16:40,443 --> 00:16:42,140
No.

243
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,340
<i>What?</i>

244
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:45,138
You heard me.

245
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,771
Well...

246
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:51,471
I can't give you
your mail if you don't show ID.

247
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:53,438
Sure, you can.

248
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,537
All you gotta do is look through
those packages over there,

249
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:56,970
find the one addressed
to "Duluth,"

250
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,168
and then hand it to me.

251
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,200
Look, son, we're in Duluth,
so, technically,

252
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:06,532
all the mail
is addressed to "Duluth."

253
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,697
Am I gonna need to come
back there and find it myself?

254
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,462
Sir?

255
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,562
O-okay.

256
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:32,756
This is highly irregular.

257
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,823
No, highly irregular
is the time I found

258
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:39,422
a human foot in a toaster oven.
This is just odd.

259
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:44,521
Uh...

260
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:53,518
Uh...

261
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:02,303
_

262
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,910
I'm a minister, apparently.

263
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:19,210
Sir?

264
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,842
You have a blessed day.

265
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:37,992
Missed a spot.

266
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:08,616
You're looking
at the supermarket king

267
00:19:08,618 --> 00:19:10,550
of Minnesota, <i>la mercado rey.</i>

268
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:13,049
29 markets in 15 counties,

269
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,448
and it all started
right here in this office.

270
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,381
Next quarter, we're expanding
into Wisconsin and the Dakotas.

271
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,045
By this time next year,

272
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:23,745
rule the whole goddamn Midwest.

273
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,877
You see my mangos?

274
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:27,877
Straight from Ecuador,
kiwis too.

275
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:31,241
That's what makes my stores
so goddamn superior.

276
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:33,575
I got mangos
in goddamn January.

277
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,175
And the back
of a 90-year-old woman.

278
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,008
God damn it.

279
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:45,404
Who's the fire hydrant?

280
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:49,502
Semenchko, head of security.

281
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:51,269
You an Oilers fan?

282
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:54,902
Wally here
is 1992 Farm League MVP.

283
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:59,499
Knocked 138 heads career-wise,
ain't that right, Wally?

284
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:03,000
Our mutual friend said something
about a blackmail letter.

285
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:15,862
Found this on my windshield
last week.

286
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,481
_

287
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,327
What does this mean,
"I know about the money"?

288
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,227
What it means don't matter.

289
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,759
It's blackmail.

290
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,558
I didn't bring you here
for what it means.

291
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,924
I brought you here
to make it stop.

292
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,857
Semenchko said, "Don't do it."
He said, "Let me handle it."

293
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:32,690
But you don't get to be
<i>la mercado rey</i>

294
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:35,990
without knowing
when to delegate,<i> comprende?</i>

295
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:40,587
It's a pretty specific number,
$43,613.

296
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:43,054
Hell, maybe he wants
to pay off his student loans,

297
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:45,086
I don't know. What matters is,
can you find the guy?

298
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:47,384
Hey, dad.
Got a good one for ya.

299
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,052
Oh, sorry.

300
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:52,050
Don't you know closed door
means "Keep out," boy?

301
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,816
Or at least knock,
for shit's sake?

302
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,749
You'll like this.

303
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:59,549
What's a karate expert's
favorite beverage?

304
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:04,113
Kara-tea.
Get it?

305
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:07,279
<i>Kara-tea.</i>

306
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:09,979
It's... it's tea.

307
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:13,411
Son, get the hell out.

308
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:16,710
Nice to meet ya.

309
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,673
Look, I can find the guy.
The question is,

310
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:24,307
what do you want done with him
once he's found?

311
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,240
Send him packing.
Isn't that what they say?

312
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,673
Who says that?

313
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,172
In the movies.

314
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:32,637
I don't watch movies.

315
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,204
You don't watch movies.

316
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:37,404
Look, this ain't complicated.

317
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:39,135
You don't get to be
the supermarket king

318
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:41,902
of Minnesota without making
a few enemies, all right?

319
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:45,667
Start with my damn wife.

320
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:48,532
You think your wife's
blackmailing you?

321
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,632
<i>You ever nail a Greek woman?</i>

322
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:53,798
After 40,
their pussies grow teeth.

323
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,697
And she ain't my wife,
she's my soon-to-be ex-wife,

324
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:59,829
and she is suing me for 50%.

325
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:02,895
Except now
I'm starting to think

326
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:06,793
maybe 50% ain't enough for her.

327
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:09,993
This is kind of
embarrassing, but, uh...

328
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,693
would you sign a copy

329
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:14,723
of my book?

330
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:18,022
I'd be delighted.

331
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:20,990
You... you want
something personal?

332
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:23,521
Yeah, could you put
"To Frank Peterson,

333
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:27,820
thanks for nailing
my blackmailer."

334
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:29,620
I'm just kidding.

335
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:33,084
Anything you want.
You're the writer.

336
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,001
_

337
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,266
In addition to the victims
in the basement...

338
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:02,198
that's Nygaard,
Mr. and Mrs....

339
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,097
<i>we're hearing</i>
<i>the Chief of Police</i>

340
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,631
<i>was shotgunned in the foyer.</i>

341
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:10,196
That means "Entryway."

342
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:12,461
No description yet
of the suspect or suspects,

343
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,327
<i>but I told the new Chief</i>
<i>over in Bemidji</i>

344
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:18,259
<i>we'd be on high alert</i>
<i>for anything that connects.</i>

345
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:20,293
<i>That means suspicious persons</i>
<i>or jailhouse snitches</i>

346
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:22,192
<i>saying they know a thing.</i>

347
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,689
Okay, let's get to it.

348
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,489
Grimly.

349
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:38,020
Animal-Control guy called
in sick again... You're on duty.

350
00:23:38,022 --> 00:23:39,553
Yes, sir.

351
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:24,338
I got "Aurora Borealis."
What about you? Over.

352
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,605
<i>I just put
"Northern Lights." Over.</i>

353
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:29,637
My dad's home with dinner.
Over.

354
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:32,036
<i>What's it tonight?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

355
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:33,968
Looks like burgers.
Over.

356
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,868
And chicken nuggets.

357
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,968
And chicken nuggets.
Over and out.

358
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:26,215
Did you get the dipping sauces?

359
00:25:26,217 --> 00:25:27,448
Extra, even.

360
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,881
Oh.

361
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:35,347
Good day?

362
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:36,579
Yeah.

363
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:39,511
We, uh...
we had an assembly,

364
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:41,511
and the principal
talked about bullying

365
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:44,243
and how bullying was wrong,
and if we saw somebody

366
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:48,343
getting bullied, we should
say something or stop it,

367
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:51,141
<i>and I raised my hand,</i>
<i>and I asked</i>

368
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:53,507
<i>what you're supposed to do</i>
<i>if the bully is, like,</i>

369
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,773
<i>a lot bigger than you are</i>
<i>or has a knife or something.</i>

370
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:00,951
And what did he say?

371
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,763
Well, that's good advice.

372
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:10,429
Yeah, but what if
there's no time?

373
00:26:10,431 --> 00:26:12,427
I mean, you're the police.

374
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,227
If you saw somebody
doing something,

375
00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:16,260
you'd stop 'em, right?

376
00:26:16,262 --> 00:26:19,091
Well, you know, sometimes

377
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:21,558
there's more than
one right thing.

378
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,357
What does that mean?

379
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,188
It means...

380
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,688
I got you, and I am
responsible for you,

381
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,517
and sometimes I might be
in a situation where...

382
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,449
and this hasn't happened,
and it won't...

383
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:49,515
but a situation where
if I try to stop a guy

384
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:54,415
from doing a bad thing,
I could get hurt.

385
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:57,014
Or worse.

386
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,612
And then who would
take care of you?

387
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:02,180
But it's your job.

388
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:05,212
Well, I got two jobs,
and the first,

389
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:08,846
the most important,
is being your dad.

390
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:14,511
Well, if I saw somebody doing something,
I would stop them.

391
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:17,110
I believe you would.

392
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:34,038
Every cooperation, obviously.

393
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,038
If you want girl,
you want drug, just ask.

394
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,102
You know who we are.

395
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,768
I told the police,
I couldn't see the guy

396
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,101
on account of the blood
being in my eyes.

397
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:49,901
We got a description of a man.
5'10", brown hair,

398
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:53,431
big bruise on the forehead.
Does it ring a bell at all?

399
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:57,998
Could be Lenny.

400
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,198
<i>Who's Lenny?</i>

401
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,363
Comes in here a lot.
Drink pretty heavy.

402
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:04,029
I heard him say a few things
over the years

403
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:05,495
about guys like Hess.

404
00:28:05,497 --> 00:28:10,225
Money in the pocket,
think they're tough shit.

405
00:28:10,227 --> 00:28:15,063
That's him at the bar,
with the band-aid on his head.

406
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:26,652
Well, the Russians, they
used to send dogs up into space,

407
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:30,183
which is stupid, because
what's a dog gonna do in space?

408
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:33,315
At least with a monkey,
they can operate the, uh...

409
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,815
the equipment or something.

410
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,080
Hi. My friend would like
an orange soda,

411
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:43,879
and I'll have just a cup
of hot water with lemon.

412
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,712
What are you supposed to be,

413
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:47,311
some kind of circus act?

414
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:53,377
Oh, my friend was wondering,
how'd you hurt your head?

415
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:55,408
Oh, is your friend
looking for a date?

416
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,840
'Cause you know this is a place
for dicks who like pussies,

417
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,640
not pussies who like dick.

418
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:02,073
No, seriously,
h-h-how'd you hurt your head?

419
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,137
Screw.

420
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:08,937
I ain't afraid of a dink
and a lepton.

421
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:14,736
You like playing with knives?

422
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:17,802
Oh, you keep talking, big boy,
you're gonna find out.

423
00:29:33,361 --> 00:29:35,726
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

424
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:38,026
Hey!

425
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,824
That the guy?

426
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,090
Can you take off the tape
maybe?

427
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,087
God damn you little bastards!

428
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,088
<i>I'll kill the lot of you!</i>

429
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:58,918
Hey, now, look, okay?

430
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,985
I'm sorry for what I said
to you before

431
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:02,551
<i>about the dink and the lepton.</i>

432
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:08,783
I don't think it's him.

433
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:21,345
<i>Delicious.
Just a few more.</i>

434
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:23,778
What'd you say your name was
again, handsome?

435
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,876
Frank Peterson, ma'am.

436
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:27,909
I work for Mike,
your divorce attorney.

437
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,542
Oh.
Charmed, I'm sure.

438
00:30:32,377 --> 00:30:35,840
Oh, sorry.
Just bronzed.

439
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:39,105
He's a pig.
You smelled his hands?

440
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:41,773
Have I smelled
your husband's hands?

441
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:44,237
They smell like feet.

442
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:47,570
Your ass looks amazing, darling.
Keep it up.

443
00:30:47,572 --> 00:30:51,102
So, anyway, I've been tasked
to put together

444
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:53,701
a complete record
of your husband's assets.

445
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:57,000
We want to get you the biggest
divorce settlement possible.

446
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,401
Now, I've got
your husband's net worth

447
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:01,534
estimated at $10 million.

448
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,565
More.

449
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:04,998
$15?

450
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,564
Okay, sweetie,
let's do a cool down, yeah?

451
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:12,262
Five minutes.
There you go.

452
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:15,395
Ma'am, can you confirm
that your husband

453
00:31:15,397 --> 00:31:17,827
started his first grocery
with a loan from his uncle,

454
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:19,060
like it says in the book?

455
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:23,892
That's the story.

456
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:25,458
But you don't believe it?

457
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,191
<i>Stavros had two uncles.</i>

458
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:29,824
One of 'em was a drunk
who lived in a barn,

459
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:33,721
and the other died in a fishing
accident when he was ten.

460
00:31:33,723 --> 00:31:35,323
So where did the money
come from?

461
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:36,655
<i>Hey, ma.</i>

462
00:31:38,888 --> 00:31:40,220
Frank Peterson.

463
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:41,886
Oh, yeah, from the store.

464
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:43,319
Hey, I got one for you.

465
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:45,685
What kind of bone
will a dog never eat?

466
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,850
Huh.

467
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:49,450
Chicken?

468
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:53,249
A trombone.

469
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:56,150
Oh, yeah!

470
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:59,047
That's a good one.
A trombone.

471
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,580
My dad'll like that one.

472
00:32:00,582 --> 00:32:03,247
<i>Your dad, your dad.</i>

473
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:04,480
Your dad's screwing us, mister.

474
00:32:04,482 --> 00:32:05,711
Mommy.

475
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:07,478
What?
I'm just being honest.

476
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,711
He's a hard-on, your father,
and you're too trusting.

477
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:11,977
Well, he's my dad,

478
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:13,309
and you're my mom,

479
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:15,975
and everything's
gonna work out, okay?

480
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,208
Oh.

481
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,308
Mmm.

482
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,041
Aren't they just
the sweetest pair? Hmm?

483
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,072
<i>Yeah, it's-it's me.</i>
<i>It's Lester.</i>

484
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,203
<i>Uh, she's, uh... My wi...</i>
<i>My wife, she's, uh,</i>

485
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:36,702
<i>aw, hell, um...</i>

486
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,069
<i>I think I, uh...</i>

487
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:41,934
<i>She's in the basement dead</i>
<i>and, uh... look.</i>

488
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:44,100
<i>I'm freaking out here.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

489
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,198
<i>Yeah, yeah, it's-it's me.</i>

490
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,832
<i>It's Lester.</i>

491
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:56,330
<i>Uh, she's, uh... My wi...</i>
<i>My wife, she's, uh,</i>

492
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:59,262
<i>aw, hell, um...</i>

493
00:32:59,264 --> 00:33:03,127
<i>I think I, uh...</i>

494
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:05,927
<i>She's in the basement dead</i>
<i>and, uh... look.</i>

495
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,058
<i>I'm freaking out here.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

496
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,491
<i>Lester, have
you been a bad boy?</i>

497
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,758
<i>Jeez...</i>

498
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,291
Here. Oh! Sorry.
Just bronzed.

499
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,657
<i>The hammer and, uh...
look...</i>

500
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,422
<i>can you come over?</i>
<i>I'm on Willow Creek Drive.</i>

501
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:21,555
<i>Number 613.</i>

502
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:23,088
<i>Please!</i>

503
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,054
<i>Please?</i>

504
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,719
<i>Sure, Lester.
I'll be right there.</i>

505
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:48,279
This place is a shithole.

506
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:51,113
Okay, nut sack,
here's the drill...

507
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:53,978
You're gonna pack up
your shit and blow.

508
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,877
I'll tell Stavros
you couldn't find the guy,

509
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:00,444
and in return,
I won't bust your head.

510
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:04,540
You hearing me, asswipe?

511
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:09,040
I did some digging on you,
made some calls, you get me?

512
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:12,007
And we don't need you
and your big-city connections

513
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:16,104
coming here and showing us
what time it is.

514
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:18,104
I'm the guy.

515
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:21,104
You understand?
Me.

516
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:24,635
20 years I worked for the king.

517
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:28,967
You know what that makes me?
The goddamn prime minister.

518
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,533
So give me the letter,
pack up your shit, and...

519
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:41,164
What the hell you doing?

520
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:45,929
That's disgusting.

521
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:59,756
Okay, slick, I got your number.

522
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:01,589
I'm on to ya.

523
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:04,556
Just remember, you were warned.

524
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:06,589
<i>Semenchko warned you.</i>

525
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,938
Uh, hey, Molly.

526
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:38,036
Yeah, Chief?

527
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,569
So just want to make sure

528
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:41,503
we're on the same page
about everything.

529
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:43,136
I want you to center it.

530
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:45,134
<i>Same page about what?</i>

531
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:48,799
Just... about Lester
and the case, you know.

532
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:52,066
Just want to make sure you know
to focus on the break-in angle.

533
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,592
Maybe call some other town,

534
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,827
see if they have a similar problem.
No, higher.

535
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:00,093
Similar to three murders,
including the Police Chief?

536
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,224
Not, you know, literally.

537
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,457
Just ruffians and the like.

538
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:07,156
Right there, perfect.

539
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:10,023
Look, Chief, I know
you don't think Lester...

540
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:11,555
Maybe call the staties,
you know?

541
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:13,954
See if they effected
any car stops.

542
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:16,587
Suspicious types
where the driver

543
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:18,720
<i>- had a head wound, and the like.</i>
- Yeah.

544
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,718
- Yeah, but I think...
<i>- Just...</i>

545
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,452
Leave poor Lester
alone, will ya?

546
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,159
- You'll be in Gordo's room.
- Uh-huh.

547
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,992
He's on the sofa, which is...
Don't worry.

548
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:51,091
His dad built him a fort.
He loves it.

549
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:25,681
Oh!

550
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:34,510
Baby, it's cold outside!
B-r-r-r!

551
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:38,342
But here at Phoenix Farms,
it's always summer.

552
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:40,108
Real good peas, hon.

553
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,708
Yeah, mom, real good.

554
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,775
How's your dinner there,
Lester?

555
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:48,639
Oh, yeah.
Real good.

556
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,905
I was thinking of going hunting

557
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:51,138
- this weekend.
- Mm-hmm.

558
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,406
Told Gordo I would
take him shooting.

559
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:57,403
You interested?

560
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:59,269
- Uh...
- Now, hon, I don't think

561
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:01,636
your brother wants to be around
all that guns and violence,

562
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,235
not after what happened.

563
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:06,896
Oh, shoot.
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:06,898 --> 00:39:08,128
- No, no, it's fine.
- I can be

565
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,629
- a real ass sometimes.
- Language.

566
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:13,294
No, no, no, I...
It sounds...

567
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:17,592
You know, bag a deer
or something.

568
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,625
So I've been thinking,

569
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:21,892
maybe I should sell
the place, you know?

570
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:25,122
Get a... what do you call it,
a fresh start?

571
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:26,556
- Yeah?
- Mm.

572
00:39:26,558 --> 00:39:30,587
That's great.
I'll call Jimmy.

573
00:39:30,589 --> 00:39:33,820
It's a fine market right now
he says... real good.

574
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:36,320
It is the right choice,
sweetie.

575
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:38,887
Too many bad memories
in that old house.

576
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:40,386
Both Chaz and me think so.

577
00:39:40,388 --> 00:39:41,619
- Ow!
- Oh, jeez!

578
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,117
- Mm.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

579
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,750
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

580
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:47,684
It's fine.

581
00:39:55,415 --> 00:39:57,980
Hi.

582
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,312
What can I do for you, son?

583
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,312
Well, I got a...

584
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:05,911
I need something for a wound,
I guess you'd call it.

585
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:08,576
Are we talking pain pill
or something more topical?

586
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:14,074
It's... I guess something to keep
it from getting infected.

587
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:16,407
Okay.
That'd be an anti-bacterial.

588
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:17,905
All right.
I got some in the back.

589
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:22,572
<i>Mr. Nygaard?</i>

590
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:24,638
- Yeah?
- Ooh, hiya.

591
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,370
Hi.
Deputy Solverson again.

592
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:27,636
I just have
a few more questions.

593
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,202
Is now a good time?

594
00:40:29,204 --> 00:40:30,868
N-not really.
I'm kind of in the middle of...

595
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,135
Sure, yeah, no, I understand.

596
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:33,536
Yeah, it won't take a second.

597
00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:36,301
Um, so, listen, going back
to the Emergency Room,

598
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,933
that first visit, that was for
a broken nose, is that right?

599
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:42,533
Shoot. I-I just remembered.

600
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:44,530
Um, sir...

601
00:40:44,532 --> 00:40:46,463
You know, I got to be honest,

602
00:40:46,465 --> 00:40:50,396
I-I-I'm starting to feel
a little harassed here.

603
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:54,361
- Now, that's not...
- Sir, your unguent!

604
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:57,094
Sir!

605
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:58,561
I think he means you.

606
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:02,293
You know, you're asking
about a fella

607
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,790
that I might've talked to
at the hospital

608
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:07,557
when you should be out there
looking for the animal

609
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:10,191
- that killed my wife.
- With all respect, sir,

610
00:41:10,193 --> 00:41:12,122
your wife's not
the only victim here.

611
00:41:12,124 --> 00:41:15,455
A friend of mine was killed,
plus, you know, Sam Hess.

612
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:18,786
Yeah... I told you, I haven't
seen Sam since high school.

613
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:22,468
_

614
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,086
I'm not sure this is your car,
Mr. Nygaard.

615
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,519
What?

616
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:29,551
Oh, no, it's...
it's my wife's.

617
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,450
Mine's in the shop.

618
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:34,349
Well, sir, it's just... it's hard
to believe is all, you know?

619
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:36,848
I mean, you're saying this is
all some big coincidence,

620
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,880
you know,
you knowing Sam and all.

621
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,613
And it's a quiet town,
and suddenly,

622
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:43,613
we got four victims in 24 hours,
yourself included.

623
00:41:43,615 --> 00:41:46,511
<i>And then there's this witness</i>
<i>saying that you were talking</i>

624
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:48,843
about Sam Hess the day he died,
and, you know,

625
00:41:48,845 --> 00:41:52,243
then it turns out you and he had
differences in the past, so...

626
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:54,510
You know, all I'm saying
is, just...

627
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,108
help me understand
what happened.

628
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:02,174
Look, I answered all your...
Just ask Bill, huh?

629
00:42:02,176 --> 00:42:05,573
Your boss,
he said he was satisfied.

630
00:42:05,575 --> 00:42:08,871
And I-I got...
Look at me.

631
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:11,370
My wife...

632
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:14,036
is dead,
and you're harassing me.

633
00:42:14,038 --> 00:42:15,835
I'm not harassing
you, sir. I...

634
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:17,368
Talk to Bill!
I...

635
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,835
He'll tell you,
this... this was a break-in.

636
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,334
You're
wasting time talking to me.

637
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:24,167
I'm sor... I can't help you.

638
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:25,999
Watch your feet, now.

639
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:51,524
So how's it going?

640
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:53,390
Well, it turns out
Lester and Hess

641
00:42:53,392 --> 00:42:58,021
went to high school together
and Hess used to beat him up.

642
00:42:58,023 --> 00:43:00,852
A learned detective
might consider that a clue.

643
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:03,353
Yeah, that's what I said,

644
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:06,285
but Bill's a big believer
in coincidence, apparently.

645
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:08,217
Well, what he lacks
in common sense,

646
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:09,682
he makes up in self-esteem.

647
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:11,983
Yeah.

648
00:43:11,985 --> 00:43:14,216
Bill have a theory?

649
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:17,816
Oh, yeah, he says
that it was a spree, you know?

650
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:21,147
A drifter
or "gang of drifters."

651
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:23,380
You know, like it's 1942.

652
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:26,646
Like, uh, drifters
are a national threat... hobos.

653
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,511
Well, he's Chief now,

654
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:33,277
so he sets the agenda,
same as always.

655
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:35,376
Yeah, I know, it's just...

656
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:38,374
I mean, you know,
here we get this car crash

657
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:41,474
with this dead man
in frozen panties nearby,

658
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:42,841
and the driver
has a head injury

659
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,307
and maybe went
to the Emergency Room

660
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,774
where he talked to Lester
about Sam Hess,

661
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:49,438
and then within 24 hours,
Hess is dead,

662
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,771
and then there's the fracas

663
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,937
with, you know,
Lester's wife and Vern.

664
00:43:56,004 --> 00:44:00,635
Not sure if you remember,
but when you were five,

665
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,434
they had to put you
under anesthesia

666
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:04,466
to fix your teeth.

667
00:44:04,468 --> 00:44:06,499
- Gave you that mask.
- Hmm.

668
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:09,865
- Gas that smelled like tutti frutti.
- Yeah.

669
00:44:09,867 --> 00:44:11,599
My soft little girl

670
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:13,997
in a hard world
of drills and needles.

671
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:17,696
I'm 31, dad.
I carry a gun.

672
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:19,996
<i>I know.</i>

673
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:22,494
But it's relative, you know?

674
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,627
There's the kind of things

675
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:30,492
a schoolteacher gets exposed
to... truancy and the like...

676
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:33,190
and then there's the stuff
a cop sees...

677
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:38,490
murder and violence
and general scofflawery...

678
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:42,422
and then there's the kind
of deal you're looking at now.

679
00:44:42,424 --> 00:44:44,087
Which is?

680
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:48,854
Which is, if I'm right...

681
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,918
savagery, pure and simple.

682
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,251
Slaughter, hatred,

683
00:44:54,253 --> 00:44:56,616
devils with dead eyes
and shark smiles,

684
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:59,182
and...

685
00:44:59,184 --> 00:45:00,982
one day, you're gonna
get married...

686
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:03,315
<i>and have kids,</i>

687
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:07,315
and when you look at them,
their faces,

688
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:10,412
you need to see
what's good in the world,

689
00:45:10,414 --> 00:45:13,945
'cause if you don't,
how you gonna live?

690
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,744
You talk a lot, you know that?

691
00:45:19,978 --> 00:45:22,376
It's always been a problem.

692
00:45:28,074 --> 00:45:30,473
- Lou.
- Chief.

693
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,606
Moll could I he a word?

694
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:33,906
Yeah, sure.

695
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:35,338
Pull up a chair.
You want some coffee or...

696
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,604
Yeah, no, uh...

697
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:40,503
Lester Nygaard called me,
yeah, and he's super upset.

698
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,737
Well, yeah, you know,
I thought he might do that.

699
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,768
Yeah, we talked
about this and all,

700
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,467
and I thought we were...
I thought I was clear

701
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,600
that we were gonna focus
on the drifter angle

702
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:51,868
and not, you know...
harass the victim.

703
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:54,410
Well, I'm not, you know...
I didn't harass him.

704
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:56,025
I just... I got questions,
you know.

705
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:58,890
Yeah, well, I'm the Chief now,
and I got to...

706
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:01,091
Everyone's got
to line up behind me,

707
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:02,424
you know, toe the line.

708
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,689
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, I know.

709
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:05,054
Yeah, we talked about this,

710
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,722
and now I got to take you
off the case.

711
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,822
Well, we all know
how you felt about Vern.

712
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:11,488
I mean, heck, who didn't?
But...

713
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,418
maybe it's best if you just...

714
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,719
it... and this could be good
for you career-wise,

715
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:19,550
because, uh, I'm gonna
make you head of inquiry

716
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:22,249
on that frozen fella,
the naked one.

717
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:23,682
Yeah, I'll make you lead
on that.

718
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:25,215
- Bill, listen, I...
- Yeah!

719
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:26,716
So that's my decision.

720
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:30,247
Take care.

721
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:41,977
