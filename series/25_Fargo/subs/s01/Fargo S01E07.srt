1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:02,605
Precedently on Fargo...

2
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:07,546
Who?

3
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:08,983
Fargo.

4
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,520
Freeze! Police officer!

5
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,056
Halt!

6
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:19,601
That cop, the female,
says you're a suspect.

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,669
Suspect of what?

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,041
For Pearl, the Chief,

9
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:23,709
even Sam Hess.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,280
If you want this to go away,

11
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,551
you gotta give 'em someone.

12
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,095
It's good waffles, hon.

13
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:55,067
It's a mix.

14
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,439
Who's ready for seconds?

15
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,946
- Gordo?
- Yeah?

16
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:04,017
- What you doing there?
- Reading a comic.

17
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:07,924
It's breakfast time, though.
Supposed to be family time.

18
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:11,798
Yeah, put the comic away, huh?

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,767
One more page.

20
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:15,806
That's not...
It's breakfast, mister.

21
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:18,676
Family time. You heard your mother.

22
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:21,213
700 to 1,000
people are without power...

23
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,219
Your mom needs help after school.

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,221
Got hockey.

25
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:26,691
After hockey then.

26
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:27,959
Supposed to play with Kevin.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,929
Well, you can play with Kevin tomorrow.

28
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,335
It's time you learned some responsibility.

29
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:34,205
Ooh, hon, listen to this.

30
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:36,275
Meteorologists are saying the incident

31
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,011
was probably caused by a tornado

32
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,718
which sucked up water and fish from a lake

33
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,088
and dropped them miles away.

34
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,059
And we'll have more on
this developing news story

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,795
a little later tonight

36
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:48,931
- along with our meteorologist's take on...
- The darndest thing.

37
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:50,701
Come on, bud, get your boots on.

38
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:51,972
You don't wanna be late for the bus.

39
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:54,676
Kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

40
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,680
Mwah. Love ya.

41
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:57,815
And me?

42
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,284
Dad.

43
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,990
On what reporters are calling
the storm of the century.

44
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,196
Plow drivers have been
working for 24 hours straight

45
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:07,800
without rest, and though exhausted,

46
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,605
we spoke to one earlier today...

47
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:25,600
No funny stuff today.

48
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,297
So then Neo's like, "I'm the one."

49
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:43,866
And agent
what's-his-name is like...

50
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,235
"The sound of inevitability."

51
00:02:45,236 --> 00:02:48,006
Yeah, and he's got him,
right? Around the neck.

52
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,945
- Oh, it hurt me a little.
- Don't be such a baby.

53
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,616
Guys. So they're on the tracks, right?

54
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:53,850
And the train's coming. Stop...

55
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,221
And Neo says, "No way, huh?"

56
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:57,191
And he...

57
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,705
Uh...

58
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,902
So we're in the room
with the stripper, yeah?

59
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:43,344
And Blackman wants to know
how much for a blumkin.

60
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,344
Which I'm like, "What the heck is that?"

61
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,121
- Blackman.
- Yeah, so he says,

62
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:52,227
"You know, why not stick
around and find out?"

63
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:53,996
And I'm like...

64
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,965
Mr. Nygaard,
your wife is on one.

65
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,203
Yeah, I'll call her back.

66
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,074
Oh, no, she said it's urgent.

67
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,081
Yeah, hon?

68
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:05,817
Chazz, the cops are here.

69
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:06,987
Gordo's been arrested,
and the cops are here.

70
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:08,824
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

71
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,727
What do you mean the cops are there?

72
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:12,162
In the house.

73
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,065
They say that Gordo
brought a gun to school,

74
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,801
and they're tearing up the house.

75
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,103
They say they got a search warrant.

76
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:18,809
Don't... don't let them.

77
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,444
I'll be right there.

78
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:22,815
Just... I'll be right there.

79
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:24,852
- I'm coming!
- Chazz, what have you done?

80
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,289
- I'm on my way!
- Chazz?

81
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,849
No.

82
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,253
Wait, hold on!

83
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:45,757
What?

84
00:04:45,758 --> 00:04:47,128
You son of a bitch! He's my baby!

85
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,229
Now, I got...

86
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,003
- I got permits for those.
- You son of a bitch!

87
00:04:52,004 --> 00:04:53,908
Now, Bill Oswalt, hold on...

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,950
Son of a bitch!

89
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,288
I can explain that.

90
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,089
I...

91
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,516
What have you done?

92
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:09,045
Oh, hey.

93
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,781
Bill.

94
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:15,791
Busy morning, huh?

95
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:21,467
Is there a... some kinda
development with the case?

96
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,073
Is that why I'm...

97
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:26,445
Where's the female deputy? Is she...

98
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,848
She got shot, Lester.

99
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,550
- She got...
- In Duluth.

100
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:32,154
I should be up there right now,

101
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:34,157
but then there's this mess.

102
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,129
I don't even know where to start.

103
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,833
It's like when you see on the news

104
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:41,037
a boat sinks in India

105
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,343
and 300 people drown,
and you ask yourself,

106
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:46,046
"Do I know 300 people?"

107
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,282
Or one of those African massacres

108
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,320
with 12-year-olds
with machetes,

109
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,189
and they kill... You can't even...

110
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,962
You can't even count that high.

111
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:55,897
We lost 16 people in 1920

112
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:57,334
to the flu.

113
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,536
I looked it up.

114
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,175
In '78, six people died
in a pharmacy fire,

115
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,012
but nothing like this ever.

116
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:06,249
Three people murdered in two days,

117
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,021
including the Chief of Police,

118
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,958
Lenny Potts missing, and a cop shot.

119
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,464
And now a kid brings a gun to school.

120
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,467
A kid?

121
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,270
It was Gordo, Lester.

122
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,142
Gordo? My Gordo?

123
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:22,513
He had a handgun in his backpack,

124
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,249
unloaded, thank gosh.

125
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,324
But still, you can't... Not
with the current climate...

126
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,294
Is he in trouble?

127
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:33,133
Is he...
He brought a gun to school!

128
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:35,871
And still... Gordo's the least of this.

129
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,144
We searched the house.

130
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:41,248
And, Lester, I gotta tell you,

131
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,353
I don't know whether to...

132
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,092
After all these years,

133
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:50,264
I like to think that
you could've come to me,

134
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:53,604
you could've trusted
me as a friend with...

135
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,445
We know you were in the room

136
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,147
when Vern was shot.

137
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,618
You had a shotgun pellet in your hand,

138
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:03,189
same as killed Vern.

139
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,347
Was your wife having an affair?

140
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,219
With Chazz?

141
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,894
Mm-hmm.

142
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:29,569
We found a photo.

143
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,375
Photos. At his place.

144
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:33,311
Suggestive.

145
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,681
I don't wanna talk about it.

146
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,982
Boudoir photos.

147
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,485
- And a pair of...
- Bill!

148
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,920
Yeah, and I know...

149
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,991
I know how much you loved her.

150
00:08:40,992 --> 00:08:42,360
I remember

151
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,463
ninth grade science class, Mrs. Nagutuck.

152
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,667
Pearl walks in the first day of class

153
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,505
and sits down, and you look at me...

154
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:52,079
"I'm gonna marry that girl one day."

155
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,223
But she was always...

156
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:01,228
I know this is outta line, but...

157
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:04,301
we all heard the stories.

158
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:07,206
But to sleep with your own brother?

159
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,208
I know.

160
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,712
God... Your own brother!

161
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:12,215
And what then?

162
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:13,517
She tells him it's over and he...

163
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:16,022
We all know your brother had a temper.

164
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,257
He broke a guy's nose once

165
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:19,095
just for crackin' wise at the state fair.

166
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:20,463
Ha! I remember!

167
00:09:20,464 --> 00:09:22,601
Had to do community service.

168
00:09:22,602 --> 00:09:25,440
So what, she cuts it off, the affair,

169
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,543
and then he...

170
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:34,089
All I know is that I came home from work,

171
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,659
and they were arguing in the basement.

172
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,997
I heard the voices. I
thought, is that Chazz?

173
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,203
And so I went over to
the top of the stairs

174
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:44,408
to hear, you know?

175
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,782
And she says, uh,

176
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,819
"Love? Is that what you think this is?"

177
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,722
Or something like that.

178
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:55,162
She laughs.

179
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:56,864
And then she says,

180
00:09:56,865 --> 00:10:01,006
"You know, you're not half
the man your brother is."

181
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:03,744
Then I hear this sound.

182
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:05,247
This...

183
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:10,457
I'll never forget it.

184
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:13,029
So, um...

185
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:19,105
I run downstairs, and, uh, there's Chazz.

186
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,909
And he's got the hammer.

187
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,813
And he looks up at me and says,

188
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:26,118
"Oh, jeez, Lester.

189
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,756
What did I..."

190
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,462
I'm upset.

191
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:33,398
I...

192
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,835
I try to get to Pearl, you
know, to check if she's...

193
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:36,971
And Chazz says to me,

194
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,810
"Lester, this was an accident."

195
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,714
And I... "An accident?"

196
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:44,051
You hit her with a hammer.

197
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:47,424
And, uh, he raises up the hammer again.

198
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:49,093
He's still looking at me.

199
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:51,800
Uh, I don't know if he's gonna... or what.

200
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:54,404
So... so I say, um, something like,

201
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:58,145
"Chazz, what the heck..."

202
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:05,491
And the doorbell rings.

203
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,061
- Vern?
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,399
I wanted to say something, Bill.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,068
I swear.

206
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,205
But Chazz, you know, he's...

207
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,308
You were afraid.

208
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,781
Oh, I was afraid, yeah.

209
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,954
And Chazz is my only brother.

210
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,458
So then what happens?

211
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,097
So then... Uh, we go upstairs.

212
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,037
And, uh, Chazz says, "Take care of it."

213
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,907
And he goes in the back.

214
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,308
Where you kept the shotgun.

215
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,044
Where I kept the shotgun. I
should have thought of that.

216
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,917
The shotgun... I know... I know, but I...

217
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,452
I was in shock.

218
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,488
So I let Vern in, and right away

219
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:43,059
I think to... to tell him,
to say what's happened,

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,065
because Pearl could
still be alive downstairs.

221
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,869
There might still be time to...

222
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,476
And then Chazz comes in with the shotgun.

223
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,780
And I should've stopped him.

224
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:56,218
I should've said right away,

225
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:59,190
"Chazz is in the house, and he's, um..."

226
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:02,196
but I was afraid, like you said.

227
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:08,341
And now... And now it's...

228
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,554
Bill, if you think that
makes me guilty of something,

229
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:18,926
then I want you to throw the book at me.

230
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,797
Put me in jail.

231
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:23,001
'Cause I loved her.

232
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:27,002
You know, Pearl, despite all...

233
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:30,815
she was...

234
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,420
She was my wife.

235
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:10,154
Lester!

236
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,325
Lester, what did you do?

237
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:16,132
Lester!

238
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,537
Lester!

239
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,274
Lester!

240
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:05,057
Freeze! Police officer!

241
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,177
Halt!

242
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:50,172
She's awake.

243
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:56,183
What happened?

244
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:58,321
Um, you got shot.

245
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:04,932
Go outside, now, okay?

246
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:07,136
Why?

247
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,776
Just do it.

248
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,991
Did we get him? Who?

249
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:21,864
Malvo.

250
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:24,101
I had him and...

251
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:26,773
Until this other fella popped up.

252
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,375
Uh...

253
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:30,078
Look now, I-I-I gotta
tell you something...

254
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,952
Do you know what happened
to the fella I shot?

255
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:34,788
Is he...

256
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,257
He's, uh...

257
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:39,863
They got him upstairs in Intensive.

258
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,502
I shot him twice.

259
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,945
Just like they teach you.

260
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:51,946
Center mass.

261
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,192
And him with a bazooka.

262
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,162
How the heck did I do that?

263
00:15:57,163 --> 00:16:00,836
'cause you're you.

264
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:03,575
Look, here's the, um...

265
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,049
Um...

266
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,354
I shot you.

267
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:20,338
Well, that don't make sense.

268
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,242
You ran off, you know,

269
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:24,580
and... and I couldn't
see anything, you know?

270
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:27,484
I mean, not that that's any...

271
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,057
I mean, there's...
There's no excuse for it,

272
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:34,331
for what I did.

273
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,100
You were out there alone,

274
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:39,206
needing backup, and I...

275
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,210
What'd I lose?

276
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,815
A spleen.

277
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:46,086
Oh.

278
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,224
I'll get you a new one, I swear.

279
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,160
Yeah, you better.

280
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:54,334
There's gonna be an inquiry.

281
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:57,339
I was too shook up at the scene to,

282
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,848
but I'll... I'll confess.

283
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,517
They'll probably take my badge,

284
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:07,192
but with all that's happened
that's likely best, so...

285
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,527
Come on now.

286
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,196
You said yourself,

287
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,936
it's a blizzard and whiteout conditions.

288
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:17,243
And I... I could've shot you just as easy.

289
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,512
No, I've just been

290
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,450
messing things up from the go.

291
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:24,490
Hey now. That's enough of that.

292
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,428
You want some pop or something?

293
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,234
No, I want a new spleen.
That's what I want.

294
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:34,342
So, you know, better get crackin', mister.

295
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,657
Dad.

296
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:45,094
Who's watching the restaurant?

297
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,299
Screw the damn restaurant.

298
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:59,654
Guess we both got bullet holes now, huh?

299
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:18,088
You got, uh, premium channels?

300
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:20,291
I'm not sure. I just woke up.

301
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:21,693
Work that
is extremely difficult.

302
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:23,898
Rock formations...

303
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:25,968
The bark beetle
carries the wood to its nest...

304
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,939
on the way to Kessel.

305
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,176
He shoots, he scores!

306
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,513
Gophers are playing.

307
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:35,520
If that's what you wanna watch.

308
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:39,328
Forcing a turnover and
the assist to Kessel.

309
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:49,105
Ben Schmidt says you put down
a guy with an assault rifle.

310
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,528
Well, he was pointing it at me.

311
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:00,267
Yeah.

312
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:07,647
Proud of you.

313
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,994
C... C...

314
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:13,000
Hmm.

315
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,474
All right.

316
00:20:24,288 --> 00:20:25,323
Cleaners.

317
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,493
Hi, yeah, I got...

318
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:28,496
How you doing there then?

319
00:20:28,497 --> 00:20:30,164
Oh, I'm real good now. How are you?

320
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:31,967
Oh, you know, can't complain.

321
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:34,040
Wife's got a bit of a cold,
but that's life, right?

322
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,041
Sure.

323
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:39,249
Well, my house needs, uh...

324
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,322
It's... well, I'm not
gonna lie, it's a real mess.

325
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,259
Heck, that's our bread and butter.

326
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,395
Well, do you fellas do crime scenes?

327
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,699
Had a break-in, huh?

328
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,205
Yeah, it's a little worse than a break-in.

329
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:53,074
A lot of broken glass or...

330
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:54,341
Well, I'd rather not get...

331
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:55,712
Sometimes they defecate in your...

332
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,983
Let's just say there's a lot of blood.

333
00:20:57,984 --> 00:21:00,254
Hello?

334
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,298
Good!

335
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,368
And twist.

336
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,541
And front.

337
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,712
And side.

338
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:16,050
And two.

339
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:18,053
And three.

340
00:21:18,054 --> 00:21:19,623
And good!

341
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:21,226
Left arm.

342
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:23,530
And bend.

343
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,968
Bend.

344
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:28,072
Bend.

345
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:30,611
Good!

346
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,527
So I notice you got a pin on your map

347
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,730
in every state but Georgia.

348
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:20,135
What the hell do you got against Georgia?

349
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:21,570
My first wife.

350
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:23,507
She was Korean.

351
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,580
She used to spit at me when we had sex.

352
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:30,520
Can I sit?

353
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:34,262
Or did you want to kill me standing?

354
00:22:42,776 --> 00:22:45,080
Two hombres took a run at me in Duluth.

355
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,581
Mexicans?

356
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:47,784
That's the wrong part

357
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:50,454
of the sentence to be focusing on.

358
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:53,627
The point is they said Fargo sent them.

359
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:55,431
So I have two questions.

360
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:58,670
First.

361
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:02,671
Did you tell these boys where to find me?

362
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,215
Second.

363
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,688
Who do I see about this in Fargo?

364
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:10,827
Look, you know I can't...

365
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:12,729
Did you put 'em on me?

366
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,435
No. Course not.

367
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,638
But you gotta understand,

368
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,676
this is a business of relationships.

369
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:21,178
I can't just...

370
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,681
Relationships.

371
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:24,417
Right.

372
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:27,790
And, well...

373
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,130
It's not my position professionally

374
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:34,102
to get involved in squabbles.

375
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:37,174
Especially not of a private nature.

376
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:39,580
How do you know it's private?

377
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:45,851
If people are unhappy with our services,

378
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,596
they call.

379
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:51,868
A guy screws up, arrangements are made.

380
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:53,738
A cash settlement.

381
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,441
If that's not enough,

382
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:58,247
break a leg or an arm.

383
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:00,183
No calls.

384
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:03,589
Not about you.

385
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,827
So whatever it is,

386
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:09,828
it's gotta be personal.

387
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,341
Doesn't matter. It's the principle.

388
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,754
This one calls an ambulance,

389
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:21,890
that one calls a hearse.

390
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,526
I'm gonna ask you again,

391
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:24,863
and depending on the answer

392
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,702
I pick up this or that.

393
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:33,713
Who do I talk to in Fargo?

394
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:20,699
You remember me?

395
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,380
Uh...

396
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:48,101
_

397
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:51,189
Dead.

398
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:05,347
Can...

399
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:08,855
Can you talk? Speak, I mean?

400
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:15,774
_

401
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:19,308
Right, but you... you... you read lips?

402
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,480
Okay.

403
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,952
Okay.

404
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:36,872
You know I'm the one shot you, yeah?

405
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:40,873
Do you remember me from before?

406
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:43,884
In Bemidji?

407
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:45,455
The insurance office?

408
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:48,593
You were talking to Lester Nygaard.

409
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:51,767
Just hit me lying in bed
thinking about that...

410
00:26:51,768 --> 00:26:54,003
What happened, you know.

411
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:58,412
Hold the phone, I know that fella.

412
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:00,851
Did you come here looking for Malvo?

413
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,021
For... look...

414
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:09,365
Lorne...

415
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:10,768
Malvo.

416
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:12,938
Lorne Malvo?

417
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,944
Did Lester tell you where to find him?

418
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,287
It hurts?

419
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:23,291
Yeah.

420
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:25,797
Mine too.

421
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:30,304
I mean, it's crazy.

422
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:33,310
I never shot anyone before.

423
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:37,985
I'm gathering this wasn't
your first time though.

424
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:47,001
Look at us.

425
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:48,939
And you got a dad somewhere I bet.

426
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,846
Just like me.

427
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:56,352
And, I mean, what's the point, you know?

428
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:59,624
'Cause here you are,
and your friend is dead,

429
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,625
and you're gonna spend the
rest of your life in jail.

430
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:07,306
And for what?

431
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,997
Okay.

432
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:02,508
Okay, Mr. Nygaard, I
gotta ask you to stand

433
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,178
and put your back to the bars.

434
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:06,718
Listen, officer, this is a huge mistake.

435
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,687
I... This is a setup.

436
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:10,256
- Sir.
- Do you understand?

437
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:12,160
Evidence has been planted,
it's been falsified.

438
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:13,629
Sir, turn your back towards me...

439
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,864
If I could just talk to my brother...

440
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,669
or I'm gonna have to tase you.

441
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,245
This is a nightmare.

442
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:26,454
You... you gotta believe
me. I didn't do these things.

443
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:29,293
Not for me to say, sir.

444
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:34,568
Where are you...

445
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:37,674
Transfer to County.

446
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,545
You'll be there until the trial.

447
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,817
Or until you make bail.

448
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,968
Jeez, Lester.

449
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:11,870
Oh, hey.

450
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:14,608
Heard you got arrested.

451
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:16,311
Ah, well, you know how it is.

452
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:18,749
Had a few too many. Slept
it off at the station.

453
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,552
And who can blame you, really?

454
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:21,856
After what you been through.

455
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:23,525
Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:24,895
They were real sweet to me.

457
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,232
I'm the victim here, you know?

458
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:28,367
Course.

459
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,972
So what's on the agenda for today?

460
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:31,975
I'm ready to go.

461
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:33,743
You know, start fresh.

462
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,447
I can work late even.

463
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,953
There's nothing at home
but an empty house, so...

464
00:30:37,954 --> 00:30:39,387
Right.

465
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:43,361
Well, uh, I was just about
to call the widow Hess.

466
00:30:43,362 --> 00:30:45,866
Yeah, her claim's been denied.

467
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,302
You don't say.

468
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,708
Yeah, seems Sam stopped
paying the premium.

469
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:51,777
Shame really.

470
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:54,616
Good for us. That was a big policy.

471
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,887
Well, she's not gonna be happy about that.

472
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:01,595
No, she's not.

473
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:04,668
Why don't... why don't I
take that off your plate?

474
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:06,404
Really?

475
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,407
I mean, I don't know. You
sure you're ready for...

476
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,343
Look, she can't shout at me, right?

477
00:31:10,344 --> 00:31:12,614
Not after... I mean,
we're in the same boat.

478
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:14,487
So I figure I tell her,
she has a good cry,

479
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:15,755
and that's that.

480
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,558
Otherwise she's gonna be all claws-out.

481
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:18,893
That makes sense.

482
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:21,032
Yeah, it's settled. I'll head over.

483
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,402
You don't wanna just call?

484
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:24,870
Mm, no, in person's better, I think.

485
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,876
Give her a shoulder, you know?

486
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:50,453
Come in!

487
00:31:54,393 --> 00:31:57,665
I, uh, brought you some flowers.

488
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,469
Oh, thanks.

489
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,841
Just put 'em...

490
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:09,820
What are you...

491
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:11,089
Oh.

492
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,560
It's making my head hurt,

493
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:13,928
this whole case,

494
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,000
all the moving pieces.

495
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,406
Thought I'd put it up,
you know, graphically.

496
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:22,311
See if things made much more sense.

497
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:28,555
I called back to Bemidji
to talk to Bill, but he's...

498
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:31,462
I don't know, some kid
brought a gun to school

499
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:32,830
or something.

500
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:36,069
So everyone's kinda running around.

501
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,406
And to be honest, everything they said

502
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:39,644
didn't make much sense anyway.

503
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:43,382
Who's the deaf fella then?

504
00:32:43,383 --> 00:32:45,721
Fella upstairs, tried to
murder me with a bazooka.

505
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:46,756
Oh, yeah?

506
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,091
Yeah.

507
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,329
Turns out he can't hear.

508
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,033
And the other fella with his throat cut,

509
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:54,636
I'm guessing he translated.

510
00:32:54,637 --> 00:32:56,841
And they're who now?

511
00:32:56,842 --> 00:33:00,747
Well, that's the thing.

512
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,852
All I can think is...

513
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:05,055
and, you know, maybe this is a stretch,

514
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:07,928
but heck if I know any
other way to think about it.

515
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:10,800
Sam Hess, right?

516
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:14,006
So he owns a trucking company.

517
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,509
And we always thought
he had maybe alleged ties

518
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,747
to organized crime,

519
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,884
this operation out of Fargo.

520
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:22,855
So when Hess gets killed,

521
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:25,727
I'm thinking maybe Fargo

522
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:28,467
sends these two boys to
figure out what happened.

523
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:31,671
And how do they end up here?

524
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:33,875
Well, follow me.

525
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:37,515
If we think, which we do,

526
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:41,657
that Lester, on the day of the murder,

527
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,994
got bullied by Hess

528
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:46,766
and then met Malvo at the hospital.

529
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:47,935
Right.

530
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:50,674
And hired Malvo to kill Hess.

531
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:51,775
Which he did.

532
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:53,612
And then these two boys

533
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,784
come in from out of town asking questions.

534
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,154
Get to finding Lester.

535
00:33:58,155 --> 00:34:00,592
And he sends 'em here.

536
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:06,769
So Lester knew that Malvo was here

537
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,674
in Duluth.

538
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:13,916
It would appear that way, yeah.

539
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:15,118
But that's...

540
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,155
That's ammunition, right?

541
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:20,060
I mean, to go back to Lester.

542
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:22,465
Oh, yeah. You betcha.

543
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:24,069
Took forever, but I got 'em to sign off

544
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,672
on taking you home.

545
00:34:29,078 --> 00:34:31,682
Oh, so you're, uh...

546
00:34:31,683 --> 00:34:32,951
Oh, yeah.

547
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:35,923
Sure that... Recover at home, you know?

548
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:38,461
That makes sense, sure.

549
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:40,632
Thanks, dad.

550
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,970
Uh, well, okay.

551
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:44,707
Uh, guess I'll see you later.

552
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,013
Oh, dad, my flowers.

553
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:50,584
Oh, yeah.

554
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,224
Thanks for these.

555
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,696
He bought me flowers.

556
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:59,934
You don't say.

557
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,703
Glad you like 'em.

558
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:05,578
I'm gonna put 'em in water
as soon as I get home.

559
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:08,883
You keep your chin up, Gus Grimly.

560
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:10,954
We're winning this thing.

561
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:14,895
Don't you forget.

562
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:17,468
Say bye to Greta for me.

563
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,244
_

564
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:53,567
So he's got the stick in his mouth, right?

565
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,136
Biting down.

566
00:35:55,137 --> 00:35:56,872
And I grab the arrow.

567
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:59,744
Then Craig is in the car having a giggle.

568
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:01,747
Thinks the whole thing's hi-larious.

569
00:36:01,748 --> 00:36:04,287
Which that's my cousin out there, right?

570
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:07,091
So I slip the knife outta me boot

571
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:08,728
and give him the old what-for.

572
00:36:08,729 --> 00:36:11,132
Held the knife to his bloody face.

573
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:14,972
And lunch is over.

574
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,979
I don't know how they
eat that crap every day.

575
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:26,227
Speaking of...

576
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,096
What?

577
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:31,169
It's fresh.

578
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,307
Do you know the conditions of
a modern fast food restaurant?

579
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:35,912
I'm not just talking about hygiene.

580
00:36:35,913 --> 00:36:38,650
Get bent.

581
00:36:45,529 --> 00:36:46,932
They did an experiment once.

582
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:50,604
Scientist took two glasses of water.

583
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:52,675
Then he starts cursing at one,

584
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:54,544
calling it all kinds of names.

585
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,649
You're making this up.

586
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,584
I swear to God.

587
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,554
I swear to God.

588
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:01,124
He yells at one glass.

589
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,598
And then whispers sweet
nothings to the other glass...

590
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:16,218
Can I help you, sir?

591
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:17,220
Gun!

592
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:22,163
Was that shots?

593
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:24,200
Oh, my God, my God!

594
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,669
Drop it!

595
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,352
Call 911!

596
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,860
Where's the top dog?

597
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:40,229
The what?

598
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,033
The boss man.

599
00:37:42,034 --> 00:37:43,703
Unh! Third floor! Private elevator.

600
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:46,908
Oh, no!

601
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:56,894
Freeze, shitbird!

602
00:37:56,895 --> 00:38:00,032
Shit... unh!

603
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:01,735
What's the code?

604
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:03,240
For the elevator?

605
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,608
933.

606
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:21,806
Son of a...

607
00:38:23,877 --> 00:38:26,080
Drop dead... ah!

608
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:27,249
Shoot him!

609
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,289
Get out, boss!
Come on, get him, quick!

610
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,624
Agh!

611
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,661
Boss, get back!

612
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:35,096
Shoot him!

613
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:41,876
Jesus.

614
00:38:41,877 --> 00:38:43,980
What... what... Was that...

615
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,416
Call it in.

616
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,418
Oh... okay.

617
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:48,388
Call it in, man.

618
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:50,425
Your pop is in the way.

619
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:53,264
Where are you... Hold on.

620
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:54,800
Got me all...

621
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,001
Maybe we should get in the car

622
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,738
and then back up a few feet

623
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:59,241
and then pull back in
like we just arrived.

624
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:00,812
Can we just focus on the...

625
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:05,019
You need to have fewer ideas.

626
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,190
Shit balls.

627
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,292
We're in so much...

628
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,763
Okay, let me do the talking.

629
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,032
Why? I can do...

630
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,435
Because, when you talk...

631
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,040
- Back! Get back.
- ...bad shit happens.

632
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,675
FBI.

633
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,012
We're FBI.

634
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:20,915
Back! Get back!

635
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,887
Back, please. Police on the scene.

636
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:25,724
- What do you guys got?
- Really?

637
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:26,959
It's a body.

638
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,929
- Well, he doesn't know.
- Lock it down.

639
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,197
Multiple gun shots.

640
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:32,168
Shooter's still inside the building.

641
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,904
- And you're gonna need more
patrolmen than this. - Okay. Okay.

642
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:35,075
Okay. We're good.

643
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:36,912
We're going in, back us up.

644
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:37,779
James.

645
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,350
You follow us. Come on.

646
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,411
It's about time.

647
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:56,714
I've been calling.

648
00:39:56,715 --> 00:39:59,151
Sorry about the delay.

649
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:01,221
- You know the red tape on these things.
- Mm-hmm.

Thanks.

653
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:11,140
You look real nice today.

654
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,511
Thanks.

655
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,381
You're sweet.

656
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:17,319
Boys home?

657
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,955
No, thank God.

658
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:20,491
They have a game.

659
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:24,465
Good. Good.

660
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,401
You don't go then, no?

661
00:40:26,402 --> 00:40:27,604
Are you kidding?

662
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,375
I just stay here trying to drink enough,

663
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:32,614
so I'm numb by the time they get home.

664
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:37,956
Got one of those for me?

665
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:41,429
Why, Lester.

666
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,971

00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:50,413

Sure.

670

Ha ha!

671
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:58,527
Cheers.

672
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:59,563
Cheers.

673
00:40:59,564 --> 00:41:01,266
To fresh beginnings.

674
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:03,405
Yeah.

675
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:07,244
So it's all set, right?

676
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:08,346
Getting paid.

677
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:11,886
Uh, ahem, well, they should.

678
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,624
What do you mean, "Should"?

679
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,528
When do I get the money?

680
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:19,632
It's like I said, there's a few
more hoops on these homicide cases.

681
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:22,438
We're not just talking about
filing a death certificate.

682
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,142
I don't think I'm telling
you anything you don't know

683
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,647
when I say these insurance companies,

684
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:28,917
they don't like writing checks.

685
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:31,521
But I'm gonna get it, right?

686
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,259
Well, that is where

687
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,296
a skilled middleman
such as myself comes in.

688
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,502
You see, it's all about
knowing who to call.

689
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:42,502
All about knowing which palms to grease,

690
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:47,652
if you get my meaning.

691
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:51,653
I know a little something

692
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,532
about greasy palms.

693
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,951
Well, why don't you and
me have another drink?

694
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:09,960
You can show me that.

695
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:23,651
Oh, Lester.

696
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:37,544
Slow down, tiger. You're hurting me.

697
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:38,579
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,736
Ah, God.

699
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:53,572
Oh, God. Oh, God.

700
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:56,612
Oh, God. Oh, God.

701
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:59,184
Oh, God.

702
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:42,062
I should take you home and put you to bed.

703
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:45,169
Just be a second, I promise.

704
00:44:03,402 --> 00:44:04,403
Hey.

705
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:05,671
Oh, my gosh, are you...

706
00:44:05,672 --> 00:44:07,408
They said you were still...

707
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:09,244
Oh, the bullet went clean through.

708
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:11,117
Doc says take a few days, rest up.

709
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,552
Otherwise fine.

710
00:44:12,553 --> 00:44:13,555
Where is everyone?

711
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:14,722
Celebrating.

712
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:16,627
We got him...
who killed the Chief.

713
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:18,696
Lester?

714
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,233
You arrested Lester?

715
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,171
No, didn't you hear? It was his brother,

716
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,807
Chazz, the whole time.

717
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,577
He was having an affair with the wife.

718
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:27,581
She broke it off.

719
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,782
What?

720
00:44:28,783 --> 00:44:30,217
Yeah, beat her with a hammer,

721
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:31,477
then shot the Chief.

722
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:33,678
Lester covered for him.

723
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,314
Bill thinks 'cause of Chazz's temper.

724
00:44:35,315 --> 00:44:37,483
You know, the fear factor.

725
00:44:38,684 --> 00:44:40,885
Where...

726
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,455
That's not...

727
00:44:43,456 --> 00:44:45,289
I gotta talk to Bill. Where's Bill?

728
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,491
Yeah, with the rest over at Bernard's.

729
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,395
I'm supposed to go over after my shift.

730
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,896
Okay, I gotta...

731
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,800
Shouldn't you go home?

732
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,856
You okay, hon?

733
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:38,932
Now I get it.
