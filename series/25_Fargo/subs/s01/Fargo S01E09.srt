Syndicate massacre.

7
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,701

<i>They go long enough

19
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,701
you start to see
abnormalities, behavior-wise.

20
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,970
First there's the
inability to concentrate

21
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,005
and perform certain
fine motor skills.

22
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,874
Then you start to see...

23
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,476
and the army did studies
on this in the '50s...

24
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,946
the effects of sleep deprivation
on the human brain.

I mean, shit, Ray.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,680
What's the longest you've
ever gone without sleep?

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,656
Five days for me.

30
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:42,158
This was back in dental school.

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,360
Marty Perlmutter stole
a prescription pad,

32
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:46,629
wrote us all a scrip
for amphetamines,

33
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,397
so we could cram for finals.

34
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,132
And boy, howdy, I tell ya,

35
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:51,834
after three days of no sleeping,

36
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:56,405
I was an animal.

37
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,041
All right,<i>mi amigo.</i>

38
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:00,676
That ought to do it.

39
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:03,546
I'm still a little worried
about the 203 and the 204,

40
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:05,982
so we should make an appointment
to get together again

41
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,850
in about six months.

42
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:10,052
Appreciate it, doc.

43
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:11,320

46
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,159

that did by a long shot.

48
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,532
Oh, uh, you want to avoid
nut brittles for a few days

49
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,233
and any kind of fruit with pits.

50
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,835
Jemma's got a pamphlet.

51
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:27,069
- All right.
- Okay.

00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,016
Do dogs smell each
other's butts?

59

60
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,085

on occasion.

61
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,621
Well, we'll be there.

Well, they're a bunch of

91
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,462

else, that Jemma.

101
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:07,329

She stopped putting
it in her mouth

110
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,784
soon as the ring
went on her finger.

111
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,253

- Well, I'd like to meet him.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

124

Like I said, it's tricky...

125
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,289
he, uh...

126
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,159
- he's in Witness Protection.
- Say what?

127
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,796
Said he's in Witness Protection.

128
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:17,266
Turned states evidence against
these mob guys out of Chicago.

129
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,802
Told him not to.

130
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:23,773
Now I haven't seen
him in over a year.

131
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,943
He still calls, though.

132
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,512
Not supposed to, you know,

133
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,514
<i>but you can't break

134
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,083

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,660
Aw, screw it.

136
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:47,096
What are you doing next weekend?

137
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,264
You tell me.

138
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,799
<i>I like that. "You tell me."</i>

139
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:55,037
Well, Weezy and me,
we're headed for Vegas

140
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,306
to a little family reunion.

141
00:06:57,308 --> 00:07:00,643
Why don't you and
Jemma tag along?

142
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,813
Aces.

143
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,390
<i>You did this to me.</i>

144
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,093
<i>I had a wife, a family.</i>

145
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:21,063
<i>I was happy, and
then you started...</i>

146
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,065
<i>Started what?</i>

147
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,700
<i>All we did was talk.</i>

148
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:26,468
<i>No, that's not...</i>

149
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,538
<i>No, you said things,
jumbled me up.</i>

150
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,440
<i>Told me I needed...</i>

151
00:07:31,442 --> 00:07:33,042
<i>And now they're dead.</i>

152
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:34,777
<i>Why did I listen to you?</i>

153
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,879
<i>Why?</i>

154
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:37,847
<i>Oh.</i>

155
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,451
<i>Tell my wife.</i>

156
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:46,522
<i>I love her.</i>

157
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:21,891
So I come in and sit down.

158
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:23,859
"Hi, I'm Dr. Michaelson."
You know, the whole drill.

159
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:26,362
Oh, honey, could we get
some more sparkling water?

160
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:27,963
Thank you.

161
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,565
I put my mask on.

162
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,300
Tawny hands me the
number two needle.

163
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,435
I start to give the
guy a novocaine shot.

164
00:08:33,437 --> 00:08:36,038
Well, I stick the needle
in my own finger.

165
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,273
And, yeah.

166
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,674
<i>And it hurt,</i>

167
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,009
<i>but I didn't wanna look dumb,</i>

168
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:41,377
<i>so I try it again.</i>

169
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,711
<i>Next time I stick
it in my thumb.</i>

170
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:46,448
Now I'm so flustered that
I go to take my mask off.

171
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,117
But I'm still
holding the needle,

172
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,718
jab it right in my face.

173
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,924
And the patient...
the patient is like,

174
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:57,092
"Uh, doc, what's wrong?"
And I'm like...

175
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,667
I mean, it was insane.

176
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,968
<i>You're a riot.</i>

177
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,069
<i>He's a riot.</i>

178
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,838
Oh, you have no idea.

179
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,274
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

180
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:14,109
All right, so...

181
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:16,111
We are all set for tomorrow

182
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,347
to go see you-know-who.

183
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,982
Should be fun.

184
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,517
Real clandestine stuff.

185
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,320
Change cars twice. No phones.

186
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:28,624
Jeez, who did you say is
after this guy again?

187
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:32,261
Well, what are the odds?

188
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:35,130
Sorry?

189
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,834
It's me, Lester.

190
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:41,637
I'm sorry, sir, you must have
me confused with someone else.

191
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,173
Nope, Minnesota, last year.

192
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:47,042
The Emergency Room.

193
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,477
I didn't recognize
you at first either,

194
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,012
'cause you got a
whole new, uh...

195
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,547
But hey, so have I.

196
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,650
What do you think of the suit?

197
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:57,186
Bill Blass. Check this out.

198
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:59,355
Salesman of the year.

199
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:01,023
Gave it to me on a
stage and everything.

200
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,491
<i>Uh, Mick Mike,</i>

201
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,293
you gonna introduce us
to your friend there?

202
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:05,461
<i>You know, I'd love to, Burt.</i>

203
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,029
But unfortunately,

204
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:08,697
I've never met this man
before in my life, so...

205
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,633
What?

206
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:14,036
Oh.

207
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,905
Right, yeah, we don't
know each other.

208
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,510
Okay, honey, let's go.

209
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,872
We're never gonna make the show
if we don't get out of here.

210
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,486
Walk away.

211
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,221
Sorry, I must have...

212
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:33,489
Congratulations on your award.

213
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:35,024
Thank you.

214
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:36,492
Burt, did I ever tell
you about the time

215
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:38,260
I made a night guard
for Britney Spears?

216
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,695
- Really?
- I swear.

217
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,608
Come on.

218
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,843
- He was a piece of work, huh?
- Who's that?

219
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:56,578
That... that guy in the bar.

220
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,113
You sure you don't know him?

221
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,515
No, no, people nab
me all the time.

222
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:01,450
- Just one of those faces, I guess.
- Yeah.

223
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:06,889
No.

224
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,924
You don't get to... And
I'm sorry to interrupt,

225
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,159
<i>but it's not right.</i>

226
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,527
<i>When something's not right,</i>

227
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:12,928
well, the old Lester,

228
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,963
now, he would've
just let it slide.

229
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,399
But not this guy.

230
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:20,869
I've worked too hard,
I've come too far...

231
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,738
Lester, stop.

232
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,741
Oh, so now you do know me?

233
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,812
Honey?

234
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:36,585
Is this what you want?

235
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:38,320
Uh...

236
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,922
<i>Hey, Mick Mike,</i>

237
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,758
lighten up, huh?

238
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,661
Lester...

239
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,897
is this what you want?

240
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:01,844
Yes or no?

241
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,784
Yes.

242
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:20,829
Oh, my God!

243
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:27,202
Oh, my...

244
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,439
That's on you.

245
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,223
I worked this guy for
six months, Lester.

246
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,159
Six months.

247
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,227
Can you imagine the
number of sewer mouths

248
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,495
I put my hands in?

249
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:58,500
The gallons of human spit?

250
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,836
Plus the $100,000
bounty down the toilet,

251
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:03,705
but, uh...

252
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:06,742
Still, the look on his face
when I pulled the gun,

253
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,544
classic, huh?

254
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,085
Grab the fat guy's feet. We'll
throw him in a dumpster.

255
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,628
Shit, Lester.

256
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:35,771
See you later, Lester.

257
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,273
See you soon.

258
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:58,241
Oh, shit.

259
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:04,081
All right.

260
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,850
Okay, get dressed.

261
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:09,052
We gotta...

262
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:11,321
Lester, are you okay?

263
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:14,324
Get dressed. Get dressed.

264
00:14:14,326 --> 00:14:17,761
Get dressed, get dressed.
Come on.

265
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,501
Okay, go, go.

266
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:26,737
Wait a second.

267
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:29,306
All right, let's go.

268
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,548
Keep up, hon.

269
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,884
Keep up.

270
00:15:00,204 --> 00:15:01,605
Lester, you're hurting my hand.

271
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:03,974
Sorry, sorry.

272
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:22,993
Okay, okay, come on.

273
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:50,253
<i>A man has a fox, a
rabbit, and a cabbage.</i>

274
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,655
<i>What man?</i>

275
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:55,358
Any man. A man.

276
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,427
Colonel Sanders?

277
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,963
Could be. Could
be George W Bush.

278
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:01,865
Why would George W Bush

279
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:03,633
have a fox and a
rabbit and a cabbage?

280
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:04,935
Just listen.

281
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:06,670
A man has a fox, a
rabbit, and a cabbage,

282
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:08,338
and he wants to get
across the river,

283
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,940
but his boat can only carry
one of them at a time.

284
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:11,274
Get a bigger boat.

285
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:12,275
No, no, that's not an option.

286
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:13,844
And here's the problem.

287
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,012
If the man leaves the fox
and the rabbit alone,

288
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,481
the fox is gonna eat the rabbit,

289
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,049
and the same for the
rabbit and the cabbage.

290
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,685
So how does the man get
all three of his items

291
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,621
across the river without
losing any of them?

292
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:31,027
A Turducken.

293
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,329
A what's that now?

294
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,364
He stuffs the cabbage
in the rabbit

295
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:37,234
and the rabbit in the fox,

296
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,635
and he eats all of them.

297
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,670
That's not the answer.

298
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:42,839
<i>It's an answer.</i>

299
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:50,547
Hello.

300
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,383
Incoming or outgoing?

301
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:56,520
I, uh, need you to pull
the Syndicate file.

302
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:00,090
Why?

303
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,425
Is it like a clown
car back there?

304
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:04,361
Why do you need the
Syndicate file?

305
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:06,997
Yeah, did something happen
with the case? A break?

306
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,999
No, just a phone
call I gotta log.

307
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,400
- Phone call from who?
- Yeah, who called?

308
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,936
It's really none
of your business.

309
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:14,204
<i>Hey!</i>

310
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,372
Deputy Solverson.

311
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:16,506
Solverson. What does he say?

312
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:17,707
Says he knows who did it.

313
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:19,276
Okay.

314
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:21,278
Where's Bemidji?

315
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:31,421
Thanks, dad.

316
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:35,292
I think I'd look
cool with a limp.

317
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:37,894
Saw the profile of
Bill in the paper.

318
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:39,763
Yeah.

319
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,898
For the record, I advised
against wearing a sword

320
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,366
in that picture.

321
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:44,401
Hon, can you pass the syrup?

322
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:46,069
Yeah, here you go.

323
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:47,904
Anyway, I'm in charge today

324
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:49,940
on account of Bill's on his way to St.
Paul now

325
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:52,742
for a... what do you call it?

326
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,578
Law enforcement conference.

327
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,948
So watch your butts.

328
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,716
How's the route?

329
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:01,418
Can't complain.

330
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,254
You know, it takes me out by
the lake, it's a nice drive.

331
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,856
<i>Dated the girl who
delivered my mail once.</i>

332
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,592
<i>After her mother.</i>

333
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:10,327
<i>Convenient at first.</i>

334
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:14,264
Awkward after, once we broke up.

335
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:17,000
Seeing her every day.

336
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:20,170
Ended up moving to a
different neighborhood.

337
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:22,906
So that's why we moved.

338
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:27,611
You know you could've just
had your mail sent to work.

339
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:31,081
Never thought of that.

340
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,849
So when's your last day?

341
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:35,518
- About a month.
<i>- She's nesting.</i>

342
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,190
Ah, jeez, you know, you
buy one throw pillow.

343
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:42,559
Ah, we better...

344
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:45,795
Bye.

345
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:49,265
Bye, kids.

346
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:51,868
Hey, um, go fishing later?

347
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,670
You're the granddaughter
I always wanted

348
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,372
but was afraid to buy online.

349
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:57,741
Bye.

350
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,879
You did good, hon.

351
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:06,082
Yeah, and you by proximity, huh?

352
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,196
Solverson.

353
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,032
Bill.

354
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:25,869
Yeah, no, he's in the
Twin Cities for...

355
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,370
Ah, jeez.

356
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:28,705
Three people, huh?

357
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:31,508
Killed how?

358
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,976
In an elevator, huh?

359
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,811
You say one's a dentist?

360
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,212
Yeah, I'm...

361
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:39,916
What do Las Vegas
Police want me to...

362
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:42,218
Oh, sure. Yeah.

363
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,187
Yeah, no, I can go
see their witness,

364
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,422
get a statement.

365
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:46,923
What's, uh...

366
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:50,293
what's the witness' name then?

367
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:04,019
<i>Will you slow down?</i>

368
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:06,688
You'd think we
were being chased.

369
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,723
Sorry.

370
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,298
Was it me?

371
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,633
Did I do something?

372
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,201
What? No, I told you.

373
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:23,104
I made a lot of new
contacts at the awards.

374
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:24,639
Big fish.

375
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,974
You have to strike
while the iron's hot.

376
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,308
I know, but you woke me up

377
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,943
in the middle of the night.

378
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,047
Oh, I'll make it up to you.
How's that?

379
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,183
Hey, we can take a trip.

380
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:36,851
<i>Anywhere you wanna go.</i>

381
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,720
Natalie says in Acapulco

382
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:41,723
you get to drink rum right
out of the coconut.

383
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:45,026
<i>Acapulco it is.</i>

384
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:48,463
In fact, um, why don't...

385
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:49,497
We should leave tonight.

386
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,465
<i>Really?</i>

387
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,733
Sure, yeah, yeah.

388
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:53,301
I mean, why not?
Little fun in the sun.

389
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,704
Drink from a coconut.
We deserve it, huh?

390
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:59,007
What about work? Your big fish?

391
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,709
You only live once, right?

392
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:03,645
Ahem, let's just... We'll
go home, pack some stuff,

393
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,046
then head back to the airport.

394
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:06,681
Have our toes in
the sand by dawn.

395
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,849
A real adventure.

396
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,418
Oh, Lester.

397
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,741
Okay.

398
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:36,911
Now here is what
you're gonna do.

399
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:40,348
You're gonna go inside and
pack your best bikini,

400
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,183
and I'm gonna get changed
and head to the office.

401
00:21:42,185 --> 00:21:45,253
I'm gonna buy the tickets,
get the passports,

402
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:48,223
and then we are gonna
run away together.

403
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,801
Heck, we might never come back.

404
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,038
Ah, thanks, hon.

405
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,007
Here we go.

406
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,880
Truss the circle,

407
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:53,581
so whenever you go around,
you just keep going

408
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,417
even though you think
you'll fail...

409
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,320
So I checked, and there's an
11:00 out of Minneapolis.

410
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:01,089
So we should be on
the road by 6:00.

411
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:02,223
Okay.

412
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,359
I'll defrost that pea soup.

413
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:05,660
We can have that before we go.

414
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:07,428
Oh, yeah, sounds good.

415
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,529
Love you, hon.

416
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,399
Love you too.

417
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Oh.

418
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:19,874
Scared me there.

419
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:20,909
Startled me.

420
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,077
Mr. Nygaard, Deputy Solverson.

421
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,712
- Maybe you remember.
- Yeah, sure.

422
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,347
I'm sorry to bother you,

423
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,049
but we got a call
from Las Vegas PD.

424
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,250
What?

425
00:24:29,252 --> 00:24:30,752
Las Vegas Police.

426
00:24:30,754 --> 00:24:32,553
They said you were, um...

427
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,255
that you might be

428
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:35,590
a witness to a murder.

429
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:37,125
Uh, three murders, actually.

430
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,126
<i>Lester?</i>

431
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,227
It's... it's fine.

432
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,395
Go back to your show.

433
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,529
Is everything okay?

434
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:42,563
Oh, yes, ma'am.

435
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,065
Just a routine inquiry.

436
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,700
Is now a good time to ask
you a few questions?

437
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:47,135
No.

438
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:48,703
Oh.

439
00:24:48,705 --> 00:24:50,905
I mean, I got an appointment,
I gotta get to work,

440
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,707
and Linda's got shopping, so...

441
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:55,043
Now, Lester, don't be rude.

442
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,745
We just got back from Las Vegas.

443
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,047
Can you tell me
what this is about,

444
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,415
or is that classified?

445
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,283
Uh, well, yeah, actually...

446
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:04,619
Why don't... I could come to
the station this afternoon

447
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:06,921
and give a statement.

448
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:11,092
Not that I, you
know, saw anything.

449
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,627
Honestly, Lester, stay or go,

450
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,095
but I got a bladder the
size of a penny, so...

451
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,229
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Oh, yeah.

452
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:17,231
Please, come in.

453
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,767
Thank you. Thank you.

454
00:26:23,337 --> 00:26:26,306
Hey, guys, is your dad around?

455
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:29,242
<i>Yeah. Daddy!</i>

456
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:31,144
<i>Dad!</i>

457
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:37,050
Help ya?

458
00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:38,418
Oh, not sure.

459
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,720
I'm looking for Lester Nygaard.

460
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:43,022
Oh, yeah, we bought the
place from him in the fall.

461
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,324
Nice guy.

462
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:45,858
Yeah, that's Lester, all right.

463
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,193
Nicest guy you'll ever meet.

464
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:49,696
You got any idea how
I can find him?

465
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:51,898
Uh, don't have a
forwarding address.

466
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,100
He's got the shop over
on Third, though.

467
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:55,969
Is that Bo Munk?

468
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,670
<i>Nah, got his own place
now, with his name on it.</i>

469
00:26:57,672 --> 00:26:59,105
Oh, nice.

470
00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:00,873
Like I said, over on Third.
You can't miss it.

471
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,576
Okay, thanks. Oh, uh...

472
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,345
One more thing.

473
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:08,381
You do know people were
murdered in this house, right?

474
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,782
Hell of a thing.

475
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:11,250
Man in the living room, shotgun.

476
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:13,052
Woman in the basement.

477
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:16,089
I think it was a hammering.

478
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:18,391
Afterwards, Lester told
me he used to hear noises

479
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:20,259
coming from the
basement at night.

480
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:23,496
<i>Footsteps on the stairs,</i>

481
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,065
<i>a woman moaning,</i>

482
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,767
<i>that kind of thing.</i>

483
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,436
But I'm sure it was in his head.

484
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:32,805
You have a nice day.
Have fun, kids.

485
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:37,243
I don't like him.

486
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:09,742
So you won an award?

487
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:11,177
<i>That's right.</i>

488
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:12,478
<i>Salesman of the Year.</i>

489
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,049
<i>Oh, uh, yeah, I...</i>

490
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:18,317
<i>It was a national
competition, so...</i>

491
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,353
<i>Then it was dinner
with Buck Young,</i>

492
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,287
<i>who's the head of the whole deal</i>

493
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,655
that gives the award.

494
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,190
That was some spread.

495
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,192
I think we closed that
place down, drinking.

496
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:28,594
And I said I'm still
up for some fun,

497
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:30,163
and Linda said she
wanted to go to bed.

498
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:31,464
I'm a morning person.

499
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,599
Yeah, but then I thought,

500
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,602
heck, how often does
something like this happen?

501
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:38,204
You know, winning an award?

502
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:41,874
So, yeah, a nightcap, you
know, just to celebrate.

503
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,042
I told him to go.

504
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:44,377
Oh, yeah, so sure.

505
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:46,212
So I went to the bar.

506
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:48,014
And this is the
bar at the hotel?

507
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:50,349
Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.

508
00:28:50,351 --> 00:28:52,151
Excuse me.

509
00:28:52,153 --> 00:28:55,788
Uh, The Royale, I
guess it's called.

510
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,223
I ordered a drink.

511
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:59,926
Uh, had a chat with the
bartender for a bit.

512
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:01,461
<i>Male or female?</i>

513
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:03,996
Female. A woman.

514
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:07,533
But, you know, one drink and
I'm back upstairs to bed.

515
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:09,569
<i>And what happened
in the elevator?</i>

516
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:13,139
Nothing.

517
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,808
I mean, it went up.

518
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:19,312
So everyone on the elevator
was alive when you got off?

519
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:22,315
Oh, yeah, they sure were.

520
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:24,484
They were laughing
about something.

521
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:26,419
I don't... Friday
night in Vegas.

522
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:29,922
That is some place, I tell you.

523
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:31,858
Linda and me, we'd
never been before.

524
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,595
- What I love most are the fountains.
- Yeah.

525
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:39,665
Also you can gamble
at the airport.

526
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,667
Great.

527
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:43,736
Well, I checked,
and it looks like

528
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,571
you changed your flight
at the last minute

529
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:47,240
to come back on
the first flight.

530
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:50,009
So what was the reason there?

531
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,547
That was me.

532
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:57,316
My idea.

533
00:29:57,318 --> 00:30:00,786
<i>I just... I got
homesick, you know?</i>

534
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:02,522
Woke Lester up in the
middle of the night

535
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,457
and told him, did we have
to stay another day?

536
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,726
'Cause I was ready to go home.

537
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:09,962
Yeah, that's right.
That is right.

538
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:11,531
And I remember I said,

539
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:15,935
"Babe, the room is paid
for through till Sunday,"

540
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:17,970
but she was adamant.

541
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:19,872
I tend to get my way.

542
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:23,809
Oh, boy, does she.

543
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:25,478
Okay, then.

544
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,214
Well, thank you for your time, Mr.
Nygaard.

545
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:29,549
- No problem.
- Missus.

546
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:31,417
When's the due date?

547
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:34,554
Oh, I've got a few weeks still.

548
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:37,623
Listen, um, Vegas PD
is gonna send over

549
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,926
some pictures from the
hotel security camera,

550
00:30:39,928 --> 00:30:42,395
so don't leave town for a while.

551
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:44,330
I may have some more
questions for you.

552
00:30:44,332 --> 00:30:46,933
Oh, shoot. We were gonna go...

553
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:48,334
No, absolutely. Absolutely.

554
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:50,770
We'll be right here
if you need us.

555
00:30:57,747 --> 00:31:01,316
<i>Car four, come back.</i>

556
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,387
<i>Car four, come back.</i>

557
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:08,690
I'm coming.

558
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:10,224
Yeah, this is four.

559
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,060
<i>Oh, hey, Molly, a
couple of FBI fellas</i>

560
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:13,494
<i>came by the station
looking for you.</i>

561
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,229
Oh, yeah?

562
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:17,165
<i>Yeah, couldn't reach
you on the radio.</i>

563
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,266
<i>Thought you'd be at your
dad's, so I sent them there.</i>

564
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:20,101
To the diner?

565
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:21,970
<i>Yeah, so you should
probably check in on them.</i>

566
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:24,005
<i>They seemed real eager
to talk to you.</i>

567
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,542
Okay, then, will do.

568
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:15,022
Coffee?

569
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:17,591
Yeah, decaf if you got it.

570
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:21,362
And a piece of pie.

571
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:23,798
I got apple and cherry.

572
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,635
No good ever came from
a piece of cherry pie.

573
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:55,162
Thanks, friend.

574
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:01,902
Local PD?

575
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:05,339
State cop. 18 years.

576
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:09,610
Yeah, you got the look.

577
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:14,148
I spent some time
with the Tampa DA.

578
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,751
Lawyer?

579
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,420
Yeah, something like that.

580
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:25,025
Say, you may be able to help me.

581
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:28,662
I will if I can.

582
00:33:28,864 --> 00:33:30,798
I'm in town for not
too much time,

583
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,566
just passing through, really.

584
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:34,468
But, uh, I wanted to look up

585
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,136
my old pal Lester Nygaard.

586
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,238
Oh, sure, I know Lester.

587
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,239
You go by his shop?

588
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:40,975
Oh, first thing.

589
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,409
- But wouldn't you know it?
- They're closed. - Oh.

590
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:43,844
Went by the house too,

591
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:46,814
except, uh, turns
out he's moved.

592
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,982
No kidding.

593
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,483
Mm.

594
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,719
So you can see my predicament.

595
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:53,988
You try calling him?

596
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,589
Yeah, I could do that, but I...

597
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:57,958
You know, I was kind of
hoping to surprise him.

598
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:02,763
That's a pickle.

599
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:05,299
Yep.

600
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:17,111
That your boy?

601
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,514
In a way.

602
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,715
My daughter's husband.

603
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:24,752
Hmm.

604
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:28,522
They look happy.

605
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,291
Of course no one hangs
the sad pictures.

606
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:33,427
Am I right?

607
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,598
Mom crying and dad
looking angry.

608
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,401
Kid with a black eye.

609
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,607
How long did you say you
worked for the Tampa DA?

610
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,643
Oh, I didn't say I worked there.

611
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:51,412
- Spent some time is all.
- Ah.

612
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:52,946
But that's just me.

613
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:54,314
I'm a traveler.

614
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:59,219
Big cities and small towns.

615
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:01,588
Open road.

616
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,457
Which is why I thought,

617
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:07,294
here we are in a...
what do you call it?

618
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:09,830
Like, a tight-knit community.

619
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:12,833
So, uh...

620
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:15,602
why don't I just ask?

621
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:17,271
So here I am,

622
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:21,375
asking you if you know where
I can find old Lester.

623
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:28,415
Had a case once,

624
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,984
back in '79.

625
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:32,786
I'd tell you the details,

626
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:35,355
but it'd sound like
I made 'em up.

627
00:35:35,357 --> 00:35:37,357
Madness, really.

628
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,364
Bodies?

629
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,701
Yes, sir.

630
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:50,337
One after another.

631
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,340
Probably,

632
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:55,809
if you stacked 'em high,

633
00:35:55,811 --> 00:35:58,412
could've climbed to
the second floor.

634
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:04,885
Now, I saw something that year

635
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:08,388
I ain't ever seen,
before or since.

636
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:13,861
I'd call it animal.

637
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:19,833
Except animals only
kill for food.

638
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,336
This was...

639
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:31,245
Sioux Falls.

640
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:32,780
Ever been?

641
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,718
Went to Sioux City once

642
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,188
back in my scandalous days.

643
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,258
But anyway, you didn't
answer my question there.

644
00:36:46,194 --> 00:36:47,594
Well, I'll tell you what.

645
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,696
You, uh... you leave
me your number.

646
00:36:49,698 --> 00:36:51,665
I'll make sure Lester gets
it next time he comes in.

647
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,901
Well, that's a solid
offer, friend,

648
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:58,005
but like I said, I'm
just passing through.

649
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:04,578
Thanks for the pie
and the coffee.

650
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,846
Haven't had a piece
of pie like that

651
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,415
since the Garden of Eden.

652
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:21,195
Heya, dad.

653
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,263
Heya, hon.

654
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:26,099
Everything okay?

655
00:37:26,101 --> 00:37:27,768
Oh, yeah.

656
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,636
Sometimes you just
get a weird one.

657
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:34,641
Well, I'm supposed to meet a
couple fellas from the...

658
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:37,211
<i>Never mind. I see 'em.</i>

659
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,215
Hi there. I'm...

660
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,116
- Deputy Solverson.
- That's right.

661
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:44,451
I'm Agent Budge. This
is Agent Pepper.

662
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:45,853
FBI from Fargo.

663
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:47,287
<i>We went by the station.</i>

664
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:49,323
<i>They told us you would be here.</i>

665
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:50,757
Am now.

666
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:51,992
Should we grab a table?

667
00:37:51,994 --> 00:37:54,361
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

668
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,904
You made a phone call to
the field office yesterday

669
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,573
about the massacre last year.

670
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,409
Said you know who shot up
the Syndicate building.

671
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:11,612
Called seven times
according to the file.

672
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:13,313
<i>Wouldn't take no for an answer.</i>

673
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:16,750
I'm not clear on...

674
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,852
I mean, the FBI sent
a fella already.

675
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:20,153
He looked at my evidence

676
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:21,588
and said it was
circumstantial, so...

677
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,856
A worker bee.

678
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:24,291
Or what do the ants call 'em?

679
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:26,093
A drone. We're invested.

680
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,528
Got a personal stake
is what my partner...

681
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,864
See, we were there on the
day at the Syndicate.

682
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:32,299
Surveillance.

683
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:36,303
Day 156, logging the
comings and goings.

684
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:38,472
Six months and nothing happens.

685
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:40,307
- Going crazy with...
- And then...

686
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:43,443
Yeah, so, you see, we're
invested personally,

687
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:44,845
like I said.

688
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:47,147
And when we heard you called...

689
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:48,982
That you have an answer.

690
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:52,319
So please, we have to know.

691
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,788
Who is he?

692
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:00,394
Um...

693
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:02,763
dad, I think we're gonna
need some coffees to go.

694
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,754
<i>My God.</i>

695
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,192
You put all this
together yourself?

696
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:21,459
Oh, no.

697
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:24,496
<i>Gus helped me, my husband.</i>

698
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:26,731
He used to be Duluth PD.

699
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,000
He's a mailman now.

700
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:32,837
But you can see why I
think this is your guy.

701
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:33,905
Okay, I'm here.

702
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:35,507
Hey, Chief, these fellas are...

703
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,209
Bill Oswalt. I'm the Chief here.

704
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,444
Sorry I wasn't around to... I
was at a conference, so...

705
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,912
and then Cindy called

706
00:39:40,914 --> 00:39:43,081
and said there were two
agents from the FBI here...

707
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,616
Oh, no.

708
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:45,884
No, Chief, listen...

709
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,686
No, no! No, I am so sorry.

710
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:49,287
I'm so sorry.

711
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,257
Molly, these guys
aren't interested in...

712
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,026
Let's meet in my office.

713
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:56,861
Have you seen this?

714
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:58,530
Have I seen this?

715
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:01,566
Son, this thing's been
giving me nightmares.

716
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,536
Oh, come on now,
that's not fair.

717
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,571
Well, she did tell you
that we caught the guy

718
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,273
responsible for killing
the wife, didn't she?

719
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:11,610
Uh, you know, the
brother Nygaard.

720
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:12,877
And he had the
bloody hammer and...

721
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:15,247
So you don't care about the fact

722
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,782
that this Malvo character

723
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:21,553
was seen with Lester
at the hospital?

724
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:23,188
<i>Or that he ended up in Duluth</i>

725
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,224
<i>in direct conflict
with these other two?</i>

726
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:27,659
<i>No, because that...</i>

727
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,928
Uh, what happened in Duluth...

728
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,563
I'm gonna call HQ
and let them know

729
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,064
we'll be staying the night.

730
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:35,300
We can take another run
at Lester tomorrow.

731
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:36,801
Is there a motel?

732
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:39,604
Um, yeah, sure, I can...
I'll get you directions.

733
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,507
This is tremendous work, Deputy.

734
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,442
Impressive.

735
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:56,354
Yeah, I better just, um...

736
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,837
Come on.

737
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:57,108
Okay. All set.

738
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,410
Ready to go?

739
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,111
What? I thought we
weren't gonna go.

740
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:02,213
Acapulco, here we come.

741
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:03,314
Oh, my God.

742
00:43:03,316 --> 00:43:04,883
Yeah, you betcha.

743
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:06,885
I talked to the deputy.
She said, sure, go.

744
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:08,286
So now we just gotta
swing by the office

745
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:09,387
and pick up the passports.

746
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,922
What about my coat?

747
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,457
Oh, you're not gonna
need a winter coat

748
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,492
where we're going.

749
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:22,167
<i>You know I had a crush on you</i>

750
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:23,601
<i>right from when we met.</i>

751
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:26,471
Mm.

752
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,006
Oh, yeah?

753
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,742
Swear to God.

754
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:31,976
Used to sit at my desk

755
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:33,845
and dream about you
leaving your wife

756
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:37,749
or somehow getting her
out of the picture.

757
00:43:40,586 --> 00:43:41,986
Not that I wanted...

758
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,456
No, of course not. It's...

759
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:46,257
Nothing wrong with dreaming.

760
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:49,494
<i>Oh, I agree, Cinderella.</i>

761
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,629
Yeah?

762
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:53,598
You know, I remember
when I was three...

763
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,967
and I told you how we
came over to America,

764
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,103
settled in Minnesota, and
my folks bought the motel?

765
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,772
Oh, yeah?

766
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,674
<i>Well, they put me right to work.</i>

767
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:06,444
Just laundry at first.

768
00:44:06,446 --> 00:44:08,012
Then making the beds

769
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:11,182
and cleaning the rooms.

770
00:44:11,184 --> 00:44:14,052
You don't even wanna know the
disarray people leave behind.

771
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:15,520
<i>I bet.</i>

772
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,456
One time... I'll
never forget this...

773
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:23,328
I was changing the sheets
on a king size, and I'm...

774
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,997
suddenly I'm like,
"What's that smell?"

775
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,700
Well, the guest had...

776
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:33,805
He made a BM between the
mattress and the box spring.

777
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,209
What?

778
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:39,511
I guess he took the mattress off

779
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,513
and did it

780
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,248
and then made the bed back up,

781
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:46,451
which, it's a lot simpler
just to go to the toilet.

782
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,725
My point being

783
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:55,727
that while I was cleaning up,

784
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,929
I had this dream that someone,

785
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:00,331
a man,

786
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:04,402
would come along and take
me away from all this.

787
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:06,738
And then I met you.

788
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,573
And here we are.

789
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,643
And we're going to Acapulco.

790
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:56,554
I thought we were
going to the shop.

791
00:45:56,556 --> 00:45:57,989
We are.

792
00:45:57,991 --> 00:46:00,592
I just... You know how icy
it gets right out front.

793
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:02,727
Hmm.

794
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:34,525
Lester?

795
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:38,930
You know, I hate to do this,

796
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:42,533
but I kind of tweaked
my back before,

797
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:43,868
getting the luggage
out of the car.

798
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,603
Oh, you poor baby.

799
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:47,605
So do you think
you could run in?

800
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:48,973
The passports are in the safe.

801
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:51,609
There's some cash in there too.

802
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,945
Can you... Will you
do that for me?

803
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,647
Of course, hon.

804
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,882
Thanks.

805
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:02,286
Linda.

806
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:03,988
Hmm?

807
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,025
It's cold out there.

808
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:09,460
You're sweet.

809
00:47:17,536 --> 00:47:20,505
Oh, oh, uh...

810
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,640
Put your hood up, huh?

811
00:47:22,642 --> 00:47:25,410
I'd hate for your
pretty face to freeze.

812
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:23,034
Oh, my...
