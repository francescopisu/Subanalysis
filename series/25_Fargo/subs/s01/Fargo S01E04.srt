1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,638
Erstwhile on <i>Fargo...</i>

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:05,573
<i>So you think this is the one</i>

3
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:06,541
<i>killed all those people
over in Bemidji?</i>

4
00:00:06,543 --> 00:00:09,244
Could be.

5
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:11,279
I mean, you're saying this is
all some... some big coincidence

6
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,048
<i>that suddenly
we got four victims</i>

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,183
in 24 hours, yourself included?

8
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:17,652
My wife is dead,
and you're harassing me.

9
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:20,154
Just leave
poor Lester alone, will ya?

10
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,989
Found this on my windshield
last week.

11
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,492
You got bronzer
on your blackmail note.

12
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:27,695
I'm taking over.

13
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:29,263
I ran his plates,
and it turns out

14
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:32,866
that the car was registered
to one of your victims.

15
00:00:32,868 --> 00:00:35,102
30 milligrams.
Don't take two of these

16
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:37,838
and think you're gonna nap...
it's basically speed.

17
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,325
It's like a nightmare.

18
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:11,261
I told you.
I know a guy.

19
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,764
You know a guy.

20
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,332
A guy?

21
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:19,902
Better be some guy, Stavros.

22
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:25,408
For this...

23
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,178
we gave up everything.

24
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,480
Gave up?
What did we have?

25
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,982
Debts, screaming phone calls,

26
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,884
bill collectors at the door.

27
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:38,688
<i>At least it was warm.</i>

28
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:50,332
Shit.

29
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:51,967
What?

30
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:53,602
Out of gas.

31
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:55,036
You bought gas.

32
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:56,471
$5.00.
It was all I had.

33
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,739
<i>Idiot!</i>

34
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,174
<i>The boy's gonna freeze!</i>

35
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:00,609
<i>We can't stay here.</i>

36
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,411
I know.
I'll think of something.

37
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:03,612
<i>Think of what?</i>

38
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:04,646
Gasoline?

39
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:06,348
Yeah, from your brain into...

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,683
Would you shut up?
I got to think.

41
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,310
Oh, hey!

42
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:40,080
<i>Here!
Here!</i>

43
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,849
Hey!

44
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:44,484
Here!
Here!

45
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:45,885
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
slow down.

46
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,854
Hey! No, no, stop!

47
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:49,989
Stop!
Wait!

48
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,724
Hey!
Come on, come on!

49
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:54,727
Oh!

50
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:03,069
All right.

51
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,839
Lord, let me get through this.

52
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,408
Let us find gas

53
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,077
and a...
and a warm bed.

54
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,548
Let us prosper even in the...
in the smallest of ways,

55
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,884
and I'll be your humble servant

56
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:22,855
for the rest of my days.

57
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:25,390
Yeah.

58
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:09,123
Oh, God.
My God.

59
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,794
Oh, God.
My God.

60
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:15,930
Thank you, God.

61
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,673
All right.

62
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,145
I can't believe
he wouldn't stop...

63
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:34,015
A family vehicle,
a baby in a car.

64
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:36,883
Who doesn't stop
for a baby in a car?

65
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,418
God is real.

66
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,387
We're gonna freeze to death

67
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,656
<i>because a man that hasn't
showered since the '70s</i>

68
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:44,558
<i>couldn't be bothered
to apply the brakes.</i>

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
God is real.

70
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:55,202
God is real.

71
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:06,178
Well...

72
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,748
there's nothing here.

73
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,217
No wildlife in your pipes.

74
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,352
Water heater's clean.

75
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:17,556
I'm not sure how you got
blood in your shower.

76
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,692
Are you sure it wasn't rust?
'Cause...

77
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,193
Listen to me.

78
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:23,195
It's not like
a band-aid fell out, okay?

79
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:24,597
It was buckets,

80
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,600
literally buckets of blood.

81
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:28,868
Whoa.

82
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,369
Making a horror film, huh?

83
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:32,972
And with the dead dog
you mentioned too... uffda.

84
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:35,373
Sounds like a bad day.

85
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:38,877
Did you see any signs
of tampering?

86
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,479
Tam... tampering?

87
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,781
Yeah.

88
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,416
Screws loosened recently

89
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:49,554
or holes that blood
could've been injected.

90
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,289
Injected?

91
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,758
What the heck are you
thinking happened here?

92
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,060
Nothing.

93
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:58,163
Thanks for your time.

94
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,931
<i>Yeah.</i>

95
00:07:59,933 --> 00:08:03,301
You know, I, uh... I seen
your commercials on TV...

96
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:05,736
July in January.

97
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,272
You got any, like,
gift certificates?

98
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,907
- The wife, she...
- Get the hell out of here.

99
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,642
Sure, okay.

100
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:13,177
Yeah.

101
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,015
Uh, say...

102
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:20,551
you ever read the Bible?

103
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,022
What?

104
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,757
The Bi... Bible...

105
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,992
you know, The Big Book.

106
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:30,761
All that blood
made me think of it,

107
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:33,596
you know, Moses and the like.

108
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:36,466
"And God sent a plague
of blood upon the land."

109
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:38,401
Better get right with the Lord.

110
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,169
- You know what I'm...
- <i>What'd you say?</i>

111
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:43,339
Nothing.

112
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,874
Say it again.

113
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:46,509
Well, no...

114
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:47,944
What did you say to me?

115
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,612
- Say it again!
- Boss, let him go.

116
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,947
What did you say?

117
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,315
Boss, he's just a damn plumber.

118
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,117
Let him go.

119
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,455
Jeez.

120
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,057
He's crazy.

121
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,625
You're crazy!

122
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,334
<i>Jeez.</i>

123
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,471
<i>Car 39, this is Dispatch.</i>

124
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:51,539
<i>Come in.</i>

125
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,309
Ah, hold your horses.

126
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,612
<i>Car 39, this is Dispatch.
Come in.</i>

127
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,451
Yeah, this is 3-9.
Over.

128
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,121
<i>Car 39, need you to follow up
on a report...</i>

129
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:11,491
<i>murdered canine

130
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:13,059
<i>Over.</i>

131
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:17,463
Is that a... Can you call it
a murder if it's a...

132
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:19,933
Anyhoo, that's Animal
Control's purview.

133
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,434
<i>Yeah, Joe's sick.</i>

134
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,002
<i>Was supposed
to respond yesterday.</i>

135
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,405
<i>Claimant's super PO'd.
Over.</i>

136
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,774
Jeez, come on,
that guy is always sick.

137
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:30,342
What's he got, the cancer?
Over.

138
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:33,245
<i>Yeah, leukemia.
Over.</i>

139
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:35,881
Jeez, that is...
that's awful.

140
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:39,218
Okay, well, uh...

141
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,320
3-9,
car 3-9 responding.

142
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:44,623
Over and out.

143
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,038
1-2-5.

144
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,011
1-2-7.

145
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:10,081
Okay.

146
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,753
Oh, jeez.

147
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,188
It's him.

148
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:28,265
It's him.
Oh!

149
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:34,170
Freeze!
Don't...

150
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:36,339
Put your hands
where I can see...

151
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:38,541
where I can see 'em.

152
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:42,012
I'm just on a call.

153
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,147
Drop... drop it.

154
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,383
Yeah, just as soon as I finish.

155
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:47,951
This is Duluth.

156
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:51,821
Package requested.
Frank Peterson.

157
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,657
Okay, all good.
See?

158
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,191
Put it down.

159
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,225
It's a new phone.

160
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,694
Now!

161
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,229
Okay.

162
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:03,198
Okay, um...

163
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,703
uh, turn around and put
your hands on your head.

164
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,639
What... what's this
all about, Officer?

165
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:13,375
You know what this is about.

166
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:16,145
Okay, um...

167
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:19,148
put your, uh... your left hand
around your, uh...

168
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,749
the back of your...

169
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:24,019
Yeah.

170
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:25,486
Okay.

171
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:28,256
Now the other one.
Slowly.

172
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:31,192
Am I under arrest?

173
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:34,028
You're handcuffed.
Of course you're under arrest.

174
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,932
On what charge?

175
00:12:37,934 --> 00:12:39,901
It... um...

176
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:43,204
We'll figure that out
at the station.

177
00:12:45,274 --> 00:12:48,376
Okay.

178
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:50,411
All right.

179
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,181
Back... back to the car.

180
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,358
Dang it.
Dang it.

181
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,967
All right, uh, butt first.

182
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:15,302
Watch your head.

183
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,291
You're making a mistake.

184
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,861
Be quiet.

185
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:50,669
You're making a mistake.

186
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:54,973
I said quiet!

187
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:59,110
That's what you're gonna say
a couple hours from now...

188
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,746
"You're making a mistake."

189
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,271
Got one.

190
00:14:14,273 --> 00:14:17,607
What was he, mean to a cat?

191
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,943
Murder and car thievery,
all right?

192
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:22,511
This fella's wanted for
the triple homicide in Bemidji.

193
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,146
Oh, now, hold on a sec.

194
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:26,148
It's like I told
this young fella.

195
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,018
This is a boondoggle,
plain and simple.

196
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,886
Save it, Cochise.

197
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:33,723
Now, I'm gonna ink
your right hand

198
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:36,559
and press each finger
individually against a book.

199
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:38,694
If you try anything,

200
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:41,330
I can't promise your fingers
won't get broke.

201
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:44,166
Okay, message received,
young fella.

202
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:46,969
You won't get
no pushback from me.

203
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,759
What the heck?

204
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,971
<i>Son of a...</i>

205
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,606
<i>Molly, call on two.</i>

206
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:27,174
Yeah, Solverson.

207
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,376
<i>Yeah, hey, it's Gus.
I got him.</i>

208
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,578
Who's this, then?

209
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,415
Uh, yeah, Gus Grimly,

210
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:35,883
from over Duluth.

211
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,419
You know, we had
the milkshakes the other...

212
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,254
Oh, yeah, hey.
How's it going?

213
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:41,855
<i>Yeah, uh, real good.</i>

214
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,926
Um, so, uh, I was
on patrol earlier,

215
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:48,628
responding to a 613, and, uh...

216
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,782
<i>What's that, then?</i>

217
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:52,765
A-a dead dog,
foul play suspected.

218
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,667
And I see this fella,

219
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,036
and he's standing by a van.

220
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,438
And it was him.

221
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,973
Him who?

222
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,741
<i>The fella
from Mr. Nygaard's car.</i>

223
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:03,176
The driver?

224
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,344
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,880
The, um...
the one I let go.

226
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,615
But there he was.

227
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,950
I mean, you know, just standing
there making a call on his, uh...

228
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,385
So... so... what did you...

229
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,187
I stopped and arrested him,
of course.

230
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,421
Arrested him?

231
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,956
Yeah.
For the murders.

232
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,927
I'm looking at the guy
right now.

233
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:24,229
The Lieutenant's gonna
have a chat with him.

234
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,264
I thought you might want to...

235
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,632
Yeah, yep.

236
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,267
Okay, I'm getting in my car.

237
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,035
- <i>Great.</i>
- Yeah.

238
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:32,771
Uh, I'll be there
just as soon as I...

239
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:35,173
Okay, then. Yeah, I'll tell
the Lieutenant to wait for you.

240
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:37,609
- Thanks.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

241
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,711
- <i>You're welcome.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

242
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,480
So we've been putting in
a lot of hours on the Chief,

243
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,916
but the weather service
is tracking a big storm.

244
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,717
Okay, they're looking
at Wednesday night,

245
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,318
Thursday early AM...

246
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,720
high winds, blizzard,
the whole shebang.

247
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,822
So, if you want to make
extra money plowing,

248
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:53,291
see Cindy.

249
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:55,259
Same goes for traffic duty,
et cetera.

250
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,428
I don't want this impacting
everyday doings.

251
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,330
So don't sign up

252
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,831
<i>unless your workload
is cleared.</i>

253
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,967
Chief, they got him.

254
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:04,635
Who?

255
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:05,670
Duluth PD.

256
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:07,939
No, who'd they get?

257
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:11,976
Oh, yeah, uh, fella driving
Lester's stolen car.

258
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:14,845
<i>Deputy pulled him in
an hour ago.</i>

259
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,614
How come they called you?

260
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,182
Pardon?

261
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:20,750
Well, you're not even
on the case.

262
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:22,118
How come they called you?

263
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,687
I just...

264
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:26,089
Well, the other day
a deputy drove down from Duluth,

265
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,759
and, you know, he and I...
he and I talked is all.

266
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:31,962
Well, that's irregular.

267
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:35,265
They should talk
to the officer in charge.

268
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,967
Yeah, yeah, so I's thinking
I'd drive up there,

269
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:38,535
you know, talk to the suspect,

270
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,537
on account of, you know,
I think he's the fella

271
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,972
put the naked guy in the trunk.

272
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:43,506
Nah, should be me.

273
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:45,441
You said he was driving
Lester's car.

274
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:46,443
That's my case.

275
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:48,344
Plus, Vern takes precedence.

276
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:50,980
Okay, but, Chief... Knutson,
you're in charge till I get back.

277
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,082
Okeydokey, Chief.
Ten-four.

278
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:06,962
Got to pick up a few things.

279
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,197
You could have waited
in the car.

280
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:09,832
No, Kitty said I should...

281
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:12,234
I mean, I want to be here
for you, so...

282
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,168
Oh, jeez.

283
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,643
They just...
they leave it like that?

284
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,045
All the blood?

285
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,980
Yeah, it's, uh...

286
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:29,684
you know, they gi... they give you
a number to call, a service.

287
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:34,756
Lester, I...

288
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:36,991
I got to...

289
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,669
Jeez.

290
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,211
Oh, yeah... oh, my...

291
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:00,547
oh, yeah.

292
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:10,123
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, God.

293
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,125
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

294
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,094
Oh.

295
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,363
What's...

296
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:28,641
Ow!
God damn it!

297
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:31,010
Christ!

298
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,560
Oh, my God.

299
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,430
There, that's...

300
00:19:57,636 --> 00:20:01,139
Hello?

301
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:04,642
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

302
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:07,278
Who's this?

303
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,347
<i>The Widow Hess...</i>

304
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,748
<i>her husband nice and cozy
in the ground,</i>

305
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,017
<i>insurance money on the way,</i>

306
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,320
<i>every night she puts
her kitty in your face.</i>

307
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,925
<i>Guy like you, Lester,
small town, small time,</i>

308
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,528
<i>I think you won the lottery.</i>

309
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,332
<i>But I think that
you need to ask yourself...</i>

310
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:31,768
<i>was it worth it?</i>

311
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,203
Worth what?

312
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,539
<i>Your life.</i>

313
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:29,397
- Freshen you up?
- No, we're good. Just the check, please.

314
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,331
Everything okay?

315
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,700
He's just not very hungry.
Thanks.

316
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:40,371
Thanks.

317
00:22:13,737 --> 00:22:16,706
For Christ sakes, man!

318
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:29,085
Seriously?

319
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:02,150
I'm not looking at you!

320
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:04,019
I'm not looking at you.

321
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:12,927
You got two minutes.

322
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,696
Okeydokey.
Thanks a lot, sir.

323
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:42,422
Sir?

324
00:23:42,424 --> 00:23:44,190
Are you Don Chumph?

325
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,861
Uh... yeah.

326
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:50,363
There's a phone call for you.

327
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:52,932
- A what now?
- Telephone.

328
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,934
You can take it
right here at the counter.

329
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,074
Hello?

330
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:02,774
<i>Do they have 'em?</i>

331
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,109
Who is this?

332
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,011
Well, let's figure
this out together.

333
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,213
Who knows you're
at the pet store right now?

334
00:24:08,215 --> 00:24:09,781
My mom.

335
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,919
Do I sound like your mom?

336
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:16,054
- Uh, no.
- <i>Hold on.</i>

337
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,357
Does your mom know why you're
at the pet store right now?

338
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,226
She thinks I'm getting a cat.

339
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:23,061
Okay, I don't have time
for this.

340
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:26,398
Do they have 'em, yes or no?

341
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,967
Yeah, but only a hundred.

342
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,902
Okay, well, there are three
other pet stores in the city,

343
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,970
so hit 'em all.
I'm in jail.

344
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,672
I'll be out in a few hours.

345
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,073
Wait. What?

346
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,709
Time's up.

347
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,746
Okay, two hours.
Come get me.

348
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,218
And this is the deputy
who effected the arrest.

349
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,853
Yeah, nice work there.

350
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,221
He give you much of a fight?

351
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,856
Uh, no, sir.

352
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:54,492
Bill Oswalt's the Chief
over Bemidji.

353
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,927
Ah.

354
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,729
Molly come?

355
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,331
Who?

356
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,165
Deputy over in my office.

357
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,201
Sounds like your man's
got a thing for her.

358
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,770
Lock that shit down, Grimly.

359
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,938
This is a murder case.

360
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,673
Yes, sir.

361
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,409
So we got a name on the guy?

362
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,177
<i>Yes, sir, driver's license
says Frank Peterson</i>

363
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,414
and an address up in Baudette.

364
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:20,550
Peterson, eh?

365
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,552
I knew a Jay Peterson once.

366
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,456
Had a dwarf arm.

367
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,857
What about evidence?

368
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,359
Sir?

369
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,226
Yeah, proof of his connection
to the crime.

370
00:25:31,228 --> 00:25:33,328
You say you stopped him
driving Lester's car.

371
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,597
<i>Yes, sir, but I didn't know
that it was stolen.</i>

372
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,866
<i>Why I let him go.</i>

373
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:40,869
Yeah, but you pulled prints
from the impounded vehicle?

374
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:42,104
No, sir.

375
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,872
Tech said it was wiped clean.

376
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:45,107
Yeah.

377
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,909
Well, we got a photo,
though, right?

378
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:48,744
I mean, dashboard camera
from the car stop?

379
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:50,813
You know, proof he's our guy.

380
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,382
No, sir, my camera
hasn't worked for weeks.

381
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:54,883
But Molly's got a picture.

382
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:56,618
It's in the file.
She showed me.

383
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
Yeah.

384
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:00,188
- She did?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,593
There.

386
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:08,262
Yeah, this fella.

387
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:11,099
It's kind of hard
to see, though.

388
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:14,001
It's grainy.

389
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,637
You sure this is our guy?

390
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,273
Yeah... yeah, no.
That's our guy.

391
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,843
I-I'm positive.

392
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:34,354
Yeah, I'm Lieutenant Schmidt.

393
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:38,058
This is Bill Oswalt,
Chief over Bemidji.

394
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,359
Yeah, Frank Peterson.

395
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:41,028
I'm the minister
up in Baudette.

396
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,763
Go, Bears.

397
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,202
Minister?

398
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:49,469
Yeah, Baudette Lutheran,

399
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,872
six years now...
Frank Peterson.

400
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:54,208
Before that, Aberdeen.

401
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,642
<i>So, you know, I'm not used</i>

402
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,310
<i>to having a firearm
stuck in my face,</i>

403
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,045
which I know the Lord
tests you in all kinds of ways,

404
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,614
but, oh, partner,
that's a heart-stopper.

405
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:08,888
<i>Cut the shit.</i>

406
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,423
You were pulled over
Tuesday night

407
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,425
driving a stolen car.

408
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:15,194
No, sir.
I think I'd remember that.

409
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:17,363
Plus, Tuesday's bingo night
at the church.

410
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:20,433
<i>We had a full house.</i>

411
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:23,069
Florence Nightgarden won
the entire pot,

412
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:25,037
if I'm not mistaken.

413
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,906
And we can check on that?

414
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:30,408
Oh, sure, yes, sir.
You could call Florence herself.

415
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,911
Or Jim Avery...
he's our alderman.

416
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:34,579
Deputy Grimly...

417
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:37,616
Oh, that's the fella,
Deputy Grimly.

418
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:39,885
Pulled his pistol,
pointed it right at me.

419
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,287
Thought I was gonna have
a heart attack.

420
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,055
But, you know, after he told me

421
00:27:44,057 --> 00:27:46,124
about those homicides
over Bemidji,

422
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:48,226
I thought, "Frank, I mean,
you can't blame the guy"

423
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,929
for being a little jumpy,
a horror show like that."

424
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:54,965
That son of a bitch.

425
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,434
So you're saying you weren't
in Bemidji last week?

426
00:27:57,436 --> 00:27:59,036
If I show your picture around,

427
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,571
no one would recognize you?

428
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:02,273
Me?
No, sir.

429
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:04,708
I have a cousin lived
in Bemidji back in the '90s,

430
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,110
out near Leech Lake,

431
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:08,913
but he moved to Anchorage
in '03.

432
00:28:08,915 --> 00:28:12,950
I said, "What, Minnesota's
not could enough for you?"

433
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:15,419
We had a good laugh about that.

434
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:18,722
Also, you're saying you weren't
pulled over for speeding?

435
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:20,057
No, sir.

436
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:22,159
I'm a cautious driver
by nature,

437
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:23,993
on account of my eyesight.

438
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,095
Glaucoma, they say it is.

439
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:28,998
Only in the one eye,
but you can't be too careful.

440
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,967
<i>That's what I tell
my parishioners.</i>

441
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,336
- Deputy Grimly...
- <i>Forgiveness...</i>

442
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,904
that's the heart
of the Good Book.

443
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:37,240
Turn the other cheek,
second chances, Amen.

444
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:40,176
So, no, I don't hold a grudge
against the Deputy,

445
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:43,112
though I'm lucky I had
my nitroglycerine pills with me,

446
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,214
I tell you, uffda.

447
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:51,087
Okay, well, sit tight.

448
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:53,755
We're gonna make some calls,
check your story.

449
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:56,658
Oh, you just... just pick a name
out of the phone book.

450
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,060
Everybody up there knows me.

451
00:28:58,062 --> 00:28:59,795
<i>Yeah.</i>

452
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,957
So, uh, looks like a call
was placed to your motel

453
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,926
from the victim's house the
night Pearl Nygaard was killed.

454
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:27,762
You said that on the phone.

455
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,697
Right.

456
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:33,367
So, uh, you remember any seedy
types checking in last week?

457
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:35,636
Possible with a head injury?

458
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:37,438
I thought on it
on the way over.

459
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,407
There was a fella
checked in around then,

460
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:40,941
had a bump on his head.

461
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:43,377
Gave me guff when I asked him
if he had any pets.

462
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:44,779
Oh, yeah?

463
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,781
Was it, uh, this fella maybe?

464
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:48,149
<i>Yeah.</i>

465
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,117
That's him.

466
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,419
You don't sound
too happy about it.

467
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:57,090
Well, he just wasn't
very nice is all.

468
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:59,459
Brought my book like you asked.

469
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:01,227
Fella paid cash, I think.

470
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:04,364
But I make everyone put
their name in the ledger.

471
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:08,234
There ya go.

472
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:09,335
Okay.

473
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,504
Yeah.

474
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:15,208
<i>"Lorne Malvo."</i>

475
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,843
<i>Say, uh...</i>

476
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:18,678
you remember
finding anything odd

477
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,345
when you cleaned his room?

478
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:21,947
What do you mean odd?

479
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:25,517
Like out of the ordinary,
memorable, I guess.

480
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,520
Well, he had some tokens
from over the Lucky Penny.

481
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:32,191
You don't say.

482
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:35,127
<i>Okay.</i>

483
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,361
<i>All right.</i>

484
00:30:36,363 --> 00:30:37,782
Thank you.

485
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,733
All right, then, well,
it looks like he's

486
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:43,736
a pretty well respected member
of the community up there.

487
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:46,138
<i>We just had to call and verify.
Thanks for your time.</i>

488
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,247
- Grimly.
- <i>Where you been?</i>

489
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:57,582
<i>I've been trying
to call you all day.</i>

490
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:58,983
Thought you were coming.

491
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:01,920
Yeah, I tried.
Are you in the room?

492
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:04,022
Yeah, they just talked to him.

493
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,390
<i>Why not you?</i>

494
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:06,558
Me?

495
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,427
No, I do Animal Control mostly.

496
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:11,996
<i>Listen, I got a name
for the suspect...</i>

497
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:13,231
Lorne Malvo.

498
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,066
He used it
to check into a motel.

499
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:17,569
Lorne Malvo, huh?

500
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:20,270
Oh, they're... they're coming out.
I'll call you back.

501
00:31:20,272 --> 00:31:21,905
<i>Sorry again for
the confusion, Pastor.</i>

502
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:24,174
Oh, just glad nobody got hurt.

503
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,514
You're letting him go?

504
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:31,715
Desk duty, two weeks.

505
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:33,784
- Now, just a...
- Three weeks.

506
00:31:33,786 --> 00:31:35,252
For Pete...

507
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:36,987
You're making a mistake.

508
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,864
<i>Grimly, with me, now.</i>

509
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,469
You pointed your service weapon
at a civilian...

510
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,638
no, a damn minister
on a public street.

511
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,573
No evidence, no fingerprints,
nothing.

512
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:59,575
What about the picture?

513
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:00,810
Oh, that Zapruder film
in the file?

514
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:02,245
Hell, son,
that could be a photo

515
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,579
of my mama, for all I know.

516
00:32:03,581 --> 00:32:05,248
No, it's him.
I know it's him.

517
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,083
Negatory.
We checked his story.

518
00:32:07,085 --> 00:32:09,318
- It tracks.
- He's lying!

519
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,771
You have a blessed day.

520
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,781
How can you do that?

521
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:44,019
What's that, son?

522
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:47,221
Just... just lie like that.

523
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,791
I sure hope
you catch that fella

524
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:52,426
killed all those people.

525
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,428
I'll be praying on it.

526
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:58,899
Lorne Malvo.

527
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,179
Did you know the human eye

528
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:15,648
can see more shades of green
than any other color?

529
00:33:19,987 --> 00:33:21,621
What?

530
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:23,356
I said, "Did you know
that the human eye"

531
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:27,694
can see more shades of green
than any other color?"

532
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:30,730
<i>My question for you is, why?</i>

533
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:33,666
No, no, no,
just h-hold on.

534
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,168
<i>When you figure out</i>

535
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,904
the answer to my question,

536
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,907
then you'll have
the answer to yours.

537
00:34:02,596 --> 00:34:03,929
Where are they?

538
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:06,031
In the back.
Can't you hear?

539
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:08,367
It's driving me crazy.

540
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:14,772
Yeah?

541
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,273
<i>Yeah, Mr. Nygaard?</i>

542
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,875
<i>This is Dave
from Duluth Impound.</i>

543
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:20,111
Oh, oh, yeah, I'm gonna pick
her up probably Friday.

544
00:34:20,113 --> 00:34:22,380
<i>No, sir, I'm supposed to tell
you your car's not ready yet.</i>

545
00:34:22,382 --> 00:34:24,148
What do you mean?

546
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,616
<i>It's, uh... well,
forensic team's looking at it.</i>

547
00:34:25,618 --> 00:34:27,418
- Forensic?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

548
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,753
<i>Just routine, but I can't
release the car to you</i>

549
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:30,621
<i>till they release it to me,</i>

550
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:32,256
<i>so I'll just call you
when it's done, okay?</i>

551
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:34,058
- <i>Bye, now.
- Hey, Lester.</i>

552
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,293
Aah!

553
00:35:10,383 --> 00:35:11,948
I'm in a meeting.

554
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,250
<i>Chazz?</i>

555
00:35:13,252 --> 00:35:15,952
Oh, I said,
"I'm in a meeting."

556
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:17,554
Chazz, it's Lester.

557
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:20,123
Look, I think I might be
in a bit of trouble here.

558
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,026
When are you not in...
What kind of trouble?

559
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:25,862
<i>Well, uh, I'm...
I'm in the trunk of a car.</i>

560
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,197
What?

561
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,367
A car.
In... in... in the trunk.

562
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,102
<i>You're in the trunk
of your car?</i>

563
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:33,470
No!
N-not my car.

564
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:35,105
It's... it's these two fellas.

565
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:36,907
You see, the thing...

566
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:39,909
I think I may have
been kidnapped, is the thing.

567
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:41,377
<i>What?</i>

568
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:45,581
Yeah, they got me,
uh, in the trunk.

569
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,717
I'm not... don't really
know where we're going.

570
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,386
Did you say you got kidnapped?

571
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:54,556
<i>Lester, where are you?</i>

572
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:55,724
I'll call the cops.

573
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:57,126
No, no, no, no.

574
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:59,929
Don't... don't...
don't call the...

575
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:04,566
Yeah, I'm just, uh...
I'm pranking you.

576
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:06,035
What?

577
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:07,536
<i>Yeah, remember
how we used to...</i>

578
00:36:07,538 --> 00:36:10,305
<i>you know,
practical jokes and all?</i>

579
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:12,240
<i>Well, uh, you're it.</i>

580
00:36:12,242 --> 00:36:14,575
You're an asshole.

581
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:50,877
Come on.

582
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:54,348
There you go.

583
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:57,918
Come on, let's go.

584
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,474
You're gonna say it.

585
00:37:22,476 --> 00:37:24,777
"I, Lester Nygaard..."

586
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:27,179
You're gonna say it.

587
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,516
"I, Lester Nygaard..."

588
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:34,320
I, Lester Nygaard...

589
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:36,387
Louder.
Louder!

590
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,790
- I, Lester Nygaard...
- "Killed!"

591
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,291
No, no, you see,
I did not kill...

592
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:42,060
Lester, you're gonna say it

593
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:44,195
- one way or the other, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:45,229
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:46,731
"Killed Sam Hess."

596
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,700
That's not true.
I didn't kill him.

597
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:49,734
Yes, you did.

598
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:50,835
No, I didn't.

599
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:52,370
Okay, then who was it?

600
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:53,504
The man.

601
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:54,539
Who's the man?

602
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,573
The man.

603
00:37:55,575 --> 00:37:56,908
Who?
Who's him?

604
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,344
Who...
who is him?

605
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:00,712
It was the guy.

606
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:04,716
Was... What... Who?
What guy?

607
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:13,047
I need...

608
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,216
- Hi, I need...
- Is this your car, sir?

609
00:39:15,218 --> 00:39:16,418
What?

610
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,254
- Is this your car?
- No, no.

611
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,056
I need a ride back to town.

612
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:24,426
- I'm not a taxi service, sir.
- What?

613
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,060
I said we're not
a taxi service.

614
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:27,662
Please, I just...
I just need...

615
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:30,432
Just give me a damn ride.

616
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,065
Oh.

617
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:35,235
Heck, sir.
Well, now I got to arrest you.

618
00:39:35,237 --> 00:39:37,671
Well, good, good.
Let's go.

619
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:44,745
Oh, jeez.

620
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:47,281
Thanks.

621
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:54,922
Okay.

622
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:04,330
Yeah, this is car 3108.

623
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,532
I'm coming in with a 3-1-3.

624
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:07,867
<i>Copy, 3108.</i>

625
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,636
Yeah, guy punched me.

626
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,016
Knock, for Christ's sake!

627
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:32,085
How many times?

628
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:35,488
Not now.

629
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,457
Not now!

630
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:41,528
Look, I want to talk about mom.

631
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,729
I said, "Not now."

632
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:44,764
Dad, you're not
being very nice.

633
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,232
"Nice"?

634
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:47,901
You think you go down
to a car dealership,

635
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:49,536
buy a car with nice?

636
00:41:49,538 --> 00:41:52,038
You think the girls
at titty bar care about nice?

637
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,708
It's kill or be killed, son.

638
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,083
Are you crying?

639
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:07,686
No.

640
00:42:22,636 --> 00:42:23,736
No, don't.

641
00:42:26,373 --> 00:42:29,774
Kill or be killed.

642
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:10,113
Dad, what's happening?

643
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,164
<i>We demand one
million in unmarked bills.</i>

644
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,132
<i>We'll call tomorrow
at 10:00 AM</i>

645
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:31,834
<i>with the drop instructions.</i>

646
00:43:31,836 --> 00:43:34,970
<i>Do you understand?</i>

647
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,639
Yeah.

648
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:38,641
<i>Remember, God is watching.</i>

649
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:41,143
Is that him?

650
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:55,323
God is real.

651
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:15,543
Bartender,

652
00:44:15,545 --> 00:44:17,245
- I tend...
- Hmm.

653
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:19,514
To have a, uh, beer

654
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:22,217
and then a little tequila guy.

655
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:24,518
Looks like you already
had a few.

656
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,187
Well, then they're working,
right?

657
00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:33,127
What are you looking at?

658
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:44,171
You know,
I'll tell you something.

659
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:52,879
I will put your eye out.

660
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:32,051
I was about to send
a search party.

661
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:33,352
Yeah, sorry.

662
00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:35,187
Cindy said Bill's
on his way back.

663
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:36,789
What happened?

664
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:40,759
Well, they, uh...
they let him go, Malvo.

665
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:43,195
Yeah, he had an alibi,
it checked out,

666
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:45,297
but it's him.

667
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:47,199
How do you know?

668
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:48,968
'Cause I said the name
Lorne Malvo,

669
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,103
and he stopped,
and he looked at me real funny.

670
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:54,672
And then he said, like,
a riddle.

671
00:45:54,674 --> 00:45:56,507
What's that about a riddle?

672
00:45:56,509 --> 00:46:00,945
Like, um, how come
the human eye can see

673
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:04,749
more shades of green
than any other color?

674
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:07,685
'Cause of predators.

675
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:09,520
Uh...

676
00:46:09,922 --> 00:46:12,122
Used to be,
we were monkeys, right?

677
00:46:12,124 --> 00:46:13,457
And in the woods,
in the jungle,

678
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:14,925
everything's green.

679
00:46:14,927 --> 00:46:16,627
So, in order to not
get eaten by panthers

680
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:18,962
and bears and the like,
we had to be able to see them,

681
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:21,231
you know, in the grass
and trees and such.

682
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:26,569
Predators.

683
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:33,142
So what do we do now?

684
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:38,114
Lester.

685
00:46:59,135 --> 00:47:01,070
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

686
00:47:01,072 --> 00:47:03,205
Can I get, uh, like,
a phone call?

687
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:06,175
<i>And a...
Oh, a chicken pot pie?</i>

688
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:10,279
Sleep it off, rummies.
