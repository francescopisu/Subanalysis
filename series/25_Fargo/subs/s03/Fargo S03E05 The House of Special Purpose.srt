1
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,608
<i>Back a few months ago,</i>

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,211
<i>I was headlinin'
a great big nightclub,</i>

3
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,014
<i>and they put me up
a couple days early.</i>

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,816
<i>I came in a couple days early,</i>

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,852
<i>and they put me up in what
they call the "Star Suite."</i>

6
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,988
<i>Now here I am,</i>

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,157
<i>headlinin' in one
of the biggest nightclubs</i>

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,392
<i>in the country,</i>

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,660
<i>and I wake up
at 8:00 in the morning</i>

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,027
<i>in this "Star Suite"</i>

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,830
<i>all by myself.</i>

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,332
<i>Aw!</i>

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,201
<i>Yeah,
that's what I said, "Aw."</i>

14
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,036
<i>But I did
what I've always done, man,</i>

15
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,171
<i>to cheer myself up,</i>

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,573
<i>I picked up my guitar,</i>

17
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,908
<i>I sat down,
and I wrote me a little song.</i>

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>Now this is how it feels</i>

19
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,246
<i>to be alone
at the top of the hill,</i>

20
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,881
<i>tryin' to figure out why.</i>

21

00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,473
<i>Oh, yeah!

50
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:03,477
<i>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

51
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,613
<i>Oh, Emmit! Oh, yeah!</i>

52
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:08,549
<i>Don't stop! Oh, Emmit!</i>

53
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:17,658
On the sofa, I thought,

54
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:20,461
unless you're attached to
a more classic bed narrative.

55
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,663
Non-descript, though,
you know, the furnishings,

56
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:23,965
so they can't tie it to us.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,467
That's...
I think you solved it.

58
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:29,804
We can keep you in a shirt,
hiding your difference.

59
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,806
Maybe in a cowgirl,
or a doggy scenario,

60
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,706
favoring our rears,
in other words,

61
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,508
keeping our faces
slightly absurd.

62
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:37,877
"Obscured."

63
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,279
What did I say?

64
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:42,182
I'm glad we're
doing this, babe.

65
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:43,683
Taking control.

66
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:46,053
This whole time,
we've been playing to draw.

67
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,520
It's time
we start playing to win.

68
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,090
I know, but blackmail...

69
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,892
We lost the high roller, babe.
Zip. Gone.

70
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,028
I know, and I'm so sorry.

71
00:03:55,064 --> 00:03:57,197
It's not your fault.

72
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:58,898
A day like you had,

73
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,567
I would have stopped
for a sidecar, too.

74
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,969
I just lost track...

75
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,536
I know.

76
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,973
This thing with your brother
has got us both upset.

77
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,843
To deprive
a man of his career,

78
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,243
endanger his female...

79
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,012
I panicked.

80
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,681
You're too hard on yourself.

81
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:17,049
You rallied,
didn't you, in the end?

82
00:04:18,286 --> 00:04:20,353
You're here. We're together.

83
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:23,189
Maybe I can call the guy,
the high roller,

84
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:24,557
- and say...
- What? Really?

85
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:26,058
'Cause you lost your job
at the parole board

86
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:27,861
on account of
banging your clients?

87
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:30,897
No, because I fell in love.

88
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:40,473
That's sweet. You're sweet.

89
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:55,821
Hon.

90
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:58,991
Where did you go?

91
00:05:03,064 --> 00:05:04,263
I...

92
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,400
Jesus!

93
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:09,001
I just love you so much.

94
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,503
No. For Pete's sake,
I'm wearing a hooker wig!

95
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,338
- Just hold on.
- Sorry.

96
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:16,374
No, just...
That's got to be bad luck.

97
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:21,079
Okay. Now, go.

98
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:25,283
Babe, you're my everything.

99
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:26,552
I want we should spend

100
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,953
the rest of
our lives together.

101
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,591
You gotta ask.

102
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:33,625
Oh. Right.

103
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:38,664
Nikki Swango,
will you marry me?

104
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:44,269
Yes, Raymond Stussy,
I will marry you.

105
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:55,880
Come here.

106
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,121
You've made me
the happiest woman ever.

107
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,932
Now, let's make a sex tape.

108
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,449
Hey, hon.

109
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,652
<i>You...</i>

110
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,320
Stella?

111
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,989
What is it, honey?

112
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,824
<i>I'll...</i>

113
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:49,199
No! Now, hold on!

114
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,367
Don't make a scene, Daddy.

115
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,701
Yeah, Mr. Stussy.

116
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,970
I saw the tape.
It's disgusting.

117
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,339
I didn't...

118
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,577
Baby! Baby, I didn't...

119
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:03,147
I wouldn't! Swear to Christ!

120
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:05,782
Stella...

121
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:06,950
Ma says to tell you,
"Don't call."

122
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,985
Stella!

123
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,377
<i>Nail me, Emmit, harder.
Yeah!</i>

124
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,222
<i>Oh! Emmit, Emmit,
nail me, Emmit!</i>

125
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,635
What the goddamn hell?

126
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:33,310
You have a fat wife.

127
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,281
Excuse me?

128
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,484
Which part of what I just said
is giving you trouble?

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,186
This is my office.

130
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,659
A fat woman is
inherently untrustworthy

131
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:54,230
as she is a sensualist
who sees no real difference

132
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:59,168
between a pastrami sandwich
and a dick in the mouth.

133
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:03,673
There's no call for
that kind of language.

134
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,942
No.

135
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:08,777
A female Jew is
especially vulnerable

136
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:13,149
to the zaftig seduction
of the forbidden,

137
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,017
being part animal.

138
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,756
What are you doing?

139
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,398
Do you know what a chicken is?

140
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,335
- What?
- A chicken.

141
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,005
Do you know what a chicken is?

142
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,377
A chicken is an egg's way
of making another egg.

143
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:54,155
You see, it's all
a matter of perspective.

144
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,726
The chicken sees it one way,
the egg another,

145
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:59,127
so let's start again.

146
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:00,596
This is not your office,

147
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:03,064
just as your wife
would not be your wife

148
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,802
if I came to her in the night
with a platter of cold cuts.

149
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:12,574
Sit down, my friend.
You have shock.

150
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,909
All is well.

151
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:16,411
I'm just... I'm not...
I need a minute.

152
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,112
No problem, no problem.

153
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:22,182
Have a drink,
you'll feel better.

154
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,986
No. Are you out of your mind?

155
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,327
Nice drink, refreshing.

156
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,498
Are you threatening me?

157
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:49,343
No, no, no, the whole thing.

158
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:19,906
Yuri tells me you
spoke to the police yesterday.

159
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:31,017
You can ask her,
she came to me.

160
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:33,386
Not about anything,
but there was a...

161
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,521
One of our cars was...

162
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:37,523
Some kind of accident.
A fender bender.

163
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:42,061
So, you know, unconnected
to this completely.

164
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:49,202
You may have,
during the course of the day,

165
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:52,205
a strong impulse to act.

166
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,940
It's perfectly normal,
a man of your station

167
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,710
being forced to play
the cuckold.

168
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,479
But remember, it's all
a matter of perspective.

169
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:05,017
What's happening here is good.
You and I are partners now.

170
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:08,721
Contracts have been signed
by the majordomo himself.

171
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:14,727
So, you see, lives
are changing for the better.

172
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:20,566
And all you have to do
is review the accounts,

173
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,869
write up the deals,

174
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,905
and approve the paperwork.

175
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:31,577
Do you understand?

176
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,619
Yuri will show you
to your new office.

177
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:47,792
Don't forget your mug.

178
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,092
<i>Emmit?</i>

179
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:24,428
It's worse than we thought.

180
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:27,699
<i>What we talked about.
The thing... Are you...</i>

181
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:30,267
<i>Did they hurt you?</i>

182
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:32,937
To get you to sign,
I'm saying. Did they...

183
00:13:34,474 --> 00:13:35,640
You...

184
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,809
Emmit?

185
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:40,111
Emmit?

186
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:31,827
Mrs. Goldfarb.

187
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,563
You must be Sy.

188
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:37,733
I am so glad
we finally get to meet.

189
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,070
I've been pinching Buck's ear
every time I see him.

190
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:46,075
Yes, yes, he told me.
And I must admit, I'm curious.

191
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,882
Are you all right?

192
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:59,055
Uh... Of course, I just...

193
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,025
I had an upsetting experience
this morning.

194
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,662
To be honest,

195
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,231
I feel as if I've left
the known world.

196
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,002
You ever had that feeling?

197
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,738
Like you, uh,
stepped off the map

198
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:20,242
into the,
well, unknown, I guess?

199
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,447
That's how I felt
when my Torvald died.

200
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,217
My husband made his first
million in mortuaries.

201
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,754
"Everybody dies, Ruby,"
he told me,

202
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,723
"You can't just
leave them on the sofa."

203
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,059
One night, he was eating
a three-pound lobster

204
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:41,462
and he had a stroke,
and with it, a revelation.

205
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:44,398
Self-storage,
that was the future.

206
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,068
The two businesses
are surprisingly similar

207
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:48,603
when you think about it,

208
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:51,505
a place to put the things
you'll never use again.

209
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:54,743
He died last year.

210
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:57,946
Complications from polio.

211
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:01,649
For six months, I wore black
and tore my sleeves.

212
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:05,386
And then,
I had a revelation of my own.

213
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,455
Parking lots.

214
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,224
The final piece to
the storage triptych.

215
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,094
People are always going
to need a place to park.

216
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,263
Amen.

217
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,934
I'll be honest with you,
Mr. Feltz.

218
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,739
At my age, I'm not
looking for a partner.

219
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:28,075
My preference
would be to acquire

220
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,279
the entire company,
Stussy Lots Ltd.,

221
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:34,282
and I would be happy
to let you keep

222
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:37,851
the name intact
if that worries you.

223
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,154
A second choice would be

224
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:44,357
to buy several
lots independently

225
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:47,460
and build
the business that way,

226
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:50,363
but let's be honest.

227
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,668
That would make me
your competitor,

228
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:01,308
and, as my late
husband always used to say,

229
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:07,013
"You don't want
a Goldfarb for an enemy."

230
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,981
- I'm sure that's true.
- Mmm.

231
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:14,654
It's interesting that you
should come to us now.

232
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,122
Problems?

233
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:18,123
No, not problems.

234
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:21,960
More of a softening
of the will.

235
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:25,197
You see, Emmit Stussy,
whom you'll meet,

236
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,333
is a great man,

237
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,968
a philanthropist, a leader,

238
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:31,470
and, of late,

239
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,138
he's been talking
with increased regularity

240
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:35,140
about dedicating
himself in total

241
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:36,542
to his good works,

242
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:40,679
i.e.,
the betterment of mankind.

243
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,348
Now, I suggested
he take a step back

244
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:44,015
and allow me to
run the day-to-day,

245
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:46,552
but he seems adamant
that we stick together.

246
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,554
Pre-schools in Mumbai,

247
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:51,423
health clinics
in Inner Mongolia,

248
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:54,259
better access to
veterinary care.

249
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,560
And after all,

250
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:57,095
how much money
does one man need?

251
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,932
A lot, actually.
Women, more so.

252
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:04,903
And you'd be okay with that,

253
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:07,839
selling a business that you
worked so hard to build?

254
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:12,810
I'm sorry. There's...

255
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,252
I forgot a very important...

256
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,888
We're closing on
a new line of credit,

257
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:25,590
and my girl got
my calendar confused.

258
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,959
You go ahead.
Play hard to get.

259
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:31,462
No, no, no, that's not...

260
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:36,434
Easy to get. Really.
I mean, at the right price.

261
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:41,071
But we should talk more.
Call my private line.

262
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:44,675
The office isn't safe.
I mean, the lines are down.

263
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,155
Hello?

264
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:55,324
Emmit!

265
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,499
Emmit!

266
00:20:09,906 --> 00:20:11,039
Hello?

267
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,378
Emmit?

268
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,415
She left.

269
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:25,920
Did you sign
partnership papers?

270
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:30,425
Did you make Varga
a partner in our firm?

271
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:33,362
I didn't think it was possible.

272
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:36,265
The evil of this man.

273
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,732
My brother.

274
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,769
My brother.

275
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,870
He's in my office.

276
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:46,974
He put his<i> Schwanz</i>
in the mug Esther gave me.

277
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:51,546
I had to throw it away.

278
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,782
You said you
were gonna fix this.

279
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,984
You swore he'd go away.

280
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,420
Oh, enough about
your stupid brother!

281
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:02,590
We're in trouble here!
This is a...

282
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,694
Enemies are at the gates!
Inside the gates!

283
00:21:06,729 --> 00:21:08,929
Fornicating with our cookware!

284
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:11,566
What is the point of you?

285
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:14,202
What?

286
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:15,736
The point.

287
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:17,237
What is the point of you?

288
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:21,408
You're supposed to be a fixer.

289
00:21:21,443 --> 00:21:25,312
Nothing's fixed.
Everything's broken.

290
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,019
They sent my wife a sex tape.

291
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,459
Why would your wife wanna
watch your brother have sex?

292
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:41,661
Not him, dummy, me!

293
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:45,132
Ray, in a wig,
pretending to...

294
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,335
He shaved his mustache!

295
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,637
He and that... whore.

296
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,606
And you were supposed
to stop them!

297
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:56,109
Don't come here moaning about,
"We're in trouble."

298
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:58,278
Who was the one
who found Ermentraub,

299
00:21:58,313 --> 00:22:00,280
the go-between
which led to Varga?

300
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:02,616
Where was the diligence,
the due diligence?

301
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:03,950
You said...

302
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:05,452
I wanted to go deeper,
but you said...

303
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:07,954
"Enemies at the gates,"
who let them in?

304
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:13,993
I never.
You need to unchain me.

305
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,596
If I was free, my hands,
I could...

306
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:19,098
Your brother
wouldn't bother us again.

307
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,268
It's the Delilah.

308
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:26,305
This floozy is pushing him,
putting ideas in his head.

309
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,607
And now, they think,

310
00:22:28,643 --> 00:22:30,810
my family,
that I'm some kind of...

311
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:36,015
When all I ever did was...
And there's...

312
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,818
Look at me,
there's good inside,

313
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,319
a good person.

314
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:43,389
Of course there is.

315
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:46,826
Think of the children,
the lives you help.

316
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:50,229
I'm not some kind of weakling
that can't control his...

317
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,832
Twenty-five years,
and never once

318
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:55,401
did I look at
a woman sideways.

319
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,336
Sit-down meetings
with the doors open,

320
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:58,871
professional always.

321
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:03,609
You're a model, a role model.
I look up to you.

322
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:04,976
Everyone I know.

323
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,918
You've gotta fix this.

324
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:17,255
Whatever it takes.

325
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:22,561
Shackles off?

326
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,366
And throw away the key.

327
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:51,956
I met
with the widow Goldfarb...

328
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:53,224
Not...

329
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,258
Okay.

330
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:55,760
I can't...

331
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:09,073
So, nope, say it again?

332
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:10,408
I'm saying Maurice,

333
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:11,742
the fellow with
his head caved in,

334
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,377
it wasn't a random robbery.

335
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,512
He was hired by another fellow
to rob somebody.

336
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:16,680
His brother.

337
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,281
Maurice's brother?

338
00:24:18,316 --> 00:24:20,917
No, the brother of the fella
that hired Maurice,

339
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:21,951
both named Stussy.

340
00:24:24,656 --> 00:24:26,390
- Like your stepdad.
- Exactly.

341
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,591
Probably gave
Maurice an address

342
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:28,725
for the brother,
except he lost it.

343
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,260
Or forgot it, at which point,

344
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:31,595
Maurice makes
the wrong choice.

345
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,896
Drives to the wrong town,

346
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,230
takes a name out
of the phone book.

347
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:35,565
Also Stussy.

348
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,933
And you know
what happens next.

349
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:43,072
New chief's not
gonna like this.

350
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,074
He doesn't have to like it,

351
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,476
it's factual, we think.

352
00:24:47,512 --> 00:24:49,445
Makes more sense
than the other at least.

353
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,179
He's still not gonna like it.

354
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:54,617
Well, you don't
have to like the truth

355
00:24:54,652 --> 00:24:55,851
for it to be true.

356
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,286
You sure?

357
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,687
We're gonna visit
the parole office today

358
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:00,188
either way,
face the hiring brother.

359
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:01,990
And see if you can't
track down this Vanessa

360
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:03,793
who rented the apartment
that lost an air-conditioner.

361
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,661
I'm thinking they
might be connected.

362
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,102
What do you think?

363
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,905
Bigger size.

364
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,406
Don't you think it'd
be more comfortable?

365
00:25:17,442 --> 00:25:18,974
Yeah?

366
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:20,409
We have something in a 44.

367
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:21,476
We'll try that.

368
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:27,015
You're sweating.

369
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,817
It's just...

370
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:32,354
It's a lot of money,
100 grand.

371
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:35,157
Are you sure? I mean,
we could ask for less...

372
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:37,459
Are we worth less?

373
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,694
You and me,

374
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:42,864
our value, I'm saying,
to the world?

375
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:46,068
What makes him rich,
and us not?

376
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:48,503
Larceny.

377
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:51,506
Your brother stole from you,
your birthright,

378
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,707
like the snake in the garden,

379
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:55,677
and then
he built this falsehood.

380
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,846
Self-made man, my ass.

381
00:25:57,881 --> 00:26:00,414
That business
is your business,

382
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,551
that mansion is your mansion
on account of the stamps.

383
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:06,688
What he used to
build this empire.

384
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,659
What's fair here
is complete surrender.

385
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,862
We're compromising
by asking for 100 grand.

386
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:15,429
He is getting off easy.

387
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,733
Here you go.

388
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,101
Oh, yeah.

389
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:38,118
You got me.

390
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:39,753
<i>Congratulations,</i>

391
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:42,088
<i>you're officially
the stupidest person alive.</i>

392
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:44,791
Who is this?

393
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:47,895
It's Menachem Begin.
Who do you think it is?

394
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,462
You made a sex tape

395
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:51,264
and gave it
straight to the wife.

396
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,600
No...

397
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,768
<i>You left it on the stoop.</i>

398
00:26:56,672 --> 00:26:58,271
<i>Three people
live in that house.</i>

399
00:26:58,306 --> 00:26:59,806
<i>What did you think
was gonna happen?</i>

400
00:26:59,842 --> 00:27:01,074
Tears, were there?

401
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,108
<i>She left,</i>

402
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:03,911
and took the mother-in-law.

403
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:06,379
So, whatever leverage
you think you have...

404
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:07,748
He's gonna pay.

405
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:10,417
<i>For what? She left.</i>

406
00:27:10,452 --> 00:27:11,918
The way we figure it,

407
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:13,753
that's money owed
for startup fees.

408
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:16,556
<i>Collateral Ray
put down as a youth.</i>

409
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:18,091
He's part owner
in the enterprise,

410
00:27:18,126 --> 00:27:19,559
in other words.

411
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:23,729
We're not gonna stop
till we get what's ours.

412
00:27:23,765 --> 00:27:27,333
We should meet, you and me,
hammer out an end to this.

413
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:31,571
The end is, you pay.

414
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:33,106
<i>She watched the tape.</i>

415
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,442
Asshole.

416
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:37,743
Asshole.

417
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:39,946
She watched the tape.

418
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,617
So, she believes, right now,

419
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:47,687
her husband slipping dick
to a redhead is a true story?

420
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:49,956
Factual?

421
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:52,625
We were asking 100 grand
to keep her from knowing,

422
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,360
now I'm saying 200 grand
to tell her the other truth.

423
00:27:55,396 --> 00:27:57,463
<i>There is no other truth.</i>

424
00:27:57,498 --> 00:27:59,465
You sure about that?

425
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,967
We got video evidence

426
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:02,635
Emmit's screwing
his secretary.

427
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,769
It's a fact.

428
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:06,572
It never happened!

429
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:09,942
That doesn't make it
any less of a fact.

430
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:12,645
And I'm saying
the price to convince her

431
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,180
of the other truth
is 200 grand.

432
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:21,319
<i>Stussy Lot 350, one hour.</i>

433
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,128
Baby, look at you.

434
00:28:30,163 --> 00:28:32,631
Is it all right?

435
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:33,832
It's amazing.

436
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:52,382
I gotta do a girl thing.
I'll see you at home later?

437
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:56,020
You want me to come?
It's not like I gotta work.

438
00:28:56,055 --> 00:28:57,220
You're sweet.

439
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,035
What do you want?

440
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,871
<i>You're dead, do you hear me?</i>

441
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,206
Oh, I'm dead? That's...

442
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:38,541
You got some nerve after...

443
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:40,376
<i>She saw it!</i>

444
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,211
Stella, the tape.

445
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:43,813
<i>Big whoop, I'm out of a job.</i>

446
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:46,482
She left me.

447
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,588
Oh, well, you know,
reap what you sow.

448
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,756
You should've
done what's right

449
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,124
when you had the chance.

450
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,960
Buddy, when I'm done with you,

451
00:29:57,995 --> 00:29:59,995
they'll be sponging you
off the floor.

452
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,797
Yeah?
You'll be in the poor house

453
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:03,532
making soup out
of your dirty socks.

454
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:05,634
Fuck you.

455
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:07,335
Me?

456
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,472
Is that... Is that what
you're saying? Fuck me?

457
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,978
<i>You wanna fuck me?</i>

458
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:18,980
I'll tattoo it on my fist
and come over there!

459
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,281
Stuffed and mounted
like a goddamn...

460
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:21,783
Yeah, fuck you!

461
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,518
<i>So, if you know
what's good for you,</i>

462
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:26,822
pay the damn money
and pray that I'm satisfied!

463
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,491
Hello?

464
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:30,859
God damn it!

465
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:37,364
My mom.

466
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,329
Mr. Stussy!

467
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,166
Chief Burgle,
we met yesterday.

468
00:31:13,202 --> 00:31:16,403
Uh, you know Officer Lopez.

469
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:17,704
What's, uh...

470
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:19,373
We just had
a few more questions.

471
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:21,341
I thought you said
you weren't together?

472
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,842
We had an intersection
of interest.

473
00:31:22,878 --> 00:31:24,211
Shouldn't take long.

474
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,849
You wanna come inside, or...

475
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:32,019
Oh. Better you come
to the station with us.

476
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:33,053
Cleaner.

477
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:38,791
Okay.

478
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:40,293
I gotta be back by 6:00.

479
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,229
There's...
I got an appointment.

480
00:31:42,264 --> 00:31:44,764
Oh, sure, we'll have you back.

481
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,973
Look, I understand
you got threads to pull.

482
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,409
I'm on the job, too,
in probationary guise,

483
00:31:56,444 --> 00:32:00,647
but, still, we're both
officers of the court.

484
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:01,981
Got yourself fired yesterday

485
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:03,349
is how I heard it.

486
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,685
Just now at your office.

487
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,887
That's...

488
00:32:07,923 --> 00:32:10,122
Okay,
I'm taking a little time.

489
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:13,059
Continuing my education,
exploring a few...

490
00:32:13,094 --> 00:32:14,594
'Cause it hit me one day.

491
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,429
You know,
what if I could do more good

492
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:17,797
in, like, a lawyer capacity?

493
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:20,266
You're going to law school?

494
00:32:20,301 --> 00:32:23,301
Not, you know,
officially, but...

495
00:32:23,336 --> 00:32:26,738
Met with Mr. Feltz?

496
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:28,473
Sy Feltz?

497
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:29,808
He runs your brother's...

498
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,910
Oh, yeah, that's...

499
00:32:31,946 --> 00:32:34,245
Like I said, there's
no hard feelings there.

500
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,282
Just a minor traffic skirmish.

501
00:32:37,317 --> 00:32:38,917
You're saying
Mr. Feltz was the driver

502
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:41,787
of the offending vehicle?

503
00:32:41,822 --> 00:32:45,557
No. Why? What did he say?

504
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:51,129
Look, it's a family matter
is my philosophy.

505
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:55,701
Whatever past disagreements,
bygones. You know?

506
00:32:55,736 --> 00:32:58,203
Think of Jesus, His actions.

507
00:32:58,238 --> 00:33:01,472
So, there's bad blood
between you and Mr. Feltz?

508
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:03,474
- No, I wouldn't say...
- What about between you and...

509
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:05,409
- What's the brother's name?
- Emmit.

510
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,078
Right, Emmit.

511
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:10,280
Emmit Stussy,
who lives in Eden Prairie?

512
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:12,583
Did Sy... Has he been
making accusations?

513
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:15,319
'Cause I got... Literally,
my conscience is clear.

514
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:17,321
- Your conscience?
- Right.

515
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:18,656
I'm saying if
we're being honest here

516
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:21,025
and not to cast aspersions,

517
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,994
but I've seen a lot
of snakes in my day,

518
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:24,328
and that man is a scorpion.

519
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,696
So, whatever he told you,

520
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,032
I'd take that with
a huge sack of salt.

521
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,704
Maybe if you tell us how
your car came to be damaged.

522
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,572
Like I said,
it was an accident.

523
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:39,342
He backed into
your Corvette two times.

524
00:33:39,377 --> 00:33:40,744
Mr. Feltz.

525
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:45,214
He's...

526
00:33:48,453 --> 00:33:51,554
There's jealousy there,
how close we are.

527
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:53,890
Me and Emmit, our bond.

528
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:56,225
So, you're saying
there's no beef with Emmit?

529
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,894
There's no bad blood?

530
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:02,098
No. Emmit, we're...
I was best man at his wedding.

531
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:06,502
And his daughter's wedding,
they had it in, uh, Mexico.

532
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:08,905
The invitation
said "no shoes."

533
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,240
Can you imagine
a wedding with no shoes?

534
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,113
Tell me more about your man,
Maurice LeFay.

535
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:22,051
Well, he's not my...

536
00:34:22,086 --> 00:34:25,454
Just a number on a file, uh,
one of the faceless masses.

537
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:30,226
Blew his piss test,
like I said.

538
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:31,727
Uh,
I would have rounded him up,

539
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:34,230
except air-conditioner.

540
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:36,965
And, um, just so I'm clear,
when's the last time you...

541
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:44,407
One sec.

542
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:46,441
- We said 6:00, yeah?
- Yeah.

543
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:50,579
- No.
- Sheriff, before you...

544
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:52,314
I talked to Donny, let it go.
He told me what you're up to.

545
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:55,517
We're not up to anything,
there's a suspect in the box.

546
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:56,819
A suspect of what?

547
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:58,486
Winnie Lopez, St. Cloud Metro.

548
00:34:58,522 --> 00:34:59,955
We got
a conflagration of names here.

549
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,489
Your victim,
Ennis Stussy, Eden Valley,

550
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:02,991
was murdered by
the parolee of Ray Stussy,

551
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:04,559
currently in the box,

552
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:06,461
whose brother, Emmit Stussy,
lives in Eden Prairie.

553
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:07,896
- And?
- And,

554
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:09,431
there's bad blood
between the brothers,

555
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:11,299
a run-in,
one vehicle against another.

556
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:12,935
So, we're thinking
things escalated.

557
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,236
Ray hires the ex-con to...

558
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:15,437
Listen to me.

559
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:21,809
There's a girl in England.

560
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,413
Nine years old.

561
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:29,283
Laura Buxton,
she's got a red balloon.

562
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:32,720
She ties a note to it.

563
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:35,489
"If found,

564
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:37,458
please return
to Laura Buxton,"

565
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:38,492
and her address.

566
00:35:39,996 --> 00:35:41,395
She lets it go.

567
00:35:42,732 --> 00:35:46,500
Damn thing flies
30, 40, 50 miles,

568
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,970
comes down in a field.

569
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,972
The words found
by another little girl,

570
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,673
also nine,

571
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:57,343
also named,
wait for it, Laura Buxton.

572
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:00,680
That's...

573
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:03,183
A true story.

574
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:05,618
These things
happen all the time.

575
00:36:05,654 --> 00:36:07,654
Coincidence, random life.

576
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:16,462
Okay. Here's another story.

577
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:18,799
Once upon a time,
a guy named Stussy

578
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,466
hired an idiot
to rob his brother,

579
00:36:20,502 --> 00:36:22,468
and the idiot
drove to the wrong town

580
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:24,537
and killed the wrong Stussy.

581
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:27,674
I hate that story.
You know why?

582
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:32,311
You can't prove it.

583
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:36,215
Now, pack him up
and get him out of here.

584
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,549
We got work to do.

585
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,208
How's your wife?

586
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,679
My wife?

587
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,113
Please thank her for
dinner the other night.

588
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:09,116
Those pork chops
were delightful.

589
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,350
I, uh...

590
00:38:12,021 --> 00:38:13,721
Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.

591
00:38:29,538 --> 00:38:34,041
I'm not sure
we can trust the Jew.

592
00:38:35,377 --> 00:38:37,678
- Who?
- Feltz.

593
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:40,247
There's been some
sneaking around.

594
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:41,381
Do you trust him?

595
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,716
Sy?

596
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:45,351
Some people think
he's colluding

597
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:47,020
with your brother.

598
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:48,254
What? Who?

599
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,756
People talk,
that's all I'm saying.

600
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,457
People you don't
want to be talking.

601
00:38:51,492 --> 00:38:53,392
I heard he broke
into your bank.

602
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:54,961
Sy?

603
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:56,462
Raymond.

604
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:03,169
Access to a safety
deposit box, et cetera,

605
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:04,904
and, now,
he would've needed a key,

606
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,873
and where he
might've gotten one?

607
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:08,842
An insider.

608
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,343
No, that's...

609
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:12,511
Buck drilled the lock
is what Sy said.

610
00:39:12,547 --> 00:39:15,348
Is what Sy says.

611
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:17,183
Or either, it's possible

612
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:21,220
that your consigliere
making a move

613
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:26,225
and he's using your brother
as a diversion, or worse,

614
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,927
a straw man after all.

615
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:36,068
The name on
the marquee is "Stussy Lots,"

616
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:39,437
but nowhere does it
specify which Stussy.

617
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:48,280
That's... He's...
I talked to Sy.

618
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:52,584
He's onboard,
all in with this, with us.

619
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,919
Trust me.

620
00:39:54,954 --> 00:39:59,623
And he hates,
trust me, hates Ray.

621
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:02,026
Wishes I'd cut him out
a long time ago.

622
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,167
Look.

623
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:13,504
We are making a souffle here.
Do you understand?

624
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,974
Lines of credit,

625
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:21,078
capital acquisition,
increased valuation.

626
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:26,317
It's how you turn
a small business

627
00:40:26,352 --> 00:40:28,152
into a big business.

628
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:32,856
And it is fluffy,
and it is delicious.

629
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:36,026
But you can't agitate

630
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,895
while it rises, otherwise...
Poof.

631
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,905
It's... He...

632
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:52,409
He knows it's not Sy,
that this isn't...

633
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:56,913
He just wants to protect me.

634
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,952
From success?

635
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:06,556
I'll talk to him.

636
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,761
That's all I ask.

637
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,895
Any calls?

638
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,296
I left the slips on your desk.

639
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:42,398
Also, there's a man
waiting to see you.

640
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,402
Mr. Stussy.

641
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,637
I'm Agent Dollard
from the IRS.

642
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:50,573
That's...

643
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,807
What is this about?

644
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,776
Just a routine visit, or...

645
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,913
Well, maybe we could
go to your office?

646
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,016
Great.
It's, uh, right back here.

647
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,095
- Do you mind if I...
- Please.

648
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:46,027
So, you said that this was
just a routine drop in, or...

649
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:47,995
Yes. And, no.

650
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:49,463
Routine, in that

651
00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:50,798
we make these kind of calls
all the time,

652
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:54,135
so routine for me.

653
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,637
You made a withdrawal
in the amount

654
00:42:56,672 --> 00:42:59,140
of $10,000 cash
earlier this week.

655
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:00,641
- Motherfucker.
- Excuse me?

656
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:02,343
- What?
- You said?

657
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:04,111
Since when was it
a crime for a citizen,

658
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:07,247
a tax paying citizen to use
their own money?

659
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:09,916
No, sir, it's not a crime.
Not exactly.

660
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:11,818
But, uh, any transaction,

661
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:16,957
deposit or withdrawal
greater than $9,999.99,

662
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:18,358
it triggers an alarm with us.

663
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:19,792
An alarm?

664
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:21,962
Not an actual alarm

665
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:24,030
like at a fire station,
that would be funny.

666
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,832
Spinning light,
maybe get a pole.

667
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:28,668
No, it's more of an alert,
a computer alert.

668
00:43:28,703 --> 00:43:32,505
So, I've been dispatched by HQ
to ask a few questions.

669
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,974
They're simple questions.

670
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:35,375
Maybe take a look
at your books.

671
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:37,677
My books?

672
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,180
Think of it like...

673
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:43,082
You been to the airport?

674
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:47,819
Recently?

675
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:50,555
In life, I'm saying
you've been to an airport?

676
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:51,723
Yes.

677
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:53,058
Well, sometimes
at the airport,

678
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:54,726
when you go
through the detector,

679
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:58,364
the metal detector,
or the radiographic scan,

680
00:43:58,399 --> 00:43:59,898
you get selected
for additional screening,

681
00:43:59,933 --> 00:44:01,433
a pat down.

682
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,835
Maybe they swab your hands
for explosives residue.

683
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:05,637
- What?
- Residue.

684
00:44:05,672 --> 00:44:07,139
To make sure you haven't been,
you know, building a bomb.

685
00:44:07,174 --> 00:44:08,640
What are we
talking about here?

686
00:44:08,675 --> 00:44:10,476
Nobody's been building any...

687
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:13,312
No, of course not.
That's what I'm saying.

688
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:15,314
But because
of your withdrawal,

689
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:17,048
which I am required
by law to question,

690
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,484
you've been selected
for additional review.

691
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,820
Screening, minimally invasive,
day surgery,

692
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:25,923
versus, say,
having your colon removed.

693
00:44:27,227 --> 00:44:28,259
Little IRS humor.

694
00:44:28,294 --> 00:44:29,394
Isn't this... Uh...

695
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:33,197
Don't you need
a warrant for this?

696
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:35,033
Oh, no, sir, that's the FBI.

697
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:36,901
Uh, this is more
of an informal

698
00:44:36,936 --> 00:44:38,702
kick-the-tires and all that,

699
00:44:38,738 --> 00:44:40,204
so that we can
avert an actual audit.

700
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,872
An audit?

701
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:43,707
Are you crazy?

702
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:44,742
Sir?

703
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:46,877
It's... We...

704
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:48,546
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

705
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:53,216
Our records are pristine,
our books.

706
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:55,218
You could eat off them

707
00:44:55,254 --> 00:44:57,254
if that was your...

708
00:44:59,025 --> 00:45:01,425
And that other gentleman
in the next office,

709
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,860
that would be Mr., uh...

710
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:09,466
Feltz?

711
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,436
It might be.

712
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:14,271
Sir?

713
00:45:16,943 --> 00:45:21,445
No. Uh, Mr. Feltz
is off today.

714
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,746
Family matter.

715
00:45:23,782 --> 00:45:25,147
Oh, I see.

716
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:27,416
Well, I would need
to talk to him as well,

717
00:45:27,452 --> 00:45:30,286
and any other senior members
of your staff.

718
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:32,655
How many partners do you have?

719
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:35,357
Just how much time...

720
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:39,128
Like I said,
this is just a baby step.

721
00:45:39,163 --> 00:45:41,163
I'll park myself in an office,

722
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:43,532
you know, do a few interviews,

723
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:45,001
maybe look over your books.

724
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:46,135
An office?

725
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,536
Exactly.

726
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:49,706
Or a conference room,
if that's easier.

727
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:51,307
Heck, I spent three months

728
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:53,142
in the mailroom
of a novelty store once

729
00:45:53,177 --> 00:45:54,978
surrounded by plastic poop
and rubber vomit,

730
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:57,080
so it doesn't have
to be the Riviera.

731
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:02,218
Okay. Not a problem.

732
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:05,954
I know just where to put you.

733
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,623
Oh, good.

734
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:29,145
Well, I appreciate it.
Shall we say 8:00 AM?

735
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,712
How about 7:30?

736
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:32,981
Perfect. I'll see you then.

737
00:46:33,017 --> 00:46:34,349
You betcha.

738
00:46:57,407 --> 00:46:58,540
Is he married?

739
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:00,042
What?

740
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:03,444
Was he wearing a ring?
Did he mention kids?

741
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,980
That can be used.

742
00:47:05,015 --> 00:47:07,815
I have no idea what you're
saying to me right now.

743
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,350
We can't...

744
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,520
The jig is up.

745
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:13,854
This isn't...

746
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,357
He's gonna park
himself in an office.

747
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:18,526
An office!

748
00:47:18,562 --> 00:47:22,029
Days, weeks, asking questions,
reviewing the books.

749
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:23,698
He asked to see the books?

750
00:47:23,733 --> 00:47:25,700
Yes.

751
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:29,870
That's all right.
We'll show him the fake ones.

752
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:32,907
That's... Wait.

753
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:35,243
We have fake books?

754
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,695
Let's go deeper.
Away from the road.

755
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:18,618
Forty grand.

756
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:24,290
That, plus the 10
you stole, puts it 50.

757
00:49:24,326 --> 00:49:26,927
My thought, then,
is you should leave the state.

758
00:49:28,797 --> 00:49:33,099
Two hundred.
And we want the stamp.

759
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,934
For what?

760
00:49:34,969 --> 00:49:36,802
It's the principle.

761
00:49:42,343 --> 00:49:44,276
What's this?

762
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:47,113
Nothing. Something else.

763
00:49:47,148 --> 00:49:49,348
It's okay, I got it.

764
00:49:49,383 --> 00:49:51,316
Sy, Sy...

765
00:49:52,553 --> 00:49:55,454
What's the matter, buddy?

766
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:00,192
You drank from the holy cup,
but here you are.

767
00:50:00,228 --> 00:50:01,560
Not being a good boy.

768
00:50:01,595 --> 00:50:02,995
This isn't that.

769
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,596
I'm sorry. Who are you?

770
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:09,401
What?

771
00:50:09,436 --> 00:50:12,537
He said pretty girls
should only open their mouths

772
00:50:12,573 --> 00:50:15,340
- when they see a dick.
- Oh.

773
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:18,677
And, just so I'm clear,
which one of you is the dick?

774
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:20,845
Enough. I'm handling this.

775
00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:21,880
Okay.

776
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,519
Have you been to Siberia?

777
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:29,888
Have I been to Siberia,
is that the question?

778
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:34,626
It's very much like this.

779
00:50:41,935 --> 00:50:45,269
Except the dirt.

780
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:49,607
The earth soaking
in blood, frozen red.

781
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:53,243
All of Russia.

782
00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:58,081
Hundreds of years,
millions the tsar killed,

783
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:02,119
then it was Lenin,
then Stalin.

784
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:05,556
Ten thousand, 20,000.

785
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:13,497
But here you have, like, what?

786
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,133
Malls.

787
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,070
Few dead Indians.

788
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:23,907
Twenty million Russian died
fighting Hitler, 20 million.

789
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:25,242
I see from your face

790
00:51:25,277 --> 00:51:26,743
that you can't
even imagine that.

791
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:30,180
The pogroms, the starvation,
20 million more.

792
00:51:32,017 --> 00:51:36,753
Mothers cooking
and eating their babies.

793
00:51:36,788 --> 00:51:38,788
That's why
the snow falls white.

794
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,391
To hide the blood.

795
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,566
I'm leaving.

796
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:52,702
Ahh! No!

797
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:56,005
You don't have to...

798
00:51:57,342 --> 00:52:00,509
This is what comes
after the cup.

799
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:36,054
Babe, I'm...

800
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:38,656
Phew.

801
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:40,892
Had a little scare
for a minute.

802
00:55:40,927 --> 00:55:43,494
The police, which...

803
00:55:43,529 --> 00:55:46,530
I don't have to tell you,
got my heart going real good.

804
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:52,870
But all fine now.

805
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,241
Babe?

806
00:56:05,818 --> 00:56:07,318
Babe?

807
00:56:07,353 --> 00:56:09,920
Nikki, what... Honey?

808
00:56:13,692 --> 00:56:16,494
Oh, no. No, no, no.

809
00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:18,195
Honey? Can you hear me? Nikki?

810
00:56:19,098 --> 00:56:22,032
Come on. Honey?

811
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:25,236
Baby? Baby, what happened?
What happened?
