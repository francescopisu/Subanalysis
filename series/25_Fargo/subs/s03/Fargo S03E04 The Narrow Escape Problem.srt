00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,011
<i>Each character in this tale</i>

2
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:09,279
<i>is going to be represented</i>

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:12,215
<i>by a different instrument
of the orchestra.</i>

4
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:18,288
<i>For instance, the bird will be
played by the flute,</i>

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,622
<i>like this.</i>

6
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:38,181
<i>Here's the duck,
played by the oboe.</i>

7
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:02,272
<i>The cat, by the clarinet.</i>

8
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:26,062
<i>The bassoon will
represent Grandfather.</i>

9
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:54,024
<i>The blast of the hunter's
shotguns,</i>

10
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:56,292
<i>played by the kettledrums.</i>

11
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:31,261
<i>The wolf, by the French horns.</i>

12
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,681
<i>And Peter, by the strings.</i>

13
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,461
<i>Are you sitting comfortably?</i>

14
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:14,797
<i>Good. Then I'll begin.</i>

15
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:46,829
Okay.

16
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,399
It's a safe deposit box.

17
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:50,767
Number 1606.

18
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:53,102
My guess, they stashed
the stamp there.

19
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,904
What about the key?
Wouldn't I need the...

20
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:56,673
Lost when you redecorated
the study, tell him.

21
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,641
Oh.

22
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:01,444
Don't forget. Got that meeting
with the high roller later.

23
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,947
Burt Lurdsman, plumbing supplies.

24
00:05:04,049 --> 00:05:05,882
I really feel like this is it.

25
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,183
Our ship coming in.

26
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:11,754
Remember.

27
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:14,290
Richest guy in the room
is always the boss.

28
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:45,922
Welcome to Capley Bank and Trust.

29
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:47,924
You picking up or dropping off?

30
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:49,058
What?

31
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,260
Oh, I'm just playing.

32
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,262
You wanna make a withdrawal
or a deposit?

33
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:53,363
Oh!

34
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,298
- I... I, uh...
- Oh.

35
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,734
It's okay, Milly. I got this.

36
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,336
Sorry about that, ES.

37
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:02,605
MILLY just moved down from Bemidji.

38
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:04,941
You've got to learn the faces,
huh.

39
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:06,009
Sorry.

40
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:07,577
No, that's...

41
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:10,213
Everybody has a first day.

42
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:13,716
Would you get the man a cream soda,
for shit's sakes? Jeez!

43
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:25,295
Thanks again for those Gopher seats.

44
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,297
Ham was tickled pink.

45
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,000
My sister's boy. You remember?

46
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:32,335
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

47
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:33,636
I, uh...

48
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,738
You know, I don't
got a lot of time here.

49
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,474
Oh, should be back in a snap,
MILLY. Uh...

50
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:41,544
More in the "nice to look at"
category than, say, brainiac.

51
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,547
I was hoping to get into my box.

52
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,482
You've been working out, yes?

53
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:49,852
You seem bulked up.
Been hitting the weight room?

54
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:52,689
I, uh... Hitting the buffet, more like.

55
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,324
What with the wedding and all.

56
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:56,225
Oh, I hear you.
All that cake tasting.

57
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:59,862
I am so sorry, Mr. Stussy.

58
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,964
No, that's...

59
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,866
You're fine.

60
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,201
Let the man breathe, girl.

61
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:07,036
Uh...

62
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,308
I lost the key, is the thing,
to my box.

63
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,512
Redecorating, thrown out with
the old credenza, you know.

64
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,015
Is that gonna be...

65
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:23,319
'Cause what's in there, I
really need, you know, today.

66
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,048
Well...

67
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:28,825
Uh...

68
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,527
Hate to be a stickler, ES,
but, uh, without the key,

69
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,363
well, we, uh...

70
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:34,931
No, I, uh... I...

71
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,133
We have to drill the lock and,
uh...

72
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:40,002
I get it. Makes sense.

73
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:41,971
What we should do is order a new key.

74
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:44,107
Won't take more than a week,
and that way, you know,

75
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,075
order's maintained.

76
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,710
You understand.

77
00:07:55,824 --> 00:07:57,145
You know what?

78
00:07:57,722 --> 00:08:00,223
Forget it.

79
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,393
Just go ahead and
pack up all my accounts.

80
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,974
I'll take a check if you don't
have that much cash on hand.

81
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,401
Now, Emmit, there's no need to...

82
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:12,702
No, it's fine. I understand.

83
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:14,170
You don't want to help me.

84
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:17,907
A lost key like it's some kind
of national tragedy,

85
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,409
but you got your order.

86
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:21,611
Rules and the like, so eh...

87
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:24,147
...I'll find a bank maybe
puts the customer first.

88
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,285
Call Mike.

89
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,821
Hold on a sec, ES. We're...

90
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,558
You know what?
We'll just drill that sucker.

91
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,162
No problemo. It'll take two
seconds and then you can...

92
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:41,431
Whatever you need. Just fetch
whatever's in there.

93
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,666
Not that I know
or need to know what's...

94
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:46,369
So I don't have to carry
my accounts over to Chase?

95
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,070
Chase? That's, uh...

96
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:52,642
You're such a kidder.

97
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:55,244
You really had me going there for...

98
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,380
Let me just get my keys.

99
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:02,418
While you're at it,
I'll take 10 grand in hundreds

100
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,587
and a buck in quarters for the meter.

101
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,256
That's, uh... Well, of course.

102
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:08,991
You'll just have to fill out a...

103
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,494
Or, you know what?

104
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,529
I'll get the paperwork handled myself.

105
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:18,167
Although, ES, may I suggest, um,

106
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,403
well, it's just that
whenever you take out

107
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:21,571
anything more than $10,000,

108
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:22,638
it automatically triggers a...

109
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,040
Buck,

110
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:27,210
if I wanted an opinion from
an asshole, I'd ask my own.

111
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:29,011
Got it?

112
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,695
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

113
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:56,465
The stamp wasn't there,
but I got this.

114
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,435
Christmas.

115
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:01,270
How much did he have, his account?

116
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:04,473
I don't know. Uh, maybe $1 million.

117
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,442
Your brother has $1 million,
and you took,

118
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:08,311
what is that, 10 grand?

119
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:11,414
Now, see, that's the criminal
mentality, your old life.

120
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,783
And what do you...
Hardwired patterns.

121
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,118
But we're not crooks.

122
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,620
This is the principal,

123
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:19,455
what's right,
fair market value for the...

124
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:21,324
What he took, the stamp.

125
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,694
Who's Luverne?

126
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:26,062
He did what?

127
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,898
Oh, believe me,
I'm pretty ticked myself.

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,999
I loved that dog.

129
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:32,101
Plus the money, of course.

130
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:35,571
Christ on a stick,
you think you know a guy.

131
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,406
I mean, used feminine
hygiene products

132
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:39,175
in a man's desk drawer is one thing,

133
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:40,977
but now,

134
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,681
the ridicule of beloved remains.

135
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:48,517
"Cremains" is the, I think,
preferred nomenclature.

136
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,252
This is the last thing we need.

137
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,288
What with this Varga mess

138
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,091
and poor Irv not even being cold yet.

139
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,026
See and that's, uh...

140
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:59,729
I was gonna talk to you about that.

141
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,231
Suicide is what the authorities...

142
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,200
The conversation I had.

143
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:07,870
Old folks get depressed around
the holidays and all that,

144
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,138
but I don't know.

145
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:12,408
Character like this Varga,

146
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,677
I'm just saying, you can't put
anything past him.

147
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,178
Christ.

148
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,881
What are we in the middle of?

149
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,584
We ought to consider
meeting this widow Goldfarb.

150
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:23,519
Sell the company?

151
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,187
- That's a little...
- No, no, not sell.

152
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,690
Just, I'm saying, take the meeting.

153
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:31,327
Buck says she's cash-rich
and looking to buy in.

154
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,129
And it feels like we're getting pulled

155
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,664
into something sticky here, so...

156
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:37,967
Yeah. Yeah, that's good thinking.

157
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,752
What the shit are they up to?

158
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,191
<i>When Putin was a boy,</i>

159
00:13:21,144 --> 00:13:23,477
<i>he already knew he wanted to be FSB.</i>

160
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:27,081
<i>He lived in the well,</i>

161
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,717
<i>kept a photo of Bergin by his bed.</i>

162
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,423
Bergin, who squats in 1920 dirt,

163
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,459
gives birth of GRU, later KGB.

164
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:41,086
Godfather.

165
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:51,339
And this boy, Putin, he learns sambo,

166
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:54,909
rules the yard school by his fist.

167
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:59,613
You see, in Russia,
there are two words for truth.

168
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,020
<i>Pravda</i> is man's truth.

169
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,789
<i>Istina</i> is God's truth.

170
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:13,894
But there is also<i> nepravda,</i>
untruth.

171
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:17,298
And this is the weapon the leader uses.

172
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:22,203
<i>Because he knows what they don't.</i>

173
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,941
<i>The truth is whatever he says it is.</i>

174
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:58,906
I don't get what's so complicated here.

175
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:03,110
You take a born loser,
add a drug addiction,

176
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,446
remove a job,
fill his pockets with holes,

177
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:07,681
mix in cold turkey,

178
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:09,583
you think this guy
isn't gonna drive around

179
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:11,452
randomly looking for someone to rob?

180
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:12,653
Yeah.

181
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:15,122
But then why tear a page
out of the phonebook?

182
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:17,057
Choose a house?
Doesn't that imply that...

183
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,826
There you go.

184
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:20,394
Using three-syllable words again

185
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,396
for a one-syllable problem.

186
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,999
First, that's a two-syllable word...

187
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:27,701
Let me tell you what I saw in Fallujah.

188
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:29,170
Men, okay?

189
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:32,673
My men laying in the dirt with
their guts in their boots.

190
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:34,642
How does that...

191
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:36,076
With all respect...

192
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,012
You know what an IED is?

193
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:40,214
It's like car parts and dynamite.

194
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,583
You either run one over, or you don't.

195
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:45,085
That's it, see? It's random.

196
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:46,787
Or bombs in our American streets.

197
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,389
Who gets killed?

198
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,257
Will you decide to walk
your dog that morning

199
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,793
or mow the lawn?

200
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:56,330
Your problem is
you're overcomplicating this.

201
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,732
Books under the floorboards,

202
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:01,402
an unapproved trip to goddamn Hollywood.

203
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:02,570
Told you. I'm paying for that myself.

204
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:03,737
Not the point.

205
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,172
Not the...

206
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,045
Look, I get it's personal, this one.

207
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:12,947
But we're talking simple wrong place,

208
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:14,081
wrong time.

209
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,317
A hopper with an itch on a spree

210
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,519
who met the business end of a Maytag.

211
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:21,155
Cosmic justice, good riddance.

212
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,458
So what do you say

213
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,094
we stamp this file "Case closed,"

214
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:30,364
move on to the calm and
orderly transition of power.

215
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,602
Sheriff, I hear you.

216
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,103
I do.

217
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,872
I'm not trying to stir things up.

218
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,943
No, I think you are.

219
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:47,014
I think you got resentments
over being made to cow,

220
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:48,616
kiss the ring.

221
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,685
I had boys like you in the service.

222
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:54,221
I'd tell them to go right, they go left.

223
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,993
All of them, to a man,

224
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:01,729
went home in a bag.

225
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:06,467
Well, I'm home already,

226
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,536
so I'm gonna spend
a few more days on this one,

227
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:09,803
see how it goes.

228
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:54,281
Hi.

229
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:58,686
I need the parole officer
for Maurice LeFay.

230
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,087
Mmm-hmm.

231
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:10,965
That'd be Ray.

232
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,336
He's in with a felon at present.

233
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,033
- Point me to the ladies.
- Mmm-hmm.

234
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,328
Oh, Lord.

235
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,830
My Lord.

236
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:44,632
Come on already.

237
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,300
You wouldn't...

238
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,801
Friend.

239
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:50,270
You wouldn't have
a putter-inner by chance?

240
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:51,472
How's that?

241
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:53,107
Or a pad?

242
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:56,510
This is not the way
things were supposed to go,

243
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:59,146
but the Lord must have... Not to get...

244
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:03,000
Anyway, if you could find your
way clear to abetting a sister in need

245
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:07,544
one who is supposed to be with child,
but apparently is not...

246
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:09,135
Uh, sorry, I don't have...

247
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,336
Regulations, you know.

248
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,464
We're not meant to
carry a purse, and I'm...

249
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,796
It's not my time of the...

250
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:17,243
I could ask the clerk.
She might have...

251
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:18,945
Oh, no, don't burden yourself.

252
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:37,630
Well, what are the odds?

253
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:39,298
Second female in uniform.

254
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,967
You said regulation,
and I assumed...

255
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:42,601
Winnie Lopez, Saint Cloud Metro.

256
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:45,304
Uh, Gloria Burgle,
Eden Valley Police.

257
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:46,939
Oh, and chief to boot.

258
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,774
Uh, for the moment, anyway.

259
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:52,712
Sorry, I got about 100 pounds
of TP crammed in there.

260
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:55,781
Been cranky as a female dog
since breakfast,

261
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:58,117
and now I know why.

262
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,418
We've been trying, me and Jerry,

263
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,786
for months now. Yeah.

264
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,088
Like those old Road Runner cartoons

265
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,356
with the wolf and the sheep dog,

266
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,124
how you punch a clock to go to work?

267
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,126
It's mostly missionary,
if I'm being honest.

268
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,260
We used to spice it up,

269
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:09,428
but now it's about the
shortest distance

270
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,629
between two points.

271
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:15,601
I've...

272
00:20:15,703 --> 00:20:17,703
He'd pop faster from the back,
if I'm being honest,

273
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:20,706
but I think it's important
to look each other in the eyes

274
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:22,508
when it comes to making babies.

275
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,609
You got kids?

276
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:27,594
Uh, one. Nathan. He's 12.

277
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:28,990
Oh, that's what Jerry wants.

278
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:31,726
A shortstop or a
switch-hitting third baseman.

279
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:34,596
Me? I've got my
fingers crossed for a girl.

280
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,166
Well, I better hit it.

281
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:40,168
Here on a 10-30, leaving
the scene of the accident,

282
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,736
except the Vic don't
wanna press charges,

283
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:43,405
turns out so. You?

284
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:44,506
Um, murder.

285
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:47,631
Jeez!

286
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:48,755
Yeah.

287
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,049
Well, happy trails.

288
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:15,150
I know, baby.

289
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:17,852
It's all I can think about,
too. I...

290
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:22,324
Look, I'm no psychic,
but how does he not fund us?

291
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:25,427
And if not, well,
we got capital now.

292
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:29,764
Oh, I've got to go. Yeah.

293
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:32,734
Yeah, you, too.

294
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:35,670
I love you.

295
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,672
Hi.

296
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:38,873
I already told
the other girl everything.

297
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:41,142
The other...

298
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,011
Oh, no, sir, I'm not
here about the accident.

299
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,003
Gloria Burgle, Eden Valley Police.

300
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:47,916
I'm, uh, looking into the, uh...

301
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:51,920
The, uh, murder of...

302
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,990
Now that is...

303
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,892
Truly, what are the odds?

304
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:00,795
You said "murder"?

305
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:03,665
Yes, sir, of Ennis Stussy
in Eden Valley.

306
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,367
And here you are,
how many miles away,

307
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,901
a Stussy as well.

308
00:22:08,138 --> 00:22:09,571
Well, I mean, it's...

309
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:11,940
Go figure. It's a pretty common name.

310
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:13,541
I got cousins all over the darn place,

311
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,710
not that I'm saying that
this fellow was a cousin,

312
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,413
although who knows? Could've been.

313
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:22,817
Well, reason I'm here,
one of your cons, Maurice.

314
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,352
He's most likely the culprit.

315
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:26,721
We got evidence shows he broke
into the victim's house,

316
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:29,324
tore the place apart
looking for something.

317
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,760
Hmm? Maurice LeFay?

318
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,194
That's the one.

319
00:22:33,296 --> 00:22:35,230
Air conditioner caved
his cranium, I heard.

320
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,532
Heard that as well.

321
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:39,134
Saw it, in fact.
Not a pretty picture.

322
00:22:39,236 --> 00:22:40,402
All the same,

323
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:41,603
just 'cause the perp passes on

324
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:43,638
doesn't mean the investigation halts.

325
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,007
There's a question of why.

326
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,043
- "Why."
- Yes, sir.

327
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:49,177
Fellow drove 30 miles

328
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,912
without knowing his destined address,

329
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:52,981
finds Ennis out of the phone book,

330
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,082
and then searches his house

331
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:55,483
like he knows there's something there,

332
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:57,285
like he's looking
for something in particular.

333
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:58,887
It's unusual.

334
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:01,423
Well, I mean,

335
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,693
- he liked his reefer.
- Is that right?

336
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,561
Smoked a heck of a lot.

337
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,430
In fact, he blew his piss test.

338
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:10,932
Was gonna grab him up
when I heard the news.

339
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,967
"Death by major appliance."

340
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,176
So I'm not sure how much more I can...

341
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:22,610
But if I think of anything...

342
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:25,980
All I can ask, sir,
if something pops to mind.

343
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,082
We're moving offices,

344
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:28,583
so I wrote the new number on the back.

345
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,052
"Chief."

346
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:34,322
Ignore that. We're doing
some restructuring.

347
00:23:34,424 --> 00:23:37,092
They always find a way
to screw you, don't they?

348
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,451
They try.

349
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:09,591
Jeez!

350
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:15,363
Hey, Ray.

351
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:18,533
Yeah. I'm just running out
for a home inspection.

352
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:19,768
Yeah?

353
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,369
Let's table that for now.

354
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:23,037
Yeah?

355
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,055
Have a seat, Ray.

356
00:24:44,494 --> 00:24:45,860
I, uh...

357
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:47,695
You know the Deputy Director.

358
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,097
Yes, sir.

359
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,566
How are you today, sir?

360
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:00,942
It's a problem, Ray.

361
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,117
I, uh...

362
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,252
Can't have this, Ray.

363
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:14,055
Intermingling with the clientele?

364
00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:15,857
You swore an oath.

365
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,525
Well, to be fair, sir...

366
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:21,596
Not a literal oath, I'll give
you that, but implied.

367
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:23,531
For Pete's sake, it's
right there in the handbook.

368
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:26,501
Don't bang the cattle.

369
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,870
First off, there's probably
broken glass down there.

370
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:30,004
Second...

371
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:31,606
Second, it's against the damn law.

372
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:34,108
Which... I've got to give it to you.

373
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:37,178
The Swango skank,
you could fry bacon on, but...

374
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,314
- Now, that's...
- I'm saying she's hot.

375
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,982
- No, I...
- That's not the point.

376
00:25:41,084 --> 00:25:42,283
That's right. That's not the...

377
00:25:42,385 --> 00:25:43,551
Son,

378
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:47,288
read my lips.

379
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,490
You're in a shit storm,

380
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:52,093
and we're the ones
holding out the umbrella.

381
00:25:52,195 --> 00:25:53,261
You gonna take it?

382
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:57,216
Well, that's... What is that...

383
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:59,085
I'm saying that if you tell us

384
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,619
that it was a one-time thing,

385
00:26:00,722 --> 00:26:03,656
that you lost your mind for a moment,

386
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:06,358
then we can go to suspension.

387
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,460
Hmm? Huh?

388
00:26:08,229 --> 00:26:09,829
Slap you on the wrist,

389
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,997
or maybe on the dingus would be better.

390
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:20,606
I love her.

391
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:22,875
Son.

392
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:24,877
That's wrong.

393
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:26,679
That's not the way to go here, Ray.

394
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:28,380
And you know what?

395
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:29,749
She loves me.

396
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:32,485
Look at her.

397
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:36,188
A girl like that, and she loves me.

398
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:39,458
We're getting married.

399
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:42,328
We got plans, big plans.

400
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,899
Not if we revoke her.

401
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:50,369
Now, hold on just a...

402
00:26:50,471 --> 00:26:52,271
Consequences, Mr. Stussy.

403
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:54,507
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

404
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,108
Maybe a few months at Stillwater

405
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,376
will straighten her out.

406
00:26:57,478 --> 00:27:00,045
These rules aren't just for you,
Ray.

407
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:02,481
What if she's manipulating you,

408
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,484
using her poontang
to hoodwink and bamboozle?

409
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:07,653
See, that's what they do, son.

410
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:09,889
- I thought you knew that.
- Look.

411
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:12,525
Punish me. That's fine,
but don't...

412
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:15,461
If there's any fealty whatsoever...

413
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,030
She's not a recidivist.

414
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:20,232
We're not talking
a common criminal here.

415
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:22,034
Whatever problems there were for her

416
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:24,336
are in the past.

417
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,971
We...

418
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:27,540
We've got plans, like I said.

419
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:30,009
Won bronze in the Wildcat regionals.

420
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:32,711
And there's a sponsor, Lurdsman.

421
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:34,980
He's a... Kitchen supplies or...

422
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:37,082
He's gonna sponsor our run.

423
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,517
Bridge, we play.

424
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,288
For the love of God,

425
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:45,724
you can't send her back.

426
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,137
You've got 10 minutes
to clean out your desk.

427
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,539
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

428
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,642
And you're gonna sign a paper saying

429
00:28:03,744 --> 00:28:05,945
that you're not gonna sue us
for wrongful termination

430
00:28:06,047 --> 00:28:08,380
or whatever half-cocked scheme
comes into your head

431
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:09,815
once the shock wears off.

432
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,050
You got my word.

433
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:14,386
We had your word,
for all the good it did us.

434
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:21,602
Good evening. Stussy Lots.

435
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:24,771
Oh, yeah?

436
00:29:26,108 --> 00:29:27,107
Yeah.

437
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:31,612
Be sure to tell him in the morning.

438
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:35,649
You have a good night yourself.

439
00:29:48,312 --> 00:29:49,311
Sy.

440
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:51,781
Law enforcement's here.

441
00:29:54,118 --> 00:29:55,117
That's, uh...

442
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,119
Nobody asked for that.

443
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:59,321
Sir, I'm Officer Lopez,
Saint Cloud Metro.

444
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,290
Is there a place
we could talk in private?

445
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:04,927
That's... I didn't call the police.

446
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:06,529
No, sir. It's...

447
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:08,831
I'm investigating an automotive flapper

448
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,332
in the driver of a Humvee

449
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:12,535
registered to this Stussy Lots.

450
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:13,869
Did vehicular damage to...

451
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:15,204
Fine. Fine.

452
00:30:15,306 --> 00:30:17,540
Let's... Not here.

453
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:39,728
I just want to say upfront,
this is a total waste of time.

454
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:40,896
Uh, yes, sir.

455
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:42,731
And I've already talked
to the one complainant,

456
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,967
and he's not interested
in pressing charges.

457
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,090
See?

458
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:49,493
To wit, one Raymond Stussy works

459
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:52,129
for the parole board,
and I have to ask,

460
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:54,431
any relation to
the Stussy on the marquee?

461
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,240
That's fine. I can check that.
It's just that, um...

462
00:31:03,342 --> 00:31:05,542
I ran the registration
on the offending vehicle

463
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:06,877
and saw that the Humvee in question

464
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:08,812
was registered to
your parking lot concern.

465
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,947
But it's unspecified in the paperwork

466
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,983
as to who here is actually driving it.

467
00:31:13,085 --> 00:31:15,319
Well, that's... I'd have to look.

468
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:16,553
That'd be great.

469
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:20,557
You mean now?

470
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:23,427
If it's not too much trouble.

471
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,297
I mean, it's after hours.
People are out.

472
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,900
Just leave me your number.

473
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,469
The girl in HR can run it
through in the morning.

474
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:33,770
What's her name?

475
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:40,177
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
You said...

476
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,912
What I heard was

477
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:44,648
the offended party
wasn't interested in charges.

478
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,982
Right.

479
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:47,150
Yeah, that's complainant one.

480
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,419
Complainant two,
the waitress I mentioned,

481
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,388
she got hit on the way out of the lot.

482
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,690
She is hopping mad.

483
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,292
Just paid her wagon off, apparently.

484
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:59,529
That sounds like an insurance matter.

485
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:01,498
Yes, sir, except the driver in question

486
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,100
left the scene of the accident at speed,

487
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:04,534
and that's police.

488
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:11,842
Well, like I said,

489
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,212
am I talking to myself here, or...

490
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:17,781
Soon as the girl's in tomorrow,

491
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:19,049
I'll have her call up that info,

492
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:20,917
and we'll get it over to you.

493
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,289
Okay, sir. Well, I sure do
appreciate your time.

494
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:22,379
Not sure what's keeping Ray.

495
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:26,149
He's super reliable normally.

496
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,451
You'll see.

497
00:33:27,553 --> 00:33:28,752
A rock, really.

498
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,421
It's kind of his bellwether.

499
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:40,363
I'll...

500
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,332
Let me call him again.

501
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:13,431
I feel that maybe we started poorly.

502
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,501
Jesus, it's dinnertime.

503
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:19,303
<i>Schweinekoteletts.</i>

504
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,139
Pork chops.

505
00:34:21,808 --> 00:34:22,807
With applesauce, but...

506
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,476
Marvelous. We'll talk as we eat.

507
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,945
Now, that's not...
Just a... Goddamn!

508
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:30,748
A step too far is what this is.

509
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,283
Coming to my home.

510
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:34,352
Why do I feel that
you're not happy we met

511
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:37,855
when all I want to do is
make you rich?

512
00:34:37,957 --> 00:34:40,391
Look around. I'm already rich.

513
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:42,994
No, you're not.

514
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:51,169
I wish you'd let us
sit at the real table.

515
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:53,671
In the dining room.

516
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:55,306
I'll let you into a secret, madam.

517
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:57,208
I was a housemaid's boy,

518
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:00,511
and I ate three meals a day
in a kitchen below ground,

519
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:03,047
so you're making me
feel right at home.

520
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,818
Mmm.

521
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:10,254
And how are you this evening,
young lady?

522
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:14,792
That's Mama, the matriarch.

523
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:19,030
But she doesn't talk,
not since the stroke.

524
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:20,464
That's a shame.

525
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,733
I bet she had a lovely speaking voice.

526
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:26,604
I wish you'd told me about company.

527
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:28,673
Ah! That's my fault.

528
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:31,742
I do have a tendency
to drop in unannounced,

529
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:33,244
but, you see, the thing is,

530
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:35,880
Emmit and I have such
amazing opportunities

531
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:37,481
ahead of us that...

532
00:35:37,584 --> 00:35:40,384
Well, you know what they say
about time being money.

533
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,953
- Really?
- Mmm.

534
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:43,754
I don't want to talk business
in front of them.

535
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:45,790
Emmit, don't be rude.

536
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,461
I don't mean to gossip,

537
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,531
but, um, are you English
by any chance?

538
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:54,732
What gave it away?

539
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:03,441
No, I like to think of myself
as a citizen of the world.

540
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:07,712
London, Manila, Johannesburg,
Tokyo, Rome.

541
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:09,080
You've been to all those places?

542
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:10,681
Hmm. And more.

543
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:12,750
In fact, that's what I want
to talk to your husband about.

544
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:14,719
About broadening our partnership,

545
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:18,823
or a broad in it,
if you'll pardon the pun.

546
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:21,025
Partnership?

547
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:22,360
He's exaggerating.

548
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:25,396
We have some dealings
more in the realm of finance.

549
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:26,530
Yeah.

550
00:36:26,633 --> 00:36:27,665
Maybe he's right.

551
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:30,134
We shouldn't be
broadcasting our intentions.

552
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:31,869
It's just that your husband, madam,

553
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:33,371
is a consummate businessman.

554
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:36,374
He's a true professional.

555
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:39,710
I learn something
from him every day anew.

556
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,979
In fact,

557
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:48,753
I brought those contracts
you asked me to draw up,

558
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:51,422
if you'd like to review them.

559
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:56,761
And now might I be so forward,
madam,

560
00:36:56,863 --> 00:37:00,931
as to ask for the
location of your WC.

561
00:37:03,102 --> 00:37:04,035
Our what?

562
00:37:04,137 --> 00:37:05,336
He means the crapper.

563
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:06,837
Emmit.

564
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:09,273
It's just down the hall
on your right-hand side.

565
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,508
Right.

566
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:17,715
What?

567
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:45,009
I'm not making you
a partner in my company.

568
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:47,078
You just blew in on the wind Thursday.

569
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,350
I'm calling Sy.

570
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:55,786
Ah. And here's me
thinking you were the boss.

571
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,399
In the favelas of Brazil,

572
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:12,136
there are six-year-olds with Glocks.

573
00:38:13,473 --> 00:38:17,108
They roam in packs, stealing
whatever they can find.

574
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,410
Mexican lowlifes

575
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:21,946
stream into this country like wolves,

576
00:38:22,048 --> 00:38:24,682
eyeing our women and children.

577
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:29,687
In the Congo, a family of six
live on 10 cents a day.

578
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:31,822
You turn on the TV,
what do you see?

579
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,992
Boat people.

580
00:38:36,129 --> 00:38:38,262
Mass migration.

581
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:43,367
You're living in the age
of the refugee, my friend.

582
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:46,103
Look, if you won't take
back your money,

583
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:47,838
well, I can't make you!

584
00:38:49,976 --> 00:38:51,208
You see it, don't you?

585
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:56,914
Millions of people bought
houses they couldn't afford,

586
00:38:57,016 --> 00:38:59,850
and now they're living
on the streets.

587
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:03,421
85% of the world's wealth

588
00:39:03,523 --> 00:39:06,557
is controlled by 1% of the population.

589
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,992
What do you think is gonna happen

590
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:09,760
when those people wake up

591
00:39:09,862 --> 00:39:12,563
and realize you've
got all their money?

592
00:39:12,665 --> 00:39:15,866
Hey! I just charge for parking!

593
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,301
Oh, you think they're
gonna ask questions

594
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:21,138
when they come with their
pitchforks and their torches?

595
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,573
You live in a mansion.

596
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:25,676
You drive a $90,000 car.

597
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,945
It's a lease through the company.

598
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,246
Look at me.

599
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,950
Look at me.

600
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,353
This is a $200 suit.

601
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:40,724
I wear a second-hand tie.
I fly coach.

602
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:42,660
Not because I can't afford first,

603
00:39:42,762 --> 00:39:44,361
because I'm smart.

604
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:49,099
So look at you, and look at me,

605
00:39:50,136 --> 00:39:51,769
and tell me who's the richer.

606
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:56,907
I feel like this is a trick question.

607
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:59,944
There's an accounting coming,
Mr. Stussy,

608
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:03,080
and you know I'm right.
Mongol hordes descending.

609
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:05,349
Now what are you doing
to insulate yourself

610
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:07,384
and your family?

611
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,155
You think you're rich.

612
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:14,191
You've no idea what "rich" means.

613
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:21,599
"Rich" is a fleet of private planes

614
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:24,301
filled with decoys to mask your scent.

615
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:28,205
It's a banker in Wyoming
and another in Gstaad.

616
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:32,676
So that's action item one,
the accumulation of wealth,

617
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:34,912
and I mean wealth, not money.

618
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:37,715
What's action item number two?

619
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:42,586
To use that wealth to become invisible.

620
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:50,327
Why does it smell like
an unflushed toilet in here?

621
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:52,963
Oh, we had a... There was an incident.

622
00:40:56,869 --> 00:40:58,202
Is this where you hung it?

623
00:40:59,372 --> 00:41:00,371
What?

624
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:02,673
The stamp.

625
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,945
The famed Two-Penny Red U.S. misprint.

626
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:11,282
If I'm not mistaken, the "2"
was the wrong way around.

627
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:12,983
How do you...

628
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:15,219
It's all very Old Testament, really,

629
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:18,322
this feud between you and Raymond.

630
00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:20,491
Do you know there are 25 chapters

631
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:21,959
in the book of<i> Genesis</i>

632
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:24,461
that refer to the feuds of brothers?

633
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:28,399
<i>Cain and Abel, most famously,</i>

634
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:30,601
<i>but Joseph was betrayed by his brothers</i>

635
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:32,636
<i>and sold into slavery.</i>

636
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,875
<i>Not to forget the sons of Isaac.</i>

637
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:42,079
<i>"And my brother
Esau was a hairy man,"</i>

638
00:41:42,181 --> 00:41:44,715
<i>"but I am a smooth man."</i>

639
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:48,188
Then not another peep.

640
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,592
<i>Corinthians, Leviticus.</i>

641
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:53,460
You'd think all the brothers of history

642
00:41:53,562 --> 00:41:54,762
had worked things out,

643
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:57,498
but, of course,
we both know that's not true.

644
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:01,368
Now, just wait a minute, pal.

645
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,237
I don't know what you're or how you...

646
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:06,473
But private matters between me and my...

647
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:08,308
I hear things.

648
00:42:10,045 --> 00:42:11,845
I hear them because I listen.

649
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:15,349
I see them because I watch.

650
00:42:16,852 --> 00:42:18,485
Emails.

651
00:42:19,755 --> 00:42:21,155
Phone calls.

652
00:42:21,257 --> 00:42:22,756
<i>- He came.
- Who?</i>

653
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:23,891
<i>Well, now, the fella from the...</i>

654
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:25,058
<i>Ermentraub?</i>

655
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:26,860
<i>No. Different fella.</i>

656
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,163
<i>Don't wanna say too much on the phone.</i>

657
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:31,098
<i>Just... You better come down here.</i>

658
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:39,473
You can never be too careful.
That's my motto.

659
00:42:39,575 --> 00:42:43,510
You see, I've got
great plans for us, Emmit.

660
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:47,214
Can't you just take the money back?

661
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,049
No. No, my friend, I'm sorry.

662
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:51,018
You're in the pan, and you know

663
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,187
where you go when you leave the pan.

664
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:54,588
- The...
- The frying pan.

665
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,657
You know where you go when you leave.

666
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,460
- Into the fire.
- Yeah.

667
00:43:01,363 --> 00:43:03,063
They're coming.

668
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:06,099
Pitchfork peasants
with murder in their eyes,

669
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:09,937
and me, your guardian angel,

670
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:12,773
which is why I went to the Minnesota

671
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,741
National Trust this morning,

672
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,777
and they have agreed to increase

673
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:20,280
your line of credit by $25 million.

674
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:23,617
How?

675
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:27,354
By acting as your agent, your partner.

676
00:43:27,456 --> 00:43:32,059
So, here's some of
the papers you need to sign.

677
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:33,894
I've studied your books,

678
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:35,562
and, uh, you're not just

679
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:37,498
in the parking lot business anymore.

680
00:43:38,234 --> 00:43:39,766
What business am I in?

681
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:41,568
The billionaire business.

682
00:43:50,246 --> 00:43:52,279
But first you need to tell me, uh,

683
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:55,716
is your brother going to be a problem?

684
00:43:56,919 --> 00:44:00,621
Ray? No, he...

685
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:03,056
It's just a dumb rivalry.

686
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:06,360
And the girl?

687
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,663
I don't...

688
00:44:10,332 --> 00:44:12,332
I mean, he's,

689
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,535
honestly,

690
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,739
a loser.

691
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,642
So what else could she be?

692
00:44:33,221 --> 00:44:34,888
<i>Just then Grandfather came out.</i>

693
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:40,727
<i>He was angry because Peter
had gone into the meadow.</i>

694
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:43,997
<i>It's a dangerous place.</i>

695
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,699
<i>If a wolf should come
out of the forest,</i>

696
00:44:45,801 --> 00:44:47,067
<i>then what would you do?</i>

697
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:19,699
<i>But Peter paid no attention
to his grandfather's words.</i>

698
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:22,669
<i>Boys like Peter aren't
afraid of wolves.</i>

699
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:24,437
- Mom.
- Huh?

700
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:28,375
I said it's time for bed.

701
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,844
Well, go on and get your teeth brushed.

702
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:55,368
I'm right in the next room.

703
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,971
Mom, I'm not a baby.

704
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,640
You're my baby.

705
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:09,349
Hold that thought.

706
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:34,774
Hi-ho.

707
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,543
Little off the beaten path,
aren't you?

708
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:39,045
I went by the station, they said...

709
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:40,613
Fudge, you were turning in.

710
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,649
That's okay. You want some tea?

711
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:44,684
Yeah, sounds good.

712
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:54,360
So remember I was telling you
about my hit-and-run?

713
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,962
A Humvee in a restaurant parking lot,

714
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,864
- two other vehicles involved.
- Hmm.

715
00:46:57,966 --> 00:47:00,266
So I run the plate number on the Hummer,

716
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:02,001
and it's registered to a corporation

717
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:04,137
in Saint Cloud, a company car.

718
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,306
Seems like you're crossing all the T's.

719
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:07,740
Not sure how it's...

720
00:47:07,843 --> 00:47:09,476
Well, okay, then.

721
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:12,178
So, after I see you in the commode,

722
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,781
I go see this fellow that works there,

723
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:16,349
and something strikes me odd.

724
00:47:16,451 --> 00:47:17,617
The name.

725
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:20,353
See, it turns out
that one of the victims

726
00:47:20,455 --> 00:47:22,255
has the same last name

727
00:47:22,357 --> 00:47:23,690
as the fellow that owns the company

728
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:25,391
that leased the car.

729
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:28,127
So I looked it up, and, get this,

730
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,964
they're brothers, which...

731
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,132
Then I remembered that

732
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:34,501
you were at the Parole Board
about a murder,

733
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:35,668
and so I looked it up.

734
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,103
I mean, Eden Valley's had one death

735
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:38,505
by foul play in 16 months.

736
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,406
And the victim's name is...

737
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:41,908
Ennis Stussy.

738
00:47:43,144 --> 00:47:44,477
With the same as...

739
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,312
My suspect's parole officer.

740
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:48,014
And his brother,

741
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:50,750
who owns the company
that leased the Humvee,

742
00:47:50,852 --> 00:47:54,287
and who lives, get this,

743
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:56,122
in Eden Prairie.
