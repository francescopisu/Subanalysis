1
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,125
You want some pop?
Sprite or something?

2
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,160
No.

3
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,368
This is deputy Gloria Burgle,

4
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,636
Meeker County
Sheriff's Office,

5
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:51,937
with an interview
of Emmit Stussy,

6
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,372
March 16, 2011.

7
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,510
First up,
I'm curious about something.

8
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,445
Your house is
an hour's drive from here.

9
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,614
There's three St. cloud metros
near your office.

10
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,283
Why come all
the way down here?

11
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,617
You gave me your card.

12
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,220
Okay, then.

13
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,124
Well,
I got a lot of questions, but

14
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:14,126
I guess maybe,
you should just start.

15
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:16,295
I want to be
clear about something.

16
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,730
If anybody comes here,
claiming to be my lawyer,

17
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:19,798
don't let them in.

18
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,234
- Like who?
- Anybody.

19
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,305
I'm saying,
I'm here on my own proxy.

20
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,173
Want no contact
with the outside world.

21
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,142
Don't trust anyone who comes,

22
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:31,243
if they do,
which they may not.

23
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,683
He was right, you know?

24
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,117
- Who?
- Ray.

25
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,153
I tricked him.

26
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,890
Or not tricked, but...

27
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,594
A lie is not a lie
if you believe it's true,

28
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,595
do you think that?

29
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,331
It's not my story.

30
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,234
I think that.

31
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,136
Or I did, I guess.

32
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,006
I don't know
what I believe now.

33
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,579
He played tEnnis.

34
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,249
Ray?

35
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,685
Our dad.

36
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,255
At his club, rain or shine,
every Saturday.

37
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:17,556
He had that
thing all dads have

38
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,191
after 30 years
of wearing socks,

39
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,759
where the hair gets worn away,

40
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,628
so he's basically bald
from the shins down.

41
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,367
I was on the drive,
you know, throwing

42
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,769
a ball against the house,
a tEnnis ball.

43
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,406
Wasn't supposed to,
but he was gone, so...

44
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,576
And Ray's someplace,
kitchen probably,

45
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,278
he was always eating,
that kid.

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,312
Real chubby.

47
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,149
And then, dad's home.

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
He had this old
Mercedes diesel,

49
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:49,888
you could hear it on the come.

50
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,358
So I hide
the ball and he pulls in.

51
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,232
Not out of
the car ten seconds,

52
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:03,335
when down he goes,
flat on his face.

53
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:07,739
One minute, he's waving hello,
the next, just drops like...

54
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,408
Like the lights go out.

55
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,990
I killed him.

56
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,258
- Your dad?
- Ray.

57
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,261
First I tricked him,

58
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,596
then I killed him.

59
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,366
Like no days had passed.

60
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,435
Like one thing
goes and then another.

61
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,403
Like you whack a tEnnis ball
back and forth.

62
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,640
Killed him where?

63
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,742
In the den of
a shithole apartment.

64
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,379
Framed
picture-puzzle in the wall,

65
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,980
like some six-year-old,

66
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,415
so proud,
he had to hang it up.

67
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,086
Christmas Eve.

68
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,556
You think there's
a special level of hell

69
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,791
for people that killed their
loved ones on Christmas Eve?

70
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,400
I wanted the stamps, see?

71
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,871
My dad gave me a car,
but I wanted the stamps.

72
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,706
What 17-year-old
boy wants stamps

73
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,208
when he can have
a cherry-red corvette?

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,677
But I did.

75
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,179
And Ray, like I said,
he was a chubby kid.

76
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,181
15 years old,
never been laid,

77
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,816
never even felt
up a girl, so...

78
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,788
I let it slip.

79
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:36,528
How this car, well...
It's like a magnet, isn't it?

80
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,697
Like catnip for kitty cats,

81
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,499
and if you turn up
to school Monday

82
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,267
in this thing,
well, it's a done deal.

83
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,705
And now, he's begging me.

84
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,275
"Emmit, please, take the damn
stamps, give me the car."

85
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,410
Like it's his idea.

86
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,380
What's that old quote, that...

87
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,015
"The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled

88
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,984
"was convincing
the world he didn't exist."

89
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,456
How did you?

90
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,624
I cut his throat.

91
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,260
Blood everywhere.

92
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,295
"Exsanguinate,"
that's the term,

93
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,596
the cause of death.

94
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,331
But how, exactly?

95
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,537
One stamp left.

96
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,205
I sold the rest
and used the capital

97
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,473
to get things rolling,

98
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,974
but I kept the two-cent,

99
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,943
hung it on the wall
of my study.

100
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,145
Like it was my first
dollar I ever made.

101
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,816
But think of it
from his point of view,

102
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,084
my brother.

103
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,120
Like a stick in the eye,
every time he...

104
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,990
'Cause I won, see?

105
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,327
I won.

106
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,697
And he spent his days watching
scumbags piss on his shoes.

107
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:54,339
So, I go to him and,
"enough's enough," I said.

108
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,741
"This dumb feud,
let's put it in the past."

109
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:59,945
And I give him the frame,

110
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,280
but he's still mad
and he tries to give it back,

111
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,950
so we start shoving
and the frame breaks.

112
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:08,253
And a piece of glass,
stuck in his neck.

113
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,154
You hit him with it?

114
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,089
No, I didn't... I...

115
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,124
I didn't mean to...

116
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,360
It was just one of those,
"what are the odds?" Moments.

117
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,997
Murder though,
I'm not saying it wasn't.

118
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:19,898
Hmm.

119
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,371
Thirty years I've
been killing him.

120
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,008
That was just when he fell.

121
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,896
I'm not sure
one's gonna do it.

122
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,164
I got another picked out,
closer to the precinct.

123
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,368
What matters is
he signs those papers.

124
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,403
And we get him
out of that precinct

125
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,704
before he gets too chatty.

126
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,039
I can monitor the radios,

127
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,507
see if there's a workaround
to the new security.

128
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,610
No, let's move shop,
go to stage four. No mistakes.

129
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,540
Shit!

130
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,332
Hello.

131
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,669
<i>Hope you got your
checkbook handy.</i>

132
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,204
Who's this?

133
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,171
<i>You first</i>.

134
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,310
Madam, it's just lazy
to steal from someone

135
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,645
without knowing their name.

136
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,549
Yeah. That's what I am. Lazy.

137
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,584
<i>Oh..</i>.

138
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,488
<i>The Swango. Our recidivist.</i>

139
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,957
Bingo.

140
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,428
Mr. Cayman Islands
xxjj19462sk.

141
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>Or should I say
Switzerland zz91482s?</i>

142
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,035
No, account numbers
mean nothing

143
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,904
without their passwords,

144
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:36,174
without the answer
to six security questions.

145
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,210
<i>Was it six?
Thanks. Thought it was five.</i>

146
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,980
What do you want?

147
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,581
Your name, for starters.

148
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,250
<i>V.M. Varga.</i>

149
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,086
What's the "V.M." Stand for?

150
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,090
<i>How much and where?</i>

151
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,025
Not sure that
tracks alphabetically.

152
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,193
Look,
if you're gonna be clever,

153
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,263
I'm gonna go
for a nice lie down.

154
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,000
<i>Two million. Lobby of
the Clarion Hotel, 4:00 P.M.</i>

155
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,968
Come alone.

156
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,668
Nice sweater.

157
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,340
It's a cardigan.

158
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,080
Lopez.

159
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,014
<i>Yeah.</i>

160
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,550
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

161
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,786
<i>...hear me?</i>

162
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:29,954
Hello?

163
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,123
<i>Yeah, it's me. It's Gloria.</i>

164
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,792
Oh, hey, there.
I was just thinking of you.

165
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,161
Yeah? Hey,
let me ask you something.

166
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,130
<i>Yeah, strangest thing,
I'm here on a case.</i>

167
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,532
<i>A new case, just this morning,
a homicide,</i>

168
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,334
and you'll never
guess the Vic's name.

169
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,502
<i>When you talked to</i>

170
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,805
<i>this Goldfarb lady
at the restaurant,</i>

171
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,774
<i>she gave you
a full alibi for Emmit.</i>

172
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,810
Yeah, that's it.
Spoke for 20 minutes at least.

173
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,379
Nice lady, real sophisticated.

174
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,981
Said they'd been there
since 6:15 approx,

175
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,449
maybe even 5:55.

176
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,451
Her and Mr. Feltz
and Mr. Stussy,

177
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,787
which, like I said,
you'll never guess what.

178
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:05,656
Well, thing is,
he just confessed.

179
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,025
<i>- Who?</i>
- Emmit.

180
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,193
Just walked in off the street,
told me the whole story,

181
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,396
even named the murder weapon.
So I'm wondering,

182
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:14,132
how come this lady alibis him
when he says he's guilty?

183
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,534
It's a puzzler.

184
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,903
Maybe bring her back in
and ask her yourself.

185
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,072
Yeah, sounds right.

186
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,573
Wait, you were
saying something before

187
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,908
about a new homicide?

188
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,877
Yeah. Guy's throat was cut.

189
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,679
They found a piece of glass
on the linoleum.

190
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,814
<i>What guy?</i>

191
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,150
Dentist,
lives on a nice quiet street,

192
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,451
but get this, his name...

193
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,653
<i>Marvin Stussy.</i>

194
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,123
Okay then.

195
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,726
<i>Okay then.</i>

196
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,367
Hey, there.

197
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,535
Hey.

198
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:51,869
Brought burgers.

199
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,840
Aw. Aren't you sweet?

200
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,041
Ron drive you?

201
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,676
No, took the bus.

202
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,782
So, how's it going?

203
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,285
Good, you know.

204
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,586
Think I might put
this thing to bed.

205
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,654
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

206
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,625
Hmm.

207
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,395
You know, I was thinking,

208
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,629
maybe drive up
to the lake this weekend,

209
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,531
do some canoeing?
Like when you were little?

210
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,533
- Mom.
- I know, but it'll be fun.

211
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,536
Rather go to the mall.

212
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,105
The mall?

213
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,973
Yeah, with my friends.

214
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,141
Oh, I was thinking for us.

215
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,144
Okay.

216
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,779
No, no, if you wanna go
to the mall, that's...

217
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,380
Lake sounds...

218
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,549
And I know you're not little.

219
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,318
I mean, you're
practically all grown up.

220
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,222
Phone's for you, Chief.
Nope, deputy.

221
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,990
- Hey, Nathan.
- Hey, Donny.

222
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,361
Burgle.

223
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,131
Oh. Hi,
thanks for calling me back.

224
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,768
That'd be great,
if you don't mind.

225
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,036
Really help me out.

226
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,539
Super, see you then.

227
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,077
Due diligence.
Just kicking the tires

228
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,912
on Emmit's alibi witness.

229
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,213
Oh.

230
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,586
Heck, I think I might finally
put this thing to bed.

231
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,616
What do we got?

232
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,753
Victim's a white male,
late fifties.

233
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,858
Wife found him in the kitchen.

234
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,397
Jesus.

235
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,038
Prints?

236
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,208
Yeah, we got a good
one on the fridge.

237
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,610
Moron got glue on his finger
and he wiped it on the door.

238
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,414
What's his name, again?

239
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,216
George.

240
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,286
His last name, asshat.

241
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,523
Stussy.

242
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,457
George Stussy.

243
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,962
Donny?

244
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,031
Yeah, Chief?

245
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,800
Come here,
so I don't have to yell.

246
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,007
I think he pooped.

247
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,109
Check with St. cloud,

248
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,078
see if they found prints
at their scene.

249
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,813
- That one was a stabbing.
- I know.

250
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,616
- Broken glass, right?
- Yeah.

251
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,120
This one's asphyxiation,
just like Burgle's dad.

252
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,258
I'm thinking he's
alternating his kills

253
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,059
to throw us off the scent.

254
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,494
- Who?
- Killer.

255
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,930
Killer, singular?

256
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,437
This guy must
really hate Stussys.

257
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,242
Chief, neighbor says
she saw a maroon Cadillac

258
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,911
hauling ass out of here right
before the wife got home.

259
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,546
- She get a plate number?
- You betcha.

260
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,647
About time.

261
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,140
<i>Mrs. Goldfarb?
Thanks again for coming in.</i>

262
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:26,344
I was very clear with
the other officer last time.

263
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,112
You realize memories fade.

264
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,380
Oh, you'll do great.

265
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,681
Why don't we talk
in my office?

266
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,055
So, like I said, I'm just
checking up on a few things.

267
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,724
We've had some
developments in the case.

268
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,059
And this is a murder?

269
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,461
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,963
Mr. Stussy's brother Raymond,
killed in his own home.

271
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:46,964
- Awful.
- Hmm.

272
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,368
If you don't mind me asking,

273
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,702
how did you end up
having dinner

274
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,637
with Mr. Feltz and
Mr. Stussy that night?

275
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,607
It was a... a mutual
friend introduced us.

276
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,043
And what was his name?

277
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,544
Buck Olander.

278
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,581
He's a banker. St. Cloud.

279
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,249
So,
this was a business dinner?

280
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,752
Well, I'm new in town
and Buck agreed

281
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,987
to introduce me
to some people.

282
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,055
New from where?

283
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,156
Does it matter?

284
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,560
St. Louis.

285
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,035
And you're aware what happened
to Mr. Feltz, subsequently?

286
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,337
His illness?

287
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,173
I heard.<i> Quel dommage.</i>

288
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,208
When it rains, it pours.

289
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,443
Sometimes it drizzles.

290
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,279
It's a saying.

291
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,682
When it rains, it pours.

292
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,752
Like a penny saved
is a penny earned.

293
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,057
In your statement you said

294
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,127
that Mr. Feltz and Mr. Stussy
arrived separately.

295
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,729
Yes, I think that's right.

296
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,963
Who was first?

297
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,131
Mr. Feltz.

298
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,734
And how soon after...

299
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,235
Um...

300
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,637
How soon after...

301
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,538
After...

302
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,441
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah.

303
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,076
Perp admitted.

304
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,311
Yep. Donny.

305
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,247
- What's up?
- Manhunt's over.

306
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,715
- There was a manhunt?
- Yeah.

307
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:14,251
For, like, 30 minutes.
Real exciting.

308
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:15,453
You were right
about this case,

309
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,054
it's a real twister.

310
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,622
- I'll let new Chief explain.
- My...

311
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,993
Did you tell her, Donny?

312
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,529
Well, I solved it.

313
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,331
Solved what?

314
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,999
Your murders.

315
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,302
The old-timer in Eden Valley
and then the dead PO.

316
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,137
Don't even.

317
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,306
I got the parking lot king
in holding, he confessed.

318
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,308
To both?

319
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,477
No, the...

320
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,644
We already established
there's proof

321
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,313
Maurice Lefay killed Ennis,

322
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,482
Ray's parolee, and now Emmit's
basically confirming

323
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,150
that the Ray
murder was tit for tat.

324
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:49,353
But we have two new murders,
here and St. cloud,

325
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,955
both surnamed Stussy,

326
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:53,357
both picture perfect doubles
of your earlier crimes.

327
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,925
Glass-in-the-neck bleed out,

328
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,660
my stiff with his nose
and mouth glued shut.

329
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,928
How about that?

330
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,463
And your theory is what?

331
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,932
A serial killer with two mos?

332
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,367
- How does...
- Good going, chief.

333
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,269
- How does that make sense?
- Just listen.

334
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,137
When we arrested
this piece of shit,

335
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,674
he had some mail in his trunk
from your stepdad's house.

336
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,777
Yeah, that's right.

337
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,548
And a framed photo of Ray
and his scofflaw girlfriend

338
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,350
from their domicile.

339
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,951
Also, the trunk,

340
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,053
full of broken glass,
blood, superglue.

341
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:24,555
Those are facts.

342
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,393
I got... hold on.
I got different facts.

343
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,128
Maurice Lefay's fingerprints...

344
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,663
he confessed.

345
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:36,033
My guy. In the car ride over.
All four murders.

346
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,701
- He...
- cried like a goddamned baby.

347
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,936
You should've seen it.

348
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,072
I mean...

349
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,642
Who the hell is this
out-of-the-blue guy even?

350
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:45,809
Donald Wu.

351
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,578
Served 22 years
beating a guy's skull in

352
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,146
with a tire iron.

353
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,181
Been out six months,
living under the highway.

354
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:52,983
Get this.

355
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:56,654
Said his mom's boyfriend,
named Stussy.

356
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,822
Used to diddle him in
his closet after lights out.

357
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,160
- Chief...
- Mmm-mmm.

358
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,228
No.

359
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,064
You said yourself,

360
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,567
the parking lot king's
got a two-witness alibi.

361
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,202
So what you're looking at here
is psychology.

362
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,438
He feels guilty,
all those years

363
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,707
fighting with his
loser brother...

364
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,877
Finally, guilt gets
to him, in he comes.

365
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,178
You believe it

366
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,379
'cause you got
a hard-on for the guy

367
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,614
and you wanna believe it.

368
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,950
Okay?

369
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,522
Cut him loose, deputy.
We got our man.

370
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,358
That's an order.

371
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,069
Is it gonna be much longer?

372
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,371
I gotta be downtown
in an hour.

373
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,715
No.

374
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,617
No. You can go.

375
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,828
Actually, just so I know,

376
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,564
how soon after Mr. Feltz
did Mr. Stussy arrive?

377
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:14,965
Five minutes, maybe.

378
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,235
In your statement
you said a half an hour.

379
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,771
Well, I'm sure
that's what it was then.

380
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,740
You know how
the memory can play tricks.

381
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,011
That's another saying.

382
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,683
Are you covering for him?

383
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,388
I'm gonna go.

384
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,624
If you have
any more questions,

385
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:41,725
let my lawyer know.

386
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:25,035
It's done.
They're letting him out.

387
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,307
Doyle'll drive you
to meet the swango,

388
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,742
I'm moving to stage five.

389
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,910
Loved you in
<i>death of a salesman.</i>

390
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,414
Hilarious.

391
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,992
I'm going to have some tea.
Would you like some tea?

392
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,794
No, thanks.

393
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,531
You know why I
chose this place?

394
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,866
Were you born here?

395
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,536
Don't be mean.
Am I being mean?

396
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,339
We could've used
a real grenade.

397
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,143
No, you're right.
My apologies.

398
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,780
It was the wildcat regional.

399
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,948
Third runner up, me and Ray.

400
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:47,951
That's why we're here.

401
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,455
That's a bridge tournament.

402
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,124
How quaint.

403
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,426
I've never understood this

404
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:59,163
repulsive affinity
of playing games.

405
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,532
Oh, bridge isn't a game.

406
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,402
58 octillion possible deals.

407
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,005
Then you got the human factor.

408
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,475
Symbiosis with your partner.

409
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,977
The cheats and tells
of your opponents.

410
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,045
Strategy.

411
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,448
That was my strength.

412
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,883
Yeah, I can tell.

413
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,421
You sure I can't tempt you?

414
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,058
It's my mother's recipe.

415
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,994
No? Well...

416
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,498
You got it?

417
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,767
Yes.

418
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,336
I have it,

419
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,707
but I'd like to offer you
something else instead.

420
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,910
A job.

421
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,118
Remind me what you do again.

422
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,454
I work for
a company called Narwal.

423
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,193
No, you don't.

424
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,229
You tell people you work for
a company called Narwal

425
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,097
'cause people look
past middle management.

426
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,367
But I know
a boss when I see one.

427
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,306
Very good.

428
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,442
You just added
a zero to your salary.

429
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,678
That's okay.

430
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,880
I already got a job.

431
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,716
Blackmailing you.

432
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:27,651
All right now.

433
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,052
And tell me.

434
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,923
How do you think
that's going to play out

435
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,292
from a strategist's
point of view?

436
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,097
Well,

437
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,865
there's a 60%
chance that briefcase

438
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,601
is full of your
dirty underwear.

439
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,670
And since I don't
see your associate,

440
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,772
I figure he's out there
somewhere watching us.

441
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,108
Maybe even with a rifle.

442
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,011
Go on.

443
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,016
And if I brought the books
and the hard drives with me,

444
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,085
you're gonna give
your man a signal

445
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,155
<i>and he's gonna take the shot.</i>

446
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,927
<i>And did you? Bring them?</i>

447
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,433
The problem is

448
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,470
this is a public place
with a lot of witnesses.

449
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,941
And you're a pretty
distinctive-looking guy.

450
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,010
Am I?

451
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,348
Look around.

452
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,669
Nice.

453
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,106
There, you see,

454
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,141
I'm guessing
the wildcat regional

455
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,376
was an amateur affair.

456
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,380
Semi-professional.

457
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,739
See, you got cocky.

458
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,376
Forgot to count
all the pieces on the board.

459
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:35,612
The cards I'm not showing.

460
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,216
So now it's just me and you.

461
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,219
And I want my money.

462
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,598
You just added another
two zeros to your salary.

463
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,869
What's in the briefcase?

464
00:33:58,871 --> 00:33:59,903
Where are my things?

465
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,140
Well, now, Willy loman,

466
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,374
I feel I ought to punish you

467
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,177
for not doing
what you were told.

468
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,545
So maybe I share
one of the hard drives

469
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,479
with the police.

470
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,484
You...

471
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,687
You can't win this game,
you do realize that?

472
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,322
I thought you
didn't play games.

473
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,690
I'm offering you a fortune,

474
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,260
you're asking for
a piggy bank,<i> pourquoi?</i>

475
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,397
Because I wanna hurt you.

476
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,233
Not be your pet.

477
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,838
I wanna look you in the face

478
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,640
and rip out
something you love.

479
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,279
I didn't kill him.

480
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,550
You do know that?
It was Emmit.

481
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,488
Wasn't Emmit who came for me
in the precinct.

482
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,958
Wasn't Emmit
who flipped that bus.

483
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,435
I didn't have any feeling
about you before,

484
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,771
but now I'm starting
to really dislike you.

485
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,975
Good.

486
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,649
I'll give you till tomorrow
to get my money.

487
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,319
You want me to stay?

488
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,499
Should I sit?

489
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,472
Got married
straight out of high school

490
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,375
to a guy I knew
since fifth grade summer camp.

491
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,511
Summer wedding.

492
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,280
Guests were mostly mosquitoes.

493
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,083
We had a baby boy,
then a toddler,

494
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,386
now a teen.

495
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,456
Last year,
my husband phones me at work,

496
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,325
tells me he's got
a boyfriend named Dale.

497
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,527
Says they're
moving in together.

498
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,461
Says he's sorry.

499
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,565
He loves me,
but not like that.

500
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,468
"What else is there?" I say.

501
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,473
You think
the world is something,

502
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,142
then it turns out
to be something else.

503
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,152
You're free to go.

504
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,220
What?

505
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,489
No, I'm...

506
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:09,726
I told you what happened,
what I did.

507
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,928
I want no special treatment
just 'cause I'm rich.

508
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,263
You treat me like
every other felon.

509
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:15,232
No, you're not getting it.

510
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,100
Somebody came,
just not who you thought.

511
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,936
What are you talking about?

512
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,705
Since you confessed,

513
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,074
two other fellas named Stussy
have been murdered.

514
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,777
The first with
the copycat approach

515
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,512
mimicking my stepdad.

516
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:33,049
The second made to look like
your brother's neck puncture.

517
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,552
Whoever it was, planted
evidence in both places

518
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,088
to make it look like all this
is the work of a serial killer

519
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,956
who hates people
surnamed Stussy.

520
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,627
Are you saying
that people are dead

521
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,128
because they've got my name?

522
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,097
Yes.

523
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,400
But the real beauty of it is

524
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,602
they gave us a suspect
and he confessed.

525
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,803
He...

526
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,272
confessed to all four murders.

527
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,541
Some three-time loser

528
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,277
who couldn't make it
in the modern world.

529
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,878
What must they've paid him?

530
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,047
Must've been
a heck of a price.

531
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,348
But it worked.

532
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,420
That confession, combined with
the evidence I mentioned,

533
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,322
means he goes to prison
the rest of his life

534
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,523
and you go home.

535
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,000
Who is he?

536
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,139
Who?

537
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,174
The master
pulling the strings.

538
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,777
That fella
I met in your office

539
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,145
who said he sold ladies shoes,

540
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,013
this is him, right?

541
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,415
His work.

542
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,521
I'm...

543
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,426
I'm...

544
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,498
I...

545
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,103
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,634
The problem is not that
there is evil in the world,

547
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:40,136
the problem is
that there is good.

548
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,140
Because otherwise,
who would care?

549
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,076
Reinforcements have arrived.

550
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,344
Whiskey or beer?

551
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,483
Well, you're not supposed to
drink during ovulation,

552
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,586
but at the same time,

553
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:30,987
if I have to look
that thing in the eye

554
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,155
sober one more time,

555
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,423
I may jump out a window,

556
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,525
so Moscow mule
and make it ornery.

557
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,496
Still punching the clock, huh?

558
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,565
With all the romance of two
lumberjacks chopping wood.

559
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,969
Thank god for k-y.

560
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:48,171
So when you called,
well, I can't say I was sorry.

561
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,643
One more.

562
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,812
To showing up
and fighting back.

563
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,247
Except...

564
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:02,118
It's over.
The good guys lost.

565
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,455
For the present, but we all
know Jesus wins in the end.

566
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:06,956
I'll drink to that.

567
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,197
You know, before you got here,

568
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,232
I was thinking, see Ennis,
my step-father,

569
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,234
he wrote these space books...

570
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,435
And I read one of 'em.

571
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,307
<i>The planet wyh</i> with
the "h" at the end.

572
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:28,711
And it was about this android,
I guess you call it, who...

573
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,848
His master died
and he wandered

574
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:34,384
the universe alone
for two million years.

575
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,419
- Jeez.
- Yeah. And...

576
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,722
And all he could
say was, "I can help."

577
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,661
But he couldn't,
or at least he never did.

578
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46,329
But he kept on saying it.
"I can help."

579
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,565
And he kept on failing.

580
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,735
Which is,
if I had to define it,

581
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,270
the way I feel most days.

582
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,105
Come on now.

583
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,340
And the other days,

584
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:59,676
if I'm being honest,
how I feel is...

585
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,513
Invisible. Or not invisible.

586
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:05,982
Unreal.

587
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,685
Does that make sense?

588
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,020
No, ma'am.

589
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,422
Well, there's the fact
that automatic doors

590
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:13,890
never open for me,

591
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:17,026
and the sensors on,
like, the...

592
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:19,095
The sink or the soap dispenser
never sense me.

593
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,431
And when I make a call,
no one can ever hear me.

594
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,536
So I got this theory,
in private,

595
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,340
that I don't actually exist.

596
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,150
Right.

597
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,059
I got a whole
speech I could make.

598
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,294
Oh, please don't.

599
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,665
Here's what I think you need.
Stand up.

600
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,835
- Why?
- I wanna show you somethin'.

601
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,576
What?

602
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,108
Okay?

603
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,683
Better get to the ladies
and clean yourself up

604
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:47,984
'cause we got some
heavy drinking to do

605
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,552
and I can't have
people thinking I forced you.

606
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,290
Thanks.

607
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,059
Yeah.

608
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,860
We got the bond
of the uniform.

609
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:00,863
Plus, I like you.

610
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,101
I like you, too.

611
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,057
Ugh!

612
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:28,991
Great.
