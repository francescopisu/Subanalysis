1
00:00:02,809 --> 00:00:04,625
Erstwhile on Fargo...

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,293
You going by
the autopsy later?

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,128
They glued
his nose and mouth shut.

4
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:10,848
Are we thinking cause of death
is somehow a cliffhanger?

5
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,466
Is that the box
you took from Ennis'?

6
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,385
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,970
So, you figure
this Thaddeus Mobley fella

8
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:18,322
had something to
do with the murder?

9
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:19,723
I should say so,

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,191
seeing as how Ennis Stussy

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,794
and this Thaddeus Mobley
are one and the same.

12
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,979
I know he wasn't
from around here.

13
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,981
It's kind of,
to be honest, a mystery.

14
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,150
Ennis moved to
Eden Valley in 1980.

15
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:31,702
But I think he may
have changed his name

16
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:32,986
before he moved here.

17
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:34,772
Did you ever hear
of Thaddeus Mobley

18
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,106
out of Los Angeles?

19
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:38,175
No, I'm afraid not.

20
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:08,822
Hi, uh, could I get a...

21
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:11,358
Joachim.

22
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:15,412
One cube.

23
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,282
And, uh, whatever
this big swinging dick

24
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,533
over here is drinking.

25
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:22,252
Oh, no, that's...
I just wanted a cream soda.

26
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:25,038
I'm not much of a drinker,
in point of fact.

27
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:25,906
Ah.

28
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:27,040
Well, maybe that's why

29
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:29,042
you are
the award-winning writer.

30
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:30,511
Saving some of
those brain cells

31
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:31,929
for the page.

32
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:33,213
How about a nice cream soda

33
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:35,799
for my new amigo
Thaddeus over here?

34
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,218
Do you prefer "Thaddeus",
or, uh...

35
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:40,020
Uh, Tad. Thanks.

36
00:01:40,106 --> 00:01:42,139
But how'd you know my name?

37
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,561
You are the cheddar, kid.
Get used to it.

38
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:49,029
Wait, the what?

39
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:51,732
You know, you're the cheddar.
The cheese.

40
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:53,901
Howard Zimmerman.

41
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:56,370
Producer.

42
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:57,871
Oh.

43
00:01:57,957 --> 00:01:59,156
So, let me ask you,

44
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,374
you ever think
about turning that...

45
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,075
That book of yours
into a movie?

46
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,746
"The Planet Wyh."

47
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:08,081
Bob Redford is the robot.

48
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:09,416
Hold the phone.

49
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:11,685
You're saying you wanna turn
my book into a movie?

50
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:13,053
Uh, no, bubeleh.

51
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,089
I'm saying I want you to
turn your book

52
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,425
into a major motion picture.

53
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,435
Colossal.

54
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:30,237
Mr. Zimmerman! Mr. Mobley!

55
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:34,074
Hold up the dingus
for me and say "UFO"!

56
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,226
Hey, kid.

57
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,360
Over here.

58
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,232
Ah.

59
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:20,404
You like?

60
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,124
Yeah.

61
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:28,579
Doll! Come back.
I want you to meet somebody.

62
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:44,845
Hi. I'm...

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,597
This is the genius
I was telling you about.

64
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:48,098
You're killing me, Howie.

65
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:49,433
Can we go eat already?

66
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,435
All right, sure.
Just give me a sec, sweetie.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,569
Sit down.

68
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:59,326
So, how's my screenplay
coming along?

69
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:01,111
Oh, um,

70
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,779
you know, it's...
It's pretty good, actually.

71
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,665
I just...
I thought I would be here

72
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,066
maybe a week or two, you know.

73
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:07,834
And the motel's
getting pretty expensive.

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,537
Relax, kid.
I got you covered, totally.

75
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,873
Just make sure you
keep all your receipts.

76
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,125
Mr. Beatty for you, sir.

77
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,377
Warren! Mi amigo, mi compadre.

78
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:19,212
Yeah. All right,
don't tell me. Let me guess.

79
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,099
You read it, you loved it.
Am I lying?

80
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,768
No, no, I know.
It's dynamite, isn't it?

81
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:27,638
They call it a "space opera,"
if you can believe that.

82
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:28,972
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

83
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:29,973
No, the kid is banging out
the screenplay

84
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:32,192
now as we speak.

85
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:34,945
So, listen,
is Yablans gonna let you out?

86
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:36,563
Oh, Christ.

87
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,249
No, no, no. I understand.
No, it's fine.

88
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:41,551
Next time, bubeleh,
next time, right?

89
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:42,619
For sure.

90
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,204
Right. Bye.

91
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,407
What happened?

92
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,110
Beatty's under contract
at Paramount.

93
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:52,212
Short of us
greasing a few palms,

94
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:54,548
so to speak,
he's not going anywhere.

95
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,833
You mean bribes?

96
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:58,502
Jesus, keep your
voice down, would you?

97
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,921
Look, it's just
tit for tat out here.

98
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:02,589
That's how business is done.

99
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:05,475
Now, look, you know
that I'm no Mother Teresa,

100
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:09,896
but after divorce number three,
this tit is pretty tapped out.

101
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,098
We're gonna have to find,

102
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:13,317
I don't know,
some other avenue.

103
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,068
Well, you know,
I do have a book advance.

104
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,003
How much money are
we talking about?

105
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:48,111
It makes the sex amazing.

106
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:56,530
Ah.

107
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,986
Minsky.

108
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:54,538
I can help.

109
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,658
I'm dying.

110
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:00,243
I need...

111
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:07,667
No.

112
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:10,971
It's too late for me.

113
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:14,090
You must find
a way to get word back.

114
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:18,845
Let them know,
it wasn't all...

115
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,348
for nothing.

116
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,852
I can help!

117
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:39,866
"Get word back,"
the Captain had told him.

118
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,585
But how?

119
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:45,338
Thus began the wander of
the Android Minsky.

120
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:48,041
He was a prototype,
singular in his design,

121
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:49,509
created to observe and record,

122
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,878
his programming
not yet complete.

123
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:53,546
A child, in other words.

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,932
Folks, we've begun

125
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:57,550
our descent to Los Angeles,

126
00:09:57,636 --> 00:09:59,886
where the current weather
is a beautiful 72 degrees.

127
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,232
Is that a typo?

128
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,884
Sorry?

129
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:17,153
The "why" is spelled wrong.

130
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:19,789
It's a kind of make-believe.

131
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:20,890
Oh.

132
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:22,993
Good?

133
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:26,579
Oh, there's a robot, I guess.

134
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,499
And he's wandering,
looking for, uh...

135
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:32,252
I'm not sure,
the meaning of life, I guess.

136
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:33,553
Oh.

137
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:36,423
That. Yeah.

138
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,393
I know how he feels.

139
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,180
This is my sixth flight
this week.

140
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:46,599
Isn't it Tuesday?

141
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:49,152
Yeah.

142
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:56,443
You know, in the beginning,
we swam, then we crawled,

143
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:02,532
then walked,
then ran, and now...

144
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,741
- Hi! Merry Christmas!
- Hi.

145
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:10,960
Are you here for
the convention of Santa Claus?

146
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,078
Why do you...

147
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:16,966
No. I'm not.

148
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,501
By the hour then, or...

149
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,170
- What?
- Nothing.

150
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,721
Um, single room, one night?

151
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,473
I'm not sure
how long I'll be here.

152
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,726
Uh, room 203. Very nice room.
Very nice.

153
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:29,429
It's got air conditioning.
You can smell the ocean.

154
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:30,730
There's a view?

155
00:13:30,816 --> 00:13:33,650
No. There's a smell.
At low tide.

156
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,169
Oh.

157
00:13:37,757 --> 00:13:38,889
What the heck?

158
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,341
Stop!

159
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,176
Stop!

160
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:07,503
Red Honda.
I got the plate number.

161
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:08,838
Yeah, that'll help.

162
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:11,174
So, what'd he look like,
the, uh, bag thief?

163
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,177
Kinda older white male, 5'9".

164
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,512
Uh, green pants.

165
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,399
Green, what do you...
Elf pants.

166
00:14:20,935 --> 00:14:22,852
They're having
a Santa conference.

167
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,322
Not sure why they chose here.

168
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,573
Any valuables in the bag?

169
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,325
Not really. Mostly flannel.

170
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,943
Think I'll get it back?

171
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,662
I wouldn't hold your breath.

172
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:37,533
Hey, while I got you,
I got some info I need run.

173
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,168
Oh, yeah, we don't do that.

174
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,754
Sorry, I should've clarified.
I'm law enforcement also,

175
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:43,539
up Minnesota.

176
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,707
Minnesota?

177
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,509
Exactly. Eden Valley.
I'm Chief.

178
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,961
Or I was Chief.
Or, no, I still am. Anyway...

179
00:14:49,047 --> 00:14:50,046
I thought in the spirit of

180
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,714
inter-collegial
understanding...

181
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,850
See, I'm in town
looking into a homicide,

182
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,803
and the victim spent some time
here, back in the '70s.

183
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,891
Right.
Okay, I'll tell you what.

184
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,361
The plate number checks out,
I'll come find you.

185
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,480
Maybe even
bring that suitcase.

186
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,122
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, sport.

187
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,157
How's your dad's place?

188
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:42,992
Uh, good.

189
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:44,961
Dale got me an Xbox.

190
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,546
Wow.

191
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:47,747
That was gonna be
your Christmas present.

192
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,665
I know. But he said sometimes

193
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:51,200
it's good to have
an everyday present.

194
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:53,186
Haven't heard that one.

195
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,221
I'll have to tell Santa
to take it off the list.

196
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:57,623
Mom, there's
no such thing as Santa.

197
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,592
There's not?
I can see about nine of 'em

198
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:00,977
from my window
right at this very...

199
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,395
Mom...

200
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,347
Eat your vegetables, okay?

201
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,731
Okay.

202
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,735
Where are you again?

203
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,687
I'm in Hollywood, California.
Trying to figure out

204
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,239
what happened to
your grandfather.

205
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,442
But he wasn't even really
my grandfather, they said.

206
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,444
Just married to
Grandma for a while.

207
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,197
Well, he was something
to somebody.

208
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:24,200
No games till your
homework's done, promise?

209
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,535
Promise.

210
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,253
Okay, then. Love you.

211
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,871
Put Donny on.

212
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,791
Okay. Bye, Mom.

213
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,263
Hey, Chief.

214
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:38,965
Town still there?

215
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,433
How do you mean?

216
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,785
Oh, Chief,
new chief's real angry.

217
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,887
Said you didn't
have permission to go.

218
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:47,056
Said county's not
gonna pay for the trip.

219
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,574
I never asked 'em to.

220
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,942
Well, he wants you
to come back.

221
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,162
Found the motel
from the photo.

222
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,147
Got a lead on this actress,
I think, Vivian Lord.

223
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,532
Her whereabouts.

224
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:58,568
Wow.

225
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,287
So, what do you want me
to tell the new chief?

226
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:03,906
Tell him I saw the ocean
and it was wet.

227
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:08,077
I don't know.

228
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,445
That all, hon?

229
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,731
Actually,
I'm looking for Vivian.

230
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,484
Hey! Viv!

231
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:51,042
- Ms. Lord?
- Mmm-hmm.

232
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:52,494
I'm Chief Burgle. Gloria.

233
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:53,995
With the Eden Valley Police,
up Minnesota.

234
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,380
Okay if I ask you
a few questions?

235
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:56,915
Never been to Minnesota.

236
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No, I know, it's not about...
This won't take long.

237
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:02,003
Did you know a fella,
Thaddeus Mobley, a writer?

238
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,305
Would've been about
35 or so years ago,

239
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:06,174
here in Los Angeles.

240
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:15,066
No, it's not a very
clear time for me.

241
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,518
Which?

242
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,436
The '70s.

243
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:20,739
But you knew him?

244
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:22,691
Uh.

245
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:25,243
He had this in his...

246
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:28,329
In a box, so I'm thinking you
must've known him pretty well.

247
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:29,864
Honey,

248
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,701
you know how many walls
I'm on in this town?

249
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,543
Uh...

250
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,511
Homicide's the thing,
with him the victim.

251
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,046
So, it matters.

252
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,383
Look, what's your name?

253
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:49,801
Gloria.

254
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:52,053
Gloria.

255
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:55,223
I'm 29 years sober.

256
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:56,725
- Long time.
- Mmm.

257
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,279
Before that, I wasn't.

258
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:06,735
So, even if I knew this guy,

259
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,237
it's basically nothing
but a dream.

260
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,043
Is there anyone else
I can talk to?

261
00:20:15,128 --> 00:20:16,077
I'm not a snitch.

262
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:17,712
No. That's not...

263
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:19,581
For information, I'm saying.

264
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,635
See, he was my stepdad.
Sort of, for a time.

265
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,887
And my son,
not that that matters...

266
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:29,758
A homicide is a homicide,
but still, the personal angle.

267
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:34,095
Hmm.

268
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:36,981
My order's up.

269
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,768
Sure. Well, I'm at
the Hollywood Premiere Motel.

270
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:41,770
If you change your mind,
give me a call.

271
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,139
Officer Hunt?

272
00:21:51,224 --> 00:21:53,591
- Oh, hey. Gloria, right?
- Yeah.

273
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:55,560
Yeah, pop a squat.

274
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,095
Can I get two beers?

275
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,563
- You want two beers?
- Um...

276
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:00,315
Think I'll just
have a diet pop.

277
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:03,318
"Diet pop."

278
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,153
You're... You're too much.

279
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:09,824
Hey, so after we talked,
I tried, uh...

280
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,643
I tried to friend you
on Facebook.

281
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:13,661
I don't use that.

282
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,664
Really?
You don't use Facebook?

283
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,584
You're kidding me. Everybody's
on Facebook. It's Facebook.

284
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,085
Could you stop
saying "Facebook"?

285
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,789
I got 352 friends.

286
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,841
Most of 'em I don't even know.

287
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:29,460
But... Oh, and this one time,
I met this chick,

288
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:32,013
- she was smoking hot.
- Mmm.

289
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:33,965
Then she turned out to be

290
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,018
a Nigerian man
who wanted money.

291
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:40,188
But, uh...

292
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:43,057
I live in a small town.

293
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:46,194
You gotta be
on Facebook, though.

294
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,695
You know, 'cause
it's like a small town.

295
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:48,863
Uh-huh.

296
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:50,281
Only online.

297
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,117
You know, so you check in,
you can post photos.

298
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:56,404
You know, connect? Right?
'Cause who has time for...

299
00:22:56,873 --> 00:22:58,206
Yeah.

300
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,992
I'll, uh, check that out.

301
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:02,994
Yeah!

302
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,213
Yeah.

303
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:11,085
So, did you find anything?

304
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:14,172
Huh?

305
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:16,975
About when I called before,

306
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:18,726
asked you to look up
that fella, Thaddeus Mobley,

307
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,511
lived here in the 1970s?

308
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:23,431
Right. Yes. No, of course.
Yeah, I... I checked on that.

309
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,016
Nothing came up.

310
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:28,937
So, he was, what?
Like, your dad?

311
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:30,822
Sorta.

312
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,776
You're a real chatterbox, huh?

313
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,661
I can't get a word
in edgewise with you.

314
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,329
Good thing you're so hot!

315
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:40,114
Charm police?

316
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,784
I got a major felon
right here.

317
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,752
I'm only teasing you, though.

318
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:46,871
You don't
got teasing in Minnesota?

319
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,008
I don't sound like that, do I?

320
00:23:51,962 --> 00:23:53,928
I mean, yeah.

321
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:57,715
Look, uh, I'm just...
I'm just kidding with you.

322
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:00,351
Can you relax?
Maybe have a beer.

323
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:02,186
Ugh.

324
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:04,055
I gotta go drop
the kids off at the pool.

325
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,441
- You got kids?
- I gotta take a shit.

326
00:24:23,793 --> 00:24:25,159
You again.

327
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:28,046
Six flights before Tuesday?

328
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:30,214
Right. What are the odds?

329
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,382
I never asked.

330
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,336
- Paul Marrane.
- Uh, Gloria Burgle.

331
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:36,471
Ah.

332
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:37,672
What do you do, Gloria?

333
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,173
I'm in law enforcement.

334
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:40,808
Oh.

335
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,510
- Like the police?
- Exactly.

336
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:44,512
I'm Chief in Eden Valley.
Or, was Chief.

337
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,330
We're being
swallowed by the county,

338
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:48,666
so hierarchy's
a little unclear at present.

339
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:49,734
Oh.

340
00:24:49,853 --> 00:24:51,319
Married or divorced?

341
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:52,687
I'm sorry?

342
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:54,355
Your finger.

343
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:57,525
You used to wear a ring.
Now you don't.

344
00:24:57,627 --> 00:24:59,944
Divorced. Or, not yet, but...

345
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,279
Anyway...

346
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,032
Uh.

347
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:07,201
Before he goes off to war,

348
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:12,040
a soldier gives his wife
a bill of divorce.

349
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:16,127
He says, "Dear,
this is your bill of divorce.

350
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:18,513
If I don't return
within 12 months,

351
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:22,133
it becomes effective
from this moment onward."

352
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:26,187
Meaning that, if he dies,

353
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,057
they've been divorced
the whole time he was gone.

354
00:25:29,142 --> 00:25:33,778
If he returns,
they were always married.

355
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:34,979
Huh.

356
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:36,981
That's like a...
Ah, what do you...

357
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,566
I'm my own grandpa.

358
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:43,154
Which means,
if you really think about it,

359
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:47,909
for the entire year,
she was married and divorced.

360
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:50,328
Well, we got a hearing
next month,

361
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:52,413
so, probably won't
have to wait that long.

362
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:53,714
Ah. Good.

363
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,249
All right, keep walking,
dipshit. This one's mine.

364
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:58,086
Uh, no. That's not...
We know each other.

365
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,754
All right.

366
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,506
Look, I'm just gonna cut
to the chase here, gorgeous.

367
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:03,224
Am I getting laid tonight
or what?

368
00:26:05,812 --> 00:26:07,728
What.

369
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:10,348
Cool. Thanks for the beer.

370
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:43,357
"From small
beginnings, big things arise,"

371
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,693
thought the Android Minsky.

372
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,663
"Energy became matter,
matter became life.

373
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:52,033
Bacteria to amoeba,
amoeba to amphibian,

374
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:54,869
amphibian to man.

375
00:27:54,954 --> 00:27:59,040
Living and dying in numbers
too large to calculate."

376
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:07,048
Orphaned and alone,

377
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:09,517
he traveled the Earth
as centuries passed.

378
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:13,104
Millennia.
A being in search of meaning.

379
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:23,231
Each century, he would have to
stop and recharge.

380
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:26,033
In those hours he was
vulnerable to attack.

381
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:28,119
Hold him still!

382
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:30,571
- I can help!
- Watch him.

383
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:34,659
I can help!

384
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:33,525
Hi.

385
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:37,529
I'm looking for information
on a writer.

386
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:39,248
He would've worked here
in the '70s.

387
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:41,199
- Union?
- Uh, pardon?

388
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:43,051
Was he in the union?

389
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:45,520
I don't know.
He wrote books mostly.

390
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:48,557
The Writer's Guild doesn't
represent book writers.

391
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,009
Well, that seems
like an oversight.

392
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:52,311
Name?

393
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:53,845
Uh, Gloria Burgle.

394
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:56,715
- His name is Gloria...
- No. Sorry. That's my name.

395
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,884
He was Thaddeus Mobley.

396
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:03,555
Wait here.

397
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:57,859
Howard, there's someone here
to see you.

398
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,324
Gladys?

399
00:31:12,426 --> 00:31:15,777
No, Mr. Zimmerman, it's...
I'm Gloria Burgle.

400
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,431
I'm sorry,
could you repeat that?

401
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:36,598
I'm a police officer.

402
00:31:40,195 --> 00:31:41,303
I had a few questions
for you about

403
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:43,872
a writer you worked with
back in 1975.

404
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:44,973
Thaddeus Mobley.

405
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:49,878
He wrote a script for you
called The Planet Wyh,

406
00:31:49,997 --> 00:31:52,297
a science fiction film?

407
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:55,717
And, well, he was the victim
of some malfeasance recently,

408
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:57,586
and I'm just trying
to connect the dots here.

409
00:31:57,671 --> 00:32:00,422
I know he was writing
a movie for you,

410
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,691
and then, I don't know,
something happened.

411
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:18,874
Do I know about...

412
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,769
And now?

413
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:34,099
Excuse me.

414
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:37,519
Uh, I'm... Does anybody else
visit Mr. Zimmerman?

415
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,571
He mentioned
a woman named Gladys.

416
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:41,022
- She died.
- Oh.

417
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:43,408
He's been here a long time,
since the accident.

418
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:44,943
Say more about that.

419
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:47,279
I don't know.
It's before my time.

420
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:48,663
But what I heard is

421
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:49,948
they thought he was
gonna be a vegetable,

422
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:56,254
he was messed up so bad.

423
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,539
Time for your bath.

424
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:15,082
Though his sensors
recorded the data,

425
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:18,785
the numbers had
become meaningless.

426
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:23,540
From his remove, he watched
civilizations rise and fall.

427
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:28,879
Hope became despair,
became hope, became despair.

428
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:34,267
From time to time,
the technology existed

429
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:36,520
to send word back
to his home world.

430
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:39,689
But by now, there was no one
left to respond.

431
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,274
I can help!

432
00:34:57,209 --> 00:35:01,795
And then,
one day, something happened.

433
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,886
I can help!

434
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,108
Hey.

435
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:49,726
You should've called, baby.
I got company.

436
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:50,944
You got any coke?

437
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,612
It's just, I got nothing.

438
00:35:52,698 --> 00:35:55,649
They're gonna kick me out of
the motel soon, and I just...

439
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:58,235
Thaddeus, my boy.

440
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,319
<i>How are you?</i>

441
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:02,489
Why is he here?

442
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:03,657
What... What are you...

443
00:36:03,742 --> 00:36:04,908
You're not gonna cry, are you?

444
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:06,576
What? No!

445
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:08,829
Of course he's not gonna cry.

446
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:11,832
Thaddeus is a big boy.
He's seen the world.

447
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,717
I want my money!

448
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:16,586
Well, certainly.
Of course you do.

449
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:19,006
And, by rights,
you should have it.

450
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:20,257
But I'm afraid

451
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:22,597
the rather unfortunate fact
of the matter is,

452
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:25,262
it's all gone.

453
00:36:25,347 --> 00:36:26,646
What... What?

454
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:27,898
Told you he's crying.

455
00:36:28,017 --> 00:36:29,683
I... I'm not crying.

456
00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:31,184
Listen to me. Bubee, relax.

457
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,353
I understand.
These are hard lessons.

458
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,604
But you know what?

459
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,656
You're gonna thank us one day.

460
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,525
Us? What... I...

461
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,193
- I thought we were...
- What?

462
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,613
In love?

463
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:46,333
I used you, asshole.
Don't you get it?

464
00:36:46,418 --> 00:36:48,668
Harsh. Too harsh, my love.

465
00:36:48,754 --> 00:36:50,120
Let the boy down easy.

466
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:52,706
Can't you see he has
a genuine fondness for you?

467
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:54,758
You know, just shut up.
I... I need to think.

468
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:57,794
What? You need it in Braille?

469
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,129
Nobody asked you to come here

470
00:36:59,214 --> 00:37:01,581
with your stupid face
and your sad eyes.

471
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:03,366
Love.

472
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:04,935
You're a piggy bank.

473
00:37:05,938 --> 00:37:07,220
You know what? Uh...

474
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:08,855
I think it's probably
best if you were to go.

475
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,524
I mean,
she's obviously quite upset.

476
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:12,192
Don't touch me!

477
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:15,312
Kid, relax.

478
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,863
Come on. It's fine.

479
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:19,132
I mean, you got played,
that's all.

480
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:20,233
You're young.

481
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:21,868
Believe me,
you're gonna get over it.

482
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:22,903
And you know what?
The truth of the matter is,

483
00:37:22,988 --> 00:37:24,738
we did you a favor.

484
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:26,873
It's a hard, hard world
out there.

485
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:29,292
You need to develop
a tougher shell, my friend.

486
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,378
Jesus, Howie.
Just get rid of him already.

487
00:37:32,297 --> 00:37:33,413
- No!
- Kid.

488
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:34,464
No.

489
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,799
- Kid.
- No.

490
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,717
No!

491
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,473
Everybody's got
a role to play.

492
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:47,010
Yours is to cough up
the cheddar and then screw.

493
00:37:48,263 --> 00:37:49,596
You understand?

494
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,231
I don't hear you.

495
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:52,315
Yes!

496
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:04,778
You see that?

497
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:07,280
Turns out he's reasonable.
He's really a nice kid.

498
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:13,870
Stop!

499
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,956
Ahh.

500
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,270
You're a bad person!

501
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:40,480
I never saw him again.

502
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:44,618
So, that was the accident.

503
00:38:44,703 --> 00:38:46,486
Zimmerman. You conned him.

504
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:52,325
Did he... Do you think
Zimmerman would have...

505
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:56,329
Maybe he wanted revenge
and he hired someone, or he...

506
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:02,969
No.

507
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:07,274
It's just a story.

508
00:39:10,212 --> 00:39:12,812
None of this has
anything to do with...

509
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:22,105
Okay.

510
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,832
He was right.

511
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:36,503
I am a bad person.

512
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,925
Yet he wasn't so good either.

513
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:55,248
Okay. Um...

514
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:10,347
Shit.

515
00:42:12,277 --> 00:42:13,810
Okay, folks, in a few minutes,

516
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:15,945
we'll be beginning our descent
into Minneapolis-Saint Paul

517
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:19,082
where the temperature
is a balmy 23 degrees.

518
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:47,944
Unit M-N-S-K-Y.

519
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:49,229
I can help!

520
00:42:49,314 --> 00:42:52,482
We, the Federation
of United Planets,

521
00:42:52,567 --> 00:42:55,318
want to honor you
for your service.

522
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:57,470
We downloaded
your data recorder

523
00:42:57,572 --> 00:42:59,773
and found that you
have been functional

524
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:03,810
for 2.38 million years.

525
00:43:03,912 --> 00:43:06,846
We believe this makes you
the oldest sentient being

526
00:43:06,948 --> 00:43:09,549
in the history
of the universe.

527
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,838
You have seen
the birth of planets,

528
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:17,307
the death of worlds.

529
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:19,426
You have ridden on
the tail of a comet,

530
00:43:19,561 --> 00:43:22,345
have journeyed to
the heart of the sun.

531
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,097
Your data will help us

532
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:28,067
decode the very
fabric of the universe.

533
00:43:28,854 --> 00:43:30,437
I can help!

534
00:43:30,572 --> 00:43:33,606
You have helped,
my metal friend.

535
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:36,609
But now your
service is complete.

536
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:41,080
It is time to
shut yourself down.

537
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:48,321
I can help!

538
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:46,396
Arby's?

539
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:47,680
Okay.

540
00:44:48,984 --> 00:44:51,150
You just appear every time
a person says Arby's?

541
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:52,852
Oh, are you guys
going for Arby's?

542
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:54,103
Maybe.

543
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,022
Hey, uh, Chief. Old Chief...

544
00:44:56,157 --> 00:44:57,524
You gotta stop
calling me that.

545
00:44:57,609 --> 00:44:59,742
Sorry. Just...
Got a call on the radio.

546
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:02,028
They've pulled some
prints from Ennis'.

547
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:03,363
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

548
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:06,266
Ran it through the...
What do you... Database?

549
00:45:06,368 --> 00:45:07,700
- Got a match.
- You don't say.

550
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:09,869
Yeah. Maurice LeFay.

551
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:11,538
Now, that don't sound Russian,

552
00:45:11,623 --> 00:45:13,840
but I showed his photo
to Earl, and he was like,

553
00:45:13,925 --> 00:45:18,545
"Yeah, that's our man,"
so, out of, uh, St. Cloud.

554
00:45:19,514 --> 00:45:22,799
Well, now, what do you know.

555
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:25,218
We should maybe
drive up there after Arby's.

556
00:45:25,353 --> 00:45:26,853
Dead, apparently.

557
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:27,887
The... Who?

558
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:29,222
Suspect. LeFay.

559
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:30,690
Some kinda freak accident.

560
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:33,276
Air conditioner fell on him, just...

561
00:45:33,395 --> 00:45:35,528
Like a pancake.

562
00:45:35,614 --> 00:45:37,730
And him on parole for
some pretty nasty stuff, too.

563
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:38,865
Not in front of the boy.

564
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:41,284
- Mom, I'm old enough.
- Not even close.

565
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:43,236
An air conditioner, in winter?

566
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:44,821
That's what I thought.

567
00:45:45,874 --> 00:45:47,206
Well, if he's dead,
I don't suppose

568
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:48,741
he's going anywhere.

569
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:50,243
Probably we should
have a milkshake,

570
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:52,745
maybe some curly fries,
ponder all future moves.

571
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,799
We may solve this thing yet.
