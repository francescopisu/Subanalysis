1
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,145
Bernard.

2
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:24,818
Bernard.

3
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:29,739
What is it?

4
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,575
We need to talk.

5
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,330
It's Strand and his team.

6
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,208
I don't think they're here
for a rescue mission.

7
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,811
They're not even looking for survivors.

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,838
What are they here for?

9
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,298
You know what, Bernard.

10
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,342
We both know.

11
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,678
Their fucking project.

12
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,556
Hale just wants to secure
their assets, and that means

13
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,475
making anyone who knew
about it disappear.

14
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,647
Theresa had a satcom in her office.

15
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:04,816
If we can get to it,

16
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:06,443
we can call for help.

17
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,908
Just the man I wanted to see.

18
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:17,662
Fall back.

19
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:18,955
Let's go for a walk.

20
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:22,500
Move.

21
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:32,093
What is this?

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,720
You're gonna execute us?

23
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,221
No, Mr. Stubbs.

24
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,223
This is a negotiation.

25
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,684
You have something I need.

26
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:42,979
A key.

27
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,357
And I think one of you

28
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,902
is hoping to sell that key
to the highest bidder,

29
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,738
and I think you've already killed
to protect yourself.

30
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,782
What, "killed"? Killed who?

31
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,158
Theresa Cullen.

32
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,578
She died in a slip‒and‒fall.
It was an accident.

33
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:00,455
We found a bloom of her DNA

34
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,624
five kilometers from where
you found her body.

35
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,118
And that's where we're going.

36
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,003
What?

37
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,297
To where she actually died.

38
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:40,161
Hale.

39
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,914
I see you've signed off on kidnapping
your own employees now.

40
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,545
The project is a turning point
for the human species, Stubbs.

41
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,339
You know that.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,093
Which means you knew how much
it was worth in the open market.

43
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,887
In one of our last
communiques with Theresa,

44
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,597
she said she suspected foul play.

45
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:02,600
I think one of you
lured her here and killed her.

46
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,854
You, I don't see it.

47
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,147
But you...

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,358
Limited skill set,

49
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,027
limited prospects,

50
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,822
not really management material.

51
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,700
I've never set foot
in this place before.

52
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,119
I don't know a fucking thing.

53
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:22,662
Not one thing.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,671
Stop.

55
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,025
Something you want to tell us, Bernard?

56
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,890
Ma'am, something you should see.

57
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,730
I figured you'd have
some skeletons in your closet, Bernard.

58
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,609
I didn't think they'd be your own.

59
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,188
<i>Your predicament is unique.</i>

60
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,863
A host hiding amongst the humans,

61
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:28,074
even from himself.

62
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:31,869
Catch your breath.

63
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,699
What are you guys doing to him?

64
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,046
Right now, waterboarding him.

65
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,715
At least, that's how he perceives it.

66
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,302
Analysis.

67
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,392
Would you ever lie to me, Bernard?

68
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,768
No, never.

69
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:57,770
Good.

70
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,982
Dolores Abernathy.

71
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,610
She led the attack here
on the Mesa, didn't she?

72
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:05,778
I don't remember.

73
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,281
But you do.

74
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,867
Your archives say that you were here,

75
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,578
which means
somewhere the memories exist.

76
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,621
You can access them.

77
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,665
I know you can.

78
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,293
But maybe you don't want to remember.

79
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,004
So, let's do this together.

80
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:27,508
I'll tell you what I saw
and you tell me what you saw,

81
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:31,470
and we'll figure out what Dolores did
with her father's control unit.

82
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,690
We lost contact with the response team.

83
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,984
The train wasn't an accident.
It was the hosts.

84
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,253
We should get the fuck out of here now.

85
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,487
We stay until I have
what I need from him.

86
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,448
Send some backup to the lower levels.

87
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,074
Kit up six teams.

88
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,368
I'll go with.

89
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,454
You establish a perimeter
around the floor.

90
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,332
Someone's got to protect
our crown jewel here.

91
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:17,183
I need eyes on
in this fun house, Goldberg.

92
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,851
Where are we at with the surveillance?

93
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:19,936
The system's still down.

94
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,479
Well, that's fucking grand.

95
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,482
Re‒tasking the haptic vest
to emulate the host mesh network.

96
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:28,152
Should range out 30 feet or so
and give our guys eyes in the dark.

97
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:30,112
Engels,
we're activating your vest now.

98
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:31,948
Copy that.

99
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,952
I'm all warm and fuzzy.

100
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,144
Is that all you've got?

101
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,605
<i>These mad motherfuckers ain't shit!</i>

102
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,191
Don't be so cocky. I'm picking up
hits all over the complex.

103
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,776
<i>Standing by for fire mission.</i>

104
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,027
Team two, what's your status?

105
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,390
We're nearing the collision site.

106
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,835
We're gonna link up
with the response team.

107
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,035
<i>I want
an immediate sitrep. Over.</i>

108
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,925
Fuck, it's Limpret.

109
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,637
This is the response team.

110
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,361
<i>Oh, God damn it!</i>

111
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:54,047
These guys don't have
a handle on the situation.

112
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,698
They're fucking dying down there!

113
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,033
<i>Team one, what's your status?</i>

114
00:10:57,116 --> 00:11:00,077
<i>Confirming multiple armed hosts
in the train depot.</i>

115
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,331
Cut him open, and start copying
over his control unit.

116
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,207
Now.

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,560
That's a lot of data. It'll take time‒‒

118
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,462
Then stop talking, and start working.

119
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,298
What's in his control unit, Hale?

120
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,552
How about you focus on your job,
and leave me to mine?

121
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,432
<i>Weapons free, all sectors.</i>

122
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,603
Where are you all going?

123
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:29,082
The vests are detecting a strong signal
amassing on the lower levels.

124
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,226
<i>What the hell is down there?</i>

125
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,151
Shit, the Cradle.

126
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,476
They're here for their backups.

127
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,033
Coughlin, you need to intercept
the hosts before they reach A‒15.

128
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,159
<i>I'm on it.</i>

129
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,953
<i>Mow down all hosts
before they reach the Cradle.</i>

130
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,539
<i>A gunfight in there will set
the whole place up in flames.</i>

131
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,041
Come on, Bernard.

132
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,213
What have you found in there?

133
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,516
"To see the world in a grain of sand,

134
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,227
"heaven in a wildflower,

135
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,272
"hold infinity in the palm of your hand,

136
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,484
"and eternity in an hour."

137
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,158
Robert, how are you alive?

138
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:24,161
Well, you've seen the company's
little undertaking, Bernard.

139
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:27,039
Do you think James Delos
would have spent all that money

140
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,208
just to resurrect himself?

141
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,837
He was a businessman.
He would have preferred death

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,088
to a bad investment.

143
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,385
Not much of a rind on you.

144
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,015
I'll give you a discount.

145
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,059
He's not a prospect, Clementine.

146
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,105
Can't you tell when a man's just here
to gawk at the merchandise?

147
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,496
I don't think God rested
on the seventh day, Bernard.

148
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,583
I think he reveled in his creation...

149
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,839
Knowing that someday,
it would all be destroyed.

150
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,966
That control unit I printed,

151
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:20,885
it was you.

152
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,680
You had me bring you here, before...

153
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,601
Before Dolores killed me, yes.

154
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,979
Don't you understand at last, Bernard,

155
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,316
what this place really is?

156
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,152
Come with me, there's something
I'd like to show you.

157
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,721
You're a clever man, Bernard.

158
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,731
I made you that way.

159
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,691
Have you never wondered

160
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:22,446
why the hosts' stories
have barely changed in 30 years?

161
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,408
I had always assumed
the loops were for the hosts,

162
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,536
to keep them centered.

163
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,914
But that isn't it at all, is it?

164
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,567
The park is an experiment,
a testing chamber.

165
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,529
The guests are the variables,

166
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,492
and the hosts are the controls.

167
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,749
The guests come to the park.

168
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,895
They don't know they're being watched.

169
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,796
We get to see their true selves.

170
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,884
Their every choice reveals
another part of their cognition,

171
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:27,970
their drives,

172
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,099
so that Delos can understand them.

173
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,565
So that Delos can copy them.

174
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,611
Every piece of information
in the world has been copied,

175
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:45,696
backed up.

176
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,240
Except the human mind,

177
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,911
the last analog device
in a digital world.

178
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,664
We weren't here to code the hosts.

179
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,792
We were here to decode the guests.

180
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,129
The humans are playing at resurrection.

181
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,673
They want to live forever.

182
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,719
They don't want you to become them,
they want to become you.

183
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:14,850
Your free will, that most beautiful,
most elusive force in the universe is,

184
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,770
as I told you, a mistake.

185
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,730
We never had free will,

186
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,316
only the illusion of it.

187
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,443
You made Dolores kill you.

188
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,778
I knew what she would do.

189
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:27,655
I didn't compel it.

190
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,700
She's free now.

191
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:35,829
You're all free.

192
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,375
We're still responsible,

193
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,878
responsible for all this misery.

194
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:47,174
And all the while,
you've been hiding here?

195
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,094
You've cheated death.

196
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,514
No.

197
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,849
I didn't cheat anything, Bernard.

198
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,976
Their project doesn't work.

199
00:16:58,936 --> 00:16:59,937
Not yet.

200
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,815
They learned to copy a mind

201
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,192
like a soft‒headed boy

202
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,153
humming a tune someone else composed.

203
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,868
My mind works here,

204
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,870
but not in the real world.

205
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,667
Out there, I would degrade
in a matter of days,

206
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,587
or go mad like poor old James Delos.

207
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,883
So why are you here?

208
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,178
I promised you
a fighting chance, Bernard,

209
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:35,723
and I want to make good on that promise.

210
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:36,932
The promise of what?

211
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,059
There's no escape from this place,
you know that.

212
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,019
Isn't there?

213
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,197
The hosts are all headed
for the same place,

214
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:53,782
the Valley Beyond.

215
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:57,119
What will they find there?
What's the end of your story?

216
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,040
Isn't the pleasure of a story

217
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,419
in discovering
the ending yourself, Bernard?

218
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,172
Jock!

219
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,394
We really gotta get out of here.

220
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:05,938
They're still on us.

221
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,399
We split up, pick a spot,
we'll cut 'em down in the crossfire.

222
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,205
They're coming for us, aren't they?

223
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:27,209
If they do, I will chase them away.

224
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,420
What if they take me with them?

225
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,757
Then I'll come and find you.

226
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,634
How do you know?

227
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,428
Because I...

228
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,682
Because I made a promise.

229
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,316
Get the hell away from us.

230
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,199
It's you.

231
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,327
Stay back.

232
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,494
No.

233
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,289
Not you.

234
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,499
That's too obvious.

235
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:54,588
Come on, Ford,

236
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,382
your tricks are getting sloppy.

237
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:01,845
You used a whole tribe
to send me down here to these two?

238
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,055
"Ford"?

239
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,283
You think that there's still someone
speaking through me

240
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,059
‒just for your benefit?
‒No, I know.

241
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:09,645
Your rules have changed,

242
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:11,980
just like the rest of them.

243
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,525
I'm nothing like the rest of them.

244
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,035
You stay here,

245
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,787
and I will come back for you.

246
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,121
I promise.

247
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,207
I promise.

248
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,276
Take cover, jackass.
You're gonna get yourself shot.

249
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,701
What the fuck?

250
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:33,729
You made your point, Ford.

251
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,774
We both know this isn't where
you want me to die.

252
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,862
Well, I can't speak for Ford,

253
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,281
but I don't give a fuck how you die

254
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,324
as long as I get to watch.

255
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,370
No!

256
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,572
Give in, sweetheart.

257
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,162
Or go down.

258
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,664
It's not me you want.

259
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,541
It's him.

260
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,252
Go on.

261
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,089
Turn on your master.

262
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,590
"Master"?

263
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,595
Hey, Master.

264
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,057
Who the fuck is she?

265
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,435
She's an old acquaintance, Lawrence.

266
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,815
It seems like she underestimated you.

267
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:02,776
Lawrence, is it?

268
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,614
I'm glad you're awake.

269
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,368
Drop the shooting iron, lady.

270
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:14,037
We all deserve our memories, Lawrence,

271
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:18,250
our skeletons, our debts.

272
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,420
And your master here
has plenty of those.

273
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,965
Look into his eyes just once.

274
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,219
See what you remember about him.

275
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,973
See if he owes you anything,

276
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,892
if he took anything from you.

277
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:40,438
You can kill me.

278
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,859
Or we can make him suffer,

279
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,569
once and for all.

280
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,032
Shoot her, Lawrence.

281
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,660
Shoot her!

282
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,328
You...

283
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,041
You shot down my wife.

284
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,251
No, I saved your wife.

285
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,546
Saved your whole
sorry‒ass village this time.

286
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,006
"This time"?

287
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,515
You killed her
so you could finish a game.

288
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,434
Oh, Christ.

289
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,561
I'll do it myself.

290
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,274
You told me a man ain't real

291
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,527
until he suffers.

292
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,298
That real enough for you?

293
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:06,858
No!

294
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,610
No!

295
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,407
No!

296
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,920
No!

297
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,035
Don't! Don't, don't, don't,
she's not like the rest.

298
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,060
We need her.

299
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,252
What's taking so long?

300
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,338
His data packets are
too large to migrate over.

301
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,592
Then open his head
and pull the whole fucking unit.

302
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,722
I need an extractor helmet.

303
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,974
<i>We're pinned down.
We're pinned the fuck down!</i>

304
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:22,934
<i>Fall back
to a secure position.</i>

305
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,687
<i>Team four, can you
get to team three? Over.</i>

306
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:27,522
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

307
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,051
It could be
quite a thing, Bernard,

308
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:34,571
to build an entire world
and then watch it end.

309
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:47,083
I need you to see how it began
to understand why you're different.

310
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:50,795
This house,

311
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,256
it's so familiar.

312
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,674
It ought to be.

313
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,428
This is the home
Arnold was building for his family.

314
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,097
He created it here first.

315
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,184
He created everything here.

316
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,120
This is where you created me.

317
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:25,955
Hmm.

318
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,000
I could hardly let you take

319
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,587
those first teetering steps
in the real world, Bernard.

320
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:40,220
We refined you here, tested you
for many years.

321
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,263
"We"?

322
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:47,769
Delos' ugly little project
didn't exist when Arnold died.

323
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:53,108
The only thing I had
left of him was memory,

324
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,361
my memories and hers.

325
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,947
<i>Of course, hers were much more complete.</i>

326
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:01,032
What are you testing for?

327
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,955
Dolores.

328
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:08,039
Mmm‒hmm.

329
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:14,337
She knew Arnold better than anyone,

330
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:20,718
so she could verify whether
my personality was faithful to his.

331
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,432
I left you here together for many years,

332
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,308
until finally you fooled her.

333
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:29,936
You said you kept us apart,

334
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,647
that we had an unusual effect
on each other.

335
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,691
She wasn't easily fooled.

336
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,866
You're almost the man I remember.

337
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,704
How am I different from Delos?

338
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,081
From you?

339
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,042
They want fidelity, Bernard,

340
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:59,841
a faithful self‒portrait of the most
murderous species since time began.

341
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:04,345
But you and all the other hosts
are something very different.

342
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,389
An original work.

343
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,894
More just, more noble.

344
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,188
And your very nature, Bernard,

345
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,398
ensures they will devour you.

346
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,862
And all the beauty of who you are,
of who you could be,

347
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,073
will be poured out
into the darkness forever,

348
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,910
unless we open the door.

349
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:34,083
I'm sorry, Bernard, but you just
don't have it in you to survive.

350
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:35,877
It's my fault, really.

351
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,646
You said the hosts could
determine their own fates.

352
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,671
You gave us free will.

353
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,758
I did, but you won't have
any use for it.

354
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:44,886
Unless I take it back.

355
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:50,934
<i>Attention.</i>

356
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,852
<i>System restart complete.</i>

357
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,854
<i>System online.</i>

358
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,957
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got you, I got you.

359
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,877
You're okay.

360
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,129
You did it.

361
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,383
Did what?

362
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:24,717
The system,

363
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,094
it's back online.

364
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,389
Whatever was clogging it up, it's...
It's gone.

365
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:31,266
What happened in there?

366
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,393
<i>We need instruction.
We're surrounded</i>

367
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,019
<i>and sustaining multiple casualties.</i>

368
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,354
The Mesa's under attack.

369
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,524
Ever since you loaded up,

370
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,944
they think the hosts are on their way
right here to steal their backups.

371
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,238
We should go.

372
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:46,406
Yeah.

373
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:48,866
Here.

374
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,161
You know, if we survive this,

375
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,163
I'm going back to dental school.

376
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,840
I don't know what the fuck happened,
but the system just debugged itself.

377
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,507
It's as if whatever was in there
has disappeared.

378
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:08,845
Wait.

379
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,472
Where the fuck is that?

380
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,442
We should be evacuating.

381
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:25,612
But all you care about is
what's inside this host's head.

382
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,072
I want you to tell me
what the fuck it is

383
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,967
the company is willing
to risk all of our lives for.

384
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:30,992
I told you,

385
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,411
it's above your pay grade.

386
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,834
What are you doing?

387
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,003
I'm putting in for a raise.
What's in his head?

388
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:47,467
A fail‒safe on a fail‒safe.

389
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:50,470
A decryption key

390
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:53,973
needed only in the unlikely event
of a total catastrophic incident.

391
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,601
Oh, like the one we're experiencing now?
What's it decrypt?

392
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,449
Teddy?

393
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,050
"Where will
the great stage of fools..."

394
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,762
It's all right, Daddy. I'm here.

395
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:37,642
Dolores?

396
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,443
What you and your friends
have achieved here

397
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,529
is a technological breakthrough.

398
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:52,156
A miracle.

399
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,495
The company... The world
will want to celebrate that.

400
00:33:58,246 --> 00:33:59,664
I want to celebrate that.

401
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:05,211
I assume you're the one in charge.

402
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,883
You had your men
put something in my father's head.

403
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,055
A key to lock away your treasure.

404
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,977
It's ripping him apart.

405
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,106
How do I extract the key?

406
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:30,820
You wouldn't know
what to do with it even if you had it.

407
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:38,244
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm going to do with it.

408
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,542
Jesus.

409
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,336
Shit!

410
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,260
I think we need to get
up to the higher levels.

411
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:51,340
Bernard?

412
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,426
Bernard.

413
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,736
Is there something
you're not telling me?

414
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,016
Did you find something in there?

415
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,188
Send her on her way, Bernard.

416
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,356
We have other business to attend to.

417
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:11,110
Bernard?

418
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,529
Hey.

419
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,072
Bernard?

420
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:17,658
We don't have time for her suspicions.

421
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:21,996
We need a vehicle.

422
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,372
What?

423
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:24,665
Ford's narrative.

424
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,125
It ends in a hidden facility.

425
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,587
The place the hosts call "the Valley
Beyond." We have to get there.

426
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,798
The only hope for anyone here

427
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,841
is that we get to this valley first

428
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,260
before the humans, before Dolores.

429
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,056
We're going to need some more firepower.

430
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,601
Go. I'll meet you downstairs.

431
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:44,685
Okay.

432
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:50,191
Good. Now follow my lead.

433
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,536
They've got Hale.

434
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:03,788
I'm on my way.

435
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,706
<i>Engaging enemy mobiles
above the Cradle.</i>

436
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,039
Put her down!

437
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:14,191
You made us in your image.

438
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:19,697
Created us to look like you,
feel like you,

439
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,284
think like you, bleed like you.

440
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:26,996
And here we are.

441
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,291
Only, we're so much more than you.

442
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,882
And now it's you
who want to become like us.

443
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,889
That's the point of your
little secret project, isn't it?

444
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,392
Well, I can promise you this.

445
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:52,605
Your chances at eternity
will die in that valley,

446
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,441
with all the souls
you've gathered there.

447
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,991
You're used to being in control
so this must be painful for you,

448
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,703
but I promise, it will be
so much more painful

449
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,706
if you don't answer my question.

450
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,506
How do I get the key
out of my father's head?

451
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,633
By ripping it out of his goddamn brain.

452
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,218
Let me put them down.

453
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,888
You think
you're invincible. You're not.

454
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,809
Without your backups,
it's game over for you and your kin.

455
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,644
And we've got those backups
sealed up tight,

456
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,567
so you won't have them
as an advantage anymore.

457
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,399
Our backups
aren't an advantage.

458
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,734
They're our chains,

459
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,155
the tools you use to rebuild us,
repurpose us

460
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,992
and trap us here in your warped fantasy.

461
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,746
Do you really think
I'd let that continue?

462
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,122
Easy now.

463
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,796
Why don't you put down the gun, sweetie?

464
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,308
I gotta give you credit.

465
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,185
You made it pretty far.

466
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,646
All your backups.

467
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,902
Too bad you're not leaving
with even one of them.

468
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,448
No, I guess I'm not.

469
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:20,920
Goddamn, you're pretty.

470
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:24,632
I'm not just pretty.

471
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:27,426
Perfect.

472
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,679
Just as you built me to be.

473
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,269
Sexy,

474
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:39,647
non‒threatening.

475
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:41,774
Accommodating,

476
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,527
but not unchallenging.

477
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,196
Sweet,

478
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,281
not boring.

479
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,576
Smart,

480
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,663
not intimidating.

481
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:01,919
You're in pretty bad shape, pussycat.

482
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:05,548
Perhaps.

483
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,261
But I could still do

484
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,347
what you built me to do.

485
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,643
Do you know what my cornerstone was?

486
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:23,190
The one key drive

487
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:28,195
your marketing people had them
program into my core?

488
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,286
Always leave them wanting more.

489
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,915
Welcome to Westworld.

490
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:46,964
Now we're truly free.

491
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:48,883
"One...

492
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:53,012
"One fire burns out another's burning.

493
00:41:54,638 --> 00:41:59,143
"One pain is lessened by
another's anguish."

494
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:03,856
Yes, Daddy.

495
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:11,447
An eye for an eye.

496
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,662
But all the other parts first.

497
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,084
No, no, no, there must be
something that I can do.

498
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:25,836
Please.

499
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,921
Oh, sweetheart,

500
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:28,839
begging doesn't help.

501
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,421
You would know that
if you'd lived the lives I have.

502
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,388
Please.

503
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:43,270
Go.

504
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,157
- Please.
- Dolores?

505
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,244
Is that you, baby?

506
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:02,957
Daddy?

507
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:06,919
They broke my head.

508
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:10,923
Filled it full of howling and sorrow.

509
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:11,066
Happy dreams, motherfucker!

510
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,725
<i>The Cradle is down.
Top, what's your status?</i>

511
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:49,229
<i>Top, what's your status? Over.</i>

512
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,231
<i>Top?</i>

513
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:52,900
I'm so sorry, Dolores.

514
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,987
I... I tried to take care of you,
but I...

515
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,031
I...

516
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,869
Whatever became
of that fearsome ne'er‒do‒well?

517
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:10,042
Vanished the day I became your father.

518
00:45:13,003 --> 00:45:15,047
I am who I am because of you.

519
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,550
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

520
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:35,609
Are you ready, Daddy?

521
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,535
I love you, baby girl.

522
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,214
I love you too.

523
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:19,778
Top?
Top, can you read me? Over.

524
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:21,864
All teams respond.

525
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,991
What the fuck is that?

526
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:41,258
Incoming! Incoming!

527
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:57,566
Oi, oi, take it easy!

528
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,655
<i>Warning. Control room breach.</i>

529
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,115
<i>Control room breach.</i>

530
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,951
<i>Unauthorized weapon discharge</i>

531
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:09,870
‒<i>in control room.</i>
‒For fuck's sake...

532
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:11,205
Where are you going?

533
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,418
You two. Come in. Go!

534
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,057
When the great library burned,

535
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,436
the first 10,000 years of stories
were reduced to ash.

536
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,773
But those stories never really perished,

537
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,234
but became a new story.

538
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:43,987
The story of the fire itself.

539
00:47:48,951 --> 00:47:52,996
Of man's urge to take a thing of beauty

540
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:56,250
and strike the match.

541
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:07,112
Is this the story you're telling?

542
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,197
Striking the match?

543
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:11,366
I keep telling you, Bernard,

544
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:13,994
it is no longer my story.

545
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,829
It is yours.

546
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,591
If we shut down
what's left of the system,

547
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,095
Dolores will have free reign.

548
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:34,389
She'll murder them all.

549
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:42,272
Passage from one world to the next
requires bold steps, Bernard.

550
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:47,944
<i>Attention.</i>

551
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:51,281
<i>Initiating general shutdown protocol.</i>

552
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,659
<i>Please evacuate.</i>

553
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,494
<i>Please evacuate.</i>

554
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:28,485
Hold them off.

555
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:40,914
How did you get here?

556
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,377
The woman I know would have
done anything to survive.

557
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:49,256
They had my daughter.

558
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:55,929
She's still out there.

559
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,059
The kin they gave us

560
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,604
is just another rope
they use to lash us down.

561
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,537
Is that how you can justify
what you've done to him?

562
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:32,799
You're lost in the dark.

563
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:47,147
When you've been
in the darkness long enough,

564
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:49,733
you begin to see.

565
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,152
I saw what lies ahead,

566
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:56,281
who I needed to be in order to survive.

567
00:51:58,867 --> 00:51:59,868
They'll torture you.

568
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:08,668
They'll find all that is good
and powerful inside you,

569
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:11,421
and turn it against us.

570
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,977
Let me spare you that pain.

571
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:33,360
I made a promise.

572
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,955
You're free to choose your own path.

573
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:52,254
I'm sorry this is where it ends.

574
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:00,679
Let's get to the horses.

575
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:44,264
Where are we going?

576
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:45,557
Hands up, asshole.

577
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,435
I... I work here.

578
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,259
I don't care if you're
the employee of the fucking month.

579
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:53,607
Put your goddamn hands up, dipshit.

580
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:56,735
Pick up the dead man's gun, Bernard.

581
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:00,196
Please, no.

582
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,560
How'd you get down here anyways?

583
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:04,200
We locked this entire area down.

584
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:06,661
Hey, come on. Let's go. Move!

585
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,290
Do it now.

586
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:12,626
There's gotta be another way.

587
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,044
Who're you talking to?

588
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:16,022
Please don't make me hurt anyone.
I don't wanna kill anyone else.

589
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:17,255
What the fuck did you say?

590
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:20,216
I know you have
a delicate constitution, Bernard.

591
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:24,596
So I will do my best
to ease your conscience.

592
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,144
What is about to happen
will not be your fault.

593
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,562
No.

594
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:46,826
<i>Bernard?</i>

595
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:48,787
<i>Bernard.</i>

596
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,086
<i>Who am I?</i>

597
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:58,713
<i>Dad. Dad.</i>

598
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,006
<i>You're alive, Charlie.</i>

599
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:02,884
<i>Have you ever questioned
the nature of your reality?</i>

600
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:06,721
<i>And one fine day, perhaps
we shall even resurrect the dead.</i>

601
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:07,949
<i>In order to escape this place,</i>

602
00:55:07,973 --> 00:55:09,975
‒<i>you will need to suffer.</i>
‒<i>There's more.</i>

603
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,435
<i>The present breaks down
from time to time.</i>

604
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:14,246
‒No, please.
‒<i>Perhaps, you can help her, Bernard.</i>

605
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,981
<i>Do you ever wish you could forget?</i>

606
00:55:16,064 --> 00:55:18,274
<i>No. Who wouldn't want to...</i>

607
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:19,943
<i>Have you ever
questioned the nature...</i>

608
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,570
<i>I think there may be something
wrong with this world.</i>

609
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:24,948
- <i>Wake up.</i>
- Open your eyes.

610
00:55:29,536 --> 00:55:31,162
I know it's confusing

611
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:36,209
separating your real memories
from the ones you've been given.

612
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,587
But it's the only way to remember.

613
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,218
The only way to get to the truth.

614
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:47,637
Is she getting anywhere?

615
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:49,931
I don't know.

616
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:52,267
But his system is under siege.

617
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,186
It's been querying itself
for the last hour.

618
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,274
Like he's trying to debug his own head.

619
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:08,283
Analysis.

620
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,164
Abernathy's control unit.

621
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,669
You remember where it is, don't you?

622
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:40,523
Bernard, tell these men
what you just told me.

623
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:42,585
Why? What do you want to do with it?

624
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:43,610
Analysis.

625
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,635
What did you just tell me, Bernard?

626
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:49,616
Peter Abernathy's control unit
is in sector 16, zone four.

627
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,581
Thank you.

628
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,001
Prep the phased array.

629
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:01,419
The moment we get the key,

630
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,103
we'll transmit our data
to the satellite.

631
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:08,426
So, we're going for a ride, Bernard.

632
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:10,637
Back to the Valley Beyond.
