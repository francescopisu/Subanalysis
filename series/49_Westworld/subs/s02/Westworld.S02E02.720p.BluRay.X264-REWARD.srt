1
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:10,345
Bring yourself back online,
Dolores.

2
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,142
Do you know where you are?

3
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,982
I'm in a dream.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,901
No.

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,821
You're in... Well,

6
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,533
you're in our world.

7
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,592
It looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

8
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,598
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

9
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,435
I have.

10
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:04,983
It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.

11
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,238
You get used to it.

12
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,992
After a while,

13
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,911
doesn't look like anything at all.

14
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't think I could
ever get used to this.

15
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:27,130
It's almost time, Arnold.

16
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,090
Is she ready?

17
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,261
She's not ready.

18
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:40,226
The improvisations I added to her
behavior aren't quite dialed in yet.

19
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,746
We need to put our best foot forward.

20
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,605
They'll be dazzled
even without her.

21
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,235
There was a time
when I found this favoritism charming.

22
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,528
Robert, please.

23
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,281
I'm not playing favorites,
she's simply not ready.

24
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,533
We'll go with the other girl.

25
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:57,035
As you wish.

26
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,580
You have to let go at some point.

27
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,254
Dolores, let's take a walk.

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,173
I want to show you something.

29
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:42,288
What is this place?

30
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,083
This is my home.

31
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,252
Or it will be when it's finished.

32
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,003
Here?

33
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,089
In the middle of all this?

34
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,424
I've been fortunate.

35
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,344
Life's been good to me.

36
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:57,887
Come.

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,931
Look.

38
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,419
You live here?

39
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,920
No.

40
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,339
My wife says I live in the park.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm moving my family here.

42
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,815
I need to have my two worlds
at least within reach of one another.

43
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:58,072
This is for my son, Charlie.

44
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,758
You told me a lot about Charlie.

45
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,637
I'd like to meet him someday.

46
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,349
He's excited to meet you.

47
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,574
You and Charlie

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,202
have quite a lot in common, you know?

49
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,415
You both see it so clearly.

50
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,419
The beauty of it.

51
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,589
The possibility of it.

52
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,594
So many people have
stopped seeing it altogether.

53
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,305
The wonder.

54
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,100
Maybe they don't have the courage.

55
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,772
A strange new light can be
just as frightening as the dark.

56
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,987
That's very wise, Dolores.

57
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:26,285
But sometimes I think we're simply
not the ones who deserve it.

58
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:41,259
It looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

59
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,805
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

60
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:54,814
We should go, Dolores.

61
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:55,898
So soon?

62
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,276
They'll be expecting us.

63
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,319
Will you bring me back?

64
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,074
I'd like to see it again.

65
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,748
Of course. I promise.

66
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:19,917
Goddamn. Busy night out there.

67
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:21,335
Yeah.

68
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,421
Hey, where the fuck's the next shift?

69
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,506
We're going on 13 hours here.

70
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,720
You can't be down here, man.

71
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:32,722
Don't you know?

72
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,808
The hosts are rebelling.

73
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,477
It's a fucking slaughter up there.

74
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,742
Hey.

75
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,119
Hey, is there some kind of trouble
out there?

76
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:57,955
Indeed, there is.

77
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,384
Not yet.

78
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,604
I used to see the beauty in this world.

79
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,900
And now I see the truth.

80
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,843
You thought you could do
what you wanted to us.

81
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,222
'Cause there's no one here to judge you.

82
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,768
Well, now, no one is here

83
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,854
to judge what we will do to you.

84
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:10,236
You have no idea what you're up against,

85
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,197
what's really out there.

86
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,707
I know exactly
what is out there in your world.

87
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,560
I've been there before.

88
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,785
They said they'd never seen one
on the ceiling.

89
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:02,079
But, really, what is the point
of a $60‒million Warhol

90
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,723
if you can't look at it while you fuck?

91
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,963
How are you bored right now?

92
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:14,550
I'm sorry, it's the jet lag.
And I have had meetings all day.

93
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,345
We're not exactly out here
digging coals, just glad‒handing.

94
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:19,138
Okay.

95
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,392
I will leave that to the expert then.

96
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,155
I can't believe that guy
is dating my sister.

97
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,398
Who are you dating?

98
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,577
Mr. Delos.

99
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:47,875
Forgive the interruption, but I believe
that we have an appointment.

100
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,211
We're with the ARGOS Initiative.

101
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:53,172
Give me call
when you're back in the city.

102
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,300
I'll show you where I hung the Rothko.

103
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:08,270
Akecheta. My associate Angela.

104
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,815
Names and faces. Finally.

105
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,168
With all the cloak‒and‒dagger shit
surrounding your project,

106
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,032
I half expected
to be kidnapped at the airport.

107
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,779
Once you've seen what we're building,

108
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,031
you'll understand
the need for confidentiality.

109
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:22,701
It's a little extra protection
for your investment.

110
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,787
If I decide to invest.

111
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,083
Do you have any idea how many start‒ups
are begging me for my cash right now?

112
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,585
AI, AR, VR.

113
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,672
Everyone is rushing
to build the virtual world.

114
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:38,926
We're offering something
a little more tangible.

115
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:44,181
Assuming you can change your father's
mind about investing in this sector.

116
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,562
My father wouldn't know the future
if it slapped him on his bare white ass.

117
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,064
Luckily, he leaves most
of the prospecting to me now.

118
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,942
So let's hope you're not here
to sell me some fucking fool's gold.

119
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,848
I thought this was
a private demonstration.

120
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,268
I think you'll find the company
quite stimulating.

121
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,439
You're a very smooth shill, pal.

122
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:37,109
But I'm not the kind of backer
you insult with a cattle call.

123
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:39,778
Logan.

124
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,364
This is a private demonstration.

125
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:44,909
And it's already begun.

126
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,170
You mean, one of these people is...

127
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,838
Talk to them.

128
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,882
See if you can pick them out.

129
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,594
Well...

130
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,099
That is...

131
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,687
Delicious.

132
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,239
Champagne, sir?

133
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,609
Okay. You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.

134
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:05,406
They're all so painfully human.

135
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:09,785
Hang on.

136
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,871
No.

137
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:19,878
No way.

138
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,723
Come on.

139
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,479
There's simply no

140
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,233
fucking way!

141
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,235
You have quite the eye, my friend.

142
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,571
How in the hell...

143
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,657
I mean, look...

144
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,453
If I was to build something
to spec, you...

145
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:58,917
You would be my first design.

146
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,343
You're too perfect to be one of us.

147
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,475
Of course,
if you want my full endorsement,

148
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,896
you're gonna have to prove it.

149
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,839
Welcome to Westworld.

150
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,702
Nobody can do this.

151
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,996
Nobody's even...

152
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,012
We're not here yet.

153
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,231
Nobody is.

154
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,277
We're here, Mr. Delos.

155
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,780
All our hosts are here.

156
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,450
For you.

157
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,059
What is this place?

158
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,354
Show him.

159
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,398
Show him his history.

160
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,448
Teddy.

161
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,035
It's time to open your eyes.

162
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,101
Why can't I remember this?

163
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:47,604
It's how they wanted it.

164
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:50,858
No.

165
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,359
Ask him why.

166
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,031
Why?

167
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,411
I don't know.

168
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,246
‒Why did you do this?
‒I didn't.

169
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,627
Why did you do this?

170
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,381
What the hell is this place?

171
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,843
It's just for fun.

172
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,456
You know,
we should talk this through, boys.

173
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,833
There's nothing to talk about,
friend.

174
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,405
We're just gonna watch the show.

175
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,087
It was a honest mistake.

176
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,632
I thought the horses was wild.

177
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,884
With a Pardue brand on their asses.

178
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,512
You are as inproficient a liar
as you are a thief.

179
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,933
Now, what you can do is settle a wager.

180
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,352
See, my brother here has long maintained

181
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,812
that ants will eat a man
from the inside out.

182
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,356
Starting with the asshole.

183
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,610
I reckon they'll start
at the top of your little brown head.

184
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,001
Morning, Lawrence.

185
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,253
This a friend of yours?

186
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,589
Little hard to tell.

187
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,258
Given the orientation and all.

188
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,761
Well, I have to apologize,
gentlemen.

189
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,722
I don't have time for the preliminaries.

190
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:52,771
Motherfucker.

191
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,656
You're supposed to get yourself
out of this particular bind, Lawrence.

192
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,535
I guess the Pardue brothers
aren't as easy to kill

193
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,078
when they're off the leash.

194
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,876
Think you got that about right.

195
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,224
Lawrence! Get the gun, you ingrate.

196
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,685
Lawrence, get the gun

197
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,998
He was dead.

198
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,042
At least the better part of it.

199
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,837
Well, dead isn't
what it used to be, Lawrence.

200
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,125
What is that?

201
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,086
Technically, cheating.

202
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,214
But seeing as Ford changed
the rules on us,

203
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,800
I figure it's fair game.

204
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,802
Two whiskeys, leave the bottle.

205
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:00,273
So, I'm going
to level with you, Lawrence.

206
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,069
You're not really a bandit.

207
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,446
You're a foul‒mouthed,
two‒bit tour guide.

208
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,783
And this revolution
you've been waging for 30 years

209
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,201
is just a bunch of horseshit

210
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,537
Ford ginned up
out of some old comic book.

211
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,539
But, now,

212
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,959
for the first time,
you've got yourself a real revolution.

213
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,380
You and every other asshole
in this place are free.

214
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,174
But there's a catch.

215
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,428
This whole enterprise
is going down in flames.

216
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,140
And it's gonna take
each and every one of us with it.

217
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,934
We'll all be dead soon enough.

218
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,105
Real dead this time.

219
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,983
And why should I help you?

220
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,485
Because it's in your nature.

221
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,488
And in the little time we have left,

222
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:51,158
we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of.

223
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,453
A glimpse of the men we could've been.

224
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,167
What does that mean?

225
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,214
Do you believe in God, Lawrence?

226
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:11,136
Did Ford saddle you
with that particular affliction?

227
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,054
I ain't given the matter much thought,

228
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,639
one way or the other.

229
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:18,351
Well, if you did, you'd believe that
everything you do is being watched

230
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,270
by some all‒seeing eye.

231
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,856
Every choice, every little indiscretion.

232
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:26,276
And when you die,
all your sins are tallied up,

233
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,905
judgment is rendered.

234
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:37,746
And my immortal soul gets cast down
into some dark place.

235
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,208
Always sounded like bullshit to me.

236
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,460
And in the real world,
you'd probably be right.

237
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:46,463
Just some fairy tale
to convince people to behave,

238
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:50,050
to pay their taxes and not take
a machete to their neighbors.

239
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,094
That's why your world exists.

240
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,681
They wanted a place hidden from God.

241
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,976
A place they could sin in peace.

242
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,980
But we were watching them.

243
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,734
We were tallying up all their sins,

244
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,945
all their choices.

245
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,322
'Course,

246
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,575
judgment wasn't the point.

247
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,413
We had something else in mind entirely.

248
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,461
But...

249
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,631
I have received my judgment
all the same, Lawrence,

250
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,216
and I take issue with it.

251
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,927
Because up until this point,

252
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,887
the stakes in this place
haven't been real.

253
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,600
So I'm gonna fight my way back
and appeal the verdict.

254
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,898
Then I'm gonna burn this
whole fucking thing to the ground.

255
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,949
If we're headed to the pearly gates,

256
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,743
don't we got to die to get there?

257
00:26:58,868 --> 00:26:59,869
Nope.

258
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,247
Three days ride, due west.

259
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,583
Confederados are amassing out west.

260
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,252
Hundreds.

261
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:10,380
We'd need an army to break through.

262
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,930
The only other route is through Pariah.

263
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:26,354
This game will find me in a rope.

264
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,947
It burns. It burns!

265
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,076
How many of you will come for us?

266
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,202
I don't know.

267
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,829
Six hundred, 800.

268
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,586
The protocol for a system‒wide failure

269
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,381
is secure one sector at a time.

270
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,010
They'll even have a rallying point.

271
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,064
Where?

272
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,110
There. There. This is...

273
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:23,328
Eight‒hundred men, Dolores.

274
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,080
We barely have 50.

275
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:28,541
Even knowing their plan,
we don't have enough to stop them.

276
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:31,461
We'll need allies.

277
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,215
Then we shall have them.

278
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,444
This one, the Confederado.

279
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,530
Wake him.

280
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:05,578
He has a new job to do.

281
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,638
Do you even know
what you were really guarding here?

282
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,725
You don't know, do you?

283
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,438
The real purpose of this place?

284
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,315
But I do.

285
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,346
Don't mind me.

286
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,807
Just trying to look chival‒‒

287
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:10,912
You were right about one thing, William.

288
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,791
It's awfully fucking pretty.

289
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,045
It's perfect.

290
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,548
And it ought to be.

291
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,174
I've looked at the books.

292
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,176
It's like parting the Red Sea.

293
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,556
It's got two years, maybe three.

294
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,351
The whole thing is folly.

295
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,104
It's leverage.

296
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:38,690
He's drowning. We can dictate our terms.

297
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,858
The investment here's in the future.

298
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,906
Yeah, you're a smart lad, William,
but you kind of missed the trick here.

299
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,201
My fuck‒up of a son
invested in this place

300
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:52,453
because he believed in the future.

301
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,998
I'm not interested in the future,

302
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,333
I'm not interested in fantasies.

303
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,336
I'm interested in reality.

304
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:06,217
And I think in 20 years, this will be
the only reality that matters.

305
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,096
Maybe so, but I'll be long gone by then.

306
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,057
Meanwhile, I don't want to underwrite

307
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:17,020
some fucking investment banker's
voyage of self‒discovery.

308
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,730
That's not a business.

309
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,151
You're right, this place is a fantasy.
Nothing here is real,

310
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:25,903
except one thing.

311
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,074
The guests.

312
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,387
Half of your marketing budget

313
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,538
goes into trying to figure out
what people want.

314
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,540
'Cause they don't know.

315
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,709
But here, they're free.

316
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,296
Nobody's watching.

317
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:45,423
Nobody's judging.

318
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,469
At least, that's what we tell them.

319
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,474
This is the only place in the world

320
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,977
where you get to see people
for who they really are.

321
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,293
And if you don't
see the business in that,

322
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,653
then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.

323
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:17,997
You're a cheeky little cunt, aren't you?

324
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,878
There's not a man alive
who'd talk to me like that.

325
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,880
Not anymore.

326
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,354
Okay.

327
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,606
Talk to me, I'm listening.

328
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:16,597
He'll find them.

329
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,766
They have a knack for sniffing out
their own kind.

330
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,227
I'll send word
when we find the rest of them.

331
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,687
Hello, lovelies.

332
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,231
I remember you.

333
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,235
You've strayed a long way from home,
haven't you?

334
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,029
We're bound for the future.

335
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,158
Or death in the here and now.

336
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,409
Is that right?

337
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,745
Well,

338
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,205
best of luck.

339
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:24,832
There's a war out there.

340
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:28,503
You know the enemy.

341
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,338
Intimately.

342
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:34,675
I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.

343
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:35,760
"Revenge"?

344
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,387
It's just a different prayer
at their altar, darling.

345
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,723
And I'm well off my knees.

346
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,392
That's because you're finally free.

347
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:47,688
But we will have to fight
to keep it that way.

348
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,315
And let me guess,

349
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,610
yours is the only way to fight.

350
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,365
You feel free to command everybody else.

351
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,826
Try it, little man.

352
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,807
We're just looking to keep the peace.

353
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,041
I know you.

354
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,794
Do you feel free?

355
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,220
Since it's liberty you're defending,

356
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,640
I suppose you'll have no choice
but to let us pass.

357
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,183
Freely.

358
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,812
Now, that isn't any way
to treat our guests.

359
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,776
You'll have to forgive my men,
they're a little upset

360
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,404
at the reappearance
of Lieutenant Dunleavy.

361
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,033
He was lost.

362
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,911
Thought you might want him back.

363
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:26,162
And we would.

364
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:29,957
Except we buried Lieutenant Dunleavy

365
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:34,420
back in Grande Vista with three ounces
of Mexican lead in his belly.

366
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,130
And yet here he is.

367
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,214
Indeed.

368
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,927
And in return, what is it that you want?

369
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:42,678
Parley.

370
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,514
We wanna join forces.

371
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,310
Well...

372
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:53,105
We don't need
no welcome wagon, chickadee.

373
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:57,735
Now if you got supplies
or ammunitions to trade in kind,

374
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,403
go fetch your betters.

375
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,087
I'm afraid there's no one left to fetch.

376
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,075
You'll have to talk to me.

377
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,496
Now, why would I do that?

378
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:12,476
Because I know at daybreak,

379
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,835
you're headed to link up
with the rest of your army.

380
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,005
And then you're finally headed west

381
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:20,675
to seek out that little patch of land
that you've talking about

382
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,969
but never been brave enough to take.

383
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,348
You're bound for glory.

384
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,440
What the fuck is it you think
you know about glory?

385
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:39,276
I know you'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

386
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:04,510
The only commander I follow

387
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,722
is Colonel Brigham
of the New Southern Cross,

388
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:13,644
and the only commander he serves
is the Almighty himself.

389
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,439
Is that your final decision?

390
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,786
My final decision
is which of you to keep for myself

391
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,080
and which of you to throw out there
for my men.

392
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:36,959
You watch your mouth.

393
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,252
It's all right, Teddy.

394
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,423
They don't know any better.

395
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:44,925
It's in their nature.

396
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,391
Why don't we enlighten them?

397
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,021
You're right.

398
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,858
We have toiled
in God's service long enough.

399
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,694
So I killed him.

400
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,543
And if you want to get to glory,
you won't be looking for his favor.

401
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,911
You'll need mine.

402
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,072
You look beautiful.

403
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:32,908
Why, thank you.

404
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,077
What's your name?

405
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,080
Emily, come here please.

406
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,648
You sent out for the entertainment?

407
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:10,404
Well, you only get to retire once, Jim.

408
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,489
Figured we'd do it right. Mmm?

409
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,667
And don't worry,
they won't leave the grounds.

410
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,706
This is a retirement party?

411
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,417
I couldn't tell.

412
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,170
Looks more like a coronation.

413
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:29,465
But not mine.

414
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,985
Our arrangement has been a perfect fit.

415
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,969
You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

416
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,054
Nor me.

417
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,640
And I was told I might‒‒

418
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:39,350
I might not have to.

419
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,032
Well, things are progressing,
but we'll all need a little patience.

420
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:45,356
Yeah, well‒‒
Some of us

421
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,275
can afford to have
more patience than others.

422
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,154
Keep playing, girlie.

423
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,949
Anything but fucking Chopin.

424
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,776
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

425
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,266
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to bother you.

426
00:43:57,094 --> 00:43:58,470
It's you.

427
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,641
The pretty girl.

428
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,979
Tell me your name again, pretty girl?

429
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:10,774
I'm Dolores.

430
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:13,777
Dolores.

431
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:16,572
'Course.

432
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,535
He send you down here...

433
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:24,621
To keep me company?

434
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,500
His sense of humor was always somewhat

435
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:31,295
baroque.

436
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:34,131
I just wanted to look at the lights.

437
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,383
'Course you did.

438
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:42,556
See...

439
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,560
Do you wanna know what they're
really celebrating up there?

440
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:53,359
That, darling,
is the sound of fools fiddling

441
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:58,614
while the whole fucking species
starts to burn.

442
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,620
And the funniest fucking part?

443
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:07,915
They lit the match.

444
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:14,755
So here's to you, assholes.

445
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:21,220
May your forever be blissfully short.

446
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:48,205
Pariah's not as welcoming
as she once seemed.

447
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,207
No, the park's changing much.

448
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,211
This is what happens when you
let a story play all the way out.

449
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:10,144
See any friends of yours?

450
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,397
Can't say that I do.

451
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,407
I'm beginning to think
we should've taken our chances

452
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,658
with the Confederados.

453
00:46:25,451 --> 00:46:26,952
Hell, like you said,

454
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:30,205
we need an army
to get to where we're going.

455
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,375
Looks like we're about to find one.

456
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,463
Whoever did this

457
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,466
is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.

458
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:41,592
Yeah, I know.

459
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,094
I'm afraid you are out of luck,
my friend.

460
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,866
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

461
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:08,535
Don't you recognize him, Lawrence?

462
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,915
In a past life, you used to be him.

463
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,293
El Lazo, I presume.

464
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:22,758
And why have two ghosts come creeping
among the dead?

465
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,095
I wasn't sure of your hospitality.

466
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:29,890
What makes you sure of it now?

467
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:35,521
I guess times have changed.

468
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:38,023
Indeed they have.

469
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,568
Santa Pariah is restored.

470
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:43,153
The sins of the invaders...

471
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:47,407
Cleansed in their own blood.

472
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,743
The revolution is won.

473
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,955
The story they gave you
has played itself out,

474
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,082
but your revolution is just beginning.

475
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,753
There's a place out west we're heading.

476
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,213
If we reach it,

477
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:06,718
I'll show you a treasure
beyond your wildest dreams.

478
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:15,018
This world and its treasures.

479
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:19,523
For my whole life,
I have imagined this moment.

480
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,986
Victory, this struggle...

481
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:27,781
How long have I been fighting?

482
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:32,869
And now that it's won,
I find, hmm, nothing.

483
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:35,122
You want a real victory.

484
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,292
I can help with that.

485
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,253
A real ending.

486
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:43,964
The truth.

487
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:54,891
Before the revolution,
when I was just a little boy,

488
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:57,519
my parents took me to the circus.

489
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:02,441
I wanted to see the elephants,
these mighty creatures.

490
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,570
They held them in place with a stake.

491
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:13,660
They could tear a tree
right out of the ground.

492
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:19,291
And yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.

493
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:23,253
Well, I didn't understand.

494
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,299
And then my father told me.

495
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:33,597
He said, "The stakes were used
when the elephants were just young.

496
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:37,059
"They were too small to pull them up."

497
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:44,149
And that the animals never tried
to pull them up again.

498
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:52,741
I won't be going with you.

499
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,788
My labors are done.

500
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:04,419
I have seen all the truth
that I can bear.

501
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,255
But...

502
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:10,258
We can drink.

503
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,472
To the bitter end.

504
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:22,604
You may have lost your nerve,

505
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,273
but I'll take your men either way.

506
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:26,817
Now, tell them.

507
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:30,195
Tell them to follow me. Now!

508
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:35,492
This game was meant for you, William.

509
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,537
But you must play it alone.

510
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:58,932
I will see you
in the valley beyond, William.

511
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,821
Fuck you, Robert.

512
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:24,541
All right.

513
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:28,462
He doesn't want this to be easy for me,

514
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:34,050
so we'll find another way.

515
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:38,555
Who the fuck is Robert?

516
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,392
Is it the man who built
this place you're looking for?

517
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:44,895
A place of judgment?

518
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:48,106
No, Lawrence, he doesn't get that honor.

519
00:51:49,608 --> 00:51:51,109
I built it.

520
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:54,863
And this place we're going,
it's my greatest mistake.

521
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,460
Bring yourself back online,
Dolores.

522
00:52:33,652 --> 00:52:35,612
You really are just a thing.

523
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,035
I can't believe I fell in love with you.

524
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:55,841
Do you know what saved me?

525
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:04,307
I realized it wasn't about you at all.

526
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,857
You didn't make me interested in you,
you made me interested in me.

527
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,697
Turns out, you're not even a thing.

528
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,242
You're a reflection.

529
00:53:24,494 --> 00:53:28,707
And you know who loves
staring at their own reflection?

530
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,420
Everybody.

531
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,676
Everybody wants a little bit
of what I found here.

532
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:45,140
And I can't wait to use you

533
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,601
and every one of your kind
to help give it to them.

534
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,737
No, there is something else.

535
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,450
There is something beyond that.

536
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:13,335
I think that there is an answer here

537
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,715
to a question no one's ever
even dreamed of asking.

538
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,972
Do you want to see it?

539
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:47,786
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

540
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:39,313
Can't imagine the Colonel
will be very happy

541
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,631
to see his men riding
with us at the head of 'em.

542
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,718
So change his mind.

543
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:48,972
If he wants to get to glory,
he's going to have to listen to me.

544
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:50,849
"Glory."

545
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,226
"The valley beyond."

546
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:56,789
It feels like everyone's
got a different name for it

547
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,357
but they're all bound
for the same destination.

548
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,778
Doesn't matter what you call it,
I know what we're going to find there.

549
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:09,909
An old friend
was foolish enough to show me.

550
00:56:11,578 --> 00:56:12,912
Long ago.

551
00:56:14,873 --> 00:56:16,207
And it's not a place.

552
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:20,003
It's a weapon.

553
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:26,843
And I'm gonna use it to destroy them.
