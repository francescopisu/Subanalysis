1
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,425
Maling, for you, sir.

2
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,429
Go ahead.

3
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,264
Dredging is almost at 50%.

4
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,548
I should have the rest of them
skimmed up by end of day.

5
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,520
We also started draining the valley.

6
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:25,814
You want all personal effects
or just skin and bones?

7
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:28,525
Everything, down to the last Stetson.

8
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,193
Fly the whole pile over.

9
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,028
We'll crack them open to see

10
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,298
if we can't reprogram these things
to behave by our rules again.

11
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,323
<i>Copy that.</i>

12
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,909
Sir, I have two teams out
looking for Abernathy.

13
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:40,245
Good.

14
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,872
When you find him,
bring him to me personally.

15
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,824
So what have we got?

16
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,075
It's not good.

17
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,036
We're pulling what we can
off the recovered host control units,

18
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,749
but what's really unsettling is
what's in about a third of them.

19
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,334
What's that?

20
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,503
Nothing.

21
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,796
They've been wiped?

22
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,923
More like they're virgin.

23
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,718
Like they never held data to begin with.

24
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,762
No user prints or anything.

25
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,931
And that's not the worst of it.

26
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,809
Have a look.

27
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,063
We put the fires out,

28
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,232
but there's nothing we can recover
from the Cradle.

29
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:53,443
The host backups
have all been destroyed.

30
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,654
So we've effectively lost a third
of our IP in a single sweep?

31
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,538
That's quite a story you gave them.

32
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,294
And one hell of an ending.

33
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,801
How did all these disparate threads
come together to create this nightmare?

34
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,639
If we figure that out,

35
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:25,683
we'll know how this story turns.

36
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:53,920
What the hell is that?

37
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,755
Looks like a dead man to me.

38
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,508
You know the old saying
about knives in gun fights?

39
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,184
Does the saying have a footnote
about fucking lassos, then?

40
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,811
All right, that's enough.

41
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,729
Lay down your sword.

42
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:14,983
Tell your associates to set us free.

43
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,485
We mean no harm.

44
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,828
See, darling?

45
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,955
Everything under control.

46
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,137
Beautiful way to watch the sunrise.

47
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:48,349
Glistening off the intestines
of the recently mutilated.

48
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,518
Oh, Jesus.

49
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,145
Ugh.

50
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,814
Judging by their weapons,

51
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,607
I'd say local police.

52
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,444
And given that he's got one now.

53
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,491
Captured by samurai copâ€’killers.

54
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:06,826
Fuck me.

55
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,621
Can't you say something to them?

56
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,083
I'm from Hong Kong, asshole.

57
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,670
This is just the tip
of Shogun World's prick,

58
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,714
an experience expressly designed

59
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,633
for the guests
who find Westworld too tame.

60
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,678
We based this park on Japan's Edo period

61
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,222
for true aficionado of artful gore.

62
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,396
This world will end badly.

63
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,482
I'll make sure your end is worse.

64
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,706
You understand them?

65
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,333
You all do.

66
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,043
Look, she's a madam.

67
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:00,379
Consciously fluent in dozens of
languages, including Japanese.

68
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:01,815
But you all have those comm skills

69
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,257
buried somewhere in your code.

70
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,600
Point is,

71
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,894
the fact that these psychos
didn't flip to English

72
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,604
as soon as I opened my mouth means

73
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,816
that the same malfunctioning shit show
that's playing out

74
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:21,651
in Westworld has found its way here.

75
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,321
It's also why your vocal voodoo
didn't work on them.

76
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,156
You spoke the wrong language.

77
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,046
This all feels
a little too familiar.

78
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,322
Butterfly?

79
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,365
A Mariposa.

80
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,037
I'll be damned.

81
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,622
It's us.

82
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,415
Yes, fine.

83
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,417
I may have cribbed a little bit
from Westworld.

84
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,088
Well, you try writing 300 stories
in three weeks.

85
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,856
We're human shields now?

86
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,650
Welcome to Shogun World.

87
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:19,578
Can you watch it?

88
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,343
Behind you!

89
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,469
Hell of a homecoming.

90
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,936
Sweetwater was never home
to begin with, Teddy.

91
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,148
You and I were born
long before this place even existed.

92
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,984
The place
I return to again and again.

93
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,362
No matter how far I strayed,

94
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,908
something always carried me back.

95
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,120
Something like that?

96
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,344
Looks like she's taken some hits
the past few days.

97
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,888
But who hasn't?

98
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,570
Make a thorough inspection,

99
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,989
from the engine to the last axle.

100
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,200
Fix what's broke.

101
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,202
Strip her for speed.

102
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,331
Teddy, with me.

103
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,937
What do we need the train for, Dolores?

104
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,064
They've taken my daddy,

105
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,360
so we're gonna get him back.

106
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,166
Well, it ain't doing any good
sitting in that bottle.

107
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,342
Sorry, Maeve.

108
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:27,094
Didn't get much sleep last night.

109
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,349
Sometimes...

110
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,185
Sometimes, they're real bad.

111
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:41,984
Clementine.

112
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,322
You're new.

113
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,574
Not much of a rind on you.

114
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,783
That's enough.

115
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,245
Rejoin the others.

116
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:02,963
It's like I told you, Teddy.

117
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,924
This place was never home.

118
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,136
Let's ride.

119
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,013
Some place I wanna see.

120
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,854
When I asked
for a civilized conversation,

121
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,564
I meant the quickest way out of here.

122
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,108
Not all this.

123
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,485
Just try and rein it in a bit, will you?

124
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,280
The narrative bones of this place
are just like Westworld.

125
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,617
Hospitality is foreplay to a new quest.

126
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,911
But in this world,
if you don't hear them out,

127
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,246
you've dishonored them.

128
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,997
Sometimes, homicidally so.

129
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,749
Fine, we'll listen.

130
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,584
But then we go and find my daughter.

131
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,171
And for the record,

132
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,591
it's not just the narrative bones
that are identical.

133
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,844
You've plagiarized our stories,

134
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,011
our identities.

135
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:36,306
It's not plagiarism.
It's supply and demand.

136
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,184
If you're asking can you trust Akane,

137
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:42,730
the real question is,
can you trust yourself?

138
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,606
You know who I don't trust?

139
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,108
Him.

140
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,362
Say the word,
and I'll skin him like a rabbit.

141
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,822
What's the matter with you?

142
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,537
He's not supposed to be here.

143
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,915
Who knows how seeing your own doppelbot
is gonna fuck with your cognition?

144
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,542
Heightened aggression and suspicion,

145
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,919
feedback loops, that.

146
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:10,132
Yet another reason to get out of here
tout de fucking suite.

147
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,643
Our quest, I presume.

148
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,186
I recognize this one.

149
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,938
It's called "Army of Blood."

150
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:45,310
Madam Akane, the new geisha,

151
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,354
has no choice but to give up Sakura.

152
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,831
That's not supposed to happen.

153
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,000
Looks like someone had a choice

154
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,334
after all.

155
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,621
Snow Lake is a cornerstone.

156
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,206
It also has an access point
back to the tunnels.

157
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,000
It's our way out.

158
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,003
So you're not so useless after all.

159
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,514
Did you have something to do with this?

160
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,210
Both of you, look.

161
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,184
Oi!

162
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,862
Shit! Ninjas!

163
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,114
Fucking hell.

164
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,069
We got three.
The rest vanished with Sakura.

165
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,946
This is insane.

166
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,990
Ninjas never show up in this story.

167
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,998
Oh, fuck.

168
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,844
The Shogun's army
never comes into town.

169
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,692
You three, with me.

170
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,938
I don't need to know the language

171
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,207
to know a fucking asshole of a man

172
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,566
when I see one.

173
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,882
You and I spent a lot of time here.

174
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,511
Watching the herd,

175
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,306
talking about making a life together.

176
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,935
Someday.

177
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,526
I guess I just wanted
to see it one last time.

178
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,699
What if someday was right now?

179
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,830
What are you talking about, Teddy?

180
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,042
There's a fight coming, Dolores.

181
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,597
And this could be one
that's gonna change us

182
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,506
in ways we can't even begin to predict.

183
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,551
And I'm still waking up to...

184
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,554
What I really am.

185
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,724
And if that means I'm free,
then we both are.

186
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,352
Free to walk away.

187
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,315
Now, you can't tell me that somewhere
out there, in all that beauty,

188
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,944
there isn't a spot for us.

189
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,540
Did I ever tell you about the year
we almost lost the herd?

190
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,960
Bluetongue.

191
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,256
Quarantined the cows that had it,

192
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:00,758
but it kept spreading all the same.

193
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,181
Daddy finally figured out that it
wasn't spreading from cow to cow.

194
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,142
It was the flies that carried it.

195
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,854
He worried over it all night.

196
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,773
How do you stop a sickness like that?

197
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:19,068
One with wings.

198
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:22,238
Say it was you.

199
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,869
What would you do, Teddy?

200
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,664
I'd give them shelter.

201
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:36,211
House the weakest in a barn,
out of the air, away from the flies,

202
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:38,922
until it passed.

203
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,179
You're a kind man.

204
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,394
Daddy burned them.

205
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,689
The weak, the infected.

206
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,443
Made a pyre that went on for days,
and it stank,

207
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,696
but the flies hate smoke.

208
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,951
The herd lived.

209
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,790
I'll think about what you said.

210
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,393
I'd like to take this moment to appeal
to your sense of survival.

211
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,395
If the Shogun is awake enough

212
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,939
to play fast and loose
with his ninjas and his army,

213
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:41,401
then the odds of us surviving here
have dropped to approximately fuckâ€’all.

214
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:44,487
But I say we ditch Akane
and make a run for Snow Lake.

215
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,240
Why should we all get killed
over a literal sex machine?

216
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,577
Present company excluded, of course.

217
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,037
That machine's name is Sakura.

218
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,831
You can't keep doing this to us,

219
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,500
giving us people to love
and then getting upset when we do.

220
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,085
But it's just fucking code.

221
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,336
You're wrong.

222
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,589
I'm coded to care about nobody
but myself,

223
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,942
and yet, here I am, willing to risk
my life for someone else.

224
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,260
Well, so much
for your soâ€’called daughter.

225
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,306
You want to go it alone, be my guest.

226
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:16,269
But mention my daughter one more time,
and I will snap you like a matchstick.

227
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:18,855
Like you did that ninja?

228
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,735
He took one look at you
and selfâ€’impaled.

229
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,112
How did you do that?

230
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,283
I don't know.

231
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,577
That was no voice command.

232
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,415
I think I'm finding a new voice.

233
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,544
Our transportation is ready.

234
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,223
God damn it.

235
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,685
What have they done to the place?

236
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,193
Is that...

237
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,029
The fucking cavalry.

238
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,449
Great.
So much for our rescuers.

239
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,349
I'm gonna take a fucking moment.

240
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,686
Don't stop on my account.

241
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,713
If you've quite finished...

242
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,884
It's time to sell this ruse.

243
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,072
How many of them are there?

244
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,284
Between the camp and the town, hundreds.

245
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:38,953
Literally hundreds.

246
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,748
So Maeve's gonna freeze
all those assholes,

247
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,471
and we're gonna make off
with that geisha?

248
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,543
We're gonna die.

249
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,008
Did you just make that up right now?

250
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:17,802
Damn convincing.

251
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:19,929
Not to the daimyos.

252
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:22,849
It's like they had no idea
what I was saying.

253
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:55,923
Shit.

254
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,550
That's cortical fluid.

255
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,760
The Shogun's not awake.

256
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:01,679
He's broken.

257
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,818
No fucking wonder
the daimyos didn't hear you.

258
00:37:57,902 --> 00:37:59,946
We've gone
completely off the rails here,

259
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:01,030
and this loon is driving

260
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,239
the fucking train.

261
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:06,655
The train will be ready by morning.

262
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,575
To go where?

263
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:11,827
Exactly where we thought.

264
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,125
I caught up with the men
who took your father.

265
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,180
I couldn't get him back,
but I got this one.

266
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:24,381
It took a while,
but he gave up their destination.

267
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,009
Tell them.

268
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:28,803
It's the Mesa.

269
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:30,888
We're going home, Teddy.

270
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,310
Load everything up on the train.
We leave at first light.

271
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,150
Let's find a spot for the night.

272
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:16,559
What you asked today,

273
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:18,435
about walking away,

274
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,063
making it on our own.

275
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:23,983
Would you want me to say yes

276
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,193
even if I was only going
to disappoint you?

277
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,003
I'm not some stranger, Dolores,

278
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:48,757
coming from outside,
looking for a pretty lie.

279
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:51,677
I've known you my whole life.

280
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:01,228
Where we go, we go eyes open,

281
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:04,982
together.

282
00:46:58,192 --> 00:46:59,234
You're right.

283
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,863
Some things are too precious to lose,

284
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:08,744
even to be free.

285
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,383
There's something I need to show you.

286
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,184
For days now,

287
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:36,355
I've been questioning my feelings
for you.

288
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,817
How much is real?

289
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,947
How much is just some story
I was made to believe?

290
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,590
But tonight, I know.

291
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:05,509
It was all true.

292
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:25,153
They built us to perform for them

293
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:27,322
and for each other.

294
00:48:28,615 --> 00:48:29,825
That's over.

295
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:33,036
I saw you tonight, Dolores.

296
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,332
And you saw me.

297
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:41,378
I did see you, Teddy.

298
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,596
These past few days,

299
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,099
I've seen you so clearly.

300
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:04,818
And I've seen you're not gonna make it.

301
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,116
What is this, Dolores?

302
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,330
This is what I don't want you to become.

303
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:21,543
There's a swarm descending.

304
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:24,963
Just like the Bluetongue
when I was a girl.

305
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,676
And if we're gonna survive,

306
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,930
some of us will have to burn.

307
00:49:58,664 --> 00:49:59,706
Hold him.

308
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:05,003
Dolores. Dolores.

309
00:50:06,088 --> 00:50:07,923
I wish there was another way, Teddy.

310
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,635
But where we're about to go,
it's no place for a man like you.

311
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:13,970
I'm so sorry.

312
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:15,847
You sure you want this?

313
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:18,266
Changes this extreme

314
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,810
without a full reset, it's...

315
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:22,729
I can't guarantee
that he'll hold together.

316
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:24,231
To grow,

317
00:50:25,357 --> 00:50:26,692
we all need to suffer.

318
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:34,457
<i>Arigato,</i> Maeve.

319
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,507
Jesus.

320
00:57:06,091 --> 00:57:07,342
What do we do now?

321
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,137
I told you I found a new voice.

322
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,099
Now we use it.
