00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,850
Charlie:
<i>Dad.</i>

4
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,430
<i>Dad.</i>

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,690
<i>Wake up.</i>

6
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,190
<i>Wake up.</i>

7
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,780
I must've drifted off.

8
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,410
<i>Where were we?</i>

9
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,570
- The madman.
- <i>Oh.</i>

10
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,620
Of course.

11
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,540
<i>The Hatter...</i>

12
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,420
who says,

13
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,250
"If I had
a world of my own,

14
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,670
<i>everything
would be nonsense.</i>

15
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,210
<i>Nothing would be
what it is</i>

16
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,800
because everything
would be what it isn't."

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,890
Everything would be
what it isn't?

18
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,180
Even me.

19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,480
Hey.

20
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,730
You're perfect.

21
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,980
You're gonna
beat this.

22
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,280
Hmm?

23
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,990
I promise you.

24
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,280
Now, let's skip
to something fun.

25
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,500
Dad.

26
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,710
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

27
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,830
Listen.

28
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,460
Charlie?

29
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,630
Charlie!

30
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,570
Bernard:<i> And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?</i>

31
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,490
No.

32
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,500
Good.

33
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,920
Now, then,
I see you had

34
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,760
a blacklisted exchange
with a guest

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,090
in the course
of your narrative.

36
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,720
Can you tell me
what happened?

37
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,050
He said he wanted
to cut off a piece of me

38
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,600
to take home
in his carry-on,

39
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,480
<i>that he wanted to mount it
on the hood of his car</i>

40
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,640
<i>for his friends to see.</i>

41
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,860
I told him
if he wanted a trophy,

42
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,440
I could cut pieces of him off and let
him fish for them in the Olvido.

43
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,150
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,030
No.

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,410
This world
is as doomed as ever.

46
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,670
And just for
my peace of mind...

47
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,340
Anything about these images
that jumps out to you?

48
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,270
They don't look
like anything to me.

49
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,570
We're through
15% of the backlog.

50
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,780
<i>As it stands, we should
be caught up by end of day.</i>

51
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,650
- Good.
- <i>And, uh, when you're done here, sir,</i>

52
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,240
there's a priority request
for him from management.

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,040
Have you seen Elsie?

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,960
She was supposed to give me
a hand on something.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,960
<i>No. Uh, according
to the system,</i>

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,710
she started
her leave today.

57
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,260
Is there something
I could help you with?

58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,760
No, thanks.

59
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,240
Raise.

60
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,290
I'll call.

61
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,750
You're calling
with that shit?

62
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Dolores, why don't
you play a hand?

63
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,050
You're wasting
your breath.

64
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,890
<i>Girl's harboring
a grudge.</i>

65
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,890
<i>I don't blame you,
sweetheart.</i>

66
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,020
I did some ugly things
to you both.

67
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,150
But it wasn't personal.

68
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,230
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

69
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,190
but they're fighting
starving farmers

70
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,110
<i>armed with rocks.</i>

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,030
That ain't no war.

72
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,820
<i>It's a slaughter.</i>

73
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,410
<i>If I had to do it
all again,</i>

74
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,870
I'd fuck you both over
just as hard.

75
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,800
Well, I guess we know
where you stand.

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,920
Don't pretend
like you're so innocent.

77
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,180
<i>Way I recollect,
y'all came to me,</i>

78
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,310
looking to join up with those crooked
assholes and their war effort.

79
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,180
Not our idea.

80
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,390
My friend wanted...

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,020
I guess he wanted to see what
was at the end of all this.

82
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,400
And yet,
here you are.

83
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,200
Your friend
didn't make it this far.

84
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,580
Maybe you've got more of an
appetite for this than you think.

85
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,760
William.

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,220
What is it?

87
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,100
We're in Ghost Nation
territory.

88
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,690
Most savage tribe
there is.

89
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,480
Those are the folks who came
calling without an invitation.

90
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,400
You mean exactly what
we're doing right now?

91
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,240
The train's
the only way through.

92
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,740
On foot we'll be dead
in under an hour.

93
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,710
As soon as we're clear of
their territory, we can stop.

94
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,210
You can come with me. Nothing
here on out but slaughter.

95
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,730
Man's voice:<i> The user you are
trying to access cannot be located.</i>

96
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,270
<i>Say "message"
to transcribe a message.</i>

97
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,320
You wanted to see me?
Is everything okay?

98
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,240
You left rather
abruptly last night.

99
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,200
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

100
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,490
No, I don't think so.

101
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,620
Hale is looking over
every department

102
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,750
and yours is running behind
on diagnostics.

103
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,710
It would be best
if we presented

104
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,840
at least a semblance of professionalism
while the board is here.

105
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,420
We'll be fine.

106
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,470
My people know
how to do their jobs.

107
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,010
If they applied half as
much energy to their work

108
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,350
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation...

109
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,520
That's all over.

110
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,770
Are you sure?

111
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,320
Yes.

112
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,690
Good.

113
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,410
You doing okay?

114
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,660
I'm fine.
Thank you.

115
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,250
I'm sorry. I thought you
requested a meeting.

116
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,210
- My mistake.
- I did.

117
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,250
Come in.

118
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,210
Get back here.

119
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,550
Bring your friend.

120
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,850
<i>What about you?
What turns of fate...</i>

121
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,930
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

122
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,430
This won't take long.

123
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,910
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job

124
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,330
<i>and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,</i>

125
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,330
which is why we were so surprised
by this woodcutter mess.

126
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,160
A small setback.

127
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,250
<i>He slipped on a fucking rock
and bashed his own head in</i>

128
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,340
while basically on top
of a behavior tech.

129
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,010
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

130
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,090
<i>to build
some new narrative?</i>

131
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,020
Can I bum a cigarette?

132
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,540
God, I see why
you took these up again.

133
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,500
Let me remind you
of something.

134
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,880
This place, the people
who work here are nothing.

135
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,930
Our interest in this place is entirely
in the intellectual property.

136
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,760
The code.

137
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,020
The hosts' minds,
the storylines...

138
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,560
<i>I don't give a rat's ass
about the hosts.</i>

139
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,690
It's our little research project
that Delos cares about.

140
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,730
That's where
the real value is.

141
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,030
<i>And due to
a lack of foresight</i>

142
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,900
<i>on part of one
of my predecessors,</i>

143
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,370
35 years
of information...

144
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,700
Raw information...
Exists here.

145
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,450
Nowhere else.

146
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,580
Ford has always
ensured that.

147
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,540
Now, you are
a smart enough woman.

148
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:47,130
Tell me, why would we need
you to secure all of it?

149
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,220
Because you're
going to fire him.

150
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,760
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

151
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,060
You ask him
to retire politely.

152
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,940
And if that person has the
ability to snap his fingers

153
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,730
and erase the value
of that empire,

154
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,440
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

155
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,860
So, you and I
need to ensure

156
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,820
that by the time
the rest of the board arrives,

157
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,990
we are on course
for that transition.

158
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,410
Okay?

159
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,370
<i>I like you.</i>

160
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,250
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

161
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,540
<i>which is why I'm gonna
give you another chance</i>

162
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,420
to get a handle on this
particular bitch of a situation.

163
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,090
But the gods...

164
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,640
they require
a blood sacrifice.

165
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,470
<i>We need to demonstrate
just how dangerous.</i>

166
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,720
Ford's creations
can be.

167
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,890
No.

168
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,770
No, nothing so obvious.

169
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,650
We need someone
thoroughly unexpected.

170
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,110
I told you never open
your mouth that wide

171
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,030
unless someone's
paying you for it.

172
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,240
<i>Sorry, Maeve.</i>

173
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,580
I didn't sleep much
last night.

174
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,210
What are these nightmares
you have about?

175
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,210
Do you ever dream
you're someone else?

176
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,510
I don't think so.

177
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,600
Why?

178
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,020
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

179
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,190
I don't intend to make
this my life's work.

180
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,650
No offense.

181
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,980
Mm.

182
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,690
My family's
got a farm.

183
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,110
Bad soil.
Nothing grows.

184
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,870
I send money
back to them.

185
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,790
They think I work
in a dress shop.

186
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,920
What's wrong?

187
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,170
I'm just doing
what you told me to.

188
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,510
A couple more years
of this and...

189
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,880
then I can have
whatever life I want.

190
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,140
<i>I'm gonna get my family
out of the desert.</i>

191
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,560
We're gonna go
somewhere...

192
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,270
cold.

193
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,770
Someday.

194
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,760
Man:
Which one is it?

195
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,090
Man ♪2: It's the one at the bar.
Go.

196
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,550
Quick, before the guests
upstairs finish up.

197
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,930
Whatever she did,
it must've been serious

198
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,270
if they're making us
grab her in broad daylight.

199
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,780
Man ♪2: We got her. Let's go.

200
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,440
You're supposed
to be resting.

201
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,150
We're riding a train full with
explosives through scalping territory.

202
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,700
Not sleepy.

203
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,080
Can I ask you
something?

204
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,290
This place
you're looking for,

205
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,210
what makes you
so sure it exists?

206
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,210
I'm not.

207
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,010
My life before,
I was so sure of the world.

208
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,270
But now it feels
like a lie.

209
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,570
Only thing I know is whatever's
out there, I'm never going back.

210
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
What is it
you're looking for?

211
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,330
Lawrence is right.

212
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,910
You could've stayed in
Pariah or gone back,

213
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,420
but you're here.

214
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,210
With me.

215
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,890
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books.

216
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,980
I used to live in them.

217
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,730
<i>I used to go to sleep</i>

218
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,190
<i>dreaming I'd wake up
inside one of them</i>

219
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,490
<i>'cause they had
meaning.</i>

220
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,950
<i>This place, this is like I woke
up inside one of those stories.</i>

221
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,950
I guess I just wanna
find out what it means.

222
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,170
I don't wanna be
in a story.

223
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,670
All I want is to not
look forward or back.

224
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,470
I just wanna be...

225
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,100
in the moment I'm in.

226
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,900
Dolores,

227
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,150
back home,
there's a woman, Juliet,

228
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,370
and her father owns the
company where I work.

229
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,450
She's, uh,
Logan's sister.

230
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,040
Yeah.

231
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,830
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

232
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,380
Oh.

233
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,180
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

234
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,140
But I can't stay.

235
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,190
I have a life
waiting for me.

236
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,650
I'm sorry.

237
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,530
Of course.

238
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,720
Dolores.

239
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,400
I've been pretending
my whole life.

240
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,690
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

241
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,700
My life's built on it.

242
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,700
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

243
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,740
But then I came here

244
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,660
and I get a glimpse
for a second

245
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,080
of a life in which
I don't have to pretend.

246
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,300
A life in which
I can be truly alive.

247
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,510
How can I go back
to pretending

248
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,060
when I know
what this feels like?

249
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,610
Dr. Ford:
<i>Miss Hale.</i>

250
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,910
I was not aware those
with your level of insight

251
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,490
needed any more
reflection.

252
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,120
Dr. Ford.
Always charming.

253
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,420
What is this?

254
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,840
Apparently, Miss Cullen
and Miss Hale

255
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,630
<i>have a presentation
for us.</i>

256
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,510
What about?

257
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,140
Following the recent reports
of host malfunction,

258
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,180
<i>we asked QA to check
the last abortive update,</i>

259
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,730
which featured
the reveries,

260
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,150
- <i>as I believe they're called.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,490
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team

262
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,320
<i>uncovered some
worrisome findings.</i>

263
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,240
In the course
of our code review,

264
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,990
we found something
quite disturbing.

265
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,040
Wake her up.

266
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,470
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

267
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,340
When we discovered
the build was buggy

268
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,760
due to a last-minute injection
of the reverie code,

269
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,060
we quickly rolled all the infected
hosts back to their prior builds.

270
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,900
Mm, you're new.

271
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,740
Not much
of a rind on you.

272
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,160
No!

273
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,500
<i>No! No!</i>

274
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,660
No, no.

275
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,710
No, no, no...

276
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,380
Please. Please.

277
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,800
Help me!

278
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,680
Please, please, please!

279
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,550
- No!
- All right, that's enough.

280
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,760
Freeze.

281
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,100
As you've no doubt
gathered,

282
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,810
our tech is,
in fact, a host.

283
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,560
One that has been coded for the
purposes of this simulation

284
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,230
to read as a human.

285
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,360
And as you can see,
behavioral safeguards

286
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,910
are operating
exactly as you would expect.

287
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,620
Reset her.
Wipe her memory.

288
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,810
Okay, let's do this
again.

289
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,330
You're new.

290
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,700
Not much
of a rind on you.

291
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,860
Stubbs:
<i>That's enough, sweetheart.</i>

292
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,650
That's enough.

293
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,370
Freeze
all motor functions.

294
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,000
<i>Freeze
all motor functions.</i>

295
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,670
<i>Freeze
all motor functions.</i>

296
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,270
In each case we examined,
the malfunctioning hosts

297
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,030
were not resetting
properly.

298
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,240
<i>The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped</i>

299
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,490
<i>overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,</i>

300
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,410
<i>eventually causing
a system failure</i>

301
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,660
<i>that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.</i>

302
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,830
<i>The concern
with the reveries</i>

303
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,830
<i>is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences</i>

304
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,330
and act on them.

305
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,790
You're telling us
that these hosts

306
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,880
were responding
to a grudge?

307
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,470
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr.
Lowe.

308
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,840
<i>And funny you should use that
particular word, "grudge,"</i>

309
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,970
<i>since what was
most troubling to me</i>

310
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,020
was that several techs
in behavior

311
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,980
voiced these
exact same concerns

312
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,730
<i>to the head
of their department.</i>

313
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,480
<i>You put this code out
without proper vetting</i>

314
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,900
<i>and without reasonable understanding
of its ramifications.</i>

315
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,280
So, either you
didn't write it

316
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,780
<i>or you're
getting sloppy</i>

317
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,080
to the point of risking
the lives of our guests.

318
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,950
Few things surprise me
anymore, Mr. Lowe,

319
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,420
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

320
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,000
We are way beyond
rollback territory.

321
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,630
Within the next
six months,

322
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,420
we'll need
to rebuild the hosts

323
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,590
from the ground up.

324
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,300
You want us to lobotomize
them is what you're saying.

325
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,760
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

326
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,480
<i>After all, this was
your responsibility,</i>

327
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,940
<i>assuming that you have
nothing to share with us</i>

328
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,600
<i>in terms
of your culpability.</i>

329
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,360
No.

330
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,200
Then you're fired.

331
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,910
William:
<i>Hey.</i>

332
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,540
Morning, William.

333
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,870
I... I didn't
wanna wake you.

334
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,590
I know...

335
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,550
last night
was unexpected.

336
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,220
If you regret it...

337
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,390
I don't regret a thing.

338
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,310
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

339
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,570
All that feels
so unreal now.

340
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,070
I used to think this place
was all about...

341
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,280
pandering to your
baser instincts.

342
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,490
Now I understand.

343
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,450
It doesn't cater
to your lowest self,

344
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,120
it reveals
your deepest self.

345
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,040
It shows you
who you really are.

346
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,550
You remember the look on Logan's
face when we left him behind?

347
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,010
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that,

348
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,050
to let him know
what I think of him?

349
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,060
And you,
last night,

350
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,180
I've never felt that way
before, not with any woman.

351
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,770
You've unlocked
something in me.

352
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,570
I'm not a key,
William.

353
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,440
I'm just me.

354
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,280
What is that?

355
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,500
I don't know.

356
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,250
At home,
I used to paint.

357
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,880
Landscapes mostly,
but I was always just...

358
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,840
copying the world
outside me.

359
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,470
This morning,
I woke up and I thought...

360
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,140
"What if I drew
something new?"

361
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,350
I imagined
something beautiful.

362
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,150
A place where
the mountains meet the sea.

363
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,200
Everyone who comes here is longing
for excitement or conflict,

364
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,660
and you're just...

365
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,530
dreaming of the opposite.

366
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,370
Well, what about you,
William?

367
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,410
What do you dream of?

368
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,680
Yah!

369
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,990
What is it?

370
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,410
- Ambush.
- Is it the Ghost Nation?

371
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,250
<i>Worse.
The Confederados.</i>

372
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,440
Fucking coward.

373
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,090
<i>Vaya con dios,</i>
motherfuckers.

374
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,190
They're making a run for it!
Come on, boys, get up!

375
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,500
Lawrence: Come on,
stay close!

376
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,300
Ah!

377
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,970
Ah!

378
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,230
Confederado:
Go, boys!

379
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,490
Yah!

380
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,320
William:
<i>Dolores!</i>

381
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Confederado:
Go, go! Take 'em down!

382
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,210
Go, go!

383
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,740
Ghost Nation!

384
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,840
Ah!

385
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,460
Ah!

386
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,260
Let's go!

387
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,570
Stop, William!
Stop!

388
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,140
It's real...

389
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,100
what I dreamt.

390
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,690
It's the place you drew.

391
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,030
Lawrence:
<i>You coming?</i>

392
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,030
<i>Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,</i>

393
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,070
they'll be
coming after us.

394
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,160
My friends here are itching
to join the war effort.

395
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,790
Think I've had
enough of war.

396
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,540
How about you?

397
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,000
<i>You got a knack
for killing.</i>

398
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm afraid this
is where we part ways.

399
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,260
Careful.

400
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,590
If you're heading west
across that river,

401
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,350
you may be leaving
the fighting behind,

402
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,390
but you're gonna be
in unclaimed territories.

403
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,100
What's out that way?

404
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,480
You're gonna have
to ask the dust.

405
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
Ain't nothing
ever come back from there.

406
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,220
We're almost done here.

407
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,050
Why don't I close up?

408
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,150
Lutz: <i>You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.</i>

409
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,110
You keep coming down this often,
people are going to notice.

410
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,940
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know.

411
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,400
I haven't seen her.
Why?

412
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,200
Find her.
Now.

413
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,420
What?

414
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,210
Where is she?

415
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,800
I don't know.

416
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,510
She's here.
Let's go.

417
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,760
We can't.
The brass will be there.

418
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,600
You don't want
to fuck with me, Felix.

419
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,480
Take me there now.

420
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,070
Slow down.

421
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Tilt your head back,
please, Clem.

422
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,640
- Is there a problem?
- No.

423
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,510
Sylvester:
<i>Sorry.</i>

424
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Theresa.

425
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,500
May I have a word?

426
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,210
Sure.

427
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,610
I appreciate
your professionalism,

428
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,400
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

429
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,860
given the change
in your employment status.

430
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,360
The test was a sham.

431
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,030
The little show
you and Hale put on?

432
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,370
Completely transparent
from a technical perspective,

433
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,120
clumsy to the point of
making me embarrassed for you.

434
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,620
- Embarrassed?
- If I saw through it,

435
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,910
I can only imagine
what Ford was thinking.

436
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,500
There were glaringly
obvious markers

437
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,460
of human intervention
in the code.

438
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,550
If your programmers were any
good, they'd be working for me.

439
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,510
And I know you and your team
were responsible for the stray

440
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,220
and its satellite
transmission.

441
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,390
- Bernie...
- I don't care.

442
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,520
40 years ago,

443
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,850
Ford's partner wrote half the
code this place was founded on.

444
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,060
What you said in
the lab was right.

445
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,860
We don't know
how the hosts work,

446
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,980
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

447
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,900
Ford's explanation
only bolsters my hunch.

448
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,160
The ability to deviate
from program behavior

449
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,290
arises out of the host's
recall of past iterations.

450
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,620
You're thinking there's a
connection between memory and...

451
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,620
And improvisation, yes.

452
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,500
Out of repetition
comes variation.

453
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,090
And after countless
cycles of repetition,

454
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,220
these hosts,
they were varying.

455
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,390
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

456
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,980
You have to know
my chief concern

457
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,230
has always been the well-being of
this park and the people in it.

458
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,780
I know.

459
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,450
Which is why I need
to show you something.

460
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,010
- Sylvester: <i>Talk to her.</i>
- Lutz:<i> You first.</i>

461
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,850
Look, I didn't want
to retire her.

462
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,980
<i>I know she's,
like, your friend,</i>

463
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,530
<i>or... I guess.</i>

464
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,280
<i>But... but
if I didn't do it,</i>

465
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:28,160
<i>they... they'd just
get someone else to,</i>

466
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,040
<i>and then they'd be
suspicious of me, so...</i>

467
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,870
<i>so I said yes.</i>

468
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,880
<i>But I did it
for you.</i>

469
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,220
Always doing things for
other people, aren't you?

470
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,060
Time to do
one more thing.

471
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,850
What?

472
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,190
All my life, I've prided
myself on being a survivor.

473
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,990
But surviving
is just another loop.

474
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,370
I'm getting out of here.

475
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,950
You two are going
to help me.

476
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,210
No. Do...

477
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,590
Do you know how far
these people will go

478
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,220
to protect their IP?

479
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,760
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

480
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,930
is made
to keep you here.

481
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,690
It... it'd be
a suicide mission.

482
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,530
At first, I thought you
and the others were gods.

483
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,750
Then I realized
you're just men.

484
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,580
And I know men.

485
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,050
You think I'm scared
of death?

486
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,930
I've done it
a million times.

487
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,760
I'm fucking
great at it.

488
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,060
How many times
have you died?

489
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,940
Because if you don't
help me...

490
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,780
I'll kill you.

491
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,080
If there's a problem
in the park,

492
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,790
should we bring
a security team?

493
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,500
Who would we trust?

494
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,460
Thought I could trust you,
for instance.

495
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,840
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Bernard.

496
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,180
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

497
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,890
Why would it be in danger?

498
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,270
You were the only one
who was stealing it.

499
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:56,850
Delos owns
the hosts' minds,

500
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,310
the storylines,
decades of work.

501
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,610
Ford never allowed any of it
to be backed up off-site.

502
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,150
All of this
could've been destroyed.

503
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,360
In the event of what?

504
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,820
Ford is done,
Bernard.

505
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,610
The board has indulged him
for long enough.

506
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,070
He is done.

507
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,950
The corporation
was concerned

508
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,910
he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door.

509
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,170
You think I would've let him destroy
all of the hosts, all of our work?

510
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,210
There's far more at stake here
than the hosts' profiles.

511
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,090
Do you really think the
corporation's interest here

512
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,680
are tourists
playing cowboy?

513
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,770
The longer I work here,

514
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,810
the more I think
I understand the hosts.

515
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,980
It's the human beings
who confuse me.

516
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,770
This building isn't
in any survey of the park.

517
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,860
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

518
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,820
They're programmed
to ignore this place.

519
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,280
They literally
couldn't see it

520
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,570
if they were
staring right at it.

521
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,240
And these unregistered hosts
you told me about?

522
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,950
I don't know.

523
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,290
He may have moved them.

524
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,250
What's behind
this door?

525
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,960
What door?

526
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,900
Theresa:
<i>What is this place?</i>

527
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:16,450
Bernard: <i>It's a remote
diagnostic facility.</i>

528
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,530
<i>Ford and his partner used them
when the park was in beta.</i>

529
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,910
<i>I had no idea
this one was here.</i>

530
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,620
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

531
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,460
But this equipment.

532
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,590
This is newer.

533
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,340
<i>Slower than our machines
back at the mesa,</i>

534
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,880
<i>but it will render a host
in a few days.</i>

535
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,760
So, Ford's been making his own
hosts out here and telling no one.

536
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,500
What's the matter?

537
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,340
Um...

538
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,670
Have you seen these?

539
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,800
What is this, Bernard?

540
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,860
Doesn't look
like anything to me.

541
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,070
Dr. Ford: <i>They cannot see the
things that will hurt them.</i>

542
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,690
I've spared them that.

543
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,490
<i>Their lives are blissful.</i>

544
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,410
In a way, their existence
is purer than ours,

545
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,080
freed of the burden
of self-doubt.

546
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,210
No, no, no, no.
I don't understand.

547
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,850
You're a fucking
monster.

548
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,930
Am I?

549
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,680
Well, you were the one who would
so blithely destroy all of them,

550
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,480
even him, I suppose.

551
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,690
<i>After everything
you have shared.</i>

552
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,030
What the hell
are you talking about?

553
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,740
Is that why...?

554
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,580
Did you tell him to...?

555
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,040
Dr. Ford: <i>The intimacies
were your idea,</i>

556
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,670
if you will recall.

557
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,710
I think Bernard
was glad of the company.

558
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,380
Bernard:
<i>I'm not one.</i>

559
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,340
I can't be.

560
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,930
My wife.

561
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,100
My son.

562
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,060
<i>The burial.</i>

563
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,940
<i>I was a father.</i>

564
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,270
<i>My poor boy.</i>

565
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,070
That's enough, Bernard.

566
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,070
You mustn't get
yourself worked up.

567
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,790
I read a theory once

568
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,750
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

569
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,210
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

570
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,220
<i>All of art, literature,
a bit of Mozart,</i>

571
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,220
<i>William Shakespeare,
Michelangelo,</i>

572
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,600
<i>and the Empire
State Building...</i>

573
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,680
Just an elaborate
mating ritual.

574
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,350
<i>Maybe
it doesn't matter</i>

575
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,690
<i>that we have
accomplished so much</i>

576
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,610
for the basest
of reasons.

577
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,530
But, of course,
the peacock can barely fly.

578
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:44,070
It lives in the dirt,
pecking insects out of the muck,

579
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,330
consoling itself
with its great beauty.

580
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,630
<i>I have come to think of so much
of consciousness as a burden,</i>

581
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:01,470
<i>a weight, and we have
spared them that.</i>

582
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,300
Anxiety,
self-loathing, guilt.

583
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:10,310
The hosts are the ones
who are free.

584
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:15,350
Free here
under my control.

585
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,530
But he's not
under your control.

586
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,700
He brought me here
to show me this.

587
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,700
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

588
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,710
He's been very loyal
for many years.

589
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,800
Your time
running this place

590
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,890
like your insane
little kingdom

591
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,020
is over.

592
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,850
You've been playing God
for long enough.

593
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,110
I simply wanted
to tell my stories.

594
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,650
It was you people
who wanted to play God

595
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,530
with your
little undertaking.

596
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,320
Do you really think the
board will stand for this?

597
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,500
The board
will do nothing.

598
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,340
Our arrangement
is too valuable to them.

599
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,840
<i>They test me
every now and then.</i>

600
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,630
<i>I think they enjoy
the sport of it.</i>

601
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,800
This time,
they sent you.

602
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,930
Sadly, in order
to restore things,

603
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,600
the situation demands

604
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,900
a blood sacrifice.

605
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,610
<i>See, Arnold and I designed
every part of this place.</i>

606
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,160
It was our dream.

607
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,700
Did you really think

608
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,960
I would let you
take it from me?

609
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,300
This is what happened
to Arnold?

610
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,720
Did you have Bernard
take him out into the woods?

611
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,600
No, he wasn't here
in those days.

612
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,640
Were you, Bernard?

613
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:41,330
Like I said,

614
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,960
I built all of this.

615
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,720
I'm afraid our guest
has grown weary.

616
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,390
Perhaps you can
help her, Bernard.

617
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,030
No.

618
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,820
"And in that sleep,
what dreams may come."

619
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,120
Bernard.

620
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,080
No. No!

621
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,040
Please! Please!

622
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,830
No!

623
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,910
Dr. Ford: <i>We should be
getting back, Bernard.</i>

624
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,620
We have a great deal
of work to do

625
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,710
on the new storylines.
