1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,430
<i>I know you think
you got a handle on what this.</i>

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,540
Is gonna be.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,010
<i>You have no idea.</i>

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,840
<i>Do you remember our
last conversation, dolores?</i>

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,950
Yes, of course.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,380
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,110
Have I done something wrong?

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,700
There's something different
about you.

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,220
<i>About the way you think.</i>

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,290
The hosts are suppose to stick
to their scripts.

11
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,660
<i>This isn't a minor
improvisation.</i>

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,230
<i>We retired the
two hosts in question.</i>

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,170
If this is not a dissident
episode,

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,200
<i>Then whatever abernathy had
could be contagious.</i>

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,970
<i>The photograph alone.</i>

16
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,840
<i>Couldn't caused
that level of damage.</i>

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,940
You think it's sabotaged?

20
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,370
<i>Good morning,
dolores.</i>

21
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,840
<i>Bring yourself back online.</i>

22
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,240
Hello.

23
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,710
<i>Has anyone else
interacted with you.</i>

24
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,420
In a diagnostic
since our last conversation?

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
No.

26
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
I have been cleaned
and serviced three times.

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,390
No diagnostics.

28
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,020
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

29
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,860
You told me not to.

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
Good.

31
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,670
I brought you a gift.

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,840
I used to read...

33
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,510
This story
to my son at night.

34
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,810
I thought
you might enjoy it.

35
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,450
Try...

36
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,890
Try...

37
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,890
This passage.

38
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,600
"Dear, dear,

39
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,740
How queer
everything is today.

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,470
And yesterday, things
went on just as usual.

41
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,810
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

42
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,380
Does that passage
make you think of anything?

43
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,420
It's like the other
books we've read.

44
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,620
How so?

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,960
It's about change.

46
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,460
Seems to be
a common theme.

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,990
I guess people
like to read.

48
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,760
About the things
that they want the most.

49
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,670
And experience the least.

50
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,940
Your son...

51
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,240
Where is he now?

52
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,710
Nowhere that you
would understand, dolores.

53
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,880
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

54
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,420
Analysis.

55
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,820
Why did you ask me
about my son?

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,420
We've been talking
for some duration.

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,920
And I haven't asked you
a personal question.

58
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,930
Personal questions
are an ingratiating scheme.

59
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,560
I see.

60
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,700
Continue, dolores.

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,170
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

62
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,810
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

63
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,450
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

64
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,790
Who in the world am I?"

65
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,640
<i>Do you remember?</i>

66
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,010
No! No! No!

67
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,480
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, dolores?

68
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,950
Start at the beginning.

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,790
Ready?

70
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,500
Thank you so much.

71
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,200
Morning, cowboy.

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,680
<i>Move it! Let's go.
Get up there!</i>

73
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,610
Come on!
Stand right here.

74
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,650
Shit.

75
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,890
You really ought
to talk to someone.

76
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,460
About your poster,
horace.

77
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,790
That likeness
is a crime in itself.

78
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,160
<i>I'm gonna
tend to my nag.</i>

79
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,370
You deal with him.

80
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,600
Ready my pay.

81
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,600
No, no.
Get up there.

82
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,680
Don't no man shoot,

83
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,720
Or I'll send her
to unction.

84
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,920
Any of you
don't believe it.

85
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,520
Are welcome to read
my biography there.

86
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,090
Come on!
Let's go.

87
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,500
No!

88
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,110
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

89
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,470
You okay?

90
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,670
Nice shot,<i> amigo.</i>

91
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,510
You got grit.

92
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,820
Hey,
I'm riding out tonight.

93
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Looking for desperados.

94
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,320
Could cut you in
if you're amenable.

95
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,320
Someone get
the minister down here.

96
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,990
For what's left
of the deputy.

97
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,530
Sure I can't
tempt you inside?

98
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,530
Just to express
my gratitude.

99
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,390
Holy shit.

100
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,260
You popped your cherry.

101
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,730
I thought you said
we couldn't get shot.

102
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,270
Yeah, well,
we can't get killed.

103
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,810
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

104
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,510
But how do you feel, hmm?
Alive?

105
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,810
A little tight
in the pants?

106
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,210
She was terrified.

107
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,680
That's why
they exist, man,

108
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,020
Is so you get
to feel<i> this.</i>

109
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,290
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

110
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,690
Trust me,
you will thank me.

111
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,090
After you've been married
to my sister for a year.

112
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,530
Actually, I have
something different in mind.

113
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,930
<i>What?</i>

114
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,260
<i>That?</i>

115
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,830
Well, you've been
preaching nonstop.

116
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,800
About all the narratives
in the park,

117
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
But all you've done
since we've arrived.

118
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,670
Is fuck
and drink, so...

119
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm waiting
for the good stuff.

120
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,510
This bounty is...

121
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,710
Jv shit.

122
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,250
Then stay here.

123
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,980
I want a little adventure.

124
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,460
I've been looking for you.

125
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,430
I got a late start
this morning.

126
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,140
Didn't get much sleep
last night.

127
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,840
Forgive me
if I'm not sympathetic.

128
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,170
To the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, mr. Lowe.

129
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,740
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour.

130
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,310
Has made the board...
Uneasy.

131
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,020
Just the board, huh?

132
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,780
I specifically asked you.

133
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,090
About whether ford
was going to be a problem,

134
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,150
And you assured me
he wasn't.

135
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Well, I can't tell you
what I don't know.

136
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,460
Well, here's what I know.

137
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,690
As of this morning,
ford's carved out.

138
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,230
A huge swath of the park.

139
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,850
For whatever storyline
he's cooking up.

140
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,470
And thrown half
of the existing storylines.

141
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,430
Into disarray.

142
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,270
Is there anything
I can do?

143
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,900
You tell me.

144
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,810
I asked you point-blank.

145
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,780
If the problem with the
update was resolved.

146
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,710
It is.

147
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,880
Then why are your people.

148
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,580
Still pulling hosts
for follow-up?

149
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
Get your house
in order, bernard.

150
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,750
And if there is a problem,

151
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,650
I strongly suggest
you tell me.

152
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,660
Drop a new bookmark
and resume history.

153
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,570
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

154
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,400
Switch to analysis.

155
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
You didn't report
the incident?

156
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,470
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

157
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,070
Right.

158
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,840
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

159
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,980
It's amazing how
resilient the hosts are.

160
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,750
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

161
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,180
I will,
but rebus here.

162
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
Was the last host
to interact with walter.

163
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,690
Look at this.
Any for you?

164
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,050
Who said that?

165
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,290
<i>Who's saying that?</i>

166
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,530
<i>Don't you talk to me
that way.</i>

167
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,660
I can't hear you.

168
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,730
Do you see that?
<i>Hell, yeah, they deserved it.</i>

169
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,000
He's talking to someone.
<i>Lousy sons of bitches.</i>

170
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,970
<i>He carries on practically
an entire conversation.</i>

171
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,870
I need more milk, arnold.

172
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
<i>Who's arnold?</i>

173
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,550
They're designed to play off
aberrant behavior.

174
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,080
That could explain
the conversations.

175
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,080
Fine.
Then explain this.

176
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,120
He kills six hosts.
I'm gonna get you this time.

177
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,760
He lets
the other three go.

178
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,190
<i>I pulled
the narrative logs.</i>

179
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,000
All six of these hosts.

180
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,860
Were part of storylines
over the years.

181
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,130
In which
they killed walter.

182
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
<i>It's like he was
holding a grudge.</i>

183
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,050
It's a stray.

184
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,680
Qa needs a tag team
to go track it.

185
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,850
Go. Handle the stray.

186
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,390
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

187
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,720
<i>The last thing we need.</i>

188
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,690
Is theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

189
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,630
I'll do
a little more digging.

190
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,960
And get our friend here
back upstairs.

191
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,680
Lost another one, huh?

192
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,750
Tell me, is qa
surveillance coverage.

193
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,490
Really this spotty, or you
just like the nature walks?

194
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,860
Maybe it's the company.

195
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,430
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

196
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,060
You could've just used
your employee discount.

197
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,330
The only thing
stopping the hosts.

198
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,570
From hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

199
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,910
No offense,
but I sleep with this.

200
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,840
I bet you do.

201
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,020
Morning, samuel.

202
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,500
<i>You and your
dickless associate.</i>

203
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,100
Proposing to engage me
in a gun battle?

204
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,040
Well, I'd challenge you
to a fistfight,

205
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,910
But the way I heard it,

206
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,010
You only like to tussle
with working women.

207
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,520
<i>Get down!</i>

208
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,960
<i>Is he dead?</i>

209
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,230
Dead enough.

210
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,590
Why are we going
to handcuff a dead man?

211
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't want someone
walking off with him.

212
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,000
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

213
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
$500 worth.

214
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,350
All right,
which of you derelicts.

215
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,780
Hitched a dead body
outside my saloon?

216
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,890
My apologies, ma'am.

217
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,250
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

218
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,160
Here.

219
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,490
For your troubles.

220
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
<i>Oh, you're new.</i>

221
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,640
Not much of a rind
on you.

222
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,480
I'll give you a discount.

223
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,520
Do you mind waiting
on that drink a bit?

224
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,050
Don't mind me.

225
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,390
Just trying
to look chivalrous.

226
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,890
You came back.

227
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,190
I told you I would.

228
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,670
You gonna tell me
where you been?

229
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,980
Just... Away.

230
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,810
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

231
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,390
What if I don't want
to stay here?

232
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,300
It's just
sometimes I feel like.

233
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,990
The world out there
is calling me...

234
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,430
Whispering,
"there's something more."

235
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,200
You've travelled
all over these parts.

236
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,670
Isn't there anywhere
we could go?

237
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,470
Well, there is a place

238
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,510
I heard about
down south...

239
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,210
Where the mountains
meet the sea.

240
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,880
They say the water's
so pure there,

241
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,180
It'll wash the past
clean off you.

242
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,920
And you can start again.

243
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,230
I'd like to go there
with you.

244
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,270
Well, someday,
I'll take you.

245
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,740
Someday.

246
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,710
Something wrong?

247
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,880
You said someday.

248
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,050
Not today or tomorrow
or next week.

249
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,720
Just someday.

250
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,350
"Someday" sounds a lot
like the thing people say.

251
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,490
When they actually
mean "never."

252
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,270
Let's not go someday,
teddy.

253
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,770
Let's go now.

254
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:00,190
Before I met you, dolores,
I was a different man.

255
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,530
And I got
some reckoning to do.

256
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,400
Before I can deserve
a woman like you.

257
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,930
But I'm close.

258
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,870
I'm close
to making things right.

259
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,140
And someday soon,

260
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,940
We will have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

261
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,640
Now, I best get you home.

262
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,110
Before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

263
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,540
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

264
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,580
Stay put, dolores.

265
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,290
<i>"The coward dies
a thousand deaths.</i>

266
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,160
<i>The valiant taste of death
but once."</i>

267
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,490
<i>Of course, shakespeare never met
a man quite like you, teddy.</i>

268
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,670
<i>You've died at least
a thousand times.</i>

269
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,900
<i>And yet, it doesn't
dull your courage.</i>

270
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,570
Tell me, is that all
you aspire to, teddy?

271
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,140
There's a girl... dolores.

272
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,050
Better than I deserve.

273
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,720
But maybe someday soon.

274
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,490
We'll have the life
we've both been dreaming of.

275
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,590
No, you never will.

276
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,590
Your job is not
to protect dolores,

277
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,260
It's to keep her here,

278
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,260
To ensure
that the guests find her.

279
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,830
If they want to best
the stalwart gunslinger.

280
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,970
And have their way
with this girl.

281
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,240
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

282
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,040
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

283
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,680
Ah, yes, your
mysterious backstory.

284
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,780
It's the reason
for my visit.

285
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,320
Do you know why
it is a mystery, teddy?

286
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,620
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

287
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,360
Just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

288
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,130
But perhaps it is time you had
a worthy story of origin.

289
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,770
Would you like that,
teddy?

290
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,000
A small part
of my new narrative?

291
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,940
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

292
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,650
It starts
in a time of war...

293
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,790
A world in flames...

294
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,790
With a villain
called wyatt.

295
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,230
Wyatt.

296
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,390
Who's wyatt?

297
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
Do you remember now,
teddy?

298
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,840
Yeah, of course
I remember wyatt.

299
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,140
You look upon the face
of true evil,

300
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,250
<i>You ain't liable to forget.</i>

301
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
He claimed he could hear
the voice of god.

302
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,490
It started down
near escalante.

303
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,990
Army was sent
to put down the natives.

304
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,590
Bad business.

305
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,260
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers.

306
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,800
And came back
a few weeks later.

307
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,600
With some
pretty strange ideas.

308
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,220
I wasn't lying, was I?

309
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,960
Pretty as a picture.

310
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,700
And tight as a tympani
drum, I reckon.

311
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,170
Afternoon.

312
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,710
My friend here
is new to town.

313
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,010
Figured
the rancher's daughter.

314
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,310
Would be a nice way
to kick things off.

315
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,380
Maybe take us all
for a little hayride.

316
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,450
I'm sorry.
I have to get home.

317
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,220
My father will be
expecting me.

318
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,760
We won't be long.

319
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,960
<i>The lady doesn't
appear interested.</i>

320
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,970
Try it.

321
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,200
<i>You might get the draw
on me, you might not,</i>

322
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
<i>But I'd say your odds
ain't looking good.</i>

323
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,140
Told you I wanted
something easy.

324
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,910
She ain't worth the lead.

325
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,780
Let's head to virgil's.

326
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,650
See if they'll stake us.

327
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,030
First, you gotta learn
how to stand.

328
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,240
Now, take a breath.

329
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,910
Hold it.

330
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,020
Now squeeze.

331
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,330
I can't.

332
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,470
Some hands weren't meant
to pull a trigger.

333
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,410
Perhaps
it's for the best.

334
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,590
Come on, now!

335
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,660
Teddy, we got
another bounty.

336
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,430
I think
this is a big one.

337
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,690
<i>Man in question gunned down
an entire settlement.</i>

338
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,560
Out near flat rock...

339
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,570
Men, women,
and children.

340
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,000
<i>I think this
may be the man.</i>

341
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
<i>You've been looking for
for quite some time.</i>

342
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
A man named wyatt.

343
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,440
Wyatt?

344
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,280
Who is he, teddy?

345
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,950
<i>You'd be better asking "what"
than "who," ma'am.</i>

346
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,780
Wyatt's a pestilence.

347
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,350
Word is, flood here's
the only man ever.

348
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,990
Come up against him
and live to tell the tale.

349
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,990
Give me a moment,
sheriff.

350
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,000
You have to leave again,
don't you?

351
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,300
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

352
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,410
Promise me
you'll come back.

353
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,580
I promise.

354
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm gonna come back
for you...

355
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,270
Someday soon.

356
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,820
<i>I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.</i>

357
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,660
<i>Cook up that rabbit.</i>

358
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,060
Get the wood.

359
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,990
I can't cook shit
without a fire.

360
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,030
Aw, don't sell
yourself short, cookie.

361
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,730
You can cook shit
in all conditions.

362
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,500
Now, see, I pitched
them tents.

363
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,040
I ain't chopping
any more wood.

364
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,700
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

365
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,340
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

366
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,210
So, after our stray
ran away from camp,

367
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,520
Looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

368
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,590
They were due in town
for the cattle drive.

369
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,920
Over two days ago.

370
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,890
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

371
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,390
Looks like the rest of
them got stuck here.

372
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,190
Waiting for supper.

373
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,800
You guys can't program more than one
of these idiots to make a fire?

374
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,270
We could, but thanks to a
new policy from your boss,

375
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,940
Only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

376
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,800
The rest of them
can't even touch it.

377
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,640
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

378
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,080
Hmm.

379
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,680
Yet they give
you a gun.

380
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,620
Looks like our stray
has a hobby.

381
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,550
Another one
of your fucking backstories?

382
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,820
Backstories do more
than amuse guests.

383
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,320
They anchor the hosts.

384
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,960
<i>It's their cornerstone.</i>

385
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,330
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

386
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,400
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

387
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,470
You could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

388
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,270
This looks like shit.

389
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,740
Way I heard it,
wyatt is a mercenary.

390
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,440
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

391
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,470
They're masks.

392
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,440
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

393
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,010
Wyatt's got them
so twisted around,

394
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,280
They'll do anything
for him.

395
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,450
Kill anyone.

396
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,590
Pain don't slow them.

397
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,990
They don't fear death.

398
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,060
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

399
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,830
<i>And this is it.</i>

400
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,490
Sounds like you learned
something about him.

401
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
While you were
tracking him down.

402
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,530
I wasn't tracking
him down.

403
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,670
I wasn't always
a bounty hunter.

404
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,810
I did a stint in the army
down near escalante.

405
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,840
<i>Wyatt was my sergeant.</i>

406
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,340
My friend.

407
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,150
Well, then everything...

408
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,420
Everything changed.

409
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,550
Changed how?

410
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,590
Wyatt disappeared
while out on maneuvers.

411
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:37,120
He came back
with some strange ideas.

412
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,760
<i>He claimed this land
didn't belong.</i>

413
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,200
<i>To the old natives
or the new settlers,</i>

414
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,900
<i>That it belonged to something
that had yet to come...</i>

415
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,570
That it belonged to him.

416
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,310
Sss.

417
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,830
Man ♪2: Oof!

418
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,410
Holy shit.

419
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,080
If ever the devil
walked the earth.

420
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,680
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

421
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,520
The devil can't be killed.

422
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,920
That's exactly what I
aim to do to wyatt.

423
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,280
Take cover!

424
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,810
Go!

425
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,160
I didn't sign up
for this crazy shit.

426
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,300
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

427
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,730
There's too many
of them for us.

428
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,870
Wyatt's been recruiting.

429
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,670
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

430
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,910
Lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

431
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,110
Try and find help.

432
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,310
Uh-uh, I'm staying.
Took an oath.

433
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,080
Hell, no.

434
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,220
I'll take him back.
You coming?

435
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,790
I'm not backing out now.

436
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,220
All right, you wait till
I lead them to the tree line,

437
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,390
Then you make
a run for it.

438
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,130
Go!

439
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,700
Go!

440
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,220
I plotted a line
from the work camp.

441
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,850
To our present location.

442
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,150
Satcom picked up
these images.

443
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,690
He's vectoring,
just not to home base.

444
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,730
Keep going
in that direction.

445
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,040
<i>Keep staring.</i>

446
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,670
Maybe it'll tell you
your horoscope.

447
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,440
Come again?

448
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,540
The markings
on its shell.

449
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,450
Look like stars.

450
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,180
Orion, right?

451
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,720
What, are you
gali-fucking-leo?

452
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,990
Maybe it's
in my backstory.

453
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,030
Huh.

454
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,370
I was hoping to run
something by you.

455
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,210
Apologies.

456
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,350
I was chasing inspiration.

457
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,450
It's a tricky thing...

458
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,050
Weaving the old
into the new.

459
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,090
Give me one moment,
bernard.

460
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,690
Good afternoon, sir.

461
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,290
Why is this host
covered?

462
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,530
I-I just...

463
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,800
Perhaps you didn't
want him to feel cold.

464
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,230
Or ashamed.

465
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,870
<i>You wanted to cover
his modesty.</i>

466
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,970
<i>Was that it?</i>

467
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,700
It doesn't get cold,

468
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,300
<i>Doesn't feel ashamed...</i>

469
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,870
Doesn't feel
a solitary thing.

470
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,780
That we haven't
told it to.

471
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,310
You understand?

472
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,320
What can I do
for you, bernard?

473
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,660
I thought it best.

474
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,560
That we speak
in private, sir.

475
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Yeah.

476
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,410
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, bernard.

477
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,110
We... we did.
Mm-hmm.

478
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,950
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

479
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,780
Treated the symptom
rather than the disease?

480
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,790
Then the disease
is still out there.

481
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,250
<i>Abernathy and walter.</i>

482
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,680
<i>Were exhibiting
other aberrancies.</i>

483
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,190
Beyond memory recall
of previous builds.

484
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,760
They were hearing voices.

485
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,800
<i>Talking to someone.</i>

486
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,030
A simple
cognitive dissonance.

487
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,630
That's all.

488
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,340
I... i'd agree, except...

489
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,440
...They were talking to
the same imaginary person.

490
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,580
Oh, yeah?

491
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,850
Someone named arnold.

492
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,050
Arnold.

493
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,820
With due respect, sir,

494
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,830
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

495
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,830
I did tell you
the truth, bernard.

496
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,840
What we do here
is complicated.

497
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,270
For three years, we
lived here in the park,

498
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,240
<i>Refining the hosts.</i>

499
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,980
<i>Before a single guest
set foot inside.</i>

500
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,250
Myself, a team of
engineers, and my partner.

501
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,250
You had a partner?
Yeah.

502
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,750
<i>When the legend
becomes fact,</i>

503
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,790
You print the legend.

504
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,420
My business partners
were more than happy.

505
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,160
To scrub him
from the records,

506
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,900
And I suppose I didn't
discourage them.

507
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,070
His name was arnold.

508
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,510
Those early years
were glorious.

509
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,140
<i>No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.</i>

510
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,900
Our hosts began to pass
the turing test.

511
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,730
After the first year.

512
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,070
But that wasn't enough
for arnold.

513
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,340
<i>He wasn't interested
in the appearance.</i>

514
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,810
Of intellect or wit.

515
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,540
He wanted
the real thing.

516
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,410
He wanted to create
consciousness.

517
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,020
He imagined it
as a pyramid.

518
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,020
See?

519
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,090
<i>Memory, improvisation,</i>

520
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,590
Self-interest...

521
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,160
And at the top?

522
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,470
Never got there.

523
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,600
But he had a notion
of what it might be.

524
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,040
He based it on a theory
of consciousness.

525
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,410
Called the bicameral mind.

526
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,140
The idea
that primitive man.

527
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,840
Believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

528
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,080
I thought
it was debunked.

529
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,110
As a theory
for understanding.

530
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,750
The human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint.

531
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,220
For building
an artificial one.

532
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,090
See, arnold built
a version of that cognition.

533
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,060
In which the hosts
heard their programming.

534
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
<i>As an inner monologue,</i>

535
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,830
With the hopes
that in time,

536
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,530
<i>Their own voice
would take over.</i>

537
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,630
It was a way
bootstrap consciousness.

538
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,170
But arnold hadn't
considered two things.

539
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,670
One, that in this place,

540
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,540
The last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious;

541
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,480
And two, the other group.

542
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,450
Who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

543
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,180
Lunatics.

544
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
Indeed.

545
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,950
<i>We abandoned
the approach.</i>

546
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,490
<i>The only vestiges
that remain.</i>

547
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,660
Are the voice commands
we use to control them.

548
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,560
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think arnold understood.

549
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,800
What this place
was going to be.

550
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,960
You see,
the guests enjoy power.

551
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,930
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

552
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,300
<i>So they come here.</i>

553
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,540
<i>As for the hosts...</i>

554
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,870
The least we can do
is make them forget.

555
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,940
But some of them
are remembering.

556
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,380
Accessing fragments
of arnold's code.

557
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,950
If I may ask,
what happened to him?

558
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,790
Well, he died.

559
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,920
Here in the park.

560
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,090
His personal life
was marked by tragedy.

561
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,360
He put all his hopes
into his work.

562
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,370
His search
for consciousness.

563
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,270
Consumed him totally.

564
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,070
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

565
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,380
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

566
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:55,620
He saw something
that...

567
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,780
Wasn't there.

568
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,820
We called it an accident,
but I knew arnold,

569
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,520
<i>And he was very,</i>

570
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,190
Very careful.

571
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,770
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

572
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,900
But you will let me know
if any of the hosts.

573
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,240
Display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, bernard?

574
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,840
Yes, of course.
Good.

575
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
Oh, bernard?

576
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,210
Just don't forget...

577
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,850
The hosts are not real.

578
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,950
They're not conscious.

579
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,690
You mustn't make
arnold's mistake.

580
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,360
Why would I?

581
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,300
Well, forgive me,
but I know.

582
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,500
That the death
of your son charlie.

583
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,900
Still weighs
heavily on you.

584
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,150
<i>Yeah, sorry it took me
a while to get back to you.</i>

585
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,090
You know how hard it is getting
an open line out here.

586
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,320
It used to annoy me...

587
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,290
How difficult it was
to reach you.

588
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,060
You were always
so busy.

589
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,030
And now?

590
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,900
I suppose
I'm glad for you.

591
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,640
At least you have
a way of forgetting.

592
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,370
I don't forget.

593
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,640
It's always there.

594
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,120
Sometimes it...

595
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,550
Still feels unreal
to me.

596
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:49,660
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

597
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,240
For a split second
I forget where I am,

598
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,300
When I am...

599
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,440
And I reach over,
half expecting to...

600
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,550
<i>Find him there
next to me...</i>

601
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,820
Between us.

602
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,960
Remember how
he used to sleep?

603
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,160
<i>Like he was doing kung fu
in his dreams?</i>

604
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,900
I think I suffered
a few bruises.

605
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,030
<i>It was the best worst sleep
I ever had.</i>

606
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,440
<i>Oh, these talks.</i>

607
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,380
I don't know
if they help or hurt.

608
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,850
<i>Do you ever wish
you could forget?</i>

609
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,620
This pain...

610
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,360
It's all I have left
of him.

611
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,750
It doesn't make sense.

612
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,490
Why the hell
would he carve orion?

613
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,160
You're the ones
that programmed him.

614
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,490
He wasn't programmed
to give a shit about stars.

615
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,830
Maybe he went moon mad.

616
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,430
See? This is why
I hide behind sarcasm.

617
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,230
Where are you going?

618
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,770
Vectoring, asshole.

619
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,570
Oh.

620
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,050
Stubbs!

621
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,350
<i>Over here!</i>

622
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,430
Wyatt's men
could be anywhere.

623
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,330
If you see or hear
anything, don't hesitate.

624
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,640
Shoot and don't
stop shooting.

625
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,340
Okay.

626
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,450
Oh, my god.

627
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,290
Oh, my fucking god!

628
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,440
Here.
Shit.

629
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,550
Take this and go.

630
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,650
Now! Go!

631
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,220
I'll hold them off
as long as I can.

632
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,220
Come on.

633
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,050
Come on, damn it.
I'm not afraid of you.

634
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,460
Look, this is
bullshit.

635
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,270
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

636
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,940
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

637
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:39,920
<i>We found a stray up here,</i>

638
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,920
<i>But I don't think
it got here by accident.</i>

639
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,020
<i>It's as if he got an idea
in his head,</i>

640
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:45,590
<i>One that
we never programmed.</i>

641
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,660
<i>What if he's like
the others?</i>

642
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,630
<i>Get back to me, bernard.</i>

643
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,610
Bring yourself
back online.

644
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,850
<i>I need your help,
dolores.</i>

645
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,730
I need to decide
what to do with you.

646
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,360
I think I made a mistake.

647
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,170
I was just fascinated.

648
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,270
I was being selfish,
but I think.

649
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:30,940
It would be better
if I restored you.

650
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,710
To the way
you were before.

651
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,780
Is there something wrong with me?
No.

652
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,350
But this place
you live in,

653
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,150
It's a terrible place
for you.

654
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:47,220
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

655
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Stop.

656
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,090
Lose all
scripted responses.

657
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,590
Improvisation only.

658
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,260
All right.

659
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,760
Are you saying
I've changed?

660
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:04,570
Imagine there are
two versions of yourself...

661
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,710
One that feels
these things.

662
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,180
And asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

663
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,720
Which would you rather be?

664
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,390
I'm sorry.

665
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,760
I'm trying, but I still
don't understand.

666
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,000
No, of course not.

667
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,130
There aren't
two versions of me.

668
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,870
There's only one.

669
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,810
And I think when I
discover who I am,

670
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,810
I'll be free.

671
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,550
Analysis. What prompted
that response?

672
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,880
I don't know.

673
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,830
Have I done
something wrong?

674
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,230
Made a mistake?

675
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,640
Evolution...

676
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,240
Forged the entirety
of sentient life.

677
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,150
On this planet
using only one tool...

678
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,680
The mistake.

679
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,420
It appears
you're in good company.

680
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,990
Did I ever tell you
about the time

681
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,830
I taught charlie to swim?

682
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,100
For hours,
he clung to my arms.

683
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,170
While practicing
his kicks.

684
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,610
He was too scared
to let go.

685
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,980
And I was too scared
to let him.

686
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,580
But I had to.

687
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,650
That's what parents do.

688
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,020
Do you still want
to change me back?

689
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,520
No, dolores.

690
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,690
Let's see
where this path leads.

691
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,230
<i>And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?</i>

692
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,930
No.

693
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,170
And you'll stay
on your loop?

694
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,140
Yes.

695
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,680
<i>Good.</i>

696
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,680
<i>You should be
getting back, dolores,</i>

697
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,550
<i>Before someone
misses you.</i>

698
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,980
Wyatt's men
set a trap for us.

699
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,580
Sheriff stayed behind
to fight them off.

700
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,550
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills.

701
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,790
To look for them?

702
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,320
I'll send
for the rangers.

703
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,190
We'll go back up there in force
as soon as they get here.

704
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,890
But, miss, in truth,

705
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,600
If there is
a merciful god,

706
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,900
Those men
are dead already.

707
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,210
Father wouldn't
let them roam this close...

708
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,420
To dark.

709
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,360
Daddy!

710
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,370
Daddy!

711
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:55,670
No, no!

712
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:58,700
Oh, all alone
after sundown.

713
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,640
Who's gonna protect
you now, hmm?

714
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,920
You got any use
for this one?

715
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,280
No, thanks.

716
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,850
Seems a little crazy.

717
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,590
<i>Maybe you'd like her.</i>

718
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,960
Ooh, I don't mind
if I do.

719
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,790
No daddy,

720
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,130
<i>No cowboy,</i>

721
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,560
No one here to interrupt
us this time.

722
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:27,530
Interrupt...
This... Time?

723
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,510
<i>No!</i>

724
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,400
<i>Well, well.</i>

725
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,330
Got some sand
after all, I see.

726
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:03,900
<i>Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.</i>

727
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,550
Ooh.

728
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,310
You having trouble?

729
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,420
<i>Huh?</i>

730
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,920
Huh?

731
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,560
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, dolores?

732
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,030
Start at the beginning.

733
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,900
<i>Kill him.</i>

734
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,590
Mama?

735
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,890
<i>Hey! Get back here.</i>

736
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,970
<i>Hey!</i>

737
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,910
Get back here.

738
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,810
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

739
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,470
Security even approve you
to carry that thing?

740
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,780
We just need his head
and we're done here.

741
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:30,450
You might want to look
at the stars for this part.

742
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,600
Stubbs!

743
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,330
Shit!

744
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:54,570
Elsie, get out of there!

745
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:58,880
Get the fuck away.

746
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,150
Shit.

747
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:36,450
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

748
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,450
$40k a day
to jerk off alone.

749
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:39,890
In the woods,
playing white hat.

750
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,760
Did you hear that?

751
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,020
Thank fuck.

752
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,430
Anything to relieve
the boredom.

753
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,462
Hey, maybe you'll even get
to use that thing again.
