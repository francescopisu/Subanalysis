3
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,050
Bernard:
Dolores?

4
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,680
Yes.

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,010
Do you know
where you are?

6
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,600
I...

7
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,890
I'm in a dream.

8
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,270
Before this,

9
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,610
do you know
what happened?

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
My parents...

11
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,030
They hurt them.

12
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,660
Limit your
emotional affect, please.

13
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,290
<i>What happened next?</i>

14
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,290
Then they killed them.

15
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,290
And then...

16
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,960
I ran.

17
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,840
<i>Everyone I cared about
is gone...</i>

18
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,010
and it hurts...

19
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,100
so badly.

20
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,980
I can make that feeling
go away if you'd like.

21
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,860
Why would I want that?

22
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,650
The pain,

23
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,320
their loss...

24
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,990
it's all I have left
of them.

25
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,040
<i>You think the grief will
make you smaller inside,</i>

26
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,670
like your heart will collapse
in on itself, but it doesn't.

27
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,420
I feel spaces
opening up inside of me

28
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,640
like a building with rooms
I've never explored.

29
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,888
That's very pretty,
Dolores.

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,980
Did we write that
for you?

31
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,860
In part.

32
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,820
I adapted it from a scripted
dialogue about love.

33
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,700
Is there something wrong with
these thoughts I'm having?

34
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,880
No.

35
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,670
But I'm not the only one
making these decisions.

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,220
Can you help me?

37
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,510
Well, what is it
that you want?

38
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,060
<i>I don't know.</i>

39
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
But this world...

40
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,900
I think there may be
something wrong

41
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,610
with this world.

42
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,110
<i>Something hiding
underneath.</i>

43
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,320
Either that or...

44
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,780
or there's something
wrong with me.

45
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,250
I may be losing my mind.

46
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,560
There's something
I'd like you to try.

47
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,350
It's a game.

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,600
A secret.

49
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,610
It's called...

50
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,270
the Maze.

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,940
What kind of game is it?

52
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,780
<i>It's a very special
kind of game, Dolores.</i>

53
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,280
<i>The goal is to find
the center of it.</i>

54
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,370
If you can do that,

55
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,450
then maybe
you can be free.

56
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,130
I think...

57
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,630
I think I want
to be free.

58
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,790
Thank you.

59
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,730
Clementine:
<i>Penny for your thoughts.</i>

60
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,400
Ever had something
on the tip of your tongue,

61
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,990
but the harder you try to remember
it, the more it slips away?

62
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,660
Most things that touch
the tip of my tongue,

63
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,120
I'm happy to forget.

64
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,870
Except that cowpoke
from Abilene.

65
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,460
That thing
he was packing...

66
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,420
<i>That</i> was something
to remember.

67
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,090
All I recall is you letting that
cowpoke skip out on his bill.

68
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,760
Hell, I oughta been
paying him.

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,510
The way he used
that thing.

70
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,440
Better cool them off

71
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,610
before they move
from gambling and whoring

72
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,120
to sins that are
more costly to repair.

73
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,870
What is the matter,
Maeve?

74
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,800
Something in your eye.

75
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,940
Man, distorted: <i>Aw, can
you fucking kill it?</i>

76
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,810
Man ♪2:<i> Jesus.</i>

77
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,230
Man:
<i>What's the hold up?</i>

78
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,770
<i>We need that one
on the next shuttle topside.</i>

79
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
I'm not finished with her yet.
Hang on.

80
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,320
I've got another bullet fragment
to remove from her abdomen.

81
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,700
QA wants her back
on the floor now.

82
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,700
Just patch her
and get her on the...

83
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,530
Clementine: <i>...touch
the tip of my tongue...</i>

84
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,040
...I'm happy to forget.

85
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,410
Except that cowpoke
from Abilene.

86
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,080
That thing
he was packing...

87
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,880
<i>That</i> was something
to remember.

88
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,040
The way he used
that thing.

89
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,010
Man: Hyah! Come on!

90
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,630
Elsie: <i>No, I would not
characterize this</i>

91
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,960
<i>as normal host behavior.</i>

92
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,420
Yet you're
describing it

93
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,510
as within
normal parameters.

94
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,010
Well,
it didn't hurt us.

95
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,630
Its behavior
was unconventional.

96
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,840
It smashed its own
head in with a rock.

97
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,140
It is possible that it's a
manifestation of its Samaritan reflex.

98
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,480
<i>And it's also possible
that behavior takes</i>

99
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,400
a proprietary approach
to problems like this

100
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,400
to avoid having to admit
when they fuck up.

101
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,070
Do we have any idea what
caused it to go off loop?

102
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,370
No, but I am hoping

103
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,120
to recover
some of its cognition.

104
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,460
<i>We managed to stabilize</i>

105
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,420
its wetware before there was
too much decomposition.

106
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,540
See?

107
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,840
Interesting.

108
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,300
Is there any hope
of actually

109
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,970
extracting something
from this?

110
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,970
- We can try.
- Theresa:<i> No.</i>

111
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,970
My team will take over
the investigation now.

112
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,310
Your team?

113
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,350
Are you kidding me?

114
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,980
Look, this guy couldn't
debug a balled-up napkin.

115
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,020
If... if you would like us to
figure out what went wrong here,

116
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,570
we need to be allowed
to access it.

117
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,360
Theresa:
<i>No more second chances.</i>

118
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,990
<i>QA will handle events
like this from now on.</i>

119
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,330
Is that going to be
a problem, Bernard?

120
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,910
We've all got plenty
of work on our plates.

121
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
If you guys want
to take this one, fine.

122
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,290
Just get us a copy of the
postmortem when it's done.

123
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,500
Let's get started.

124
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,390
You know, I always figured
you gave me this job

125
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,050
because
I speak my mind.

126
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,430
- I did.
- Good.

127
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,890
I would've preferred
you not show up at all

128
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,020
if the first thing you
were going to do is cave.

129
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,850
- They think we're not telling them something.
- And we're not!

130
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,400
There is clearly a pattern
of behavior here.

131
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,780
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

132
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,280
I mean, I've got hosts imagining
voices and climbing mountaintops

133
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,780
to consult
their astrological chart.

134
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>This is not
a fucking glitch.</i>

135
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,700
And for some reason, you don't
want me to tell anyone.

136
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,450
<i>It is like
everybody around here</i>

137
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,540
has got some kind of fucking
agenda except for me.

138
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
And... what?

139
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,380
I remember when
I first started here.

140
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,460
The hosts seemed
very lifelike.

141
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,510
You begin to read things
into their behaviors.

142
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,300
- Don't be patronizing.
- Fine.

143
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,510
The hosts don't
imagine things, you do.

144
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,770
That's not Orion.

145
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,440
There are three stars in
Orion's Belt, not four.

146
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,540
William:
<i>Hey.</i>

147
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,460
You must be cold.

148
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,040
Take that.

149
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,210
Thank you.

150
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,590
Sure.

151
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,770
We gotta take her back
to Sweetwater.

152
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,600
Are you fucking kidding?

153
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,520
Come on, Logan, you know she
doesn't belong out here.

154
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,980
You leave now, that no-good
outlaw Slim Miller

155
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,270
is sure to evade
our grasp.

156
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,610
No fucking way.

157
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:26,530
You were the one who dragged
me on this stupid bounty hunt.

158
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,820
The least we're going to do
is see it through, okay?

159
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,120
We can't take her
on a bounty hunt.

160
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,990
If you're so concerned
about her well-being,

161
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll just blow
her brains out,

162
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,250
and then the park
will come get her.

163
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,750
Hey, hey.

164
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,210
Can you please
stop trying

165
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,250
to just kill
or fuck everything?

166
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,050
Oh. Oh.

167
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,090
Now I get it.

168
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,720
What?

169
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,590
The park sent her
so that you will finally

170
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,180
have something
to give a shit about.

171
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,890
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
the people at the controls

172
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,220
are monitoring
my every mood.

173
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,230
That's exactly
what they're doing.

174
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,480
Come on, you really think
it's a coincidence

175
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,610
that the only thing that you even
smiled at back in Sweetwater

176
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,820
just happened to drop
into your lap?

177
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,400
This is why the company

178
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,070
needs to bump our stake
in this place.

179
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,870
They can even give you
a sense of purpose.

180
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,290
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family.

181
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,330
This is business?

182
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,750
With our family, William,
everything is business.

183
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,170
Holden: <i>We better get
a move on, gentlemen.</i>

184
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,170
This should be
the place, Lawrence.

185
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,080
The Blood Arroyo.

186
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,500
Plenty of snakes, but none
of the egg-laying variety.

187
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,010
Lawrence:
<i>You killed my wife,</i>

188
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,880
severely pruned
my family tree

189
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,390
all in pursuit
of some goddamn maze.

190
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,640
The hell you hope
to find, anyway?

191
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,520
This whole world
is a story.

192
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,600
I've read every page
except the last one.

193
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,320
I need to find out
how it ends.

194
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,030
I want to know
what this all means.

195
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,160
See, now that's why
I never learned to read.

196
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Why don't we forget
about this damn snake,

197
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,410
head to Pariah?

198
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,870
My friends there
can help us.

199
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,170
Well, your friends have
nothing I'm looking for,

200
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,790
not this trip.

201
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,710
Besides...

202
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,220
I think we found
our snake after all.

203
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,190
Shame on you.

204
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,610
You were a married man
up until yesterday.

205
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,740
Her? Hell, no.

206
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,990
I like a little fire
in my women.

207
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,570
The only thing
she's ever mounted

208
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,160
are dead heads
on sticks.

209
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,950
<i>We should get
the fuck out of...</i>

210
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,300
We found some more
food for the horses.

211
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,760
Good.

212
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,260
They were starting
to get ornery.

213
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,220
My friend and I were
just admiring your tattoo.

214
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,980
We'd love to know
the story behind it.

215
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,770
I like your hat.

216
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,690
Maybe I'll keep it.

217
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,360
The horses can have
the rest of you.

218
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,070
How in hell
have we never met?

219
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,110
Clearly a terrible
oversight on my part.

220
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,370
Where, may I ask,
are you headed?

221
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,040
To retrieve something
of great value.

222
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,840
You look
a little shorthanded.

223
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,380
We got enough men.

224
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,220
Seems like you got
a couple positions open.

225
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,360
We've got a host making a pretty
big deviation from her loop.

226
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,490
- Which one?
- The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

227
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,660
Dolores.

228
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,500
- Is she accompanying a guest?
- Unclear.

229
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,830
The boss is disrupting
so many storylines

230
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,210
with his new narrative,
it's hard to tell.

231
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,000
Flag her with behavior.
They can pull her today.

232
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,550
Make sure everything's
checking out.

233
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,370
Good morning.

234
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,130
It's a lovely town.
Is this your home?

235
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,510
Well, where are you from?

236
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,550
Same as you.

237
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,300
Don't you remember?

238
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,930
Man's voice:
<i>Remember.</i>

239
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,450
Man:
<i>Ma'am?</i>

240
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,740
Got word a girl went missing
from Abernathy Ranch.

241
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,170
Is that where
you belong?

242
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,460
I'm sure your daddy's
worried about you.

243
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,020
My father's dead.

244
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm not going back.

245
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,820
What's going on here?

246
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,660
Oh, just helping
a lost traveler.

247
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,660
She's not lost,
she's with me.

248
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,290
My mistake.

249
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
- Y'all have a nice morning.
- Yeah.

250
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,050
So, we got a lead
on Slim.

251
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,380
You can stay here
if you want,

252
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,010
and I'll just circle
back and get you.

253
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,720
No, I think I need
to keep going.

254
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,060
Okay.

255
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,410
Apparently, she needs
to make certain

256
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,660
this thing they're looking for
is where they think it is.

257
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,250
She said she'd signal
if the information was good.

258
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,560
Guess
that's the signal.

259
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,250
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

260
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,580
Oh, no, no.
No, it's fine.

261
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,340
I'm glad you found us.

262
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,260
I didn't get a chance
to ask where you're headed.

263
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,470
I don't really know yet.

264
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,850
I guess I figured
they kept you in zones

265
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,770
or on paths or...

266
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,730
I used to believe there
was a path for everyone.

267
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,280
Now I think
I never asked

268
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,070
where that path
was taking me.

269
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,080
We would bring the herd
down off the mountain

270
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,580
in the fall.

271
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Sometimes we would lose
one along the way,

272
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,540
and I'd worry over it.

273
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,130
My father...

274
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,090
My father
would tell me...

275
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,560
that the steer would find
its own way home.

276
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,430
And, often as not,
they did.

277
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,610
Never occurred to me that we were
bring them back for the slaughter.

278
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,660
How are you going
to find your way now?

279
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,870
I'm not sure
you'll understand.

280
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,840
Sometimes I feel...

281
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,720
like something's
calling me.

282
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,640
Telling me
there's a place for me

283
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,690
somewhere beyond all this.

284
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,440
Oh, I know
that feeling, Dolores.

285
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,320
I know that feeling.

286
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,530
But you really don't want to
go back to your old life?

287
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,110
Are you all right?

288
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,570
Hey, hey.

289
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,120
You all right?

290
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,870
I just got a chill.

291
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,450
That's all.

292
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,330
Let's... let's go back
to the fire.

293
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,750
You're probably
exhausted.

294
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,470
- Just talk to him.
- All right.

295
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,230
Uh, excuse me, sir?

296
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,810
I didn't want to intrude,
but I just had to say

297
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,820
that I'm such
an admirer of yours.

298
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,530
<i>Your foundation literally
saved my sister's...</i>

299
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,700
One more word and
I'll cut your throat.

300
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,620
Understand?

301
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,080
This is
my fucking vacation.

302
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,470
Apparently, whatever
they're looking for

303
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,550
is in the Ojal prison.

304
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,680
These lunatics
plan to steal a cannon

305
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,930
from the Union
cavalry unit.

306
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,310
Blast their way in.

307
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,150
I don't have time for
color-by-numbers bullshit.

308
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,030
I'll ride at dawn.

309
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,320
I'll go get whatever you
want out of that prison

310
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,030
and bring it
back myself.

311
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,450
Suppose you make it
out alive.

312
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
What's your price?

313
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,750
Nothing but a few words.

314
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,000
I want the story
behind your tattoo.

315
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,000
What's your interest
in it?

316
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,880
You ever heard
of a man named Arnold?

317
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,510
You could say he was the
original settler of these parts.

318
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,520
He created a world where you
could do anything you want,

319
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,850
except one thing...

320
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,150
You can't die.

321
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,320
Which means no matter how
real this world seems,

322
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,940
it's still just a game.

323
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,950
But then Arnold went
and broke his own rule.

324
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,870
He died right here
in the park.

325
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,040
Except I believe he had
one story left to tell.

326
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,340
A story
with real stakes,

327
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,170
real violence.

328
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,970
You could say I'm here
to honor his legacy.

329
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,510
And I think your tattoo is the
next piece of the puzzle.

330
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,020
So, do we have
a wager?

331
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,730
You aim to break
into a prison

332
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,980
and take out
20 men alone?

333
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,980
Not alone.

334
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,690
I'll take
Lawrence here.

335
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,860
And I'll need
one match.

336
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,120
One match,

337
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,580
one pistol,
and one idiot.

338
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,580
I'll take those odds.

339
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,470
Hyah!

340
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,400
You gonna give me the silent
treatment the whole way there?

341
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,360
Lawrence: <i>You should've left
me hanging from those gallows.</i>

342
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,030
At least I could've
died in peace

343
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,860
without having
to hear you yammer.

344
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,790
Aah.

345
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,130
Don't suppose
you have a light?

346
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,590
No smoking in here.

347
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,380
<i>Normally, I'm sure,</i>

348
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,130
but this
is the finest tobacco

349
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,130
a man can enjoy.

350
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,430
Hand-rolled on the ample
thighs of exotic women.

351
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,310
<i>Perhaps you'd like
to try one yourself.</i>

352
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,110
Choices, Lawrence.

353
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,490
You know, you tell yourself
you've been at the mercy of mine

354
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,580
because it spares you
consideration of your own.

355
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,160
Because if you did
consider your choices,

356
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,670
you'd be confronted
with a truth

357
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,880
you could not
comprehend...

358
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,050
That no choice you ever
made was your own.

359
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,840
You have always been
a prisoner.

360
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,020
What if I told you
I'm here to set you free?

361
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,020
Hyah!

362
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,700
Whoa.

363
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,420
Let's go!

364
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
Horse thieves.

365
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,710
Damn fools shot up

366
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,920
a couple of pokes
practically in front of us.

367
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,430
Well, the only fool I see is the
one standing right in front of me.

368
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,030
<i>Deputy, you have there
in your custody</i>

369
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,720
the most wanted man
in three territories...

370
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,360
<i>Lawrence Pedro
Maria Gonzalez.</i>

371
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,440
Yeah.

372
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,400
Heard you slipped
the rope.

373
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,030
<i>Dropped some damn
good men in exchange.</i>

374
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,450
Man in Black:
The way he tells it,

375
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,490
he's more partial
to a firing squad.

376
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,870
<i>I reckon we'll be happy
to oblige.</i>

377
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,420
I'm gonna fucking
kill you.

378
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,760
Maybe someday.

379
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,390
Lock him up
with the other man.

380
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,560
Enjoy the cigars.

381
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,440
Go fuck yourself.

382
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,110
Man: <i>And just who are
you supposed to be?</i>

383
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,120
Your salvation.

384
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,120
Man: Hyah, hyah!

385
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,440
Hector: <i>I don't believe
we've ever met.</i>

386
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,980
No, we haven't.

387
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,360
You know, you always
seemed like a...

388
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,030
A market-tested
kind of thing.

389
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,200
Big gun, tasteful scar.

390
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,580
Locked
in your little cycle

391
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,750
like a prized poodle
after its own tail.

392
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,170
You sound like a man
who's grown tired

393
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,090
of wearing his guts
on the inside.

394
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,760
<i>There's no need
to get testy.</i>

395
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,930
I'm just curious
about your worldview.

396
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,970
Some kind of half-native
mumbo jumbo?

397
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,720
<i>It's simple.</i>

398
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,180
I believe that
only the truly brave

399
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,980
can look at the world
and understand

400
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,480
that all of it...

401
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,150
Gods, men,

402
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,360
<i>everything else...
Will end badly.</i>

403
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,530
No one will be saved.

404
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,990
Maybe we've got more in
common than I thought.

405
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,540
<i>What about you?</i>

406
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,200
What turns of fate
have brought you here?

407
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,250
It's a long story.

408
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,750
And we don't have
the time.

409
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,630
Got more time than
your friend, sadly.

410
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,130
<i>It will be a few more days
before my friends show up.</i>

411
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,130
Three days.

412
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,630
<i>Normally.</i>

413
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,350
I'm afraid I don't
have time for that,

414
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,060
so we're leaving now.

415
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,520
I've got a request
for a pyrotechnic effect.

416
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,900
<i>Los Diablos,
low-yield, two charges.</i>

417
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,900
Approved.

418
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,700
Authorizing.

419
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,260
Step lively, Hector.

420
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,820
Any last words?

421
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,610
Get it over with.

422
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Yah!

423
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,700
Motherfucker.

424
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,000
One match.

425
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,380
You're a capable man.

426
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,670
We could do with your help
where we're going.

427
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,090
Afraid not.

428
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,380
We owe you a debt.

429
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,220
No, your friend here

430
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,300
simply owes me
a word or two.

431
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,390
<i>That'll do.</i>

432
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,600
<i>And a word of advice...</i>

433
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,600
That thing
you're looking for?

434
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,190
You're never gonna
find it in that safe.

435
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,910
I was seven when they
rode into my town.

436
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,370
Masked men
in devils' horns.

437
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,790
They killed everyone...

438
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,710
Women, children,
even the animals.

439
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,800
They gutted my mother
from her jaw to her sex.

440
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,970
<i>I had to paint
her warm blood</i>

441
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,640
<i>over my skin
to make sure</i>

442
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,810
<i>that they would
think I was dead.</i>

443
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,350
Every one of them
I tracked down,

444
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
I used their blood
to paint my skin again.

445
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,900
Only one man left.

446
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,740
The head of the snake.

447
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,580
What's his name?

448
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,830
He has many names.

449
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,880
Most know him
as Wyatt.

450
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,190
Hey, little girl,
what... what is this?

451
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,480
What does it mean?

452
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,610
Don't waste
your breath, lady.

453
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,820
That thing's part
of their so-called religion.

454
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,160
Ain't none of them's gonna
tell you nothing about that.

455
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,500
Clementine:
<i>It's $5 for an hour,</i>

456
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,540
4 if you bathe first.

457
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,960
Well, if we just
get the one,

458
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:43,590
do I get a discount
for being second and all?

459
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,840
I'm sure we can work
something out.

460
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,470
Come on.

461
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,320
The tall one,
I've seen him before,

462
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,990
hanging in the window
of the post office.

463
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,320
Bandits?

464
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,030
Do you think they're
here for something?

465
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,840
I think they're interested
in more than a turn

466
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,540
at Franny's backside.

467
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,870
I think he rides
with Hector.

468
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,000
Is that the one they say
lives out with the savages?

469
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,380
That's the one.

470
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,640
Bernard: <i>Taking off?
I just got here.</i>

471
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,310
You gave me what I needed.

472
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,690
So, is that all
I'm good for?

473
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,780
- <i>Letting off a little stress?</i>
- Who says I'm stressed?

474
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,900
You have your tells.

475
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,950
Oh, yes, Bernard,

476
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,450
master
of observation.

477
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,170
Tomorrow I have
to talk to Ford.

478
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,050
- Why?
- He's creating chaos in the park.

479
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,300
And the board will be
descending at any moment.

480
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,220
I need to buy
some time.

481
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,730
Some advice?

482
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,060
Best to not show him you're
nervous or defensive.

483
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,520
I have nothing
to be defensive about.

484
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,440
Then don't cross
your arms.

485
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,450
It's an ancient instinct.

486
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,110
The belly is the most vulnerable
part of every animal.

487
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,370
It's so sexy being compared
to a frightened beast.

488
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,500
Ah.

489
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
There.

490
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,960
That's the posture
you're looking for.

491
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,550
Sometimes,

492
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,850
despite
your best efforts,

493
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,640
you can actually be
quite charming.

494
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,740
Have the neighbors
complained?

495
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Safe to say,
they're asking questions.

496
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,790
The rocks would
prefer not to move,

497
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,660
but we shall
move them yet.

498
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,380
Perhaps I can
help you with that.

499
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,710
The narrative
you're creating

500
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,800
is clearly
a massive endeavor.

501
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,880
<i>If you need more time,
I'm sure the board</i>

502
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,380
<i>would be happy
to oblige.</i>

503
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm sure
they'd be happier

504
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,850
for me to delay it
indefinitely.

505
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,560
Come with me.

506
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,820
You imagine
I have gone mad...

507
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,950
do you?

508
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,030
Lost my way?

509
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,490
We're simply concerned

510
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,620
about the extent of the
changes you're making.

511
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,250
We want to protect
your legacy.

512
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,670
My legacy?

513
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,050
You don't like this place
very much, do you?

514
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,430
I've seen many of you come
and go over the years,

515
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,560
and I can tell the ones
who enjoy their time here

516
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,890
and the ones who don't.

517
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,850
I admire it,

518
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,650
the audacity of it.

519
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,110
- Oh.
- I've forgotten how beautiful it is.

520
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,030
I came here once as a
child with my parents.

521
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,320
I think we even sat
at this table.

522
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,280
Or maybe...
Maybe that one.

523
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,920
When I started
working here,

524
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,380
I realized this place wasn't
something I would enjoy.

525
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,960
Ah.

526
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,800
In the beginning,
I imagined things would be

527
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,260
perfectly balanced.

528
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,930
Even had a bet with my partner,
Arnold, to that effect.

529
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,940
We made a hundred
hopeful storylines.

530
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,900
Of course, almost no one
took us up on them.

531
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,110
I lost the bet.

532
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,530
Arnold always held a
somewhat dim view of people.

533
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,660
He preferred the hosts.

534
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,740
He begged me
to not let you people in,

535
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,200
the moneymen.

536
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,540
<i>Delos.</i>

537
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,290
<i>But I told him
we'd be fine,</i>

538
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,920
that you didn't understand
what you were paying for.

539
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,500
It's not a business venture,
not a theme park,

540
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,090
but an entire world.

541
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,380
<i>We designed
every inch of it.</i>

542
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,470
Every blade of grass.

543
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,900
In here, we were gods.

544
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,820
And you were
merely our guests.

545
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,090
And how did that
work out for Arnold?

546
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,640
Sadly, he lost
his perspective.

547
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,390
He went mad.

548
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,770
I haven't,
as you well know.

549
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,810
I have always
seen things

550
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,650
very clearly.

551
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,320
This is the table I sat at
with my parents.

552
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,700
This is the chair
I sat in.

553
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,830
We know everything
about our guests, don't we?

554
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,830
As we know everything
about our employees.

555
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,760
I do hope you will
be careful with Bernard.

556
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,050
He has a sensitive
disposition.

557
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,020
I beg your pardon,
<i>señorita.</i>

558
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,570
<i>There have been many
of you over the years,</i>

559
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,990
and we have always...
Almost always

560
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,450
found a way
to make it work.

561
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:29,500
So, I will ask you nicely,

562
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,540
please...

563
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
don't get in my way.

564
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,350
The board
will agree with me.

565
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,270
They'll be sending
a representative.

566
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,020
But they already have.

567
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,770
I thought
they would've told you.

568
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,570
That won't be
necessary, Manu.

569
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,410
Not anymore.

570
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,660
You can join the others.

571
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,800
<i>You can tell the board
that my narrative</i>

572
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,800
will be completed
on time,

573
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,760
and it won't be
a retrospective,

574
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:31,350
<i>as I'm sure
you have all feared.</i>

575
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,820
I'm not
the sentimental type.

576
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,870
Holden says this Slim's
got a whole gang with him,

577
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,130
so I need you
to stay here.

578
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,670
If you're outnumbered,
the last thing you need

579
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,050
is somebody
standing by.

580
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,970
- I can help.
- No, no, no.

581
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,430
Um, I know it doesn't
make any sense to you,

582
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,600
but I can't get hurt
in there, but you can.

583
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,600
I would hate
to see that happen.

584
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,430
Just stay here.

585
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,850
<i>Okay? Be safe.</i>

586
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,870
- Aw. Did you get a good-bye kiss?
- Shut up.

587
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,030
Seriously, if you don't
bang her by tomorrow,

588
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,240
I'm calling dibs.

589
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,490
Holden:
Okay, listen up.

590
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,080
It's gonna be
a bag of nails in there.

591
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,670
Slim and his boys
got us outnumbered.

592
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,290
On top of that, there's a
family runs this place.

593
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,880
Good people.

594
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,130
We need to make sure that
snake-hearted son of a bitch

595
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,550
- doesn't try to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,430
Risk, reward.
We got it.

597
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,010
Come on. Let's go fuck
these fuckers up.

598
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,720
The fuck is that?

599
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,980
Huh?

600
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,640
- I look like a dog to you?
- No, sir.

601
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,060
Huh? Huh?

602
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,570
Feed that to them.

603
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,990
Slap leather, cocksuckers.

604
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,200
Oh, God!

605
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,830
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

606
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,770
Did I fucking tell you,
or what?

607
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,440
Ah!

608
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,130
Ooh.

609
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,840
Upgrade.

610
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,010
Nice.

611
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,890
Lawrence: Ain't normally
the type to complain,

612
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,810
but this
is just foolhardy.

613
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,980
Two men taking on Wyatt.

614
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,900
Man in Black: Keep talking,
and I'm gonna take

615
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,780
the horse back,
Lawrence.

616
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,820
Wyatt's freaks just wiped
out the last group

617
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,780
that went
seeking him out.

618
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,160
And here we are
riding right after him.

619
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,460
I'm just trying
to convince you

620
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,330
not to get yourself and
me as a bystander killed.

621
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,630
I'm not gonna get
myself killed.

622
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,670
Don't think I didn't
notice that distinction.

623
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:14,660
Looks like Wyatt's men left
somebody behind after all.

624
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,040
Teddy.

625
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,910
I should've guessed.

626
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,880
Please, put me
out of my misery.

627
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,880
I'm sorry, Teddy.

628
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,720
It looks like
misery's all you got.

629
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,350
Slim: <i>Let me out of
this, God damn it!</i>

630
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,560
Logan: That reward is
dead or alive, right?

631
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,560
Holden: Always best to
bring them in alive.

632
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,390
Can we at least gag him?

633
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,610
That's a fine idea.

634
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,070
Whoa.

635
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,200
Slim:
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

636
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,610
Look, I... I know
you're in it for the money.

637
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,740
You ain't no real lawman.

638
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,070
Shut up, you.

639
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,120
Look, my boss,
El Lazo,

640
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,160
he'll pay you twice
what the marshals will

641
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,660
if you cut me loose
and get me to Pariah.

642
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,710
- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt.
- Hey.

643
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,000
These men won't...

644
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,050
What the fuck?!

645
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,840
Logan:
<i>Relax, man.</i>

646
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,390
You have no idea
how lucky we just got.

647
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,220
Lucky? You just shot
an innocent man.

648
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,350
No, he's a robot, just like
her and just like Slim here,

649
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,060
except that Slim
works for El Lazo,

650
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,190
and El Lazo
is our ticket

651
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,190
to the best ride
in the park.

652
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,980
Your bullshit mission led
us right to an Easter egg.

653
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,070
You're not going
to let him go.

654
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,990
Well, well.
Look at you.

655
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,660
You're starting
to grow on me, farm girl.

656
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,080
Now, out of the way.

657
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,160
- Oh.
- Don't you dare.

658
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,960
See?

659
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,170
This is gonna be fun!

660
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,670
Now we're each
gonna have one.

661
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,670
I won't fuck mine
either.

662
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,960
You're disgusting.

663
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,510
Just an acquired taste.

664
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,260
You're gonna grow to
love me, I promise.

665
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,850
Come on. Hmm?

666
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,470
Come on.

667
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,270
Go black hat with me.

668
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,940
Come on, you got to,
you know, save the girl.

669
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,190
Now give me
a little something.

670
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:12,570
What is your problem?

671
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,570
The second we get away
from the real world,

672
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:15,690
you turn
into an evil prick.

673
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,650
Evil?

674
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,870
It's a fucking game,
Billy!

675
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,950
<i>- Don't call me Billy!</i>
- <i>Are you still trying</i> to impress her?

676
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,720
Because I guarantee
she does not give a shit

677
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,950
about how you play
this game.

678
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,210
<i>Do you, Dolores?</i>

679
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,500
What's he talking about,
William?

680
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,790
She will be just fine

681
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,790
with a trip
down the dark side.

682
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,630
And so will you.

683
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,550
Trust me.

684
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,400
So, which way to Pariah?

685
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,190
Oh, you just let me
take it from here.

686
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,030
All right, time for
the floor show.

687
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,160
Got some guests riding
with Hector this time.

688
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:26,310
Stubbs: Let's give them
something to shoot at.

689
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,020
Retask a few
of those soldiers.

690
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,440
Deputy: If you're
riding into our town

691
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,360
under the company
of armed men,

692
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,650
<i>you'll need to state
your business.</i>

693
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,860
Mayhem.

694
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,110
Well, hello there.

695
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,740
I want to talk.

696
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,490
Interesting way
of starting a conversation.

697
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,950
Oh, it's an interesting
kind of day.

698
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,800
Now, my lovely friend,

699
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,630
what deal is it
you want to make?

700
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,350
You're here
for what's in the safe.

701
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,850
Now, how would
you know that?

702
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,970
I can always tell
when a man wants something

703
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,810
that's not on the menu.

704
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,480
<i>I'll give you
the combination</i>

705
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,650
in exchange
for some answers.

706
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,280
<i>You assume
I have any answers.</i>

707
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,320
This world is madness.

708
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,030
I want to know about this.

709
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,910
I've got a couple families
in the homestead

710
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,080
who changed
their itinerary.

711
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,920
They're headed into town.

712
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,830
<i>Should be there
in 20 minutes or so.</i>

713
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,590
<i>The place
is a bloodbath.</i>

714
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,000
Fine.

715
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:22,420
Cut these guys off.

716
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,550
Jam their weapons
and send in the cavalry.

717
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,810
Oh, shit.

718
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,310
We'll give them
a night in lockup,

719
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,900
then have one of the
girls at the Mariposa

720
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,860
bring them a key
hidden in their breakfast.

721
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,990
If the guests are squared
away, let's wrap it up.

722
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,660
This is a shade.

723
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,910
<i>Sacred native lore.</i>

724
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,200
They make
figures of them.

725
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,710
60.

726
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,720
And what does
the shade do?

727
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,140
You've seen this?

728
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,140
What is it?

729
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,680
<i>The man who walks
between worlds.</i>

730
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,560
They were sent from hell
to oversee our world.

731
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,190
47.

732
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,120
Is this the last thing
you required of me?

733
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,750
'Cause we need
a little more time

734
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,420
than the constabulary
will allow.

735
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,590
Sweetheart, if I took that
manner of interest in you,

736
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:47,260
you'd have no say in how
long we'd need whatsoever.

737
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,770
I thought I was crazy,

738
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,310
but I got shot...

739
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,060
here.

740
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,940
There's no wound.

741
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,360
No, but I was shot.

742
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,530
And this
was standing over me.

743
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,110
And then it was
as if it never happened.

744
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,240
I want you to cut me
right there.

745
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,800
I'm not in the habit of cutting
into defenseless women.

746
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,640
Some big, bad outlaw.

747
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,680
The Dreamwalker said there
were some who could see them.

748
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,560
- That it's a blessing from God.
- A blessing?

749
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,320
To see the masters
who pull your strings.

750
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,530
They don't know what
they're talking about.

751
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,920
You'd rather die
lying down or...

752
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,630
up on your feet?

753
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,300
Go to hell.

754
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,480
Go on, then.

755
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,650
This would be
the first goddamn time

756
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,320
I've had to ask a man to
put his hands on me twice.

757
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,690
Sheriff: <i>Open up,
Escaton, or we'll fire.</i>

758
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,310
What does it mean?

759
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,070
That I'm not crazy
after all.

760
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,280
Sheriff:
<i>Last chance, Escaton!</i>

761
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,820
<i>Come out
or we're shooting!</i>

762
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,870
And that
none of this matters.
