1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,000
Are you ready for
the ultimate challenge?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,630
I'm always ready!

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,630
Then you know
what this means!

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,070
Both: syrup race! Ahh...

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,730
Go, sir syrup!
Go, mountie man!

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,500
Go go! Go go!
Almost...Almost...

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,630
Yes! ( coughing )

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,000
I won!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,730
( Coughing )
bleah.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,530
Ho ho, no way!

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,770
Hey, Mabel,
check this out.

12
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,570
Human-sized hamster balls?

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,230
(Gasps) I'm human-sized!

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,670
No, no, Mabel. This.

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,130
We see weirder stuff
than that every day.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,070
We didn't get any photos
of those gnomes, did we?

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,300
Nope, just memories.
And this beard hair.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,430
Why did you save that?
Mm-mm-mm.

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,400
Uhh! good morning,
knuckleheads.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,070
You two know
what day it is?

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,130
Um...happy anniversary?

22
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,670
Mazel tov!
Baah!

23
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,730
It's family fun day,
genius!

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,400
We're cuttin' off work
and havin' one of those,
ya know,

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,370
(sniffing)
bonding-type deals.

26
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,030
Grunkle Stan, is this
gonna be anything like
our last family bonding day?

27
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,530
You call that Ben Franklin?
He looks like a woman!

28
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,670
( Siren wailing )
uh-oh!

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,630
Ohh! the county jail
was so cold.

30
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,430
All right, maybe I haven't been
the best summer caretaker.

31
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,530
But I swear, today we're gonna
have some real family fun.

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,770
Now, who wants to
put on some blindfolds
and get into my car?

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,030
Yay!
yay!

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,200
Wait. what?

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,100
В™єв™є

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,270
в™єв™є

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,430
( tuning radio)

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,730
( Tires screech )
whoa! Whoa!

39
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,370
Blindfolds never lead
to anything good.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,730
Wow. I feel like
all my other senses
are heightened.

41
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,430
I can see
with my fingers.
( Laughing )

42
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,730
Oh!
oh!

43
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,130
Grunkle Stan, are you
wearing a blindfold?

44
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,130
Ha ha! Nah,
but with these cataracts,
i might as well be.

45
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,000
What is that,
a woodpecker?

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
( Kids scream )

47
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,270
Okay, okay,
open 'em up.

48
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,130
Ta-da! it's fishin' season!

49
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,130
Fishing?
what are you playing at,
old man?

50
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,170
You're gonna love it!
The whole town's out here!

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,200
Here, fishy-fishies!
Get into the pan.

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,530
Say "cheese."

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,430
Aaaah!

54
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,230
Uh, is this good?

55
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,470
No!!!

56
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,130
I'll show you how
a real man fishes!

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,570
Grr! aaah!

58
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,130
Ha ha ha ha ha!

59
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,670
Hyeah! uhh!

60
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,270
All:
dead! dead!
Dead! Dead!

61
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,170
Get him!
Get him!

62
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,130
That's some quality
family bonding!

63
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,100
Uncle Stan, why do you
want to bond with us
all of a sudden?

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,030
Come on,
this is gonna be great!

65
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,600
I've never had
fishin' buddies before.

66
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,570
The guys from the lodge
won't go with me.

67
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,000
They don't like
or trust me.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,500
I think he actually wants
to fish with us.

69
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,100
Hey, I know what'll cheer
you sad sacks up.

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,670
Pow! pines family
fishin' hats.

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,200
That's hand-stitching,
ya know.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,370
It's just gonna be you, me,
and those goofy hats
on a boat for ten hours!

73
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,400
Ten hours?!

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,200
I brought the joke book.

75
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,530
No. no!

76
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,170
There has to be
a way out of this.

77
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,730
Man: I seen it!

78
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,500
I seen it again!

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,330
( Panicky grunting )

80
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,230
Hoo hoo hoo!

81
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,330
The gravity falls
gobblewonker!

82
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,230
Come quick before he
scramdoodles away!

83
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,300
( Yipping )
ha ha hoo-ah!

84
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,300
Aw. he's doing
a happy jig.

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,370
No!!! it's a jig
of grave danger!

86
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,200
Hey! hey!
Aaah!

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,470
Now, what did I tell you
about scaring my customers?

88
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,470
This is your
last warning, dad.

89
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,000
But I got proof this time,
by gummity!

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,070
Behold!

91
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,570
It's gobbledywonker
what done did it!

92
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,500
It had a long neck
like a gee-raffe,

93
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,070
and wrinkly skin like--
like this gentleman
right here.
Huh?

94
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,730
It chopped my boat up
to smitheroons!

95
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,130
It shim-shammed over
to scuttlebutt island!

96
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,100
Ya gotta believe me!!!

97
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,070
Attention, all units.

98
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,570
We got ourselves
a crazy old man.

99
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,430
( All laughing )

100
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,730
Aw, donkey spittle!
Banjo Polish...

101
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,470
( Laughter continues )

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,200
Well, that happened.

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,570
Now, let's untie this boat
and get out on that lake!

104
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,170
Mabel, did you hear
what that old dude said?

105
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,170
"Aw, donkey spittle!"

106
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,100
The other thing--
about the monster.

107
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,500
If we can snag a photo of it,
we could split the prize
fifty-fifty.

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
That's two fifties!

109
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,400
Imagine what you could do
with five hundred dollars!

110
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,270
Not so high and mighty anymore.

111
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,100
Ohh.
aha-ha ha ha ha!

112
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,370
( Crash )

113
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,170
Mabel: hey, boys.

114
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,430
You can look...
But you can't touch.

115
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,730
Squeak! squeak!
Squeak! Squeak!

116
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,000
Squeak squeak...

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,770
Both: awesome!

118
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,100
Mabel. Mabel?

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,170
Dipper, I am one million percent
onboard with this!

120
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,430
Grunkle Stan!
Change of plans!

121
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,270
We're taking that boat
to scuttlebutt island,

122
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,730
and we are gonna find
that gobblewonker.

123
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,000
Both:
monster hunt!
Monster hunt!

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,330
Monster--
old man: Monster hunt!

125
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,300
Monster--eh--

126
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,430
I'll go.

127
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,200
( Boat horn blows )

128
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,370
You dudes say something
about a monster hunt?

129
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,100
Zeus!
what's up, hambone?

130
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
Kapoosh!
pow! explode!

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,270
Dude, you could totally
use my boat for your hunt.

132
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,230
It's got a steering wheel,
chairs-- normal boat stuff.

133
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,200
All right,
let's think this through.

134
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,130
You kids could go
waste your time

135
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,100
on some epic
monster-finding
adventure,

136
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,770
or you could spend the day
learning how to tie knots
and skewer worms

137
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,200
with your great
uncle Stan!

138
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,500
В™є ( techno music ) в™є

139
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,130
в™є ( banjo music ) в™є

140
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,430
в™є ( heroic music ) в™є

141
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,400
so, whaddya say?

142
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,200
( Kids cheering )

143
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Mabel: we made
the right choice!

144
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,400
Ingrates!
ah, who needs 'em?

145
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,100
I got a whole box
of creepy fishin' lures
to keep me company.

146
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,230
( Flies buzzing )

147
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,600
Uhh!

148
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,330
Hoist the anchor!

149
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,570
Raise the flag!

150
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,370
Mabel: we're gonna find
that gobblewonker!

151
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,000
Dipper: we're gonna win
that photo contest!

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,270
Zeus: do any of you dudes
have sunscreen?

153
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,170
Dipper: we're gonna...
Go get sunscreen!

154
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,400
All: yay!

155
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,230
( Deep growling )

156
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,270
All right, if we want to
win this contest,

157
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,730
we've gotta do it right.

158
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,430
Think. what the #1 problem
with most monster hunts?

159
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,770
You're a side character
and you die in the first
five minutes of the movie.

160
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,530
Dude, am I a side character?
Do you ever think about
stuff like that?

161
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,430
No, no, no--
camera trouble.

162
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,270
Say bigfoot shows up.
Zeus, be bigfoot.

163
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,570
There he is! Bigfoot!

164
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,770
Uh-oh! no camera!

165
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,670
Oh, wait! Here's one!

166
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,200
Aw, no film!

167
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,630
You see what
I'm doing here?

168
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,470
Uh-huh.
dude's got a point.

169
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,530
That's why I bought
seventeen disposable cameras.

170
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,330
Two on my ankle,
three in my jacket,

171
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,370
four for each of you,
three extras in this bag,

172
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,100
and one under my hat.

173
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
There's no way
we're gonna miss this.

174
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,630
Okay, everybody,
let's test our cameras out.

175
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,370
Ahh! dude!

176
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,170
You see? This is exactly
why you need backup cameras.

177
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,200
We still have sixteen.

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,400
Ahh! bird!

179
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Fifteen. okay, guys,
i repeat, don't lose
your cameras.

180
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,530
Wait. lose the cameras?
Don't!

181
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,130
Dude, I just
threw two away.

182
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,230
Thirteen!

183
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,700
All right, we still
have thirteen camera--

184
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
( crunch )

185
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,330
Twelve. we have
twelve cameras.

186
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,330
So what's the plan?
Throw more cameras overboard
or what?

187
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,400
No! no. Okay.

188
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,430
You'll be lookout,
Zeus can work
the steering wheel,

189
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,200
and I'll be captain.
What?!

190
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,300
Why do you
get to be captain?

191
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,400
What about Mabel, huh?

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,270
Ma-bel! ma-bel!

193
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,670
Ma-bel! ma-bel!

194
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,270
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

195
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,630
What about co-captain?

196
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,300
There's no such thing
as co-captain.

197
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,600
Ohh. whoops!

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,770
Okay, fine!
You can be co-captain!

199
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,370
Can I be associate
co-captain?

200
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,770
As co-captain,
i authorize that request.

201
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,330
Well, as first co-captain,
our #1 order of business

202
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,370
is to lure the monster out
with this.

203
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,370
Permission
to taste some?

204
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,500
Granted.
permission co-granted.

205
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,670
Permission
associate go-granted.

206
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,130
( Grunts )

207
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,000
( Gagging )

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,270
( Laughing )
dude, I don't know what
i expected that to taste like.

209
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,100
Traitors!
I'll find my own
fishin' buddies.

210
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,400
( Mabel laughing )

211
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,470
Ah!

212
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,730
( Starts engine )
there's my new pals!

213
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,570
( Exhales )

214
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,500
Now that we're alone,
rosanna,

215
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,270
there's a burning question
which my heart longs
to ask of you.

216
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,400
Oh, Reginald!
Stan: Hey!

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Wanna hear a joke?

218
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,330
Here goes.

219
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:31,670
My ex-wife still
misses me,

220
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,700
but her aim
is gettin' better!

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,070
Her aim is
gettin' better!

222
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,130
Ya see, it's--
it's funny because
marriage is terrible.

223
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,300
What?!

224
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,370
Hey, how's it going?

225
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,130
It's going awesome.

226
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,730
В™є bow bow, ba-bow bow в™є

227
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,330
Mabel,
leave that thing alone.

228
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,430
Aw, I don't mind none!

229
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,230
Hey, look,
I'm drinking water!

230
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,630
В™є grinkle, grinkle,
little-- в™є

231
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,400
( coughing,
choking )

232
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Aren't you supposed
to be doing lookout?

233
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,170
Look out!

234
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,270
Ha ha!

235
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,400
But seriously,
I'm on it.

236
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,500
( Crash )
whoa!
Whoa!

237
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,270
See? we're here.

238
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm a lookout genius!

239
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,030
Hamster ball,
here we come!

240
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,400
( Owl hooting)

241
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,330
Dude, check it out.

242
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,430
Butt island.

243
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,070
Zeus, you
rapscallion!

244
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,070
Hey, why aren't you laughing?

245
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,200
Are you scared?

246
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,430
Yeah, right. I'm not--

247
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,170
yeah, you are!
Hey--

248
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,400
quit it--

249
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,600
stop, Mabel!
Uhh! Uhh!

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,330
( Blubbering )

251
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,270
( Loud growling )
( Both gasp )

252
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,330
Dude, did you guys
hear that?

253
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,400
What was that?
Was it your stomach?

254
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,270
No, my stomach
normally sounds
like whale noises.

255
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,030
( Whale calls )

256
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,670
Wow! so majestic!

257
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,730
( Gasps )

258
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,230
Our lantern!

259
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,500
Ahh! I can't see anything!

260
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,600
Dude, I don't know, man,
maybe this isn't worth it.

261
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,270
Not worth it?
Guys, imagine
what would happen

262
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,230
if we got that picture!

263
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,200
Tonight, we're here
with adventure-seeker
Dipper pines

264
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,000
who bravely photographed
the elusive gobblewonker.

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,770
Tell me, Dipper,
what's the secret
to your success?

266
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,670
Well, I run away from nothing...

267
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,100
Nothing except for
when I ran away from
my annoying grunkle Stan

268
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,770
who I ditched in order
to pursue that lake monster.

269
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,130
How right you were to do so.
He looked like a real
piece of work.

270
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,670
I don't often do this,
but I feel the need to
give you an award.

271
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,670
( Crash )
Charlie!

272
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,430
( Panting )

273
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,000
Why won't you interview me?!

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,300
( All screaming )

275
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,770
I'm in!
Me too!

276
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,370
( Panting )

277
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,530
All right, dudes,
I'm comin!

278
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,730
( Zeus making beat-box sounds )

279
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,530
( Rapping )
в™є my name is mable,
it rhymes with "table" в™є

280
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,470
в™є it also rhymes
with "glable" в™є

281
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,470
в™є it also rhymes
with "schmable" в™є

282
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,630
dude, we should be
writing this down.

283
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,600
Guys! guys, guys.
You hear something?
( Deep growling )

284
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,230
( Birds cawing )

285
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,230
(Gasps)
this is it.
This is it!

286
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,270
Uh. uh...
This is cooooool!

287
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh!

288
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,070
Everyone...
get your cameras ready.

289
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,270
( Camera powers up )

290
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,100
Ready? go!

291
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,500
Whaaaaa!

292
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,530
Aaaaaah!

293
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,600
But-- but what was
that noise, then?

294
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,370
I heard a monster noise.

295
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,430
( Growling )

296
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,070
( Growling continues )

297
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,330
Sweet! beaver with a chainsaw!

298
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,670
Maybe that old guy
was crazy after all.

299
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,070
He did use
the word "scrapdoodle."

300
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,000
( Growling continues )
( Sighs )

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,370
Look, when you're
threading the line--

302
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,630
a lot of people
don't know this--

303
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,470
but you want to use
a barrel knot.

304
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,130
That's a secret
from one fishin' buddy
to another.

305
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,330
Heh heh!
Uh...

306
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,670
I, uh--
who are you, exactly?

307
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,130
Just call me
your grunkle Stan!

308
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,300
Woman: sir-- sir!

309
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,070
Why are you talking
to our son?!

310
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,030
If you don't leave right now,
I'm calling the police!

311
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,400
Ha ha! Ya see,
the thing about that is--

312
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,070
arrrr!
go bother
your own kids!

313
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,430
Zeus: ooh, yeah,
work it, work it!
Nice! Nice!

314
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,470
Give me
another one of those.
Yeah, I like that one.

315
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,270
What are we gonna say
to grunkle Stan?

316
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,530
We ditched him
over nothing.

317
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,170
( Sighs )
( Low booming sound )

318
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,770
Hey. guys,
do you feel that?

319
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,330
Wha--
hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa!

320
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,700
Aaah!

321
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,730
This is it!

322
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,630
Come on,
this is our chance!

323
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,600
What's wrong
with you guys?

324
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,770
Dipper...
dude...

325
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,430
It's not that hard,
all right?

326
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,570
All you gotta do
is point and shoot.
Like this.

327
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,270
( Roaring )

328
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,570
Run!

329
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,470
Get back to the boat!
Hurry!!!

330
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,600
Aaah! ooh!

331
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,500
The picture!

332
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,270
Dude, if it makes you
feel any better,

333
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,630
I got tons of pictures
of those beavers, dude!

334
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,430
Why would that make me
feel better?!

335
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,200
Let's get out of here,
dudes!

336
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,630
All right,
this is it!

337
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,500
Cracked lens?!
Zeus, get a photo!

338
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,600
Hyuh! nyeah! Nyeah!

339
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,300
Unhh!
what are you doing?!

340
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,730
I still got one left.
Don't worry, dude. Here.

341
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,230
Aaah!

342
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,470
( Roaring )

343
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,400
Whoa!
aaah!

344
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,500
Go go go go go!

345
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,170
( Roaring )

346
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,000
Grr! gaa!
Mollycoddling--

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,700
boy: can you please tell me
more funny stories, pop-pop?

348
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,370
Anything for
my fishin' buddies!
Ho ho ho ho!

349
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,130
Arghh!

350
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:37,030
Pop-pop, I just weawized
that...I wuv you.

351
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,230
Aw, come on!
Boo! Boo!

352
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,670
Hey, there!
What's the big idea?

353
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,400
Maybe has no one
who wuvs him, pop-pop.

354
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,730
Yeah, well, i-i--

355
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,300
nahh!

356
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,500
Ahhh.

357
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,270
Zeus! beavers!

358
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Aaaaah!!!

359
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,070
Ohh! beavers--
( Shouting )

360
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,330
Aaah! oooooh...

361
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,470
Aaaah!

362
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,300
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow
ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

363
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,000
( Beaver shrieks )

364
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,430
Headlock!
dead! dead! Dead!

365
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,230
( Gasping )

366
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,370
The fishes?!
They seek revenge!

367
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,300
Swim, boys, swim!!!

368
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,270
( Beaver chattering )
aaah! Look out!

369
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,470
Easy, easy...

370
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,630
My glass!

371
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,330
Where do I go?!

372
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,500
( Grunting )

373
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Um-- uh--
go to the falls!

374
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,300
I think there might be
a cave behind there!
"Might" be?!

375
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,270
( All scream )

376
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,470
Brr. ahh.
Ooh.
Ahhh.

377
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,230
( All scream )

378
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,570
( Roaring )

379
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,230
It's stuck!

380
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,700
Ha ha! Yeah!

381
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,270
Wait. it's stuck?

382
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,700
( Gasping )

383
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,030
Boop.
ha ha ha!

384
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,330
( Dipper laughing )

385
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,700
Did you get
a good one?

386
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,370
They're all good ones!

387
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,070
Whoo-hoo!
hamster ball!

388
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,600
( Electrical crackling )

389
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,230
What the--?

390
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,070
Huh?

391
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,670
Uh!
Mabel: what's wrong?

392
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,330
( Metallic clanking )
hmm.

393
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,500
Zeus:
careful, dude!

394
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,630
I've got this! Hold on!

395
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,700
Hey, guys!
Come check this out!

396
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,400
( All coughing )

397
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Work them bellows
in the-- huh?!

398
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,300
Aw, banjo Polish!

399
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,130
Wha-- you?

400
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,000
You made this?

401
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,070
Wha--why?

402
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,470
Well, i--

403
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,670
I, uh...

404
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,430
I just wanted attention!

405
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,270
I still don't understand.

406
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,770
Well, first I just
hootenannied up

407
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,700
a bio-mechanical
brain wave generator,

408
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,070
and then I learned to operate
a stick shift with my beard.

409
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,230
Okay, yeah,
but why did you do it?

410
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,730
Well, when you get to be
an old fella like me,

411
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,030
nobody pays any attention
to you anymore.

412
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,770
My own son hasn't
visited me in months!

413
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,730
So I figured maybe
I'd catch his fancy

414
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,070
with a 15-ton
aquatic robot.

415
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,270
Wha-ha-ha-ha!
aha-ha-ha!

416
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,600
Aha-ha! aha-ha--
ahh...

417
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,500
In retrospect,
it seems a bit contrived.

418
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,430
You just don't know the lengths
us old-timers go through

419
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,530
for a little quality time
with our family.

420
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,530
( Both sigh )
Zeus: Dude.

421
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,500
I guess
the real lake monster
is you two. Heh heh.

422
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,530
Sorry, it just, like, boom,
just popped into my head here.

423
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,200
So...did you ever
talk to your son about
how you felt?

424
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,530
No, sir, I got to work
straight on the robot.

425
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,500
I made lots of robots
in my day.

426
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,670
Like when my wife left me
and I created a homicidal
pterodactyl-tron,

427
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,330
or when my pal Ernie didn't come
to my retirement party

428
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,470
and I constructed
an 80-ton shame-bot

429
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,770
that exploded
the entire downtown area!

430
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,300
Aha-ha-ha-ha!

431
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,370
Aha-- well, time to get back
to work on my death ray!

432
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,600
( Jackhammer, sawing,
drilling )

433
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
Any you kids
got a screwdriver?

434
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,530
Well, so much for
the photo contest.

435
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,470
We still have
one roll of film left.

436
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,770
What do you want
to do with it?

437
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,500
Ahh.

438
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Dipper:
hey! over here!

439
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,630
What the-- kids?

440
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,070
I thought you two were off
playin' spin the bottle
with Zeus.

441
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,470
Well, we spent all day trying
to find a legendary dinosaur.

442
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,700
But we realized
the only dinosaur
we want to hang out with

443
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,400
is right here.

444
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,370
Save your sympathy!

445
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,200
I been having a great time
without ya--

446
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,570
makin' friends,
talkin' to my reflection--

447
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,300
I had a run-in with
the lake police!

448
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,630
Guess I gotta wear
this ankle bracelet now,
so that'll be fun.

449
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,430
So I guess there
isn't room in that boat
for three more?

450
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,500
You knuckleheads
ever seen me thread a hook
with my eyes closed?

451
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,670
Five bucks says
you can't do it.
You're on!

452
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,500
Five more bucks
says you can't do it
with your eyes closed

453
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,670
plus me singing at
the top of my lungs!

454
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,070
I like those odds!

455
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,500
Whoa! what happened
to your shirt?
Long story, dude.

456
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,130
All right.
Everybody get together,
say "fishing."

457
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,300
Fishing!
fishing!

458
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,330
Dude,
am I in the frame?

459
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,500
Whaa!

460
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,470
What was that?
Mm-mm.

461
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,070
Who wants to hear a joke?
Dipper: Not me.

462
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,030
Huh huh! Yeah, you do!
Here it goes.

463
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,130
Why did the pelican

464
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,730
get kicked out
the restaurant?

465
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,070
I don't care.

466
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,630
Because he had
a very big bill!

467
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,500
В™є la la la la в™є
yuk yuk yuk!
Ooh. Boo.

468
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Blah blah bluh.
Bad joke. Bad pelican joke.
