1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,583
I'm gonna say b-five.

2
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,614
Miss!

3
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,416
Wop!

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,717
I don't think you're
playing this right.

5
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,519
Stan:
kids! come quick!

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,520
( Chuckling )

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,352
I need you to laugh
at this with me!

8
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:23,654
В™є who's cute as a button,
and always your friend? В™є

9
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:26,427
в™є 'lil g-i-d to the e-o-n! В™є

10
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,528
wink!

11
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,130
Announcer: lil' Gideon.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,401
Ugh, Gideon.

13
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:31,602
Remember when
i wouldn't date him,

14
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:33,164
and he tried
to destroy us?

15
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:35,706
He's always trying to trick me
into losing the mystery shack!

16
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:38,139
One time, I caught him
stealing my moisturizer.

17
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:41,312
And yet, our mutual hatred
for him bonds us together.

18
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:42,573
( Laughing )

19
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:43,674
Announcer:
come on down to

20
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:45,716
'lil Gideon's tent
of telepathy.

21
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:47,718
Opening soon at this location.

22
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,722
Uh, should we be
worried about that?

23
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:54,285
Please. the only way
Gideon's taking over this shack

24
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:56,357
is by breaking in
and stealing my deed.

25
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:57,758
( Crashing, breaking glass )

26
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,490
You mean like right now?

27
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,691
Uh, thirty-eight?

28
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,134
Forty-one?
oh, heavens to Betsy!

29
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:05,466
Gideon!

30
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,668
Well, well,
Stanford!

31
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,300
My arch Nemesis.

32
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,371
We seem to have entered

33
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,772
a dangerous game
of cat and mouse.

34
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,574
But the question remains,

35
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,676
who is the cat,
and who is the--

36
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,578
Soos, broom.

37
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,150
Oh, no,
not the broom!

38
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,711
( Grunting )

39
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:23,083
( Hisses )

40
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,085
( Squealing )

41
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,618
You Mark my words,
Stanford!

42
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:30,261
One day I'm gonna get
that combination!

43
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,123
And once I steal that deed

44
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:35,526
you'll never see
the mystery shack again!

45
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:37,498
Good luck, bucko!

46
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,176
Ha! the combo to this safe
is in the one place

47
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,608
he'll never find it, my brain!

48
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:57,248
Your brain isn't as safe as you
might think, Stanford pines!

49
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,689
This is the last straw.

50
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,692
It's time to unlock
the journal's greatest secret.

51
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:08,599
В™єв™є

52
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,171
announcer:
he put the "old" in old west.

53
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,805
They call him...
В™є grandpa the kid! В™є

54
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:57,278
I'm tired during the day.

55
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,749
I can relate to this.

56
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:00,551
Grunkle Stan,
why can't we watch a movie

57
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:03,183
that we'll all enjoy?
Dream boy high!

58
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,955
Where love is on
your permanent record.

59
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,186
All: boo!

60
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,388
You'll learn
to like it.

61
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,659
( Clanging, yelling )

62
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,861
Dudes!
there's a bat in the kitchen!

63
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:14,865
It tried to touch me with
its weird little bat fingers.

64
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:17,228
Don't worry,
i got this under control.

65
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,529
Dipper, take care of it.

66
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,401
( Chuckles )
yes!

67
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,872
What?
why can't Mabel do it?

68
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:22,973
'Cause life ain't fair.

69
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,306
Now go fight a bat
so we can watch TV.

70
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,437
No way,
grunkle Stan.

71
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,479
You always make me
do dumb chores.

72
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,611
I'm putting my foot
down this time.

73
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,314
I said, do it, kid!
Now!

74
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,315
( Growls )

75
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,317
( Growls )

76
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,890
( Both continue growling )

77
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,221
Okay, I'll do it!

78
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,523
( Sighs )

79
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:47,258
Stupid chores.

80
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:50,731
Remember, bats are more afraid
of you than you are of them.

81
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:53,664
Maybe I'm thinking of ducklings.

82
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,366
( Dipper screaming )

83
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,438
Ducklings.
( chuckles )
quack, quack.

84
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,409
Quack, quack, quack.

85
00:03:58,409 --> 00:03:59,670
Dipper:
ow, ow!

86
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,941
В™є swabbin' on
disinfectant в™є

87
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,373
в™є doo-do-doo в™є

88
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:04,745
( sighs ) why does grunkle Stan
always pick on me?

89
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,348
Think about it, the more painful
or difficult the chore is,

90
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,350
the more likely it is
I'll have to do it.

91
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,881
Why doesn't he pick on you guys?

92
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:13,924
Dipper, Stan's personality is
one of life's great mysteries.

93
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:16,427
Like whether or not it's
possible to lick your own elbow.

94
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:17,888
I bet you can't.
I bet I can.

95
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:18,929
( Chanting )
lick it!
Lick it!

96
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,260
Lick it!

97
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,563
Sometimes I feel
like Stan hates me.

98
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,295
Stan: the sink's clogged!

99
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:25,566
Dipper, get in here and fix it!

100
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,567
( Growls )

101
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,946
You think that combination's
safe in your mind, Stanford?

102
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:39,480
We'll see what my new Minion
has to say about that.

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,852
"Triangulum. entangulum.

104
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,914
"Veneforis Dominus ventium.

105
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:45,956
Veneforis venetisarium!"

106
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:47,858
( Chanting )
lick that elbow!
Lick that elbow!

107
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:50,491
Like the infinite horizon,
it eludes my grasp.

108
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:51,622
( Evil laughter
in the distance )

109
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:54,365
Is that who
i think it is?

110
00:04:54,365 --> 00:04:56,627
( Gideon grunting )

111
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:59,600
( Indistinct chanting )

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,872
( Thunder )

113
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:03,003
( Chanting continues )

114
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:07,538
( Croaks )

115
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:15,646
( Evil laughing )

116
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,923
Oh! oh! Gravity falls,
it is good to be back!

117
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,955
Name's bill cipher.

118
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:25,956
And I take it you're some kind

119
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,698
of living ventriloquist dummy?

120
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:29,059
( Laughs ) I'm just kidding,

121
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,461
I know who you are, Gideon.

122
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,902
What-- what are you?

123
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:33,033
H-- how do you know my name?

124
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,035
Oh, I know lot of things.

125
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,838
( Distorted voice )
lots of things.

126
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,510
( Normal voice )
hey, look what I can do.

127
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,676
Deer teeth, for you, kid!

128
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:46,717
( Laughs )

129
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,519
( Gasps )
you're insane!

130
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,020
Sure, I am!
What's your point?

131
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,056
( Grunting )

132
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,357
Listen to me, demon!

133
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,659
I have a job for you!

134
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,831
I need you to enter
the mind of Stanford pines

135
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,893
and steal the code to his safe!

136
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:04,134
( Soos gasps )

137
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:06,036
( Laughs )
wait.

138
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,998
Stan pines.

139
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,072
You know what, kid,
you've convinced me.

140
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,103
I'm sold!

141
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,875
I'll help you with this,
and in return,

142
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,947
you can help me
with something I've
been working on.

143
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,879
We'll work out
the details later.

144
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,010
Deal.

145
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,055
Well, time to invade
Stan's mind.

146
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:25,916
This should be fun!

147
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,888
Remember,
reality is an illusion,

148
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,760
the universe is a hologram,
buy gold!

149
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,861
Bye!

150
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,596
( Gasps )

151
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,897
( Both gasp )

152
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,898
It worked!

153
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,070
( Evil cackling )

154
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,034
( Snoring )

155
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,437
( Muttering )
no. Sorry.

156
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:48,839
What is going on
in that guy's head?

157
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,941
( Panting ) Dipper!

158
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:52,412
We've gotta help Stan!

159
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,544
Wait, what?

160
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,646
( Chewing )
this evil triangle guy

161
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:57,147
said he's gonna
break into Stan's mind,

162
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:58,989
and steal the combination
to his safe!

163
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,952
Also, we stopped for
snacks on the way here.

164
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:03,454
Triangle guy?

165
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:07,157
I feel like I've seen something
like this before in the journal.

166
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:08,729
Dipper: "beware bill.

167
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,831
"The most powerful
and dangerous creature

168
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,032
"I've ever encountered.

169
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,067
Whatever you do,
never let him into your mind."

170
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,168
( Grunts )

171
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:20,070
( Gasps )
grunkle Stan!

172
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,916
( Grunting and yelling )

173
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,218
"It is possible
to follow the demon

"into a person's mind
and prevent his chaos.

00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:32,953
One must simply recite
this incantation."

176
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,454
( Sighs )
this is just great.

177
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,928
I spend all day cleaning sinks
and fighting bats for Stan,

178
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,160
and now I have to save him
from some crazy brain demon?

179
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,632
But if we don't do anything,

180
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:43,794
Gideon might steal
the shack, or worse!

181
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,035
( Yelling )

182
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:46,466
( Sighs )
fine.

183
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,168
Get ready, guys.
We're about to journey

184
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,070
into the most horrifying,
disturbing place

185
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,902
any of us have ever been.

186
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:53,674
Our uncle's mind.

187
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,106
( Thunder )

188
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,779
You think I can take
these burrito bites
into Stan's brain?

189
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,811
Thumbs up, thumbs down?

190
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,753
You know what?
I'm just gonna bring them.

191
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:06,787
( Stan snoring )
okay, guys.

192
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,619
In order to save our uncle,

193
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:10,891
we're going to have to follow
that dream demon into his mind.

194
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,663
I wonder what Stan's
thinking about right now.

195
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,566
( High-pitched voice )
i love Soos like a son.

196
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:16,667
Soos!
this is serious!

197
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,668
( High-pitched voice )
sowee.

198
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:19,630
( Soos and Mabel laughing )

199
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,571
Both: yeah!

200
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,273
Let's do this!

201
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,705
( Snoring )

202
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:25,806
"Fidentus omnium.

203
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,007
"Magis omentium.

204
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,679
"Magnesuim adharminum.

205
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,580
"Magnum opus.

206
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,781
"Habeas corpus.

207
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,613
"Insectus nominus overratus.

208
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,615
"Magis tremensium.
Magis tremensium.

209
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,116
Magis tremensium!"

210
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:43,293
Oh, wow!
Whoa!

211
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,595
Oh, what the--

212
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:54,565
whoa!
this is Stan's mind?

213
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,808
Huh. figured there would
be a lot more hot old ladies.

214
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:58,939
Mabel: remember, everyone,

215
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,711
we've got to look out
for the triangle guy.

216
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,813
Yeah, look out for
the triangle guy!

217
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,274
It's him!
It's the guy!

218
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,076
You leave our
uncle's brain alone,

219
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,748
you isosceles monster!

220
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,719
( Yelling )

221
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,625
Gotcha!

222
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,256
Wait. what?

223
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,759
Ah, Stan's family,
we meet at last.

224
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,731
Question Mark,
shooting star, pine tree,

225
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,292
I had a hunch
i might bump into you.

226
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,665
( Screams )

227
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,266
( Panting )

228
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,638
Mabel: boop!

229
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:29,139
(Soos and Mabel laugh )
Mabel!

230
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,171
What do you want with
our uncle's mind anyway?

231
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,943
Oh, just the code
to the old man's safe!

232
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,175
Inside the shack is
a maze of a thousand doors

233
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,047
representing
your uncle's memories.

234
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:40,110
Behind one of them is a memory
of him inputting the code.

235
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,281
I just need to find it

236
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,253
and Gideon will
pay me handsomely!

237
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,755
Not if we stop you!

238
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:46,116
Ha!
fat chance!

239
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,988
I'm the master of the mind.

240
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,020
I even know what
you're thinking right now.

241
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,161
That's impossible!

242
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,863
No one can guess
what I'm thinking!

243
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:56,767
Whoa!
where are we, bro?

244
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,830
We must be in heaven,
'cause I just saw an angel.

245
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,732
I'm never letting go
of your leg!

246
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:03,073
You're out of your league, kids.

247
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:06,176
Turn around now, before you
see something you might regret.

248
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,678
Later, suckers!

249
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,841
We're going in.

250
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:13,043
Mabel, can we leave
those guys out here?

251
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:15,385
Looking at them hurts my eyes.

252
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:17,617
No!
they can help us!

253
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,020
Xyler and craz:
Totally! Arm throne!

254
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,052
( Mabel giggles )

255
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,655
( Sighs )
dude, arm throne!

256
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,157
Arm throne!
Ah!

257
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,930
Xyler and craz: Whoa!
Mabel: Neato!

258
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,203
Craz: radical!
Xyler:
I also think it's radical!

259
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,968
Stan: no refunds!
No refunds!

260
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:39,069
( Echoing ) no refunds!
No refunds!

261
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,410
( Growling )

262
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:44,915
( Stan speaking indistinctly )

263
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:48,648
Soos: whoa, look!
All of Stan's memories.

264
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,180
Great, sure there's
plenty of memories

265
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,421
of Stan bossing me around.

266
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:52,723
Can't wait to see more of that!

267
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:53,984
Come on, Dipper.

268
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,786
We've gotta find the code
before bill does.

269
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:56,987
Mabel is talking!

270
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:58,689
So rad!

271
00:10:58,689 --> 00:10:59,690
Let's get searching!

272
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,291
( Panting )

273
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,235
Jorge, rico,

274
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:07,397
you're the two best
Colombian prison friends

275
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:08,398
a fella could make.

276
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,403
Nope.

277
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:16,306
Sir, would you like
to buy a Stan vac vacuum?

278
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,409
Stan vac: It sucks more
than anything.

279
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:20,951
Gotta work on that.

280
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:22,212
Nope.

281
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:26,717
Whoa!
it's Stan on a date!

282
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:30,260
So, your, uh,
your eye is weird.

283
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,062
Let's, let's talk
about that.

284
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:34,224
( Laughing )

285
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,766
( Both laughing )

286
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:38,698
This is going terrible.

287
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,070
I can't think
of anything to say,

288
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,773
and she looks weird up close.

289
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:44,735
Think of a way out.

290
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:47,337
Non-specific excuse!

291
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,139
( Grunts, panting )

292
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,082
Yeesh!

293
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,714
Look, guys.
Memories about me.

294
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,087
That doesn't seem
like a good idea.

295
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,119
I just want to know
what the old guy
really thinks of me.

296
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,321
We already know how
Stan feels about us,

297
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,223
he loves us!
We're great.

298
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,354
Yeah, let's
just keep moving.

299
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:06,026
More moving?
Yes!

300
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,958
I love motion!

301
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:18,108
Okay, just a quick peek.

302
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,409
Stan: Dipper, my back itches,
can you scratch it?

303
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,311
Dipper, clean the boiler!

304
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,013
( Stan laughs )

305
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,014
No buts!

306
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,876
Now go chop that
firewood already!

307
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,517
Ah!

308
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,921
Dude, Stan, I been
meaning to ask you.

309
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:32,783
Why are you so hard on
Dipper all the time?

310
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:34,925
Look, Soos, I'm gonna
let you in on something.

311
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:36,526
You wanna know what
i really think?

312
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,528
( Indistinct whispering )

313
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:40,861
The kid's a loser.
He's weak.

314
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,493
He's an utter embarrassment.

315
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,836
I just want to get rid of him.

316
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:55,175
Hello, code to Stan's safe,
where are you?

317
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,547
Opening and closing
doors is fun.

318
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:59,379
I can do it also!

319
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:04,084
If only people knew the truth.

320
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,886
That hidden behind
this vending machine,

321
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,018
I secretly have a--
boring!

322
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,120
All right, guys,

323
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,492
I have a good feeling
about this door.

324
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:15,365
Hey, Mr. tummy.

325
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,967
( High-pitched voice )
hey, Mr. Stan!

326
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:18,128
( Normal ) are you hungry?

327
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,529
( High-pitched voice ) yes.

328
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:21,501
( Normal ) eat your crackers!
Soos: Ugh!

329
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,173
( High-pitched voice
chomping and giggling )

330
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,574
Sweet Sally.

331
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:25,936
Oh, we've been
searching forever.

332
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,578
What if the triangle guy
finds the memory before we do?

333
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:31,581
If we wanna find Stan's memory,
we gotta think like Stan.

334
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,513
He's always hiding stuff, right?

335
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,515
Yeah, like how he hides
his arrest warrants

336
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,917
under that rug in the gift shop?

337
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,488
Soos, that's it!
Look!

338
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,355
( All gasp )

339
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,432
There ya go.

340
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,833
And now to input the code.

341
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,467
Thirteen, forty-four,
and finally--

342
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,309
dude, we found it!
Yeah!

343
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,570
Guys: but what
do we do now?

344
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,611
Jinx!

345
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:03,974
Um, um, let's just
destroy the door

346
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:05,445
before bill can find it.

347
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,950
Wait!
maybe I should do it!

348
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,452
My big fat arms are great
at destroying stuff.

349
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,523
Oh, okay.

350
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,529
Hey, guys!

351
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,530
I just saw
a memory of Stan

352
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,492
roller skating
and wearing short-shorts!

353
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:24,264
Didn't look--didn't look
half bad.

354
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:27,397
Hey, something weird
is going on here.

355
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,399
( Laughs )

356
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:32,542
( All gasp )

357
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,144
Boy, you kids sure are gullible!

358
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,206
I knew you'd lead me
straight to the code!

359
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:39,579
( Evil laughing )

360
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,481
It's funny how dumb you are.

361
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:46,456
The combination to Stan's safe!

362
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,558
Boy, that was even easier
than I thought.

363
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:49,589
Oh, yeah?

364
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,221
Well, you're a...

365
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,892
A stink-face!

366
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,594
Awesome comeback, Mabel!

367
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,266
Don't treat me
like a child, xyler.

368
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,198
Later, suckers!
( All yell )

369
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,271
Come on, we've got to save Stan!

370
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:03,203
Dipper:
what's the point?

371
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,205
Why should I save him, huh?

372
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,636
I work for Stan day and night,

373
00:15:06,636 --> 00:15:10,140
and all he does in return is
say he wants to get rid of me.

374
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,582
Dipper, I'm sure
that's not true.

375
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,145
I saw it with my own eyes
in one of his memories, Mabel!

376
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,187
He's always picked on me
and now I know why!

377
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,548
Stan hates me!

378
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:19,619
( All gasp )

379
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,521
Dipper, it doesn't
matter what you saw.

380
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,154
If we don't stop bill,
we'll lose the shack!

381
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,256
No, you know what?
Not this time.

382
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,099
For once, this is one of Stan's
problems I'm not gonna fix.

383
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,661
Fine!
come on, Soos.

384
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:33,964
We'll save Stan ourselves!

385
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:37,137
Dipper, you're a cool dude,
but this isn't cool, dude.

386
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,438
Craz:
let's go, xyler!

387
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,110
Xyler:
all right, craz!

388
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,141
Those are our names!

389
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,619
( Phone ringing )

390
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,581
Yello?
bill!

391
00:15:51,581 --> 00:15:53,953
Did you find the memory
with the combination yet?

392
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,156
Relax, shortstack,
i got it right here.

393
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,727
( Laughs )
perfect!

394
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:58,989
Now give it to me

395
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,560
and I'll fulfill
my end of the bargain.

396
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,692
Finally! it's--
you got a pen there?

397
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:06,666
It's thirteen, forty-four--

398
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,239
ah! no, no, wait!
No!

399
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:11,171
Stan: none more bottomless
than the bottomless pit.

400
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,273
Which, as you can see here,
is bottomless.

401
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,076
Whoo! whatever that was,
it's gone forever.

402
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:19,209
Ha ha! Boom!

403
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,410
Xyler and craz:
Mabel did it!

404
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,481
The shack is safe!

405
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
The deal's off!

406
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,613
Wait. no! Wait!

407
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,285
I'm switching to plan b!

408
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:30,760
You!

409
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,024
You can't even imagine
what you just cost me!

410
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,196
Do you have
any idea what I'm like

411
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,528
( distorted )
when I'm mad?

412
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,312
( Mabel gasps )

413
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,314
Soos: so I guess he gets
really mad when he gets mad.

414
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,646
Eat nightmares!

415
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,118

416
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,590
( Grunts ) how do i
get out of this place?

417
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,453
Exit? hello?

418
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:07,697
Ah, this again?

419
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:09,259
Stan: he's a loser.
He's weak.

420
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,261
I just want to
get rid of him.

421
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,232
( Chuckles )

422
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,235
Yeah, those are all
things people said

423
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:16,306
about me when I was a boy.

424
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:17,307
Huh?

425
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:18,668
It was terrible.

426
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,640
I was the biggest wimp
on the playground.

427
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:24,144
( Whimpers )

428
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,316
( Laughing )
( Crying )

429
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:30,320
Stan: so one summer my pop
signs me up for boxing lessons.

430
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,282
And it was even worse
than the schoolyard!

431
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,124
Left hook!

432
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:39,089
You know, at the time, I thought
my pop was trying to torture me.

433
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:40,190
But wouldn't you know it?

434
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,192
The old man was doin' me
a favor all along.

435
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,193
Give me that bag!

436
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:44,294
Help!

437
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,065

Left hook!

438
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,567

( Cheering )

440
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,542
So you see?

441
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,643
That's why I'm
hard on Dipper.

442
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:54,804
To toughen him up,

443
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,076
so when the world fights,
he fights back.

444
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,310
Do you think it's
actually working?

445
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,153
I, I did it!

446
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:04,214
Yes!

447
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:05,455
He's really comin' along.

448
00:18:05,455 --> 00:18:08,588
When push comes to shove,
I'm actually proud of him.

449
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,390
Just don't ever tell him that.

450
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,162
His head's big enough as it is.

451
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:13,623
Soos: that's true.

452
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,429
Whoa, kid, what are
you doin' here?

453

Nice hole in your chest,
by the way.

454
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,372
Let's fix that up.

455
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,336
W-- what the--
how did you do that?

456

Word to the wise, kid,
we're in the mind.

457

You could do whatever
you can imagine in here.

536
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:20,680
He's gone,
we did it!

537
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,782
( All cheering )

538
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,654
Wha--

539
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,015
Stan must be waking up.

540
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,358
Will I ever see you
guys again?

541
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:29,489
In your dreams.

542
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,921
Good one, bro.
Good one.

543
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,064
( All yell )

544
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:36,666
We did it!

545
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,927
What?
did what?

546
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,769
What are you all doing here?

547
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:43,403
And why was I dreaming
of two brightly colored
and radical young men?

548
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,034
Grunkle Stan!
You're okay!

549
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:46,376
What is this, a hug?

550
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,036
Nope.

551
00:21:47,036 --> 00:21:48,037
It's a choke hold.

552
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,482
( Chuckles )

553
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,345
Not bad, kid.
Not bad.

554
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:59,349
I'm just glad Gideon
didn't get into the safe.

555
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:01,551
I really love this old shack.

556
00:22:01,551 --> 00:22:03,052
Group hug!

557
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:04,394
No?

558
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:05,895
I never know the right time!

559
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:07,857
( Rumbling )
hey, do you guys feel a--

560
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,103
oh, I'm sorry, pines family,
did I wake you?

561
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:15,965
But we defeated bill.

562
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,006
Bill failed me!

563
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:18,438
So I switched to plan b.

564
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,469
Dynamite.

565
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:20,670
What? bill?

566
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,341
Who-- wh-- what
are you guys talking about?

567
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,114
Spoiler alert, Stanford.
I've got the deed!

568
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:27,577
The mystery shack belongs to me!

569
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:30,019
So, get off my property!

570
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:31,451
Daddy?

571
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,953
Bring it around the front.

572
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,024
Don't worry, guys.

573
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:36,355
It's just part of the dream.

574
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,027
We're going to wake up
any second now.

575
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:39,489
Right? right?

576
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:45,595
( Laughing )

577
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,871
( All gasp )

578
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,843
Someone, pinch me, dude.
