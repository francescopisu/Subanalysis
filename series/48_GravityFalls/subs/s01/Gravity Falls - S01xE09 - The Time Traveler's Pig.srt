00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:06,474
**

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,543
there she is, Mabel--

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,479
the cheapest fair
money can rent!

4
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,382
I spared every expense!

5
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,584
( Screams )

6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,387
I think the sky tram
is broken.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,588
Also most of my bones.

8
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,556
( Laughs ) this guy!

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,591
All right, all right.

10
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,426
I got a job for you two.

11
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,462
I printed up a bunch of fake
safety inspection certificates.

12
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,598
Go slap one on anything
that looks like a lawsuit.

13
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,500
Grunkle Stan,
is that legal?

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,503
When there's no cops around,
anything's legal!

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,605
Soos, how's that dunk tank
coming along?

16
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,041
Almost ready to go, Mr. pines.

17
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,514
Ha! you got it rigged
from here to timbuktu!

18
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,417
There's nothin' on earth
that could knock me down!

19
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,520
Yeah, except for like
a futuristic laser arm Cannon.

20
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:55,523
( Grunts ) hey,
you haven't seen my
red screwdriver, have ya?

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,690
Darn thing went missing.

22
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,627
Maybe some magical creature
or paranormal thing took it.

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,530
Oy, you been spendin'
too much time with those kids!

24
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,599
All right, let's see.
Where did I put that thing?

25
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,471
This mission
is proceeding as planned. Over.

26
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,645
**

27
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,288
Stan: it's 12:00!
The dunk tank is now open!

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,922
( All groan )

29
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,158
Step right up
and dunk me, folks!

30
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,293
I'm talkin' to you, cut-offs!

31
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,295
That's right!
Muffin top! High pants!

32
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,163
Who wants a piece of me?!

33
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,699
( ( Laughs ))

34
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,302
Come back any time, folks!
( Laughs )

35
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,305
How do they get them
into this shape?

36
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,906
It's unnatural.

37
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,276
But, Dipper, they're so...
Delicious?

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,311
( Both laugh )

39
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,279
Uh, boo!

40
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,280
I'll be right back.

41
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,716
I'll be right here!
( Laughs )

42
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,184
( Whispers ) I love you.

43
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:33,321
Look at you two,
gettin' all romantic
at the fair.

44
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,323
Come on, it's no big deal.

45
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:36,724
Yeah, it is.

46
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,959
Okay, you're right! It is!
Isn't this amazing?!

47
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,695
I just dove in! I said,
"hey, you wanna hang out
at the fair?"

48
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,197
And you know what she said?!

49
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,333
Yeah, I guess so.

50
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,735
Yeah, I guess so!
It totally worked!

51
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:51,205
All your advice
about just going for it,
it's finally paying off!

52
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,207
When are you going
to learn, Dipper?

53
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,709
I'm always right
about everything.

54
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:59,713
Hey, do you smell
a gallon of body spray?

55
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,283
Hey, either of you dorks
seen Wendy around?

56
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,318
Hey!wants to know?

57
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,754
Yeah, I got some new
super tight jeans.

58
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,223
Thought she might
wanna check 'em out.

59
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,759
Yeah, you know,
i think I saw her
in the bottomless pit.

60
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,294
You should really
go jump in there.

61
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,363
Maybe I will, smart guy.

62
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,231
( Groans )

63
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,732
He is such a jerk.

64
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,734
Yeah, but he's a jerk
with tight pants and a guitar.

65
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,770
I need to keep him away
from Wendy at all costs.

66
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,372
Don't worry, brother,
whatever happens,

67
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,007
I'll be right here,
supporting you ever step of--

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,409
oh, my gosh! A pig!

69
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,746
( Panting )

70
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,248
If you can guess
the critter's weight,

71
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,417
you can take the critter home!

72
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,324
( Gasps)
(he said "Mabel"!.

73
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,792
Either that or "doorbell."

74
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,794
Did you say "Mabel"
or "doorbell"?

75
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:47,795
( Oinking ) Mabel.

76
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,029
( Gasps )

77
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, look, Mabel here
found her real twin.

78
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,268
( All laugh )

79
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,403
Pacifica!

80
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,805
Sir, I must have that pig!

81
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,040
Ah, old fifteen-poundy!

82
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,343
So, how much
you guessin' he weighs?

83
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,778
Um, 15 pounds?

84
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,281
Are you some kind of witch?

85
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,382
Well, there's your pig.

86
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,284
( Squeals )

87
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,420
( Cheering and applause )

88
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,788
And you'll be
needin' these.

89
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:17,291
No? suit yourself.

90
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,293
Mm-mm.

91
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,362
( Whispers )
everything is different now.

92
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,332
Whoa! check it out!

93
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:28,302
I don't know if it's a duck
or a panda, but I want one!

94
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,070
My uncle taught me
the secret to these games--

95
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,372
you aim for the carny's head

96
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,040
and take the prize
when he's unconscious.

97
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,842
( Laughs ) nice.

98
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,043
One ball, please.

99
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,312
You only get once chance.

100
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,449
And a one,
and a two, and a...

101
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,483
( Grunts )

102
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,052
Ow! my eye!

103
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,421
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Wendy, are you okay?!

104
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,823
Does it look swollen?

105
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,826
Everything's gonna be fine!
Don't worry! I'll...

106
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,428
I'll go get some ice!

107
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,834
Where is she? Where is she?

108
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:01,902
( Both groan )

109
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,340
Hey, watch where
you're going, man!

110
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,341
( Grunts )

111
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,409
( Panting )

112
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,478
( Grunts )

113
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,847
All right, just ease
your eyeball into that
freezy cone.

114
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,883
Robbie, thanks.
That's really sweet--

115
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,118
the gesture
and the flavored syrup.

116
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,356
Yeah, I was just here
in the right place
at the right time.

117
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,857
You know, I've been
meanin' to ask you...

118
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,493
We've been spendin'
a lot of time together

119
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,896
and I was wondering
if maybe you wanted
to go out with me?

120
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:29,897
( Whimpers )

121
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,132
Yeah, I guess so.

122
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,401
Sweet!

123
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,472
Look, Dipper!
I won my pet pig!

124
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,407
His name is waddles.

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,877
I call him that because
he waddles! Waddles!

126
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,513
Everything is different now.

127
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,915
What are ya lookin' at?

128
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,923
Oh...

129
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:08,402
Uh...
are you gonna move?

130
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,403
( Groans )

131
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,671
( Sighs )

132
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,408
Paging Dr. waddles,
we got a boy here
with a broken heart.

133
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,176
Come on, man,
these are the jokes.

134
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,947
Mabel, do you ever
wish you could go back
and undo just one mistake?

135
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,418
Nope! I do everything right
all the time. ( Humming )

136
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,520
I mean, Wendy only went out
with Robbie because
he was there with the ice,

137
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,456
and she only needed ice
because of the baseball,

138
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,458
and I would have had the ice
if it wasn't for...

139
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,426
( Gasps ) that guy!

140
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,428
Hey, you! Tool belt!
You ruined my life!

141
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:35,295
Huh?

142
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,197
Don't "huh" me!
I've seen you before!

143
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,966
What's your deal?
Are you following us around?

144
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,502
And why are you bald?
What's all that about?

145
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,971
( Screams ) my position
has been compromised!

146
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,541
Assuming stealth mode!
Color match!

147
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:52,580
Initiating color match!
Come on! Dang it!

148
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:56,517
That's amazing! ( Gasps )
are you from the future
or something?

149
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,986
Uh, no! Who told you that?!

150
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,988
Memory wipe!

151
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,524
This is a baby wipe.

152
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,527
( Sighs )
all right, you've cornered me.

153
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,530
I'm a time traveler.

154
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,231
So wait a minute,
if you're from the future,

155
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,534
do you have, like,
a time machine or something?

156
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,036
That's kinda how that works.

157
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:19,640
Could I borrow it?

158
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,713
Dipper: come on, can I use
your time machine just once?

159
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,715
Out of the question!
This is sensitive,

160
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,751
extremely complicated
time equipment!

161
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,520
It looks like
a tape measure.

162
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,655
You shut your time-mouth!

163
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,557
This makin'
any sense to you?

164
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,626
( Whispers )
i think he's just crazy.

165
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh, you don't believe me?

166
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,765
Gueboth: whoa!Was!

167
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,636
That's right, 15 years ago
there was a costume store
right here!

168
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,837
One second!

169
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,773
Aw, heck! Pat!

170
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,576
So who are you again?

171
00:07:55,609 --> 00:08:00,714
Blendin blandin,
time anomaly removal crew,
year 20-snyeventy-12!

172
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,816
My mission is to stop
a series of time anomalies

173
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,619
that are supposed to happen
at this very location!

174
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:07,688
B-but I don't see
any anomalies!

175
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,790
I don't know if it's
some kind of paradox

176
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,660
or if I'm just really tired!

177
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,795
You know, you sound like
you could use a break.

178
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,730
Definitely. definitely.

179
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:20,634
Might we recommend one
of the various attractions
at the mystery fair?

180
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,670
You know what? What the heck!

181
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,804
I'm worth it!

182
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,806
But I got my eye on you!

183
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,843
( Grunts )

184
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,845
Aw, sorry, dude,

185
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,847
but you're gonna have to take
your belt off for the ride.

186
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,850
One of your tools might fly off
and accidently fix something.

187
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,653
Guard it with your life!

188
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,889
I will watch it
like a hawk, dude.

189
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,827
( Cheering )

190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,830
Like a hawk!

191
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,865
Here it is, Mabel--

192
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,668
our ticket to any moment
in history!

193
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:57,671
Lets go get two dodos
and force them to make out!

194
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,673
No! we gotta be
smart about this.

195
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,842
All that paradox talk
kinda freaked me out.

196
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,678
All I'm gonna do is go back
and fix my one mistake.

197
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,614
If I don't miss
that baseball throw,

198
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,782
I won't hit Wendy in the eye,
and Robbie won't comfort her,

199
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,651
and they won't start going out.

200
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:14,622
I'm coming, too! I wanna relive
the greatest moment of my life--

201
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,857
winning waddles! Mwah!

202
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,958
( Oinks )

203
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,863
See ya later.

204
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,800
See you earlier!
Yuck, yuck, yuck!

205
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,902
( Beeps )

206
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:32,673
( Squeals )

207
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,943
( Eating loudly )

208
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,649
( Squeals )

209
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,917
( Eating loudly )

210
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:53,827
Ah! ah! Ah! Ah!

211
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,896
( Both panting )

212
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,802
Stan: it's 12:00!
The dunk tank is now open!

213
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,970
( All groan )

214
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,972
Step right up
and dunk me, folks!

215
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm talkin' to you, cut-offs!

216
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:07,841
Do-over?

217
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,843
Do-over!

218
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,846
Fifteen pounds!S--

219
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,849
and yes, I am a witch.

220
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,786
Well, time to round up a mob.

221
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,754
There you are.

222
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:21,922
Hey, what happened
to your hat?

223
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,725
Uh, nothing.
Hey, look! What's that?

224
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:28,729
Whoa! check it out!
I don't know if it's a duck
or a panda, but I want one!

225
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:29,830
One ball, please.

226
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,832
You only get one chance.

227
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,934
That's what you think.

228
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,870
One panda-duck,
coming right up!

229
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,972
Okay, Dipper, second chance.
Don't mess this up.

230
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,842
( Grunts ) yes!

231
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,812
Ow! my eye!

232
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:45,813
What?!

233
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,748
Does it look swollen??

234
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,750
That's so weird.

235
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:51,018
Wendy: oh, hey, Robbie.

236
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,920
So anyway,
we've been hangin' out a lot,

237
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,956
and I've been wondering if, uh,
you wanted to go out with me?

238
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,858
Yeah, I guess so.

239
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,892
Sweet!

240
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,834
The exact same thing
happened twice! It was spooky!

241
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,936
Ooh, maybe it's a time curse!

242
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,872
Waddles, can you
say "time curse"?

243
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,041
( Squeals )

244
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,877
Your face is so fat!

245
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,879
Is it possible
that the forces of time

246
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,849
naturally conspire
to undo any new outcomes?

247
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,884
No, no.
I just need to try again.

248
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,018
Third time's the charm.

249
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,755
How hard can it be?

250
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:28,922
( Beeps )

251
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:31,825
Find the witch!

252
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,768
Ow! my eye!

253
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,035
Hey, are you all right?

254
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,905
( Laughs )

255
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,050
Ow! my eye!

256
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,887
Oh, bad luck.

257
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:08,028
Uh, Wendy? How badly
do you want that
stuffed animal thing?

258
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,964
More than anything
in the world, Dipper.

259
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:14,902
( Sighs ) okay.
( Grunts )

260
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,938
( Screams )

261
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,076
I love my pig!

262
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,947
If I adjust the ball
for wind speed...

263
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,115
Factoring cotton candy...

264
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,017
Face it, Dipper,
you're obviously fated

265
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,952
to have a bad day at the fair.

266
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,054
Just like I'm fated
to be with waddles!

267
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,923
It's like there's
one variable missing.

268
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,825
What's a variable?

269
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,927
Ha! that's it!

270
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,062
I figured out a way
to win the toss,
not hit Wendy,

271
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,131
and stop Wendy and Robbie
from going out!

272
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,867
Awesome! I'm gonna go
win my pig again!

273
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,969
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't leave.
I need you for my plan.

274
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,938
But what about waddles?

275
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,940
It'll just take a few minutes!
Let's go!

276
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,108
( Blows )

277
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,847
( Wind blowing )

278
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,849
You gonna go, man?

279
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,084
And a one, and a two,
and a... ( Grunts )

280
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,953
Aw, dude, you missed.

281
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,087
Did I?

282
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,129
( All gasp )

283
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,164
( All sigh )

284
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,099
( Laughs )

285
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,133
( Groans )

286
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,134
Huh?

287
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,971
( Screams )

288
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:27,074
Your stuffed creature
of indeterminate species, miss.

289
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,142
Oh, awesome!

290
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,980
There you hi, Robbie.

291
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,948
So I was wondering
if, uh, you--

292
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,016
look what Dipper got for me!

293
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:43,090
Whatever. can't even tell
what species it is. Stupid.

294
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,191
What's his deal?

295
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,994
Looks like I came to the fair
with the right guy!

296
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,030
We have a winner!

297
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,001
Anytime, broseph.

298
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,905
Now to win my pig. ( Gasps )

299
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,172
It's all yours!
No one else's!

300
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:03,043
Old fifteen-poundy!
Yours forever!

301
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,014
( Squeals )

302
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,150
( Screams )

303
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,218
( Both laugh )

304
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,021
That was even more awesome
the third time around!

305
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,223
( Gasps ) funnel cake!
Let's go get some, Dipper!

306
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:21,194
( Screaming )

307
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,097
( Screams )

308
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,000
M( screams )-

309
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,101
I'll just wait
until you're done.

310
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,137
Okay, what is wrong?

311
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,972
We messed up the timeline!

312
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,075
Pacifica saw the flier
and won waddles before I did!

313
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,077
She took waddles, Dipper!

314
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,046
Oh, Mabel, I'm sorry.

315
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,215
( Sighs ) it's okay,
we just need to go back
and do things differently.

316
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,018
Mabel, wait!
Look, I did the math--

317
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,120
in any other timeline, Wendy
ends up going out with Robbie!

318
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,956
I can't mess this day up again!

319
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,224
But if we don't go,
then I'll lose waddles forever!

320
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,225
Hey!

321
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,226
( Both grunting )

322
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,962
Give it back!

323
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,029
Whoa!

324
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,201
( Both gasp and groan )

325
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,203
When are we?

326
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,974
The real question is,
when are we?

327
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,075
Oh, wait,
did you already--

328
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,176
'cause I was gonna--

329
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,277
yeah. yall right.Thing.

330
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,279
Do you hear that?

331
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:15,082
( Rumbling )

332
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,052
( Both scream )

333
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,257
( Both scream )

334
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,393
( Both panting )

335
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,264
( Both scream )

336
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:39,306
Be on the look out
for mountain lions, travelers!

337
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,242
Dysentery? who wants dysentery?

338
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,377
Forge ahead, mighty oxen!

339
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:48,348
For a new life awaits us
on this Oregon trail!

340
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,350
Where are we? The '70s?

341
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:54,254
You sent us back 150 years,
genius! It's pioneer times!

342
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:59,259
By trembly! Fertilla,
it seems you've given birth
to two more children!

343
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,396
It appears I have.
More little hands
to render the tallow.

344
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,398
( Chuckles ) tallow? What?

345
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:08,135
Her mouth is filled
with silver, mother!

346
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,136
These are called braces.

347
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,404
Mabel, we can't start
messing with the past!

348
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:15,408
Oh, says the guy who messed
with the past all day,
and cost me my pig?

349
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,244
I'll mess with whatever I want!

350
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,412
Check it out!
A magic button machine!

351
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:23,150
Shoes that blink!

352
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,384
( All gasp )

353
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,222
Hey, sister, guess who
gets to vote in the future?

354
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:32,225
Ladies! up top!

355
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,228
That's called a high-five.
Teach it to your friends.

356
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,397
Give me that!
I'm gonna set
the timeline right!

357
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,266
Hey! no!

358
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,401
( Roars )

359
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,337
( Both scream )

360
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,207
( Both scream, sigh )

361
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,208
( Screams )

362
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,210
Run! take cover!

363
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,279
It's coming!

364
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,282
( Laughs )

365
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,284
This future seems neat.

366
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,485
( Beeping )

367
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,190
I'm coming, waddles!

368
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,291
Hey!

369
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:07,194
I seen it! I seen it again!

370
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,295
But enough about me.

371
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,464
Behold...
me!

372
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,333
( Groans )

373
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,302
( Roars )

374
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,370
( Both panting )

375
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,207
This thing is getting hotter!

376
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,408
Hot! hot, hot, hot!

377
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,476
Whi don't know!?!

378
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,313
( Both scream )

379
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,222
Where are we?

380
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,290
It's nothing
but inky blackness for miles!

381
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:41,361
Mabel, don't you see?
We've transported
to the end of time!

382
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:46,499
( Both scream )

383
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,369
Wait, why does it
smell so bad in here?

384
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,239
( Thumping )

385
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:55,342
( Both panting )

386
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,476
Look! we're back
in the present!

387
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,278
But which present?

388
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:01,514
This is the byes!Present ever!

389
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:04,251
( Squeals )

390
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,386
No! give me that thing!

391
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,522
Dipper, give it back!

392
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,325
Look, Mabel,
it's over, okay?
Give it up!

393
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,327
I've worked too hard
to lose this!

394
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,397
But what about waddles?
He was my soul mate!

395
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,532
You said that about
a ball of yarn once!

396
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:22,335
Do you really want Wendy
to date Robbie?

397
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,570
I don't know.

398
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,546
You're not
guilt-tripping me, Mabel.
Not this time.

399
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,388
Come on, Mabel, I know you.
You're gonna forget about this
in a day.

400
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,456
Here! hey, I'll prove it!

401
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,528
See?

402
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,302
Okay, maybe you'll
forget in a week.

403
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,403
( Beeps )

404
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,341
A month.
She'll be better in a month!

405
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,375
( Beeps )

406
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,349
Waddles. waddles.

407
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,983
And if you look to your left,
you'll see miserable Mabel--

408
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:14,554
the girl who went bonkers
after her dreams were shattered
by some heartless jerk.

409
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,622
Oh, hey, Dipper!

410
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,593
( Groans )

411
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,363
( Sighs )

412
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,464
( Beeps )

413
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:30,337
I don't know if it's a duck
or a panda, but I want one.

414
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,339
( Sighs )

415
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,374
Wendy, I just wanted
to say that...

416
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,543
Well, I just wanted to say
that people make mistakes,

417
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,379
and when they do,
you should forgive them.

418
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,348
And also, that tight pants
are overrated.

419
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,549
Dude, you lost me.

420
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,351
I know.

421
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,452
One ball, please.

422
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,387
You only get one chance.

423
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,590
And a one, and a two,
and a... ( Grunts )

424
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,626
Ow! my eye!

425
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,628
Hey, Wendy,
are you okay?

426
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,531
You know, this is
the perfect time for me
to ask you something.

427
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,468
It is done.

428
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,571
Dipper! thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

429
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,373
( Oinks ) thank you.

430
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,640
He's saying
"thank you" in pig!

431
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,409
Aren't you, waddles?

432
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,378
( Oinks )

433
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,480
Ow. ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

434
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,382
I couldn't break
your heart, Mabel.

435
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:19,386
Besides, there's no way
Wendy can date Robbie
all summer, right?

436
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,420
You two!

437
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,489
( ( Squeals ) )

438
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:26,393
Do you have any idea
how many rules you just broke?!

439
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30,530
I'm asking,
i wasn't there with you.
It was probably a lot, right?

440
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,399
Blendin blandin!

441
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:36,403
( Screams )
the time paradox avoidance
enforcement squadron!

442
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,638
That's right, and our phones
have been ringing off the hook.

443
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,673
There's settlers
high-fiving in the 1800s

444
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,676
and calculators littered
through eight centuries!

445
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,545
You are under arrest
for violations

446
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,547
of the time travelers
code of conduct.

447
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,548
It was those kids!

448
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,450
And their leader, waddles!

449
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,551
That's a pig, blendin.

450
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,420
Oh! I'll get you for this!

451
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:57,557
I'll go back in time
and make sure your parents
never meet!

452
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,591
Well, we're still here.

453
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,560
Guess he forgot to go back.

454
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,462
Ha! you suckers!

455
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,465
Your pockets are empty and I'm
still sitting high and dry!

456
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,699
All: boo!

457
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:10,470
( Laughs ) yeah, boo!
Boo! I love it!

458
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:14,574
Hey, biceps! Yeah,
I'm talking to you, haircut!

459
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,543
Take your best shot! ( Laughs )

460
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,647
W-whoa!

461
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,517
( All cheer )

462
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,656
So I guess we never
found out who was causing

463
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,559
those time anomalies
blendin was looking for.

464
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:35,495
Wait, Mabel...
I think it was us.

465
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,630
Ugh, my brain hurts.

466
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,468
Aw, jeez, I gotta deal
with this all summer?

467
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,570
( Chuckles ) it's good.
It's caramel.

468
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:44,671
I'm on it.

469
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,573
( Sniffs )

470
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,508
( Squeals )

471
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,643
( Screams )

472
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:55,548
My pants! They're shrinking!

473
00:21:55,582 --> 00:22:01,621
( All laugh )

474
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,490
( Gags )

475
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,757
( Laughs ) oh, man.

476
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,694
( Sighs ) that'll do, pig.

477
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,629
( Oinks )

478
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,764
That'll do.

479
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,503
You have broken the eternal laws
of space-time.

480
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:17,504
I beg your mercy, time baby!

481
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,673
You now must clean up
all of the anomalies.

482
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,580
( Humming )

483
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,783
Old man mcguckett, local kook!

484
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,553
Are the wax figures alive?

485
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,688
( Roars )

486
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,525
What are you looking at?
