1
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:06,137
Man on radio:
Watch out, gravity falls,

2
00:00:06,137 --> 00:00:07,538
because at 110 degrees

3
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:10,511
we're looking at
the hottest day of the summer!

4
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:22,553
All in favor of doing nothing
all day, say... ( Groans )

5
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:24,695
( All groan )

6
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,097
( Oinks )

7
00:00:26,097 --> 00:00:28,059
I'm gonna throw this pig
out of the house!

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,462
You called my bluff, pig.

9
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,135
On the bright side,
pun very much intended,

10
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,238
it's opening week
at the gravity falls pool.

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,569
Gravity falls pool?

12
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:39,810
Today?
pun intended?

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,512
Quick! to the car!

14
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,414
( Grunting )

15
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:45,546
Hey, kids, a little help here.

16
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,819
( All grunting )

17
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,521
( Shudders )

18
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:52,683
All right, off to the pool.

19
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:55,656
And remember to be on alert
for random wildfires.

20
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,689
Wait, what?
( Screams )

21
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,191
He'll be fine.

22
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:02,833
В™єв™є

23
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:44,805
man: all right,
who wants to do a cannonball?

24
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,777
Man 2: Cannonball!

25
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,309
Ah, the pool.

26
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,312
Sparkling oasis of
summer enchantment.

27
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,315
Yeah, nothing like sitting in
a moist tub with strangers.

28
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,116
It's like the bus, but wet.

29
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,320
Why would a sun
need to wear sunglasses?

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,421
It's best not
to think about it.

31
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,424
Whoa, whoa!
Stop the presses!

32
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:05,626
Who's that?

33
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,432
Oh, yeah. ( Chomping ) word is,
dude never leaves the pool.

34
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:14,435
People say
he's a "mysterious loner."

35
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,836
( Chomping )

36
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,510
Is it getting hot out here,
or is it just that guy?

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,212
It's the hottest day
of the year, Mabel.

38
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,214
Besides, can't you go
for one week

39
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,876
without having a new crush
on some random guy?

40
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,248
Uh-uh. ( gasps )

41
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,380
Look at his
little moustache hairs!

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,424
You are clearly enamored.
Go to him.

43
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:34,425
( Laughs )

44
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,726
( Groans )

45
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:37,558
Hey, come on!
Watch it, kid!

46
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,559
Aah!

47
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,560
Oops, sorry!

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,332
It's so beautiful!

49
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,334
Eh, Mabel's all talk.
You wanna know a secret?

50
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:45,165
She's never even
kissed a guy before.

51
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,767
She always
messes it up somehow.

52
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,399
Oy, women!

53
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,640
Aah!

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,771
Hey, Mr. pines.

55
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,803
Wendy? where's the lifeguard?

56
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,174
I am the lifeguard.

57
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,447
I make the rules, sucka! Boosh!

58
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:59,480
Aah! she's attacking me
with water!

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,811
( All laugh )

60
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,553
Wow. you work here?

61
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:04,885
I found out lifeguards
get free snack privileges.

62
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:07,518
Plus, I get the best seat
in the house.

63
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,519
Yeah, you do!

64
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,821
( Laughing )

65
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:12,763
( Whispers )
I've been laughing for too long.

66
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:14,925
Dude, are you and Wendy
having a secret staring contest?

67
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,297
'Cause I think you're winning--

68
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,498
Soos! shh!

69
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,802
So, hey, you wanna go
Chuck more water balloons
at grunkle Stan?

70
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,435
I'd love to, but I gotta
spend the day doing tryouts.

71
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:27,438
We're looking for
a new assistant lifeguard.

72
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:28,439
Hey! ( clears throat )

73
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,610
( Deep voice ) hey...

74
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,211
( Normal voice ) what if
i was assistant lifeguard?

75
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,346
That would be so much fun!
You're totally in, dude!

76
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:37,818
You just have to check in with
my boss first, Mr. poolcheck.

77
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,390
Your boss?

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,322
( Sniffs )

79
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:46,497
( Grunting )

80
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,300
( Gasps )

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,602
Girl:
( laughing ) I'm gonna get you!

82
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:52,603
( Slurps )

83
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:53,604
( Sighs )

84
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:55,906
( Gasps )

85
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,909
Wow! oh, my gosh, how crazy,
bumping into you here,

86
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,841
even though
we don't know each other.

87
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,345
How long have you
been underwater?

88
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,877
That doesn't matter!
( Coughing )

89
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:09,420
So, hey!
My name's Mabel.

90
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,421
Hola.

91
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,583
Whoa! are you Australian?

92
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,684
( Laughs )

93
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:15,526
I am charmed by
your sense of humor...

94
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,928
And your bold lack
of water wings.

95
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,930
( Laughs )
you're so funny!

96
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,593
And your hair is beautiful.

97
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,765
No, no,
it has silly tangles.

98
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,767
Mind if I...
( Chuckles )

99
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,440
Why, Mabel,
you are so forward.

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,901
( Laughs )

101
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:32,443
This is it!
He likes you!

102
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:34,274
Go for it, Mabel!
It's time!

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,606
Ask him out on a date!

104
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:38,709
So, hey, you wanna go dry off?
Maybe hit the snack bar or--

105
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:40,981
i--I'm afraid I cannot.

106
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,584
For I have a terrible secret!

107
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:46,457
I must go.

108
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:50,461
I'm upset.

109
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:52,623
Yet, intrigued.

110
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:56,026
And that is why
i think I'd make
a good lifeguard assistant.

111
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,900
Hmm... ( sniffs )

112
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,934
Spf 100? Good. I like you.

113
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:07,508
But this isn't an easy job.
It's anarchy out there.

114
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,612
I think I can handle it.

115
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:12,743
Can you handle this?!

116
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:13,744
( Gasps )

117
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:16,517
I lost my hand
to a pool filter!

118
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,549
The pool may seem friendly,

119
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,551
but she can turn on you
in an instant!

120
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,653
Which is why
you must respect her rules!

121
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:26,026
Do you think you have
what it takes, boy? Do you?!

122
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:29,560
Sure. I guess.

123
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,805
Welcome to the deep end, son.

124
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:35,806
Well, thanks. I--

125
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:36,967
( grunts )

126
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,610
Yep, oh,
this is happening.

127
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:42,473
There she is, Soos.

128
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:45,075
Equidistant from the snack bar
and the bathroom,

129
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,578
just the right amount
of sun and shade.

130
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:50,851
And pointed away from
where old man mcgucket
lotions himself.

131
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,383
Whoo-wee!

132
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:54,385
( Cackling )

133
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:57,027
The perfect lawn chair.

134
00:05:57,027 --> 00:06:00,360
The legends that you told me
in the car were true.

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,362
I just can't believe
it wasn't already taken!

136
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,736
And now to sit on it,
thereby claiming it as my own.

137
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:06,797
( Grunts )

138
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:08,138
What?!

139
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,800
Why, hello, Stanford.

140
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,644
Gideon!
get out of my chair, kid!

141
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:17,678
Oh, my, was this your chair?
I had no idea.

142
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,150
( Whispers )
yes, I did, Stan. I knew.

143
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,483
Mm! ooh!

144
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,614
Move it,
you little troll!

145
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,656
First come, first serve!

146
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:28,659
( Laughs ) mm! Ooh! Ooh!

147
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,561
I'll first serve you!

148
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,392
( Whistle blows )
huh?

149
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:34,625
Come on, Wendy!

150
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,797
You can't do this
to an old man!

151
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,128
Sorry, Stan. It's not up to me.

152
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,730
( Chuckles ) actually, it is.

153
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,672
Hey, Wendy! I got the job!

154
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,704
Sweet!
wanna go abuse our power?

155
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,035
But what if poolcheck
catches us?

156
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,037
He seems emotionally unstable.

157
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:49,940
( Cracking )

158
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,712
Hmm...

159
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,743
( Cracking )

160
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:54,084
Nah, don't worry, man.

161
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,746
You just gotta be sneaky
about your rule-breaking.

162
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,748
Race you
to the no running sign!

163
00:06:57,748 --> 00:06:59,720
( Laughs )

164
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,892
( Slurps )

165
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,028
How long you in for?

166
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,199
Two hours, for roughhousing.

167
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,561
But I'm innocent!

168
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,862
Pool jail ain't so bad...

169
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:14,635
As long as you don't
wind up in solitary.

170
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,738
It's the nights
that are the hardest.

171
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,619
Hey, there!
( Gasps )

172
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:29,750
I brought you a sandwich.

173
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,452
It's sort of wet,
but it's still good. Blop.

174
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,756
I like sharing things--
sandwiches, secrets...

175
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,788
( Whispers ) share your secret,
beautiful stranger.

176
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,661
That wet sandwich
does look delicious.

177
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,132
Oh, very well.

178
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:46,637
But you must never tell
another living soul
my terrible secret.

179
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:49,640
You have to stay away from me
because I am...

180
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,642
A merman.

181
00:07:53,904 --> 00:07:56,607
( Chuckles ) oh, thank goodness.

182
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:01,151
I thought you were gonna
say you had a girlfriend.

183
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:03,013
A merman! Ha!

184
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,986
I should have known from your
strange foreign fish language.

185
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,618
It is Spanish.

186
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:10,260
Your voice is so deep
and masculine. How old are you?

187
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,793
I am 12 years old.

188
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,995
Merman's voices change
when we are, like, three.

189
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,867
So what's your name?

190
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:18,268
There are some who call me...

191
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:19,800
В™єв™є

192
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,971
mermando.

193
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,633
This is because
mermando is my name.

194
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,104
But I don't understand,
mermando.

195
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,037
What's a guy like you
doing in a public pool?

196
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:28,809
It is a tragic story, Mabel.

197
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,111
I was swimming with my friends,
the mighty dolphins,

198
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:34,945
in the Gulf of Mexico,
when I was ensnared!

199
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:36,987
Earl, did we just
catch ourselves

200
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:39,720
some kind of
beautiful man-fish?

201
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,992
Let's feast on his flesh!

202
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:44,024
The cargo was headed
for gravity falls.

203
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,195
( Grunts )

204
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:48,729
Using all my strength,
i tried to escape back home,

205
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,930
but it was not to be.

206
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,931
Ha-ha!

207
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,633
( Groans )

208
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,707
I would have died
of dehydration,

209
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,309
were it not for the kindness
of the forest animals.

210
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:03,013
( Laughing )

211
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:04,715
Continue licking! Oh!

212
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:07,017
( Groaning )

213
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:07,978
( Gasps )

214
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,181
But now that
you know what I am,

215
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:13,553
you must be
seriously weirded out.

216
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,556
What?! I don't care
that you're a merman!

217
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,029
You're, like, the coolest guy
I've ever met.

218
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,062
And you can play
at least one chord
on the guitar.

219
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,035
Oh, Mabel. I have never met
another human like you.

220
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,868
Would you care to join me
in a game of the Marco Polo?

221
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,701
Oh, yes, mermando! Yes!

222
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:33,173
You're covering my gills.
I cannot breathe.

223
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,875
( Coughing and wheezing )

224
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,107
( Chuckles ) weird.

225
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:42,182
Ooh! ( giggles )
my cheeks are baby soft!

226
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:46,056
( Growls ) look at him,
that smug chair-stealing jerk!

227
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:49,720
But I can't touch him,
or the pool patrol
will throw me in pool jail.

228
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,722
Hmm...

229
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:53,023
Ah!

230
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:56,596
( Chuckles ) yes. Yes!
Burn the child!

231
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,130
Aah! my eyes!

232
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,932
Deal with it.

233
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,334
( Growls )

234
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:06,777
Soos.

235
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,109
Inflatable duck guy?
Is that you?

236
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,041
Yes, Soos. I can talk.

237
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,044
Oh, my gosh, I knew you guys
were secretly alive. I knew it!

238
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:15,185
( Both laugh )

239
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:17,317
Shh! shh!
Shh! Shh!

240
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,851
My people have been enslaved,
Soos. You must free us.

241
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,994
The inflatable pool duck
revolution is at hand.

242
00:10:23,994 --> 00:10:24,995
( Both laugh )

243
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:26,196
( Whistle blows )

244
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:28,328
Pools closing!
Clear out, everyone!

245
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,630
Poolcheck!
hide!

246
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,262
Out! do not touch!

247
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:33,934
Assistant lifeguard!

248
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,909
Have a good night, son.
Lock up the supplies for me.

249
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,174
( Both chuckling )

250
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:45,175
( Whistle blows )

251
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,717
The pool, she closes.

252
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,048
Can I see you tonight?

253
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,180
Sure. where?
Wanna go for a walk?

254
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,182
Merman. I am a merman.

255
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:55,055
Oh, right.
Then I'll be back tonight.

256
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:06,767
( Grunting )

257
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,842
Look, here's a scrapbook
of human stuff.

258
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:13,143
Here's me
standing with my legs,

259
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,846
and here I am
kicking Dipper in his legs.

260
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,848
He couldn't move his legs
after that.

261
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:20,711
Can you imagine,
not having legs!

262
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,012
Let's skip this part.

263
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:24,254
And here's my whole family
kickboxing!

264
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:25,385
( Sighs )

265
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,319
What's wrong?

266
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:32,122
В™єв™є

267
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:33,223
( grunts )

268
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:35,225
I, too, used to have
a family once,

269
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,227
back in the ocean.

270
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:40,130
How I miss them.

271
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,204
Mermando, why don't you
just leave the pool?

272
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,736
I tried only once.

273
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,738
But escaping this pool
required a plan

274
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,740
that was bold and daring.

275
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,911
В™єв™є

276
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:58,448
( groaning )

277
00:11:58,448 --> 00:12:02,993
( Screaming )

278
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:04,454
( Groans )

279
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:06,456
And then the wolves came.

280
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:10,230
No, I am glad that I am here,
because I met you.

281
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,963
This is it, Mabel.

282
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:14,134
First kiss moment,
here we come.

283
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,305
Just go for it!

284
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,306
Mm...

285
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,468
What are you doing
with your mouth?

286
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:21,842
Me? nothing! This? I was
just eating some sour candy.

287
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,314
So my lips were doing that
'cause the candy was so sour.

288
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:27,017
Can I have some candy?

289
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:28,318
No.

290
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:34,754
( Sputters )
what the--

291
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,387
I'm scared!
Me, too!

292
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,758
One hundred points!

293
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,090
Dude, with this job,

294
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,262
you and me are gonna be
having fun all summer!

295
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,533
All summer?

296
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:44,895
( Whistle blows )
( Both gasp )

297
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,537
Pines, here, now!

298
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:52,903
You gave me your word that you
would respect the sacred rules
of this municipal pool!

299
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,145
Mr. poolcheck,
are you crying?

300
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:56,807
That's not important
right now! ( Sniffs )

301
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,910
You are on thin ice, boy.
You wanna keep this job?

302
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,913
Well, some maniac broke into
the supply closet last night

303
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:05,085
and destroyed our one
and only pool skimmer!

304
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,917
I want you on a stake out.

305
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:10,991
If one more supply gets taken,
you're fired!

306
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,522
I won't let you down!

307
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:15,365
Mermando, get ready!
I'm gonna bring the heat!

308
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,426
Boosh!

309
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,100
Mermando, are you okay?

310
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,574
Oh, it's your family, isn't it?
Are you thinking about them?

311
00:13:24,574 --> 00:13:26,206
( Dolphin cry )

312
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,208
Mermando, enough is enough!

313
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,811
I care about you too much
to see you like this.

314
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,985
We're gonna bust you out of here
and get you back to your family.

315
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,988
But, Mabel,
escape is impossible!

316
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:40,991
We're breaking you
out of here tonight!

317
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,154
Whoops! sorry about that.
Water.

318
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:50,901
All right, Dipper,
here's the plan.

319
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:52,903
Catch the trespasser,
protect the supplies,

320
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:55,405
keep job at pool,
and eventually marry Wendy.

321
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:56,406
Freeze!

322
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:58,368
Grunkle Stan?

323
00:13:58,368 --> 00:13:59,870
I, uh, I'm sleepwalking.

324
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,371
Also, now I'm sleep-talking.

325
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,612
Nice hat, by the way.

326
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:05,845
You! you're the one
destroying pool supplies!

327
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,348
What? no! My crime
is a lot better than that.

328
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,549
I'm gonna get that seat,

329
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,551
and be ready in the morning
when Gideon comes.

330
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,524
Then maybe I'll destroy
some pool supplies.
Night's still young.

331
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:16,386
( Blows whistle )

332
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:19,029
Sheesh, all right,
I'm going! ( Grunts )

333
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,630
Hey!

334
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,532
( Beeping )

335
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,494
Mabel!

336
00:14:26,897 --> 00:14:29,369
Are you ready
to see your family?

337
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,502
Yes, but how can I, a merman,
possibly escape?

338
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:36,476
Okay, my original plan
was to tape together
a bunch fish sticks

339
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,109
to make you a prosthetic
pair of people legs.

340
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,880
Intriguing.

341
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,652
But then I realized that
i could just transport you
in this cooler.

342
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:43,653
Ha-ha!

343
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:49,489
( Grunting )

344
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,124
Dipper: hey! Who's there!

345
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:56,596
Quick! hide me!
My kind must not be seen!

346
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,599
Mabel? is there anyone not
breaking into the pool tonight?

347
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,471
What, is Soos here too?

348
00:15:01,471 --> 00:15:02,632
( Grunts ) I'm okay.

349
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,633
Go home, Soos.

350
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,635
You got it.
( Grunting )

351
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,637
So, why are you here?

352
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:09,209
Uh, no reason.

353
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,540
( Clears throat )

354
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,542
Did that cooler
just clear its throat?

355
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:15,915
Don't be silly. There certainly
isn't a merman in there,
if that's what you're implying.

356
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,248
Who said
anything about a merman?

357
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:19,950
Mabel, I don't have
time for your games.

358
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,622
If you don't give me
those supplies, I'll lose
the coolest job ever!

359
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,155
( Sighs ) I understand.

360
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,327
Hey, look!
Wendy in a bikini!

361
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,328
Really? at night?

362
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,399
Sorry, Dipper!

363
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,661
Mabel!

364
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:37,167
Go, Mabel, go!

365
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,169
We can't all be saved.

366
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,142
( Chomps )

367
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:46,146
I'm gonna get you home!

368
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,219
Hand over the pool supplies
in the name of pool law!

369
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:52,722
Pool law is dumb!
And so is your hat!

370
00:15:52,722 --> 00:15:54,524
( Grunts )

371
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,059
Look! gravity falls lake!

372
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,665
The coast is clear.

373
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,337
Ahh.

374
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:09,569
Now all I have to do
is wait here 15 hours

375
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,401
until the pool opens.

376
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:15,345
This was a good plan.

377
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,711
( Snorts )
i think someone just sped by.

378
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,713
Probably just a dream.

379
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:27,187
With you,
every day is a dream.

380
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:29,689
( Grunts )

381
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,163
( Gasping ) I cannot breathe!

382
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,394
You must hurry!

383
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,032
( Tires screech )

384
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:43,403
Aah!
aah!

385
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,704
( Tires screech )
( Grunts )

386
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,176
I'm okay.

387
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:47,637
All right, the jig is up!
Hand over that cooler!

388
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:48,638
Never!

389
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,181
Why not?
Why do you even need it?

390
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,513
I needed the cooler
to save my new friend

391
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,515
because he needs to go home
and he's really nice

392
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,646
and we combed
each others' hair

393
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:58,648
and he needs to be in the cooler
because he breathes water

394
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:00,650
because he's a merman!

395
00:17:02,492 --> 00:17:04,524
Hola.

396
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,197
Whoa! way to bury
the lead, Mabel.

397
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:10,430
Dipper, mermando the merman.
He's a merman.

398
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,103
Nice to meet you!
Also, I think I am dying.

399
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:15,365
( Gasps ) water!

400
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,667
( Gasps ) agua!
( Coughs ) yo necesito!

401
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,469
( Gasps )

402
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:20,640
Oh, no! Mermando!

403
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,313
Dipper, you're a lifeguard!
Give him cpr!

404
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:24,814
Mermen don't breathe air!

405
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,617
Then give him
reverse cpr! Doi!

406
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:28,648
( Pants )

407
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:35,585
( Gurgling )

408
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:36,586
I hate this!

409
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,088
( Gurgling )

410
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,089
I hate this!

411
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:40,530
( Gurgling )

412
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,462
( Camera shutter snaps )

413
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,134
( Laughs ) blackmail!

414
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:45,765
( Gasps )

415
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,297
Thank you for saving me,

416
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:49,769
but why didn't you just
roll me into the lake?

417
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,543
( Groans )

418
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,677
( Both grunt )

419
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,209
( Dolphin cry )

420
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,210
( Coughs )

421
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,711
I am weak from coughing.

422
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,383
How will I get my family
to hear my call

423
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,355
from the mighty depths
of the ocean?

424
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:07,287
I've got it. B.R.B.

425
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:09,759
Problem solved!

426
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,492
Mabel, those are pool supplies.
I'll get fired!

427
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:16,496
Dipper! don't you know what
it's like to fall for someone,

428
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:20,400
even though you know
in your heart that it'll
probably never work out?

429
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,572
But you'd do anything
for that person?

430
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:26,336
( Sighs )

431
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,837
Give mermando
the megaphone.

432
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:29,209
Thanks, dip.

433
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,782
Mabel, I have never
met anyone like you.

434
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,244
Same here.

435
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:36,586
Except for a zombie, a gnome,
and a couple of cute vampires.

436
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:37,887
I don't remember
the vampires.

437
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:39,749
I don't tell you everything.

438
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:42,892
Well, mermando,
i guess this is it.

439
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:44,724
Not quite. This is!

440
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,500
Whoa! okay, that's gross. Ugh.

441
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,363
( Cheers )

442
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:55,205
That was my first kiss!

443
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:58,208
Hey, it was also kind of
your first kiss too, huh? Huh?

444
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,670
( Shudders ) please
don't involve me in this.

445
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,472
Goodbye, mermando.

446
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:03,843
Goodbye, Mabel.

447
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,248
You did the right thing,
Dipper.

448
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,220
Yeah, yeah.

449
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:14,224
Oh, wait, wait!
One last thing!

450
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,657
Yes!

451
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:21,261
I've always wanted to do that.

452
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,534
A wrecked fence,
dents in the pool mobile,

453
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,267
and a missing megaphone?

454
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,339
Who is responsible for this?!

455
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,873
It's my fault, sir.
I'm sorry. I got in too deep.

456
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:37,307
Hand over the whistle, boy!

457
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,850
( Grunting )

458
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:47,717
( Chomping )

459
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:48,818
( Whistle blows )

460
00:19:48,818 --> 00:19:51,491
If one more thing
goes wrong today...

461
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:52,492
( Grunting )

462
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,593
You're free now! Free!

463
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,266
Inflatable ducks unite!

464
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,267
You!

465
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,928
Huh? aah!

466
00:19:58,928 --> 00:19:59,969
( Grunts )

467
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,931
( Screaming )

468
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,803
Git 'em! Git 'em!

469
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,406
( Groans )

470
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,877
Hey, doofus, you'll never
guess what happened.

471
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,239
I just got fired.

472
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,910
What? really?
Yeah.

473
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,243
I guess poolcheck found out
i was taking too many snacks.

474
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:14,744
How many?

475
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:15,985
( Laughs )

476
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:17,317
Hey, wanna go break rules
somewhere else?

477
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,318
Of course!

478
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,849
( Both laugh )

479
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:23,553
( Sighs )

480
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,496
Huh?

481
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,661
"Dear Mabel,
i am home with my family,

482
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,533
and I am very happy..."

483
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,865
Mermando: our first kiss
will always hold a place
in my heart.

484
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:37,006
Technically hearts...

485
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:39,869
As a merman I have,
like, 17 hearts.

486
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,841
Horrifying but true!

487
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,012
More bottles on the way!

488
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,845
( Laughs )

489
00:20:46,876 --> 00:20:47,877
Stanford!

490
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,779
( Laughs )

491
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,252
Well, guess you've won.
Put 'er there.

492
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,924
( Grunting ) hey! What the--

493
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,256
unless perhaps
i predicted your plan,

494
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,889
and coated the entire chair
with glue last night!

495
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:03,262
Enjoy your chair...
( Whispers ) forever.

496
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,765
( Laughs )

497
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,767
( Grunts )

498
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,801
Kids, get the spatulas! Kids!

499
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:14,273
В™єв™є

500
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:31,961
