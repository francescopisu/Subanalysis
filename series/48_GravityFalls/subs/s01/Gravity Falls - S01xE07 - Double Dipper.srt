1
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,316
Oh, no Mabel. I--
i don't feel so good!

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,450
I--

3
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,352
bleechhh!

4
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:21,455
Ohh! grunkle Stan,
what did you feed us?

5
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,791
Bwahhhh!

6
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,194
( Both "retching" )

7
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,495
( Both laughing )

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,497
Guys, stop!

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,432
Something terrible
just happened!

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,302
( "Retching" )

11
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:36,370
( Laughing )

12
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,342
All right, all right!

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,411
Party supplies
are now off-limits.

14
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,446
Mr. pines,
whose birthday is it again?

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,481
Nobody's. thought this party
might be a good way

16
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,450
to get kids to spend money
at the shack.

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,384
Nice!

18
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,486
The young people of this town
want fun,

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,156
I'll smother 'em with fun!

20
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,426
Maybe comments like that
are why kids don't come
to the mystery shack.

21
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:02,463
Hey! hey! How's about
you make yourself useful
and copy these flyers?

22
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,170
Oh, boy! A trip to
the copier store!

23
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,172
Calendars, mugs,
t-shirts and more!

24
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,341
They got it all
at the copier store.

25
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,144
That's not their slogan,
i just really feel that way
about the copier store.

26
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,546
Save the trouble.
You know the old copier
in my office?

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,549
I finally fixed
the old girl up.
Good as new!

28
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,418
( Electrical crackling )

29
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,420
Butterflies!

30
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,523
Does it even work?

31
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,392
( Mechanical humming )

32
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,427
Uhh!

33
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,165
( Both coughing )

34
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,535
Success!

35
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,570
Aah!

36
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,175
Aaah!

37
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,181
Stay back!

38
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:02,590
Oh, my gosh. Mabel,
i think this copier
can copy human beings!

39
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,528
Do you realize
what this means?

40
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,299
( "Retching" )

41
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,202
**

42
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,310
all right, party people,

43
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,945
and Dipper,

44
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,580
let's talk business.

45
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,982
Soos, because
you'll work for free--
and you begged--

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,484
I'm letting you be d.J.

47
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,286
You won't regret it,
Mr. pines.

48
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,356
I got this book that
teached me how to d.J.
R-r-r-right.

49
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,324
Not encouraging.

50
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:13,227
Wendy, you and Mabel
are working the ticket stand.

51
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,564
What?! but grunkle Stan,
this party is my chance
to make new friends!

52
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,232
I-i could work
with Wendy.

53
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:23,237
You realize if you do,
you gotta commit to staying
at the ticket stand with Wendy.

54
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:27,708
No getting out of it,
just the two of you,
alone, all night.

55
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,313
Ha ha ha!

56
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:34,448
( Laughing )

57
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,251
I promise.

58
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,791
Aah! what?

59
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,760
(Mocking) uh, uh,
i can work the counter
with you, Wendy!

60
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,463
Let's kiss! Mmm...Mmm...

61
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,031
Yeah, yeah,
laugh all you want,

62
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,300
but I have devised a plan

63
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,803
to make sure my night with Wendy
goes perfect. ( Clicks tongue)

64
00:03:55,836 --> 00:04:00,274
Plan? oh, you're not
making one of those
overcomplicated listy things,

65
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:02,576
overcomplicated?

66
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,281
Let me just--all right,
hold that there... okay...

67
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,684
"Step one:
Getting to know each other
with playful banter."

68
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,586
Banter is like talking,
but smarter.

69
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,356
That sounds like
a dumb idea for poop-heads.

70
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,790
Yeah, see,
this isn't banter.

71
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,426
This is what I want
to avoid with Wendy.

72
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,861
The final step
is to ask her to dance.

73
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,597
Oh, Dipper!

74
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,034
I'm so happy you decided to work
the ticket stand with me!

75
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:31,372
You're so organized.
Show me that checklist again?

76
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,272
Oh!

77
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:35,042
If I follow
steps one through eleven,

78
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,744
nothing can get in my way.

79
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,580
Dipper, you're the one
getting in your way.

80
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,317
Why can't you just walk up
and talk to her
like a normal person?

81
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,485
Step nine, sister...

82
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,457
( Dance music plays )

83
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,398
( Scatting to music )

84
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,633
Can your uncle
throw a party or what?

85
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,569
(Over pa) The energy--
it's electric!

86
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:05,406
U( ducks quack, dogs bark )

87
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,774
And if anyone
wants to leave,

88
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,809
I'm charging an exit fee
of 15 bucks!

89
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,479
I'vwe're trapped!

90
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,121
"Step one: Casual banter."

91
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,457
So, here's a casual question.
(Clears throat)

92
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,859
What's your favorite
type of snack food?

93
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,596
Oh, man. I can't
just pick one.

94
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,431
No way! Mine too!

95
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,400
Uh, I mean--

96
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,467
I mean--

97
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,739
(coughing)
new topic! New topic!

98
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,641
**

99
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,810
go! go!
Work it! Work it!

100
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:52,119
Wow! you've got an animal
on your body! I'm Mabel.

101
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,856
(Very low voice)
Hi. I'm grenda.
This is candy.

102
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,426
Why do you have forks
taped to your fingers?

103
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,463
Improvement of
human being.

104
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,766
( Both laugh )

105
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,768
I've found my people.

106
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,170
Remember, dudes,
whoever, um,

107
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,440
party hearties--what?--

108
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,442
gets the party crown!

109
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,677
Most applause at the end
of the night wins!

110
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,878
( Inhales )

111
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:18,979
Wwow!

112
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,850
Party crown?
I'll take that.

113
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,418
Thank you very much.

114
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,753
Who's that?

115
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,422
The most popular girl in town:
Pacifica northwest.

116
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,891
I always feel bad about myself
around her.

117
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,426
I can't just
give you the crown.

118
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,661
It's sort of
a competition thing.

119
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:38,198
( Laughs ) honestly,
who's gonna compete
against me?

120
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,834
(Pacifica, over pa):
Fork girl? Lizard lady?

121
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,571
( Laughing )

122
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,972
Hold me, candy!

123
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,508
Our kind isn't
welcome here!

124
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,479
Hey! I'll compete!

125
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,480
( Both gasp )

126
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,346
I'm Mabel.

127
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,550
That sounds like
a fat old lady's name.

128
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,552
I'll take that
as a compliment.

129
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,589
May the better partier win.

130
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,623
( Snaps fingers )

131
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,859
Nice meeting you!

132
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,461
She's going down.

133
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,862
( Raucous party sounds )

134
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,231
Whoa! sounds like the party's
gettin' nuts!

135
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,502
Let the battle for
the party crown begin!

136
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,470
Mabel comes out strong.

137
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,839
Watch out, pacifica!

138
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,475
I've gotta get in there!
Cover for me?

139
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,477
Heh heh. Um, well, i--

140
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,479
thanks, man.

141

**

142
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,619
I'll be back shortly!

143
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,221
I'm sure Stan won't mind
if I'm gone for a few minutes.

144
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,524
Hey! what are you
doin', kid?!

145
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,559
These suckers aren't
going to rip themselves off.

146
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,960
Yeah!

147
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,530
You promised. Remember?

148
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,664
I did?

149
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,933
Dipper: I promise.

150
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,707
( Sighs )

151
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,612
Wendy: whoo-hoo-hoo!

152
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:02,015
Argh. if only I could be
two places at once.

153
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,851
( Wind whistles )

154
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,659
( Copier powers up )

155
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,961
I wonder if this
is a good idea.

156
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,673
Whoa!

157
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,541
I have a really big head.

158
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,280
So, uh--

159
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,548
ha! sorry.

160
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:35,683
You first.

161
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,718
Stop copying me!

162
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,986
Ha ha ha ha!

163
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,755
Aah! ow! Ow!
Funny bone.

164
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,759
I will call you
"number two."

165
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:46,960
Definitely not.

166
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,629
You know a name
I've always wanted...

167
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,831
Tyrone.

168
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,966
Okay, Tyrone,
let's get down to business.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,002
I'm thinkin' you cover me
at the ticket stand

170
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,970
while I ask Wendy to dance.

171
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,039
I know the plan, buddy.

172
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,312
Hey, we're not gonna get jealous
and turn on each other

173
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,914
like the clones
in the movies, are we?

174
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,116
Dipper, please. This is you
you're talking about.

175
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,586
Plus, hey, you can always
just disintegrate me with water.

176
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,655
Yeah...

177
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,156
Yeah....

178
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,597
Whew.

179
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,733
( Scatting to music )

180
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,034
Great news, Wendy.

181
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,603
I got somebody to cover
the concessions for me.

182
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:32,105
That's awesome! You can
hang out with me and Robbie.

183
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,775
Robbie, you remember Dipper
from the convenience store.

184
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,343
Uh, no.

185
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,746
Yo, Wendy, check out
my new guitar.

186
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,881
( Plays fancy lick )

187
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,982
Whoa, cool.

188
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:47,154
Robbie, you're a stupid,
arrogant fraud,

189
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,090
but kiss me anyway
because you can play guitar.

190
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,125
Oh, wait. I forgot
something.

191
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,062
Ohh...

192
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,665
Let's get married tonight!

193
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,167
( Cell phone rings )

194
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,902
Dipper 2: Hey, buddy,
it's me. You.

195
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,270
I just had the same
jealousy fantasy.

196
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,173
We gotta get rid of Robbie
if I ever want to
dance with Wendy!

197
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,409
Hey, Dipper!
We're gonna go sit on the couch.
Meet us when you're done.

198
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,178
Oh, no! They're
sitting on the couch!

199
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,113
We gotta think of
something quick!

200
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,784
I got the same one.

201
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,686
But we're gonna
need some help.

202
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,155
And that's where
you come in,
number three.

203
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,892
But what if Robbie catches me?
I'll be all alone.

204
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,393
Omakes a good point..

205
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,829
Four dippers. This is
a four-Dipper plan.

206
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,163
( Small explosion )

207
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,199
Uh-oh, paper jam.

208
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,107
Nyi-nyi-nyi-nyi!

209
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,076
( Scratchy, disjointed
laughter )

210
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,212
Come on, you're not gonna
make me partner up with him,
are you?

211
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,147
Shh! don't be rude.

212
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,916
Hey, buddy, hey.
It's okay.

213
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,118
( Shrill gibberish )

214
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,086
Okay,
just one more clone.

215
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,189
* ...Me is forever

216
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,194
( very high note)

217
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,996
( cheers )

218
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,164
(Breathless)
* forever *

219
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,966
I used to
sing like that...

220
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,467
Before my voice changed.

221
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,002
Pacifica pulls ahead!

222
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,170
Try and top that.

223
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,905
Oh, grenda? By the way,

224
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,708
you sound like
a professional wrestler.
Ha ha ha ha!

225
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,177
I wanna put her in a headlock
and make her feel pain!

226
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,847
It's not over
till it's over,
sisters!

227
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,948
Watch this!

228
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,850
Soos! give me

229
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,887
the eighties's
crowd-pleasingest,
rock balladiest song you got!

230
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,191
Excellent.

231
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:35,195
* don't start
un-believing *

232
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,199
* never don't not
feel your feelings *

233
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,934
( cheering )

234
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,304
Now I'm gonna
do a flip!

235
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,908
That was for you guys!!!

236
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,709
( Loud cheering )

237
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,079
( Whispering )

238
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,247
Dudes, would the owner
of a silver and red dirt bike

239
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,117
please report outside?
It is being stolen right now.

240
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,185
Wait--what?!

241
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,289
Ha ha ha!

242
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,191
Hey! come back here!

243
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,127
Oh, tough break.
I wonder who those guys are

244
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,496
that aren't me
because I'm right here?

245
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,298
Now we're gonna
bring it down for a minute.

246
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,101
Ladies, dudes,
now's the time.

247
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,305
* ( slow dance music )

248
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,740
Ah, snap!
Love this song!

249
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,314
Hey, goofus!
Now's your chance
to ask Wendy--

250
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,283
now's your chance
to ask Wendy to dance!

251
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,886
Coi--ahh--o!

252
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,224
Uhh-uhh-uhh...

253
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,994
Aah! I'll be right back.

254
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,899
Oh, I agree. You can't
just go and dance with her.

255
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,869
The dance floor
is a mine field!
A mine field, Tyrone!

256
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,337
What if there's a glitch
in the sound system!

257
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,940
Srobbie might come back!Y!

258
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,009
There's too many variables!
We need help.

259
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:11,859
( All dippers
talking at once )

260
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:14,394
All right, dippers,
gather round.

261
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,866
Now's the time.
You all clear on
what to do?

262
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,004
Hey, Soos, look!
A glowing dot!

263
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,908
Oh, man, I am so glad
i turned my head.

264
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,010
That dot does not disappoint.

265
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,827
Right. like I'm gonna
fall for that.

266
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:51,264
Aaah! gimme that money, Sonny!

267
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,634
There's your cue.

268
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,404
It's the perfect moment
to ask Wendy to dance.

269
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,271
Good luck, me.

270
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,841
I don't need luck.
I have a plan.

271
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,411
Aaah!

272
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,413
Oh, hey, man,
w-what are you doing here?

273
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,016
I mean, wouldn't you rather
be out on the dance floor,

274
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,650
uh, in, like,
exactly 42 seconds?

275
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,385
I'm just waiting
for the bathroom.

276
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,154
Um, um, okay.

277
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,655
Uh, small talk,
small talk, small talk...

278
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,959
So, hey, let's say
everyone at this party
gets stuck on a desert island.

279
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,627
Who do you think
the leader would be?

280
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,162
I...uh--

281
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,331
I think I'd go with
this lunatic.

282
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,299
( Grunting )

283
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,135
( Laughs )

284
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,904
I'd probably go for
stretch over there.

285
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:33,907
Uh, because tall people
can reach coconuts?

286
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,310
( Laughs )

287
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,446
Speaking of tall,
want to see something?

288
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,015
Those are my three brothers,
and I'm...

289
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,350
Boop!

290
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,086
Ha! you were a freak!

291
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,654
Yep.

292
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,389
You know, kids used to
make fun of my birthmark

293
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,091
before I started
hiding it all the time.

294
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,226
Uh, no, it's nothing!

295
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,228
I-i--
why did I say that?!

296
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,697
No way, dude.
Now you have to show me.

297
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,033
Show me, show me!

298
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,472
The big Dipper!

299
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,075
That's how you
got your nickname!

300
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,410
I thought your parents
just hated you or something.

301
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,080
Hey, I guess
we're both freaks.

302
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,450
( Both laughing )

303
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,486
Of course!

304
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,454
( Door closhey!

305
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,023
What are you doing up here?!

306
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,458
Number ten had been
distracting Soos for 15 minutes!

307
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,996
He's gonna get tired
Soos: Never!Eventually.

308
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,364
You won't believe it, guys.
I bumped into Wendy accidentally

309
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,100
and things are actually
going great!

310
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,136
That's nice, but not the plan.
Do we have to remind you?

311
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,006
( All talking at once )

312
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,374
Oh, man,
you guys sound crazy.

313
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,710
Look, maybe we don't
need the plan anymore,
ya know?

314
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,279
Maybe I could just go talk
to her like a normal person.

315
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,348
You bite your tongue!

316
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,682
If you're not gonna
stick to the plan,

317
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,719
maybe you shouldn't be
the Dipper to dance with Wendy.

318
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,355
If y( All talking )it...

319
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,026
Guys, come on.
We said we weren't
gonna turn on each other.

320
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,994
I think we all knew
we were lying.

321
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,762
No! no! Hey!

322
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,532
( Screaming )

323
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,538
Uhh!

324
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,040
No, wait!

325
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:18,211
Aaah! I can't breathe
clone: Yeah, you can!

326
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:21,548
Plus there's snacks
and a coloring book
in there for you!

327
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,016
Ohh!

328
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,391
Okay, so now that
original Dipper--
or "Dipper classic"--

329
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:35,228
is no longer fit for it,
i nominate myself
to dance with Wendy instead.

330
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,297
I've been around the longest,
so it should be me.

331
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,299
Right? I mean, logically.
Logically, guys.

332
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,667
Fair point, fair point.

333
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,470
Counterpoint:
maybe I should get
to dance with Wendy

334
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,572
because I've been around
for the least.

335
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,474
That makes,
like, zero sense.

336
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,309
You make zero sense!

337
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,211
Don't shove people!

338
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,046
Nyi-nyi-nyi-nyi!

339
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,013
Aaaah!

340
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:57,184
Hey, you want some
cheese and crackers, buddy?

341
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,318
( Wheezy, drooly sounds )

342
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,420
Huh? huh?

343
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,189
Yikes.

344
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,256
Hey, guys?

345
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,325
What would you do if you
were trapped in a closet?

346
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,226
All: break out.

347
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,566
Wend--

348
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,168
( muffled shouting )

349
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,270
Come on, man, give it up.
You're overpowered.

350
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,838
Hold on, guys,
think about it.

351
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,208
We're exact equals
mentally and physically.

352
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,843
If we start fighting,

that whoever wins,

378
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,316
it's been a super-fun party.

I understand
if you want to leave.

416
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,325
But then we would
miss the sleep-over.

417
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,793
We want to call our moms

418
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,428

with you!

Really? you guys!

422
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,770
Maybe we don't have
as many friends as pacifica,

423
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:41,541
but we have each other,
and that is pretty good,
i think.

424
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,377
Soos! play another song!

425

00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,495
Ahh. you think we really
even have a chance with Wendy?

431
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,831
I mean, she's 15, we're 12.

432
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,533
I don't know, man.
I hope so.

433
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,436
But we're making zero progress
the way we're doing it.

434
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,470
The only good conversation
you had with her

435
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,739
was when you didn't do
any of that list stuff.

436
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,409
I know. Mabel was right,
i do get in my own way.

437
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,844

Remember what
we talked about.

442
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,527
Uh, of course!

443
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,330
Hey, and quit being
such a wimp around Wendy, okay?

444
