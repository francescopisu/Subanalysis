1
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:09,443
Man on TV:
I'm afraid your services
won't be required here, sir.

2
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,312
My men have examined
the evidence,

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,082
and this is obviously
an accident.

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,488
What?!

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,524
Duck-tective will return
after these messages.

6
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,460
That duck is a genius.

7
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:29,397
Eh. it's easier to find clues
when you're that close
to the ground.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,466
Are you saying you could
outwit duck-tective?

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,469
Mabel, I have very keen
powers of observation.

10
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,471
For example,
just by smelling your breath

11
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:39,473
I can tell that
you have been eating...

12
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,277
(Sniffs)...
an entire tube
of toothpaste?

13
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,513
Zeus: hey, dudes!

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,415
You'll never guess
what I found!

15
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:49,317
Buriburied... ure!

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,385
Hey, I was gonna say that!

17
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:54,122
So I was cleaning up
when I found this secret door

18
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,124
hidden behind
the wallpaper.

19
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,626
It's crazy-bonkers-creepy.

20
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,528
( Hinges squeak )

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,366
Whoa! it's a secret wax museum.

22
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,301
They're so life-like.

23
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,469
Except for that one.

24
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,603
( Kids scream )

25
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:13,107
Ha ha! It's just me,
your grunkle Stan!

26
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,376
( All scream louder )

27
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,312
**

28
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,587
behold the gravity falls
wax museum.

29
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,889
It was one of our most
popular attractions!

30
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,324
Before I forgot all about it.

31
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,260
I got 'em all...
Genghis Khan, Sherlock Holmes,

32
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:09,330
some kind of,
i don't know, goblin man.

33
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,465
Ooh! is anyone else
getting the creeps here?

34
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,434
And now for
my personal favorite...

35
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,636
Wax Abraham Lincoln,
right over...

36
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,938
Oh, no! Come on!

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,707
Who left the blinds open?!

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,244
Wax John wilkes booth,
I'm lookin' in your direction.

39
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:26,180
How do you fix
a wax figure?

40
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:27,715
Cheer up,
grunkle Stan.

41
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,284
Meh.e's that smile?

42
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:31,919
Ow.p bop boop.

43
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:36,724
Don't worry, grunkle Stan,
I'll make you a new wax figure
from all this old wax.

44
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,393
You really think you could
make one of these puppies?

45
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,396
Grunkle Stan,
I'm an arts and crafts master.

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,233
Why do you think I always have
this glue gun stuck to my arm?

47
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,735
I like your gumption, kid.

48
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,371
I don't know
what that word means,
but thank you.

49
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,606
Dipper.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,309
What do you think
of my wax figure idea?

51
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,278
She's part fairy Princess,

52
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,480
and part horse
fairy Princess.

53
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,350
Maybe you should carve
something from real life.

54
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:05,219
Like a waffle
with big arms!

55
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,988
Yo-Kay, or, ya know,
something else,

56
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,690
like someone in your family.

57
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,360
Kids! have you
seen my pants?

58
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,764
O muse, you work
in mysterious ways.

59
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,500
Why is your sister
talking to the ceiling?

60
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,783
I think it needs
more glitter.

61
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,451
Agreed.

62
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,489
I found my pants,
but now I'm missing my...

63
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,291
( Screaming )

64
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,459
What do you think?

65
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:49,330
I think the wax museum's
back in business!

66
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,440
I can't believe
this many people
showed up.

67
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:00,641
I know, right?

68
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,443
Your uncle probably
bribed 'em or something.

69
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,645
( Both laugh )

70
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,449
( Coughs )

71
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,517
( Microphone feedback )

72
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,686
You all know me, folks,
town doll and Mr. mystery.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,289
Please, ladies!
Control yourselves!

74
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,325
( Flies buzzing )

75
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,394
As you know, I always bring
the people of this fair town

76
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,729
novelties and befuddlements,

77
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,432
the likes of which
the world has never known.

78
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,666
But enough about me.

79
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,401
Behold...

80
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,436
Me!

81
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,838
* ( fanfare )

82
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,307
* ye-ah!
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-ah! *

83
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,344
( coughing )

84
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,313
And now a word from
our own mabelangelo.

85
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,448
It's Mabel.

86
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,082
Thank you for coming.

87
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,852
I made this sculpture
with my own two hands!

88
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,788
It's covered in my blood,
sweat, tears,

89
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,557
and other fluids.

90
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,459
Ewww!

91
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,693
Heh heh. Yeah.

92
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,596
I will now take questions.
You there.

93
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,798
Old man mcgucket, local kook.

94
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,434
Are the wax figures alive?
And, follow-up question,

95
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,603
can I survive
the wax man uprising?

96
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,473
Um... yes! Next question.

97
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,808
Toby determined,
gravity falls gossiper.

98
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,078
Do you really think
this constitutes
a wonder of the world?

99
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,481
Your microphone's
a Turkey baster, Toby.

100
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,616
Inext question..

101
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,452
Shandra jimenez,
a real reporter.

102
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,855
Your fliers promised
free pizza with admission
to this event.

103
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,890
Is this true?

104
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,125
Come on! Hat I heard.

105
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,127
I want my pizza.

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,796
That was a typo.

107
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,831
Good night, everyone!

108
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,867
( All yelling angrily )

109
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,436
Ohhh.

110
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,873
In your face!

111
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,609
We're not coming back here.

112
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,644
I think that went well.

113
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,449
Hot pumpkin pie!
Look at all this cash!

114
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,518
And I owe it all
to one person...

115
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,420
This guy.

116
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,688
Ooh! yeah, you too,
ya little gremlin.

117
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,658
Now, you kids wash up.
We got another long day
of fleecing rubes tomorrow.

118
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,826
Go! go!

119
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,628
Ahh, kids.

120
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,530
Well, duck-dective,

121
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:05,533
it seems you've really
"quacked" the case.

122
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,802
Ha ha!

123
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,638
Stupid duck.

124
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,506
Well, I'm gonna
use the John.

125
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,642
You need anything?

126
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:19,447
( Laughs )
i love this guy!
Don't you go nowhere.

127
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,881
( Wolf howls, wind whistles )

128
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,723
Dipper, you wanna do
a toothbrush okay.

129
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:32,793
Stan (in distance):
No... no... nooooo!

130
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:36,730
Wax Stan! He's been...
Murdered!

131
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:41,569
( Grandfather clock chimes )

132
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,803
Ohhh!

133
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,572
( Police radio chatter )

134
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,676
I got up to use the John,
right?

135
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,679
And when I come back,
blammo! He's headless!

136
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:55,449
My expert handcrafting
besmirched.

137
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,717
Besmirched!!!

138
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,752
Who would do something
like this?

139
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,954
What's your opinion,
sheriff blubs?

140
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,557
Look, we'd love
to help you folks,

141
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:06,894
but let's face the facts...
This case is unsolvable.

142
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,763
What?! you take that back,
sheriff bwhat?

143
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,666
You're kidding, right?
There must be evidence, motives.

144
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,868
Ya know, I could help,
he's really good.

145
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,638
He figured out who was
eating our tin cans.

146
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,640
All signs
pointed to the goat.

147
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,709
Yeah, yeah,
let the boy help.

148
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,019
He's got a little brain
up in his head.

149
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,546
Whoo! would you look
at what we got here!

150
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,015
City boy thinks
he's gonna solve a mystery

151
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,618
with his fancy computer phone!

152
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,621
City Bo-oy!
City Bo-oy!

153
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,623
You are adorable.

154
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,990
Adorable?

155
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,560
Ha ha ha!

156
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,828
Look p.J.'S,

157
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,797
how about you leave
the investigatin'
to the grown-ups?

158
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,666
Radio:
attention, all units.

159
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,844
Steve is going to fit an entire
cantaloupe in his mouth.

160
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,637
Repeat, an entire cantaloupe.

161
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,705
Let's move.!

162
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,574
( Both laughing )

163
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,644
That's it! Mabel, you and me
are going to find the jerk
who did this

164
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,011
and get back that head!

165
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,648
Then we'll see
who's adorable.

166
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,715
( Sneezes )

167
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,484
Aw. you sneeze
like a kitten.

168
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,056
Wax Stan has lost his head,

169
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,091
and it's up to us to find it.

170
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,696
There were a lot of unhappy
customers at the unveiling.

171
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,031
The murderer could
have been anyone.

172
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,534
Yeah! even us!

173
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:23,637
In this town,
anything is possible,
ghosts, zombies...

174
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,906
Could be months before
we find our first clue.

175
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,641
Hey, look, a clue!

176
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,877
Footprints in
the shag carpet.

177
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,746
That's weird.
They've got a hole in them.

178
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,815
And they're leading to...

179
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,949
( Gasps )

180
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,587
So what do you think?

181
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,689
In my opinion,
this is an ax.

182
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,825
Wait a minute...
The lumberjack!

183
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,093
Both: of course!

184
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,928
In your face!

185
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,764
He was furious when he
didn't get that free pizza.

186
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:53,000
Furious enough
for murder!

187
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,702
Oh, you mean manley Dan?

188
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,738
He hangs out at this
crazy-intense biker joint
downtown.

189
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,640
Then that's
where we're going.

190
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,741
Dude, this is awesome.

191
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,342
You two are like
the mystery twins.

192
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,644
Don't call us that.

193
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,782
Hey, gimme a hand
with this coffin,
will ya?

194
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,118
I'm doing a memorial service
for wax Stan.

195
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,787
Something small, but classy.

196
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,355
Sorry, grunkle Stan,

197
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,125
but we've got a big break
break in the case!

198
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,361
We're heading into town
right now to interrogate
the murderer.

199
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,064
We have an ax!
Ree! Ree! Ree!

200
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,901
Seems like the kind of thing
a responsible parent
wouldn't want you doing.

201
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,871
Good thing I'm an uncle.
Avenge me, kids!

202
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,641
Avenge me!!!

203
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,915
This is the place.

204
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,654
Got the fake I.D.'S?

205
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,588
Here goes nothing.

206
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,992
Sorry, but we don't
serve minors.

207
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,127
Dagnabbit!

208
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,165
We're here to interrogate
manley Dan the lumberjack

209
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,167
for the murder
of wax Stan.

210
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,902
Deedle-eedle-eet.

211
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,871
Works for me.

212
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,143
( Yelling, glass breaking )

213
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,646
( Fighting noises )

214
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,150
He's resting.

215
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,053
All right, let's just
try to blend in, okay?

216
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,389
You got it,
dipping sauce.

217
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,792
Hey, there, fellow
restaurant patron!

218
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25,926
Bap!

219
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,227
Grrrr!

220
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,397
Aaaah!!!

221
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,033
Manley Dan!
Just the guy
i wanted to see.

222
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,135
Whepunchin' the clock.Ght?

223
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,770
You were at work?

224
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,806
No, I was punchin' that clock!

225
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,175
Ten o'clock.
The time of the murder.

226
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,112
So I guess you've never
seen this before?

227
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,214
Lhey, actually, I'm...

228
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,416
I wouldn't pick my teeth
with that ax!

229
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,152
It's left-handed.
I only use my right hand.

230
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,221
The manly hand!

231
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,690
Hit him!
Hit him!

232
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:57,958
Hee hee hee!

233
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,093
Left-handed...

234
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,896
Both:
three, four, five, six.

235
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,166
Oh! your wife
is gonna be beautiful.

236
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,768
Yes!

237
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,803
Mabel, big break
in the case!

238
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,438
But will she love me?

239
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,240
It's a left-handed ax.

240
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,875
These are all our suspects.

241
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,076
Manley Dan is right-handed.

242
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,246
That means all we gotta do
is find our left-handed suspect

243
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,715
and we'veoh, man! Killer.

244
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,984
We are on fire today!

245
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,252
Pazow! pazow! Pazow!

246
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,287
Let's find that murderer.

247
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,006
( Whistles )

248
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,255
Mabel! there's only
one person left
on this list!

249
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,491
Of course!
It all adds up.

250
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,725
( Siren wailing )

251
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,997
You kids better
be right about this,

252
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,498
or you'll never
hear the end of it.

253
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,300
The evidence is
irrefutable.

254
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,302
It's so
irrefutable.

255
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,304
I'm gonna get to use
my night stick!

256
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,039
You ready,
little fella?

257
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,808
Whoo! whoo!

258
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,143
On three.
One, two...

259
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,012
Nobody move!
This is a raid!

260
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:28,015
What is this,
some kind of raid?

261
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,518
Toby determined,
you're under arrest

262
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,221
for the murder of the wax body
of grunkle Stan!

263
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,857
You have the right
to remain impressed

264
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,259
with our awesome
detective work.

265
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,061
Gobbling goose feathers!

266
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,529
I don't understand!

267
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,264
Then allow me to explain.

268
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,934
You were hoping
that grunkle Stan's
new attraction

269
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,103
would be the story that saved
your failing newspaper.

270
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,280
But when the show was a flop,

271
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,374
you decided to go out
and make your own headline.

272
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,044
But you were sloppy,

273
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,578
and all the clues pointed to

274
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,348
a shabby-shoed reporter
who was caught left-handed!

275
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,918
Toby determined,
you're yesterday's news.

276
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,988
Boy, your little knees
must be sore

277
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,358
from jumping to conclusions!

278
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,826
Ha-cha-cha!

279
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,962
I had nothing to do
with that murder.

280
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,931
Huh? could you repeat...?

281
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,367
Then where were you
the night of the break-in?

282
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,969
Uh...

283
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:23,303
( Tape rewinding )

284
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,305
Finally we can be alone,

285
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,877
cardboard cut-out of
female news reporter
shandra jimenez!

286
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,213
Yuck!

287
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,149
Time stamp confirms it.
Toby, you're off the hook,

288
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,385
you freak of hurray!

289
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,421
But... but it has to be him!
Check the ax for fingerprints.

290
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,191
No prints at all.

291
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,592
No prints?

292
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,394
Hey, I got
a headline for ya:

293
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,397
"City kids waste
everyone's time."

294
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,133
( All laugh )

295
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,270
Boy, I'd be pretty embarrassed
if I was you two!

296
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,412
Kids, Zeus,

297
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,280
lifeless wax figures,

298
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,882
thank you all for coming.

299
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,950
( Blows nose )

300
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,352
Some people might say
that it's wrong for a man

301
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,654
to love a wax replica
of himself.

302
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,389
Teasy, Zeus.G!

303
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:20,660
Wax Stan, I hope
you're pickin' pockets
in wax heaven.

304
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,296
I'm sorry, I got
glitter in my eye!

305
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,232
( Crying ) oh, dude!

306
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,234
Huh. those cops
were right about me.

307
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:31,038
Dipper, we've come so far.
We can't give up now.

308
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,273
But I considered everything...

309
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:36,309
The weapon, the motive,
the clues...

310
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:40,247
Huh. wax Stan's shoe
has a hole in it.

311
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,182
All the wax guys
have that.

312
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,252
It's where the pole thingie
attaches to their
stand dealies.

313
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,054
Wait a minute!

314
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,290
What has holes in its shoes
and no fingerprints?

315
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,459
Mabel! the murderers are...

316
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,462
Standing right
behind you?

317
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,299
Wax Sherlock Holmes!

318
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,001
Wax Shakespeare!

319
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,403
What's up, homes?

320
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,006
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

321
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,409
Congratulations,
my two amateur sleuths.

322
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,478
You've unburied the truth!

323
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,948
And now we're
going to bury you.

324
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,288
( Bravo, Dipper pines! )

325
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,958
You've discovered
our little secret.

326
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,259
Applaud, everyone!

327
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,461
Applaud sarcastically!

328
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,230
Uh, no, that sounds
too Sincere.

329
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,999
Slow clap.
There we go.

330
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,500
Nice and condescending.

331
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,236
But how is this possible?
You're made of wax!

332
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,338
Are you... magic?

333
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:42,142
Are we magic?
She wants to know
if we're magic!

334
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,513
Cursed! cursed!

335
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,983
Cursed to come to life
whenever the moon is waxing.

336
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:54,321
Your uncle bought us
many years ago
at a garage sale.

337
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,523
A haunted garage sale,
son!

338
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,462
I must warn you,
these statues come
at a terrible price.

339
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:05,532
Twenty dollars?!
I'll just take 'em
when you're not looking.

340
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,300
I said I was
gonna Rob ya.

341
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:11,404
Sherlock:
and so the mystery shack
wax collection was born.

342
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:14,274
By day we would be
the playthings of man.

343
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,544
Coolio:
but when your uncle was asleep,
they would rule the night.

344
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,447
Hey. I told you to stmake me.

345
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,549
( Laughing )

346
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,018
Huh?

347
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,555
It was a charmed life
for us cursed beings.

348
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:35,295
That is, until your uncle
closed up shop.

349
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,578
We've been waiting ten years
to get our revenge on Stan

350
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,081
for locking us away.

351
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,052
But we got the wrong guy.

352
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,288
( Stan coughing, spitting )

353
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:05,058
So you were trying to
murder grunkle Stan for real?

354
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:08,828
You were right
all along, Dipper!
Wax people are creepy!

355
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,332
Enough! now that
you know our secret,

356
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,367
you must die.

357
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,837
( All growling )

358
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,606
What do we do?
What do we do?!

359
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,241
I don't know!

360
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,613
Aaaah!

361
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:31,084
That's it!
We can melt them with
hotty melty things!

362
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,488
Anyone move, and we'll
melt you into candles!

363
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,157
Decorative candles!

364
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,160
You really think
you can defeat us?

365
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,629
It's worth a shot,
I'm not really sure.

366
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,165
So be it. Attack!

367
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,534
Aaah!

368
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:49,569
Uhh! aaah!

369
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,106
Ohh! aaah!

370
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,643
Interview this,
Larry king!

371
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,312
My neck!
My beautiful neck!

372
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,414
Joke's on you, Groucho!

373
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,217
I've heard about
a cutting remark,
but this is ridiculous.

374
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,119
Hey, why is there
nothing in my hand?

375
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,121
( Roaring )

376
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,293
Ha! genghis Khan,
you fell harder than the...

377
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,129
Ah, I don't know,
Jin dynasty?

378
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,297
Yeah. all right.

379
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,267
Ow! ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

380
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,636
Wdipper, watch out!?

381
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,175
All right, let's
get this taken care of.

382
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,678
Catch!

383
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,686
Uh... uh...

384
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,155
Once your family
is out of the way,

385
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,524
we'll rule the night
once again!

386
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,294
Don't count on it!

387
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,231
Come back here,
you brat!

388
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,135
Uh... oh...

389
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,709
You really think
you can outwit me, boy?

390
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,312
I'm Sherlock bleeding Holmes!

391
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,647
Have you seen
my magnifying glass?!

392
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,249
It's enormous!

393
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,750
Oohh!

394
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,958
( Sigh of relief )

395
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,231
Any last words?

396
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,733
Um...
you got any sun screen?

397
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,702
Got any... what?!

398
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,738
( Gasps )

399
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,374
You know, letting me
lead you outside,

400
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,276
probably not your
sharpest decision.

401
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,446
Outsmarted by a child
in short pants!

402
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,481
Noooo!

403
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,950
Fiddlesticks!
humbugs!

404
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,553
It's a total
kerfuffle!

405
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,954
What a hullaballoo!

406
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,989
Case closed.

407
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,991
( Sneezes )

408
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,627
Ha ha ha!
You sneeze like a kitten.

409
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,963
Those policemen were right,
you're adorable.

410
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,765
Adorable!!!

411
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,001
Eww.

412
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,637
* though our group
been cleft in twain *

413
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,340
* man of wax
shall rise again! *

414
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,442
you know uh... imericks?

415
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,744
There once was
a dude from Kentucky...

416
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,346
Aaah!

417
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,282
Dipper! you're okay!

418
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,450
You solved the mystery
after all.

419
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,652
I couldn't have done it
without my sidekick.

420
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,021
No offense, Dipper,
but you're the sidekick.

421
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,524
What? says who?
Are people saying that?
Have you heard that?

422
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,359
Hot Belgian waffles!

423
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,262
What happened
to my parlor?!

424
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,264
Your wax figures
turned out to be evil,

425
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,732
so we fought them
to the death!

426
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,301
I decapitated
Larry king.

427
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,504
Ha ha! You kids
and your imaginations.

428
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,507
On the bright side, though,
look what we found.

429
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,808
My head! Ha ha!

430
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,776
I missed this guy.

431
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,644
You done good, kids!

432
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,380
Line up for some
affectionate noogying.

433
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,658
I'm not so sure about that.
Is there any other alternative?

434
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,485
Ha ha! Noogy, noogy, noogy!

435
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,454
( Siren wails )

436
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,055
Solve the case yet, boy?

437
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,291
I'm so confident
you're gonna say no

438
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:01,761
that I'm gonna take
a long, slow sip from
my cup of coffee.

439
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,798
Actually,
the answer is yes.

440
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,035
Aaaaah!

441
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,069
Ow!

442
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,671
Aah!

443
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,374
It burmy eyes! Urns!

444
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,843
( All laughing )

445
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,312
( Crash )scalded!

446
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,714
So, did you get rid
of all the wax figures?

447
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,317
I am 99% sure that I did.

448
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,785
Good enough for me.

449
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,458
Ha ha ha ha!

450
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,326
Huh?

451
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,329
So, you're a rat.
Tell me about that.

452
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,097
Hey! get back here!

453
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,499
I'm hopping!

454
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,869
I'm hopping after a rat
that stole my ear!

455
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,672
Hmm. hey, Dipper,

456
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,873
what do you think is better,

457
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,742
sequins or llama hair?

458
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,110
The llama hair.

459
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,347
Llamas are nature's
greatest warriors.

460
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,750
Thanks, Dipper!
