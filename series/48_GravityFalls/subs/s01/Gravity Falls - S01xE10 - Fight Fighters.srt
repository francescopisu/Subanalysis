1
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,408
This is it, dudes--
my favorite place
in gravity falls.

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,810
Everything I know,
i learned right here.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,146
A frog taught me how
to cross the street.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,283
When my house was haunted,
i learned how to eat ghosts.

5
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,285
And this thing
taught me how to dance.

6
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:21,055
Whoo-hoo-hoo! ha ha!
I've been jiggin'
for seven days straight!

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:22,423
Uh, Soos?

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,458
( Laughing )

9
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:25,593
Let him have this.

10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,261
What?

11
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:29,097
( Beeping )

00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:33,367

( Groans )

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,539
Oh! oh, watch out!

16
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:41,409
Whoa! ooh, cut scene!

17
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,583
( Both grunting )

18
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:52,286
Yeah! yeah! Yeah!
Go! Yes! Yes!Ghs )

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,322
( Both grunting )

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,526
The winner...

21
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,495
What? you cheated.

22
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,398
You take that back! ( Laughs )

23
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,399
Round two!

24
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm gonna punch the ref.

25
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,103
Dipper: let's gang up on him.

26
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,605
( Both grunting )

27
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:15,109
( Both laughing )

28
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,178
Wendy, what's up, babe?

29
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,280
Yeah, just puttin' up
some flyers for my band.

30
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,149
I'm lead guitar.
No biggie.

31
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,217
Are you wearing mascara?

32
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,554
Uh, it's eye paint for men.

33
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,290
Hi, Robbie. Dipper was just
showing me this great game.

34
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,391
Uh, yeah, sweet, sweet.

35
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,893
Hey, how's about you
sit this one out, okay, champ?

36
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,694
( Cracks knuckles )

37
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,863
But we just
started this round.

38
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,199
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, relax, man.

39
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,569
I'm just tryin'
to spend a little time
with my girlfriend, all right?

40
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,304
It'll just be one round.

41
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,306
**

42
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,309
so, hey, I'm going camping
tomorrow with my dad,
so I won't be around.

43
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,211
Oh, cool, cool. ( Grunts )

44
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:54,515
( Both laughing )

45
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:59,187
Opponent sighted! Fight!

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,722
**

47
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,965
king me!

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,166
A( laughs )!

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,736
It's not fair! She doesn't
even know what we're playing!

50
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,204
Go fish?

51
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,339
**

52
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,940
( rumbling )

53
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,710
Dude, I think I'm pickin' up
a radio station inside my head.

54
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,547
Try blinking to see
if you can change the channel.

55
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,415
( Grunting )

56
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,983
Robbie: * Wendy!

57
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,618
Ugh, sounds like Robbie.

58
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,989
Robbie? is he that jerky twerp
i see making goo-goo eyes
at Wendy all the time?

59
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,760
He called me "big dude" once.
I mean, I know I'm a big dude,
but it kinda hurt.

60
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,762
Should I sic
waddles on him again?

61
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,631
Whoa! easy, tiger.

62
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll handle it.

63
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,269
All: ooh!

64
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,770
( Chuckles ) conflict!

65
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,773
* Wendy! Wendy, Wendy!

66
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,377
Wendy! come on out, girl!
Come on down!

67
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,778
You realize
she's not here, right?

68
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,580
( Scoffs ) yes.

69
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:33,981
What?

70
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,317
She's out camping
with her family today.

71
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,719
Maybe if you listened to her
for once, you'd know that.

72
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,787
What was that?

73
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,455
I just said she's not here.

74
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,724
No, no, no.
You wanna get into it, huh?

75
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,025
Let's get into it, kid.

76
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,727
You think I don't know
what's been goin' on, huh?

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,796
It's obvious you've got
a thing for my girlfriend.

78
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,398
Don't you? Don't you?

79
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,466
What?! no! Come on, man.

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,736
Yeah, I'm sure she's just dyin'
to ask out a 12-year-old kid

81
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,771
who wears the exact same
shorts every day.

82
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,408
Hey, here's an idea,
why don't I call her right now

83
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,310
and see if she wants
to go out on a date with you.

84
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,745
Hey! look! Don't!
Y-you don't have to--

85
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,349
"oh! don't! Please, man!"
What are you gonna do? Huh? Huh?

86
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,450
( Ringing )

87
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,818
Wendy: hello?

88
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,822
My phone!

89
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,290
I'll buy you
a new one!

90
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,826
Oh, no! You're not
gettin' off that easy!

91
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,830
Hey! I know a fight
when I see one!
Stay right there!

92
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,332
( Groans )

93
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,835
You, me, circle park, 3:00--

94
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,438
we finish this.

95
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:34,842
Aw, he's gone. I was just
gonna call the boys over
to place a few bets.

96
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,446
The smart money's
on skinny jeans.

97
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,481
( Sighs ) what was I thinking?!
I can't fight!

98
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,483
I've never been in
a fight before!

99
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,318
Look at these noodle arms!

100
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,321
Just bonk him over the head!
It's nature's snooze button!

101
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,691
Boys, why can't you learn
to hate each other in secret?

102
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,059
Like girls do.

103
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,494
Sure, listen to your sister.

104
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,497
( Chuckles )
maybe you can share dresses too!

105
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,332
( Laughs ) boom!

106
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,600
Maybe he'll just
forget about it.

107
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,569
Maybe it'll all blow over.

108
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,571
I don't know, Dipper.
Teenagers are dangerous.

109
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,374
Those hormones turn 'em in
to, like, killing machines.

110
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,875
Oh, yeah, dude.

111
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,077
My cousin Reggie
got in a fight with a teen once.

112
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,780
The guy broke, like,
all his arms, all his legs,

113
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,615
and I think killed him
or something. I didn't know.

114
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,350
Me and Reggie
were just talkin' about it.

115
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,352
( Panting )

116
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,454
I can't stay here!
What if Robbie comes back?!

117
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,722
I gotta hide!

118
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,724
Look, kid,
you got yourself a choice here.

119
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,726
You could either
go face him like a man,

120
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,728
or you could
hide indoors like a wimp.

121
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,329
What'll it be?

122
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,502
Wimp it is.

123
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,770
Come on, Soos,
Robbie's like twice my size!

124
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:39,573
I mean, what would getting
myself killed accomplish?

125
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,910
I just need to hide here
until 3:00 passes.

126
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,778
( Sighs )
this day will never end!

127
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,815
Relax, Dipper. Just try
not to think about Robbie.

128
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,849
( Gasps )

129
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,185
( Applause )

130
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,789
Girl, who you ackin'
so cray-cray?

131
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,925
( Cheers and applause )

132
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,127
...will be back
in a moment.

133
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,129
( Sighs ) poor Dipper...

134
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:05,499
Hiding from Robbie,
unable to face his fears.

135
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,500
( Grunts )

136
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:07,768
Fears are for chumps!

137
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,803
That's why I don't have any!

138
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:10,838
( Grunting )

139
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,939
You want me
to go get a ladder?

140
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,941
What?n't have one.

141
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,544
You know, studies show
that keepin' a ladder
inside the house

142
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,412
is more dangerous
than a loaded gun.

143
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,947
That's why I own ten guns,

144
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,417
in case some maniac
tries to sneak in a ladder.

145
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,920
Grunkle Stan,
why you ackin' so cray-cray?

146
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,789
You're the one
who's ackin' cray-cray!

147
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,190
I gotta go now.

148
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,827
Why would grunkle Stan
be so weirded out by ladders?

149
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,965
Of course! I think he has
a secret fear of heights!

150
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:38,732
( Grunts )

151
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,834
We'll have to test him
to be sure.

152
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,170
Or we could leave
well enough alone.

153
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,938
Nah!

154
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,708
**

155
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:54,715
man, I wonder what
it would be like to go inside
a video game for real.

156
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,986
I should've thought of this
years ago!

157
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,589
( Grunting )

158
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,558
Stupid Robbie, such a jerk!

159
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07,561
( Beeping )

160
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,866
( Both grunting )

161
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,609
( Sighs ) that's easy
for you to say.

162
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,844
You have more than one life.

163
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,579
( Sighs )

164
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,749
I wish one of these guys
could fight Robbie for me.

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,054
Huh?

166
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,627
"To unleash ultimate power"?

167
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,662
I do like things
that are ultimate.

168
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,766
Back, back, hold,
forward, back, forward, down,

169
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,802
hold, quarter-circle,
forward, triple-punch!

170
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,640
I guess it didn't work.

171
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,707
( Rumbling )

172
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:54,842
Uh...

173
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,977
Soos?

174
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,012
Select your character!

175
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,014
Uh...

176
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,783
Rumble mcskirmish?

177
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,555
( Grunts )

178
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,862
You're real?

179
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,565
Both: high-five!

180
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,100
Ow! your pixels
are really sharp! Aah!

181
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,005
Greetings, child boy!

182
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,641
I am rumble mcskirmish
from the usa!

183
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,643
( Grunting )

184
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:31,812
Ow! cool!

185
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,082
Change machine!
Change me into a powerful wolf!

186
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,585
( Grunts )

187
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,588
With rumble around,
Robbie will be so scared
i won't even need to fight him.

188
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,990
I've got the world's
greatest fighter
to be my bodyguard!

189
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,291
( Beeping )

190
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,693
I need power-ups!

191
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,696
This is so amazing!
I gotta show Soos!

192
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,863
Soos?

193
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,099
( Gasps )

194
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,834
Help, I'm trapped in the game!

195
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,837
It was cool in theory,
but in practice
it was really boring.

196
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,105
( Screams )

197
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,774
It's not just a game anymore.

198
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,043
All right, waddles,
it's time to begin

199
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:06,046
operation get Stan
over his fear of heights!

200
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,114
( Grunts )

201
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,882
I came up with that name.

202
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,018
Happy great uncle's day!

203
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,020
Huh?
there's a great uncle's day?

204
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,123
( Chuckles ) of course
it's not a day I made up!

205
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,592
High heels?
You shouldn't have!

206
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:21,595
Seriously. w-what?
What is this?

207
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,832
What's wrong? Are you saying
these heels are too high?

208
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:28,602
Do they make you
uncomfortable? Hmm?

209
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,971
Admit it! Admit you have
a fear of heights!

210
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,973
What?! that's why
you bought me these?!

211
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,975
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

212
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,611
And on great uncle's day
no less!

213
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:41,381
But, no, I don't have
a fear of heights.

214
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,852
We now return to world's
most terrifying skydiving!

215
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,587
( Screams ) turn it off!

216
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,024
So I have a fear of heights.

217
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,694
Is that really so cray-cray?

218
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,695
( Buzzing )

219
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,730
( Grunting )

220
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,732
Well, we don't have
any traditional power-ups--

221
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,968
Turkey legs, pizza boxes,
or gold rings.

222
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,403
How about half a taco?

223
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,872
Place it on the floor!

224
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,676
( Beeping )

225
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,680
I wish I could do that!

226
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,181
Now I must defeat the world's
greatest fight fighters!

227
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,416
Take me to the Soviet union!

228
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,719
That's gonna be tough...
For a number of reasons.

229
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,421
But I do know a fighter
here in gravity falls.

230
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,657
Maximum power?

231
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,827
His name is Robbie v,
and he's kinda like
my arch-enemy.

232
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,162
Did he kill your father?

233
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,164
Well, he's dating
the girl I like...

234
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,101
And he posts a really annoying
amount of status updates.

235
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,070
And then he killed your father!

236
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,405
Uh, sure.

237
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,808
Anyway, I was hoping
you could, you know,
scare him off for me

238
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,209
so I don't have
to fight the guy.

239
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,145
( Laughs ) your question
makes my shoulders bounce!

240
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:49,950
Fireball! uppercut!
Downercut! Love punch!

241
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,451
So you'll
protect me from Robbie?

242
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,921
Challenge a( Beeps )press start!

243
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,157
( Beeps )

244
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,192
Uh-oh, I think
i hear my uncle.

245
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,228
Stay perfectly still.

246
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,464
I said stay still.

247
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,234
This is as still as I can stay!

248
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:11,238
How am I gonna get grunkle Stan
over his fear of heights?

249
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,241
Hey, Mabel,
have you met rumble yet?
He's my new bodyguard.

250
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,243
The child gave me a taco!

251
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,246
Wow! he's got a crazy voice!

252
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,014
Here, say these words.

253
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:24,752
Effervescent!
apple fritter!

254
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,754
Riboflavin!

255
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,456
Mabel, he's not a toy.
He's a fighting machine.

256
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,124
I'm gonna get him
to defend me from Robbie.

257
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:33,093
Isn't that kinda like cheating?

258
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,828
I guess so.

259
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,096
Well, I'll see you
after the fight.

260
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,865
Poop! poop and butts!

261
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,168
Tell me my opponent's
special move.

262
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,504
Don't worry,
as soon as he sees you,
he's gonna wet his pants.

263
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,007
His wet pants
will be no match for this!

264
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,142
Whoa!
where'd that come from?

265
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,878
I punched an oil drum!

266
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,145
Trust me,
you won't need that.

267
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,513
Just give him a good scare.

268
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,782
Yes!

269
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,751
With this!

270
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:00,120
This street
has really dangerous litter.

271
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,423
Hey, grunkle Stan!

272
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,861
How would you like to go take
a walk nowhere in particular

273
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,830
while wearing a blindfold?

274
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,900
Eh, beats just sittin' around
bein' old.

275
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:17,237
Wait a minute. You're not
plannin' on takin' me somewhere
super high up, are you?

276
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,074
Grunkle Stan, I would never!

277
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,910
Scout's honor!

278
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,544
All right, let's go.

279
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,780
( Laughs )

280
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:34,988
( Clock chiming )

281
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,825
Well, well, well,
look who decided to show up.

282
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,259
I thought
you'd chicken out.

283
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,528
You ready
to settle this like men?

284
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,230
Look, dude, I don't think
you wanna fight me.

285
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,233
Let's just call this thing off
before someone gets hurt.

286
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,936
You scared, huh?
Is that it?

287
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,238
Okay, dude, you asked for it.
( Snaps fingers )

288
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,041
Who's your friend?

289
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,943
And why is he blurry?

290
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,979
This happens to be
the greatest warrior
that ever lived.

291
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,849
Yeah, right. Hey, eye patch,
what did the kid promise you,

292
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,951
more tape for your forearms?

293
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,018
( Laughs )

294
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,955
How can you laugh when you
killed this boy's father?!

295
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,223
I'm giving you one last chance.

296
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,860
Back down,
or this guy's gonna go nuts.

297
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,928
How 'bout you back down, kid?

298
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,998
You asked for it. Rumble, go!

299
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,132
( Laughs )

300
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,268
What the...?! ( Grunts )

301
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,270
W-what is happening?!

302
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,006
I didn't wanna have to do this,
man, but you gave me no choice.

303
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,841
Maybe now
you won't mess with--

304
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,876
( groans )

305
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,143
Whoa! rumble, you can stop!

306
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,845
I think Robbie's had enough!

307
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,881
( Retches )

308
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:34,882
Rumble throw!

309
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,884
Stop! I said stop!

310
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,051
( Groans )

311
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,320
What the...?!
That guy's crazy!

312
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,089
( Grunts ) fireball!

313
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,592
What the heck was that?!

314
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,595
You were only
supposed to scare him!
You almost killed him!

315
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:53,200
I will not rest until the man
who dishonored you is destroyed!

316
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,969
( Grunting )

317
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,404
Punch!

318
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,039
This isn't good.

319
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,014
Something told me
this would be his first stop.

320
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,249
( Panting )

321
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,350
( Roars )

322
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,619
( Screams ) chill out, man!

323
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,422
( Screams ) please,
rumble, you gotta stop!

324
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,058
( Grunting )

325
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,160
( Beeping )

326
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,161
( Grunts )

327
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,162
( Grunts )

328
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,396
Rumble, wait!

329
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,898
( Grunts )

330
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,434
( Grunts )
punch, punch, punch!

331
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,171
( Beeping )

332
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,441
You don't have to do this!
At least pace yourself!

333
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,910
( Panting )
you might get a cramp!

334
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,178
( Groans )

335
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,180
I love you, dad.

336
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,082
( Screams )

337
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,052
( Grunting )

338
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,353
( Beeps )

339
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,925
We'll just buy another one.

340
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,460
I love being rich.

341
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,063
( Panting )

342
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,066
All you can eat!

343
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,435
( Panting )

344
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,436
Hey, dude.

345
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,205
Soos! where have you been?!

346
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,473
Uh, long story, man.

347
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,141
Dude, did you see
that video game guy

348
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,476
destroying
everything in sight?

349
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,178
( Laughs ) it was crazy.

350
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,215
Yeah, i-i kinda sorta
brought him to life
to be my bodyguard.

351
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,051
But now I have to stop him
before he kills Robbie!

352
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,720
You need an amiable sidekick
with a pickup truck?

( Tires screech )

355
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:30,130
Take off your blindfold now!

356
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,236
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I was expecting.

357
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,238
You're doing better
than I thought!

358
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,240
Now let go of the handrail.

359
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,708
No!

360
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:45,245
Hey, do you smell
anger and hormones?

Hey, Robbie,

Shh! keep it down!
He'll find us!

Please, listen to me!

Rumble, I have
something to tell you.

384
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:40,200
Robbie...
Robbie didn't kill my father.

385
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,534
( Gasps ) then who did?

386
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,571
What? no one did.
I-i lied to you.

( Gasps ) then you're
actually a... bad guy!

My entire journey, a lie.
My honor has been insulted.

391

Sensei warned me
not to join the path of evil.

392
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,193
The boy has led me astray
from my teachings.

393

If Robbie v
is not the last stage,

394
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,797
then it must be...

395
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,166

don't fight him, man.

That guy's got like a black belt
wrapped around his black belt.

You could get killed.

400

I have to,
i started all this,

401
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,344
and I've got to
at least try to stop it.

402
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,479
You sure you wouldn't
rather hide like a wimp?
