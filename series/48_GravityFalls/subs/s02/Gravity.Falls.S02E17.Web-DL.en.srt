Ahh!

4
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,883
Morning, Dipper.
Guess who.

5
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:15,987
Oh, what joy.
If it isn't Mr. Upsidedownington.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,889
How long has it been?
Third grade maybe?

7
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:20,692
That's right, and I'm
here to deliver you

8
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:23,828
an Upsidedownington-tastic message!

9
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:26,247
Is it the message that
we're getting too old

10
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,633
- for this sort of thing?
- Um, kinda, actually.

11
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:33,004
It's that we're exactly one
week away from our 13th birthday!

12
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:38,743
Whoa! Our birthday's
coming up already? [gasps]

13
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,912
Soon we're gonna be actual teenagers!

14
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:43,848
Finally I can stop
reading pre-teen magazines,

15
00:00:43,882 --> 00:00:46,751
and start reading
post-pre-teen magazines.

16
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,020
PG-13 movies, here I come.

17
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:51,856
And just one more
year until high school.

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,727
High school, Dipper!
Where girls become women,

19
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:56,994
and they teach us stuff about...

20
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:01,666
- you know what.
- Trigonometry?

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,769
- Oh, yeah, baby.
- That's not the only good news coming up.

22
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:08,833
In one week, my senior citizen
ponytail kit is coming in the mail.

24
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,611
I'm... I'm kinda going
through some things.

25

In one week, my grandma
is finally letting me

26
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,817
eat crackers on my bed.
The future is coming for us all, dudes.

27
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:21,753
- The future.
- The future.

28
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:23,755
The future!

00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,690
[chuckles]
I'm sorry, I can't take you seriously

30
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:28,960
- with that face on your chin.
- [goofy voice] What face, Dipper?

31
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:32,764
You're doing the voice, so you
obviously know what I'm talking about.

32
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:34,799
[goofy voice] I don't know
what you're talking about.

<b>2x17 - Dipper and Mabel vs The Future</b>

37
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,942
Alright, party planners!
In one week, we become teenagers,

38
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:04,779
and summer vacation winds to an end,

39
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:06,714
so we need to throw the
greatest party of all time!

40
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:10,651
I'm talkin' piñatas with
tinier piñatas inside.

41
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:12,653
Boom, dreams comin' true.

42
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:16,690
I'm talkin' inviting
everyone in town! Let's see.

43
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:18,993
Where do we stand with the gnomes?

44
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:20,995
<i>Not so fast, goofus and girl goofus.</i>

45
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,897
After that zombie incident,

46
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:25,032
no one's throwing
another party at my house.

47
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,868
I keep finding little bits of
the undead in the couch cushions.

48
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:31,705
But Grunkle Stan, we
need some roof to raise.

49
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:33,774
Dude, you can rent out the
Gravity Falls high school gym,

50
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:37,812
and have your party there.
That place is empty all summer long.

51
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:40,915
The gym's a great idea, Soos.
To the high school!

52
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,950

<i>FORD: Dipper, my face is on fire!</i>

54
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:47,054
I'll just be a sec.

55
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:50,915
- Hey, Uncle Ford, are you okay?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine.

56
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,850
I just said that to make
sure you'd come in here quickly.

57
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:56,787
- But your face is on fire.
- Yes. It's much faster than shaving.

58
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,789
Now listen, Dipper.

59
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:00,691
I have a very important
mission, and you are

60
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,726
the only one who can help me.

61
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,929
Remember the rift in dimensional
space-time I showed you?

62
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:08,933
It's cracking.
This is what Bill has been waiting for.

63
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,802
If it breaks, it'll cause
reality as we know it

64
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,737
to become completely unraveled.

65
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:17,641
A hypothetical and catastrophic event
I call Weirdmageddon.

66
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:22,947
Bill is out there,
and he'd use any trick

67
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:26,817
from deception to outright possession
to make this happen.

68
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:29,068
But for the sake of
humanity, we mustn't let him.

69
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,084
- What do we do?
- We patch the rift.

70
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,691
I'll explain on the way.

71
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,759
- Wait. What about Mabel?
- It's okay, Dipper.

72
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:39,719
You should totally go with Grunkle Ford
to save the world or whatever.

73
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,733
- Are you sure?
- We're gonna be doing birthday junk all week.

74
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,869
Plus, I packed those walkie-talkies.

75
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:47,905
Here's one for my party mission,
and one for your smarty mission.

76
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,840
[laughing]

77
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,876
Ahem. I did mention that
the fate of the universe

78
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,979
is at stake, didn't I?
Hurry! We haven't much time!

79
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,982
Okay, Dipper, it's your
first big mission with Ford,

80
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,817
a chance to prove yourself.

81
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:01,852
Don't mess this up.

82
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,955
Ow! Ah. [chuckles]
I'm all right.

83
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,031
<i>Aah!
[crashing]</i>

84
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:12,529
_

85
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:16,867
Whoa, Soos, I thought you
said this place was empty.

86
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:20,971
- My dogs, what up?
- Wendy, what are you doing here?

87
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:22,940
Ugh. High school registration.

88
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:26,877
Oh! You know, I'm only a year
away from high school myself.

89
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:30,881
Would you say your experience
is more rom-com or wacky romp?

90
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:34,718
More like teen horror movie.
High school is the worst.

91
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:38,222
Classes get super hard,
your body just flat-out turns

92
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,692
against you, and worst of
all, everybody hates you.

93
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,896
Can't do it. Can't do another year!

94
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:48,866
My hormones are like a sweaty cage.

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,969
Why aren't they singing
about following their dreams?

96
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:55,873
TV taught me that high school
is like some sort of musical.

97
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,677
TV lied, man.
If you can avoid growing up, do it.

98
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,045
I'd give anything to be 12 again.

99
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,013
Anyway, what are you guys doing here?

100
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,815
[nervous chuckle]
Just looking for a place

101
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:07,685
to have my 13th birthday party.

102
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,854
Wendy Borduroy?
I-I mean Corduroy.

103
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,990
<i>[laughter]
Corduroy.</i>

104
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:15,826
See what I mean?

105
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,884
Master Mabel to Dippity
Dog. We can have our party

106
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,837
at the gym, but we gotta
talk about high school.

107
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:28,872
I'm starting to think it's might not be

108
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:31,709
the awesome future we
were expecting. Over.

109
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:33,644
<i>[static]

We'll talk when I get back...

111
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,648
Dipper? Come in, come in?

112
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,918
Hey, I know what will
make you feel better.

113
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:41,934
Let's deliver some invites
to your friends, huh?

114
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:43,977
Yeah!

115
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,265

Mabel? Mabel, you there?

00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:53,866
[frustrated groan]

119
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,735
Listen, Dipper, in order
to seal the rift for good,

120
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:00,039
it's going to take an adhesive
stronger than anything on Earth.

121
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:03,909
- Something... extraterrestrial in origin.
- W-What do you mean?

122
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:07,747
Tipper, look at the peculiar shape
made by those cliffs.

123
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,915
Does it remind you of anything?

124
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:18,776
Hmm...

125
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:21,261
Shut... up!

126
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,399
According to my research,
the entire valley

127
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:27,435
of Gravity Valley was formed
when an extraterrestrial object

128
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,505
crash landed here millions of years ago.

129
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:33,475
<i>FORD: Did this craft cause
the town's strange properties?</i>

130
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:37,412
<i>Or, did the town's strange
properties attract the craft?</i>

131
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,082
- The answer is still unknown.
- But that's crazy!

132
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,350
Where did the saucer go?

133
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,519
Sometimes, the strangest
things in the world

134
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,588
are right under our noses.

135
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,124
<i>And our feet, in this
particular instance.</i>

136
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,560
Now, you might want to stand back.

137
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:54,380
This magnet gun could rip the fillings
out of a man's mouth

138
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,465
- from a hundred feet.
- Aah.

139
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,335
I used to raid this
thing for parts for years.

140
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,537
<i>FORD: Where do you think I got
the materials to build my portal?</i>

141
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:06,441
You... I... words, not
working from mouth.

142
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:09,644
- Now, come. And take this.
- Whoa, Whoa!

143
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:12,180
Don't worry, I've been
down here countless times.

144
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,450
All the aliens have been
dead for millions of years.

145
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,419
Probably.

146
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,149
I can't believe there's been a giant UFO

147
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,084
under the town this whole time.

148
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,454
I wish my mind could be where
yours is right now, Tipper.

149
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:39,391
When confirmation of extraterrestrials
still had that punch.

150
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,360
<i>Now it's just sort of, meh.</i>

151
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,566
McGucket and I used to
come down here all the time

152
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,535
to raid their tech ad
study their language.

153
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,138
This is so cool!

154
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,440
[laughs]

155
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,444
The substance we need to seal
the rift is an alien adhesive,

156
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,446
<i>strong enough to keep the
hull of a spacecraft together.</i>

157
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,315
Just one dollop of this adhesive

158
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,317
should be enough to seal
a crack in space-time.

159
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,385
Also, if it touches you, it will seal up

160
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,522
all the orifices in your face,
so try so avoid that.

161
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,391
Now, use your magnet gun
and follow me!

162
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,911
<i>- Hup.
- Great Uncle Ford!</i>

163
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,644
Your turn!

164
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:24,202
<i>Say "hup". It helps!</i>

165
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:28,173
[deep breath] Okay, just put on
magnet, leap down hole.

166
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,574
Turn on. Come on already!

167
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,510
[powering up]

168
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,211
Magnet!

169
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,579
Hunh!

170
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,284
Aah!

171
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,649
<i>A little help?</i>

172
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,457
Oh, hi, Mabel.

173
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,493
You're just in time for
our one o'clock boy talk.

174
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,429
If you think that's good, boom!

175
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,598
<i>Me and Dipper's 13th birthday jam!</i>

176
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,102
Oh, man, your birthday's
on the last day of Summer.

177
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,471
- I'm not gonna be here.
- What?

178
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,573
Marius is flying me out to Austria

179
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,642
to hang out his castle
or whatever that week.

180
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,544
He's co clingy!

181
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,480
You're gonna be out of
town for my birthday?

182
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:10,615
But at least you can come, right, Candy?

183
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,518
Sorry, Mabel, my parents
send me to music camp

184
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,489
this time of year.
There is no escape from music camp.

185
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,625
So neither of you are gonna
be at my birthday party?

186
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,627
And you won't be able
to wish me good-bye

187
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,195
at the end of the Summer?

188
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:28,466
<i>- CANDY: I'm sorry, Mabel.
- Summer happens so fast.</i>

189
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,568
[cell phone ringing]

190
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,138
Ugh, Marius, now's not the time!

191
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,441
I think I need to radio
for emotional backup.

192
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,609
Dipper, please come in.

193
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,678
Our party mission is
going down in flames.

194
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,646
Over. [static]

195
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,448
Oh...

196
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,555
This is their storage facility.

197
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,424
This place would have
been heavily guarded,

198
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,593
but now everything's defunct.

199
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,528
Go ahead, flip any switch.

200
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,697
They've all been busted
for millions of years.

201
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,639
Clara, did you eat my farm?

202
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,507
[mooing]

203
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,710
<i>FORD: The glue should
be around here somewhere,</i>

204
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,145
<i>so keep your eyes peeled.</i>

205
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,247
Dipper, let me ask you something.

206
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,584
- Have you thought much about your future?
- No, not really.

207
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,720
I mean, beyond graduating
high school with a high GPA

208
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,588
so I can get accepted to
a good technical college

209
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,223
with a photography and
media production minor

210
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,493
to start my own ghost hunting show.
[chuckles]

211
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,729
It's like talking to a
younger version of myself.

212
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,631
If you're so sure of
what you want out of life,

213
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,533
why wait? Why put up with
the drudgery of school?

214
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,637
Huh, trust me, I'd love to fast
forward the whole thing, but

215
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,672
it's not like I have a choice.

216
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,240
Dipper, I've been thinking.

217
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,343
I'm getting too old to investigate
Gravity Falls on my own.

218
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,213
I need to train an apprentice
to help me fight monsters,

219
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,515
solve mysteries, and protect this town.

220
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,251
And I think I'd like
to keep it in the family.

221
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:56,488
- What are you saying?
- I've read your additions to my journal,

222
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,390
and I'm impressed with your potential.

223
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,325
What would you say to
staying in Gravity Falls

224
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,661
after the Summer ends and
becoming my apprentice?

225
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:07,501
- W-What about school?
- Dipper, I have 12 PhDs. Your parents

226
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,801
would be thrilled I could give
you such an advanced education.

227
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,805
[sighs] There's also Mabel.
She'd be all alone in California.

228
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:17,876
Mabel will be fine on her own.
She has a magnetic personality.

229
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,345
I watched her become pen pals
with the pizza delivery man

230
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,713
in the 60 seconds he was at the door.

231
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,816
Gosh, we've never
really been apart before.

232
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,386
And isn't it suffocating?
Dipper, can you honestly tell me

233
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,790
you never felt like you were
meant for something more?

234
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,458
I hav... I don't know.

235
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,360
Sounds like a dream come true,

236
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,329
but I'm not sure I have what it takes.

237
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,700
I was tricked by Bill,
I was wrong about Stan's portal.

238
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,470
Heck, I can't even operate
this magnet gun right.

239
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,871
[straining]

240
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,325
Ha! Yes!
Dipper, you found the adhesive!

241
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,278
- I did?
- Oh-ho, you really did it, kid.

242
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,713
Huddle in, let's get a picture of this.

243
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,481
[alien noise]

244
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:00,819
Uh, Uncle Ford, you said
everything down here is dead, right?

245
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,255
Yes, unless somehow
we reactivated the...

246
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,509
[gasps] security system.

247
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,763
- What do we do?
- Listen to me very carefully.

248
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,798
I've studied these.
They're security droids,

249
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,266
and they detect adrenaline.

250
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,269
<i>You simply have to not feel any fear,</i>

251
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,871
<i>- and they won't see you.
- What?</i>

252
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,639
It's okay.
I've done it before.

253
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,775
Just take a deep breath,
focus on your intellect,

254
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,344
and control your fear.

255
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,947
Wh-Wh-What?
That's crazy! I...

256
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:29,981
Follow my lead!

257
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,584
- Great Uncle Ford...
- Focus, Dipper!

258
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,786
[heartbeat]

259
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,322
I, uh...
I-I-

260
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,358
- I can't.
- Get down!

261
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,570
- Aah! No! Nooooo...
- Wait! No!

262
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,039
Stay back! It's too dangerous.

263
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,908
Sealing the rift is
what's important now.

264
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,447
Take this! You're gonna
have to do it without me.

265
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,649
<i>Use the adhesive.
Fix the rift!</i>

266
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,818
<i>Save the universe, Dipper.</i>

267
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,686
Great Uncle Ford!

268
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,911
Hang on, I'm coming for you!

269
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:17,916
Don't worry, I'll get you out of there!

270
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:21,619
Where's that thing taking you?

271
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,390
<i>FORD: It's an automated prison droid.</i>

272
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:28,726
<i>And wherever it's going,
I'm not coming back.</i>

273
00:13:28,728 --> 00:13:31,184
What?
[gasps]

274
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:34,799
No, no, no.

275
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:37,936
Don't worry, I'll think of something!

276
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:42,907
Dipper, what on earth are you doing?

277
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,709
[powering up]

278
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,077
Hold on, Great Uncle Ford.

279
00:13:48,614 --> 00:13:51,616
I'm getting you out of
this one way or another.

280
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:53,518
[click, powering down]
Oh, no...

281

[beeping, buzzer blares]

283
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,690
Come on, come on!

284
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:09,067
<i>Aah...</i>

285
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,712
Let go of my uncle!

286
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:21,779
Ohh. Aah!

287
00:14:25,985 --> 00:14:28,720
<i>Aah...</i>

288
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:37,495
- Oh, no.
- Aah!

289
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,869
[crying out]

290
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:46,404
Great Uncle Ford!

291
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:49,674
Okay, let's try magna-pulse.

292
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:07,929
[groaning]
Huh?

293
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,563
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no!

294
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,035
Come on, wake up, man.

295
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:19,203
We gotta get out of here before...

296
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:27,145
<i>Hey, I'm warning you!
I have a magnet gun!</i>

297
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,482
Oh, yeah?
You think you can scare me?

298
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:33,051
Do your worst!

299
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:36,054
Nothing in this universe
is gonna take away my uncle.

300
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:38,723
<i>So go ahead, give me what you got.</i>

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,735

302
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:52,838
[Ford laughing, coughing]

303
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,041
I thought I was a goner, kid.

304
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,477
Are you all right? What happened?

305
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:02,613
The orb didn't detect any
chemical signs of fear.

306
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:06,184
It assumed the threat was neutralized
and then self-disassembled.

307
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:08,486
[chuckles]
I... I did it?

308
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,655
You did it.

309
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:14,892
This is what I was talking about.

310
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:18,196
How many other
12-year-olds do you think

311
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:20,790
are capable of doing
what you've just done?

312
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:28,272
[sighs]

313
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:31,542
Hey, everything all right, pumpkin?

314
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,112
I just can't believe
the Summer's almost over.

315
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:37,749
And now that I know how
awful high school's gonna be,

316
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,818
I'm in no hurry to
start that train wreck.

317
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,787
Ah. Nobody likes getting older.

318
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:44,122
But just because you're growing up

319
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:45,857
doesn't mean you have
to grow up, you know?

320
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:47,759
I mean, look at me.
I'm pushing 70,

321
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:49,627
and I still eat ice cream for dinner.

322
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,663
But I don't wanna say
good-bye to Gravity Falls.

323
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:55,133
Hey, at least whatever
happens after this Summer,

324
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:56,868
you'll still have your
brother along with you

325
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,002
through thick and thin.

326
00:16:58,004 --> 00:17:00,571
Not everyone can say that, you know.

327
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:09,080
Yeah. At least when I go home
I always have Dipper.

328
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,915
Good old reliable old...

329
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,083
<i>[radio static]
DIPPER: Are you okay?</i>

330
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:15,119
<i>Let's get you out of there.</i>

331
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,889
Listen to me, Dipper,
this town is a magnet

332
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:21,092
for things that are special.
And that includes you and me.

333
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:24,095
It brought both of
us here for a purpose.

334
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:26,864
Stay here with me, Dipper.
Become my apprentice.

335
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,199
Don't let anyone hold you...

336
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:30,835
[coughing]

337
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:35,706
- I'll do it. I'm gonna stay.
- Excellent.

338
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,810
Now, who wants to save
the world, apprentice?

339
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,778
[both laughing]

340
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,747
[radio static]

341
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,252
Mabel, I just had the
best day of my life.

342
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:50,688
UFOs are real, and
there's one under the town,

343
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,890
and I saved Great
Uncle Ford's life and...

344
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:54,725
Hey, are you okay?

345
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:56,727
<i>Tell me it's not true, Dipper.</i>

346
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:57,895
Tell me you were joking.

347
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:00,765
[radio static, gasps]

348
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>MABEL: Ford's apprentice?
Seriously?</i>

349
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:07,805
Look, I was thinking, and this is
a huge opportunity for me.

350
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,975
Well, it's a horrible
opportunity for me!

351
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:13,277
I had the worst day of my life.

352
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,780
When we turn 13, the Summer ends,

353
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,682
and I have to leave everything behind.

354
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:19,784
You're the only person I could count on,

355
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:21,719
and now you're leaving me, too?

356
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,221
Look, I've been thinking about it.

357
00:18:23,223 --> 00:18:26,124
I won't be gone forever, okay?
I'll still visit you at home

358
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,726
and we'll chat online...
we'll make it work.

359
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,261
I don't want it to work.

360
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:33,097
I just wish Summer could last forever.

361
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,032
But it can't, Mabel.

362
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:38,102
Look, things aren't gonna
stay frozen this way.

363
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:41,172
It's part of growing up.
Things change.

364
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:43,808
Summer ends.

365
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,942
- Ugh!
- Unh!

366
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:48,212
Mabel, wait!
I didn't mean it like that!

367
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:49,981
Mabel, come back!

368
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,450
[music]

369
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:03,027
Only party chocolate
can cheer me up now.

370
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:05,897
Nerd bucks?
Chewed up pens?

371
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,967
Ugh, wrong backpack.
It's not fair.

372
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,637
I just wish Summer could last forever.

373
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:15,306
<i>MAN: That might be possible.</i>

374
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:18,776
Sweater Town is not accepting
incoming calls right now.

375
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,178
<i>M-M-Mabel, it's me.</i>

376
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,947
What? Who said that?

377
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:27,318
- I-I can help.
- The time travel guy?

378
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,886
What are you doing here?

379
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:31,022
You said you don't want
Summer to end, right?

380
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:34,058
- Did I hear that right?
- Yeah.

381
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,293
Why are you asking?

382
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,629
Look, maybe it's against
the rules, but you once did

383
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,964
a favor for me, so I
thought I could help you out.

384
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:43,234
It's called a time bubble,
and it prevents time from going forward.

385
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:46,270
Summer in Gravity Falls can
last as long as you want it to.

386
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:50,141
Really?
But how does it work.

387
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,010
I just need you to get a little
gizmo for me from your uncle.

388
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,279
Something small... he won't
even know it's missing.

389
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:59,050
Huh, maybe Dipper has something
like that in his nerd bag.

390
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,154
Let me guess.
Mabel didn't take it well?

391
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:06,857
I... I don't know.
Maybe I'm making the wrong decision.

392
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:09,874
- I need to think about this.
- Dipper, right now we need t

393
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:13,064
o focus on the mission.
Now, come on. I've got the glue.

394
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,266
Hand me the rift and let's make history.

395
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:18,869
What?

396
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:21,072
Oh, no, the rift!

397
00:20:21,074 --> 00:20:24,308
Huh. That's odd.

398
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,410
- Is this it?
- Yes, that's it!

399
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,946
Just hand it over and I'll do my thing.

400
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:31,882
Unless you're ready
to leave Gravity Falls.

401
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:36,152
Just a little more Summer.

402
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:42,059
- Oops!
- What?

403
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:46,130
[maniacal laughter]

404
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,967
Oh, no! Wait, wait, wait!

405
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:51,969
[snap]
Oh...

406
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,871
[maniacal laughter]

407
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:57,408
At last. At long, long last!

408
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,977
The gate between worlds is open!

409
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:03,381
The event one billion years
prophesized has come to pass!

410
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:07,051
The day has come.
The world is finally mine!

411
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:09,487
[wind whistling]

412
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:17,094
[maniacal laughter]

413
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,738
[all gasping]

414
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:26,103
What's going on?
What is that?!

415
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:29,674
We're too late.

416
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:33,420
It's the end of the world.
[maniacal laughter]

417
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:39,045
[wind whistling]

418
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:43,615
[car alarm blaring]
[cracking]

419
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,719
[people screaming]

420
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,002
[helicopter passing overhead]
