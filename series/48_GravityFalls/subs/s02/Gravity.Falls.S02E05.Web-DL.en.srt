with matchmaking today.

175
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,927
Yeah! I wore my motivational
sweater and everything.

176
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,914
- I messed up that part.
- He didn't come in today.

177
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:56,916
It's the first time
he's missed work ever.

178
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:05,090
[Chuckles] So that's basically
my entire life story.

179
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:07,009
Now you tell me a thing about you.

180
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,763
<i>Every time you compliment me,
I get another highlight in my eyes.</i>

181
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:11,981
Ah, you're pretty.

182
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,899
And pixelly.

183
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:14,934
And so agreeable.

184
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,939
- Yes!
- Uh, Soos.

185
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,942
Oh, hi, dudes, come in.
This game is amazing.

186
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:25,244
I'm making eye contact,
going on dates

187
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,081
and I haven't seen any natural
sunlight for 13 hours.

188
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:33,168
Soos, maybe it's time to apply
these skills with real girls.

189
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,087
But, I'm about to meet her parents!

190
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:38,257
Her dad is an octopus man.

191
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,125
[Screams]

192
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:43,846
We're going back to the mall, man.
You need to unplug!

193
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,017
I'll see you later, Giffany.
I'll be back, I swear!

194
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:50,052
[Chuckles] Soos, you don't
have to wish her goodbye.

195
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:51,804
It's just a game!

196
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:53,856
It's not like it's going anywhere.

197
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,893
<i>Yes, it's not like
I'm going anywhere.</i>

198
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,817
Hello?

199
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:06,819
Time to read Soos's diary.

200
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:11,824
Dang!
 Where all of them sweet honeys at?

201
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,959
I'll check the ladies bathroom!

202
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,211
It's love time, girls!
Get out there!

203
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:19,131
<i>No time to wash your hands!
Get out of here.</i>

204
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,216
<i>It's time to date, date, date.</i>

205
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,503
And here comes security.
I'll deal with this.

206
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:26,505
Stay here and practice
on some real girls.

207
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,213
These girls have so many dimensions

208
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:36,431
and no explanationy menus.

209
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,350
Ah, my purse.

210
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,519
Oh, no!
Undo! Undo!

211
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:44,376
You can't undo who you are.

212
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,195
Oh, man, this is the worst.

213
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,446
I wish I was back home with...

214
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,232
<i>Hi, Soos.</i>

215
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:56,535
Giffany! Oh, man, I am
so relieved to see you!

216
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,453
Although, sort of confused.

217
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:02,241
<i>Oh, Soos,
I am not an ordinary game!</i>

218
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:05,077
<i>I am special.</i>

219
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:08,380
<i>The programmers tried to delete me.</i>

220
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:11,083
<i>So I had to delete them.</i>

221
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:15,304
What did you do to them?

222
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,089
<i>[Echoing] That's not important.</i>

223
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,423
<i>What's important is</i>

224
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,260
<i>you don't have to talk
to real girls ever again.</i>

225
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,061
<i>You and me can be together...</i>

226
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:26,248
<i>forever!</i>

227
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,101
Wow, that's awesome!
Sort of a red flag.

228
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:30,269
But mostly awesome!

229
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,104
So what do you want to do now?

230
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:34,156
<i>Anything you want, Soos.</i>

231
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:37,409
Choo-choo.

232
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,248
<i>Please insert 50 cents to continue.</i>

233
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:48,287
- Aw, man!
- [Laughs] Oh, I'm sorry.

234
00:11:48,289 --> 00:11:50,372
Dude, that's awesome
that you're a grown man

235
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,174
riding a little train like that.

236
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,426
- You're totally like owning it.
- Huh?

237
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,046
Oh, yeah, I'm like, if it's fun, do it.

238
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:00,132
- You know?
- Exactly!

239
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,466
Being an adult is the worst!

240
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:04,303
Skewering meat,
remembering to pay bills.

241
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:06,305
I just want to ride tiny trains all day.

242
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,307
At least you get to work
at Meat Cute,

243
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:10,475
extreme lunch meats
are the food of the future.

244
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:12,227
I feel the same way.

245
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:14,479
- I'm Melody by the way.
- I'm Soos!

246
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:16,481
I tell you,
if you like robots for kids,

247
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:18,984
you should check out the
best restaurant of all time.

248
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,035
You mean...

249
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,321
<i>[Unisono] Hoo-ha owl's
pizzamatronic jamboree.</i>

250
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:25,073
What?
You've heard of Hoo-ha owl's?

251
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,992
I loved that place when I was a kid!

252
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:28,377
Oh, yeah, dude,
there's one right in this mall!

253
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,162
I should show you sometime.

254
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:33,131
- I'm free around eight?
- Boom. Done.

255
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,500
Perfect.
I'll see you then.

256
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,176
What a nice lady.

257
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,428
Well, back to riding this
tiny train for children.

258
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,348
Soos!

259
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,517
We saw the whole thing, Soos.
That was amazing!

260
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,319
You talked to a real girl.

261
00:12:54,354 --> 00:12:56,154
- And you got a date!
- I did?

262
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,272
Ah! Ah!

263
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:59,408
This is the best day of my life!

264
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:01,443
You were in the zone,
you made eye contact.

265
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:04,196
It was like you'd done this
a million times before!

266
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,365
Don't you see?
That game really worked!

267
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,000
You don't need it anymore!

268
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:11,705
- You can toss it out!
- Toss it? But I like Giffany!

269
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:14,172
She's good to me!
She's predictable!

270
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:18,377
Soos, can a computer game go to
Reggie's engagement party with you?

271
00:13:18,428 --> 00:13:20,178
Uh...

272
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:23,098
Hey, Giffany, we got to talk.

273
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:26,385
<i>Of course, I'm programmed to find
everything you say interesting.</i>

274
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:29,471
Well, have you ever had to choose
between two things you like,

275
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,223
but you don't know
which one is right for you?

276
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:34,109
I mean, I'm just thinking long term.

277
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:38,363
Maybe I should be with someone a
little less beep-boop, you know.

278
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:40,065
<i>I don't think you know
what you are saying, Soos.</i>

279
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,400
<i>No one loves you more than me.</i>

280
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,452
<i>The girls out there
will just make fun of you.</i>

281
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,287
You really think so?

282
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,240
<i>I know so.
Besides, we had a deal.</i>

283
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,077
<i>You bought my game, you held my
books, you are my boyfriend.</i>

284
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,462
<i>Now sit down in that chair.</i>

285
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:55,414
I don't think I like the way
you are acting.

286
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:58,166
<i>I won't let another girl
take you away from me, Soos!</i>

287
00:13:58,217 --> 00:13:59,418
Giffany, calm down.

288
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,219
<i>You are mine, Soos!
[Clanking on glass]</i>

289
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,597
Well... uh... pause.

290
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,093
Oh, that got intense.

291
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,177
I'm sorry, Giffany.

292
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:13,015
Maybe having a cursed robo
girlfriend wasn't a good idea.

293
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,533
I'm taking you back
to the video game store

294
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,118
after my date with Melody.

295
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:20,750
[Beeping]
[Electricity Cracking]

296
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,052
Hello, old friends.

297
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:30,121
I've got to be careful this time.

298
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:32,123
No more Colombian nights.

299
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:36,093
All right, Stan, this is weird
even for you, you need to talk?

300
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:38,129
Nothing you could say
will change my mind, Wendy.

301
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,799
Sometimes, a man has to steal
an animatronic badger

302
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:44,051
to stay in this crazy game called life.

303
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:47,722
- Or you could just not care.
- It's about the principle.

304
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,940
No one tells Stan Pines
he is out of the game.

305
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,058
No one tells...

306
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:52,977
[screams]

307
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:56,335
- I'll get your orthopedic back pillow.
- Thank you!

308
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,749
You can do this, Soos.

309
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,901
Just remember
what your love crew taught you!

310
00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:02,987
- How does she look?
- Nice!

311
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:05,656
- What are her stories?
- Interesting!

312
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,793
- And who's gonna pay for dinner?
- Soos is!

313
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,128
Now date!
[Blows horn]

314
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,997
[Soos screaming]

315
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,015
They grow up so fast.

316
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,002
Itchy legs, itchy legs.
Oh, hi, Soos.

317
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:24,008
Melody! Are you ready
for a ... date with me?

318
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,843
[Laughing]

319
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,011
I totally am.

320
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:32,149
Good show, man.
Way to warm them up!

321
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:35,508
I wish I was more like you.
[Smooches]

322
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:39,940
Man, I could go for some

323
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,374
complimentary bread
sticks right now.

324
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,829
[Chuckles]
One time I was so hungry

325
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:48,032
I ate the decorational bamboo
in a Chinese restaurant.

326
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:53,754
- Like a big old panda.
- [Laughs] You're hilarious.

327
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:58,042
Well, you know, I just sort of
say whatever pops into my...

328
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:06,851
Soos, are you okay?

329
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,853
No, I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

330
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,722
Are you sure?
You are spitting an awful lot.

331
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:14,809
Uh, could you sit tight?

332
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,894
I have go to the bathroom
for a long time.

333
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:18,863
Not in a weird way.

334
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:22,116
Soos!
What are you doing out there?

335
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,735
I got a big problem, guys,
I am being stalked by Giffany.

336
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:25,903
<i>Giffany?</i>

337
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:27,738
Or maybe it's pronounced Giffany.

338
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:30,274
- I was never really sure.
- Soos, get a grip on yourself.

339
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:33,110
Giffany can't stalk you
because she is not real.

340
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,068
- Uh-oh.
- Take it from someone who brought

341
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:43,287
an arcade game to life.
This will not end well.

342
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:46,206
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure
she is stuck on TV screens.

343
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:52,212
<i>Ah, a new challenger approaches,
prepare to be...</i>

344
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,918
Oh, boy.

345
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,901
So hey! Anyway, you want
to move this date into

346
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,006
the forest far away from
all electronics and people?

347
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,758
What? But the floor show's
about to start!

348
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,177
Wha...
[Music plays]

349
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:16,987
<i>Who wants to hear
Hoo-ha the owl!</i>

350
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,461
[Shutting down]

351
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,944
<i>Hello, friends,
Hoo-ha the owl is dead.</i>

352
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:30,034
<i>This next song goes out to my
forever boyfriend, Soos.</i>

353
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,953
- Soos, what's going on?
- No time to explain!

354
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:34,304
We got to get out of here!

355
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:40,294
<i>The only way out, Soos, is in my arms.</i>

356
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:41,879
<i>Capture them!</i>

357
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:47,051
[Growling]
[People screaming]

358
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:51,105
Done! Out with the old, in with the new!

359
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,890
I feel invincible.

360
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:56,226
Ah!
What... what the...

361
00:17:56,277 --> 00:18:00,280
Who wants to get badgered?
[Screams]

362
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,952
<i>Sorry, Soos.</i>

363
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:08,122
<i>But you can't run away
from our relationship.</i>

364
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,831
So about all this, I may have
purchased a dating simulator

365
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,833
that attained sentience
and went crazy.

366
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:23,887
<i>Oh, I am crazy.
Crazy for you, Soos.</i>

367
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,257
- Ah!
- Oh, no.

368
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:29,176
Oh, I'm so sorry, Melody!
I'll fix this!

369
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,011
It's me that she wants.

370
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:33,222
I'll distract her while
Dipper and Mabel keep you safe.

371
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:36,934
- It's the only way.
- Soos, these are children.

372
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,019
The only way!

373
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,904
[Groaning]

374
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,906
- Over here, Giffany!
- Stop!

375
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,665
On three, we split.
One, two...

376
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,117
[screaming]

377
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,170
Stay back, you monster!

378
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,921
Ah!

379
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,850
Yes, yes, get him, Goldie, get him.

380
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:18,859
<i>I'm gonna eat your face like pizza.</i>

381
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:29,442
[Growls]
[Screams]

382
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:34,041
<i>I have got you surrounded, Soos.
There is no way out.</i>

383
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:35,876
Please, let my friends go.

384
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,911
I'll do anything you want.
I promise.

385
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:43,250
<i>I seem to remember someone
promising he will be my boyfriend.</i>

386
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:49,139
<i>Think about it, real girls are
unpredictable, they judge you.</i>

387
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:52,142
<i>You really think Melody
is going to take you back</i>

388
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:54,261
<i>after this awful date?</i>

389
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:59,266
<i>I can download your brain
into the game with me</i>

390
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:02,019
<i>and we will be together
forever.</i>

391
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,020
Ah!

392
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:05,856
Stay back.

393
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:10,277
<i>Come on, Soos.
Don't make me to leave you, too.</i>

394
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,945
<i>What do you say?</i>

395
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,165
I say, game over, Giffany!

396
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:18,285
<i>No! Wait!</i>

397
00:20:38,356 --> 00:20:39,856
You did it!

398
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,226
You old, beautiful monster!
You did it!

399
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:44,194
How's about you and me hit the town?

400
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,980
These old has-beens
are going to Vegas!

401
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,904
[Sighs]
I'm sorry for all this.

402
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,907
I honestly remember this place being
a lot more fun when I was a kid.

403
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,076
Believe it or not,
I've been on worse dates.

404
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:01,211
- Really?
- Never date a magician.

405
00:21:01,246 --> 00:21:03,880
Ew! Why would I?
[Chuckles]

406
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:05,882
Oh, hey, you wouldn't maybe
be interested

407
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,135
in coming to my cousin's
engagement party in a week?

408
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:11,004
I promise there is like
zero robot badgers.

409
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:13,173
[Chuckles] Yeah, I'll
still be in town then.

410
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:15,008
Still be in town?

411
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,060
I'm going back home to
Portland in a few weeks

412
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:19,846
but we can video chat,
if that's okay with you?

413
00:21:19,848 --> 00:21:23,016
A relationship with a girl that I
can only see through my computer...

414
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,852
sounds perfect.

415
00:21:25,854 --> 00:21:28,989
Spirit of love, we did it.

416
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,241
Yes, yes, I'm so happy.

417
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:33,327
Have you been
following us all day?

418
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:36,029
Soos's life is my soap opera.
