Come on, come on. Should be
just enough to finish the job.

3
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,990
Phew! Can't be too careful
with this stuff.

Blah blah blah...

"Extreme usage could result

6
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,623
Can it, Poindexter.
I've come this far.

7
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:33,925
I'm not giving up now.

8
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,466
Yes, this is it!

It's here! It's here!

14
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:39,904
Okay, so I was
just opening random doors,

15
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:43,109
because I'm a creep, when
I found something amazing!

16
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:46,900
If it was worth waking up at
7:00 am for, that will be amazing.

17
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:50,187
- Feast your eyes!
- Whoa!

18
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,355
Bro. Bro.
We're both thinkin' it.

20
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,862
Not so fast, kids.
There is no way on Earth

21
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:02,032
you're setting off those
dangerous, illegal fireworks...

22
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,033
without me.

23
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,172
Here you go, sweetie!

24
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:12,092
Set something on fire
for your Grunkle Stan!

27
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,103
Hold on a minute.
Do you have a permit for those?

28
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:24,304
Uh...

29
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,973
Uh, do you have a permit
for being totally lame?

30
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,109
Hey-o!

31
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:33,897
Well, I can't argue with that. 
Carry on.

32
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,951
But seriously, though, we should
probably clean this mess up.

33
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:43,873
- With water balloons?
- I don't see why not.

34
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:47,327
Seriously?

35
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,045
- Ow.
- Whoo!

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,083
Ah, this is what Saturdays are for.
Doing dumb things forever!

39
00:02:57,305 --> 00:03:01,007
To Grunkle Stan!
Not just a great uncle...

40
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,926
The greatest uncle!

41
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,979
All right, all right. I tell ya,

42
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,816
it's unnatural for siblings
to get along as well as you do.

43
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,102
Don't worry, we've
still got plenty of summer left

44
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,903
to drive each other crazy.

45
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:19,276
Heh... yeah...
plenty of summer left.

46
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:22,996
Kids, there's something I, uh...
something I should tell you.

47
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,116
It's, um...
W-well, it's complicated.

48
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,001
I...

49
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,870
I'm gonna go refresh my soda.

50
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:34,124
Enjoy it while you can, Stan.
They'll find out sooner or later.

51
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:38,962
Today's the day.
What is that, a ladybug?

52
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:42,132
What the... Oh, no!

54
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,139

00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,975
Kids are secure.
Roof team, go!

57
00:03:57,948 --> 00:03:59,199
Clear!

58
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,952
Pig secure... we have secured a pig.

59
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,992
Hey, hands off, you stooge!

60
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,293
 I don't understand!

61
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:13,997
What did I do that warrants
this much arresting?

62
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,085
The government guys?
I thought you got eaten by zombies.

63
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:23,006
- We survived... barely.
- I used Trigger as a human shield.

64
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,842
- He cried like a baby.
- Wha... Hey!

65
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:27,177
Not in front of the special ops guys.

66
00:04:27,228 --> 00:04:30,313
This is security footage of
a government waste facility.

67
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:35,018
<i>At 0400 hours last night, someone
robbed 300 gallons of dangerous waste.</i>

68
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,319
What? You think that's me?

69
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,271
Don't play dumb with us, Pines!

70
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:41,157
But I actually am dumb!
Last night I was restocking

71
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:44,450
- the gift shop... I swear!
- Wait, Grunkle Stan!

72
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,938
You've got the wrong guy!
Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift

73
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,334
the occasional tangerine, but
he's not some evil supervillain.

74
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,337
Listen, kid. We've been
watching your family all summer,

75
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,256
and we've seen some disturbing things,

76
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,159
but nothing as dangerous as
what your uncle is hiding.

77
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:02,796
Somewhere hidden in this
shack is a doomsday device!

78
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,049
Trigger, you take the children.

79
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,052
I'll talk to the old man.
Sorry to break it to you, kids,

80
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:11,137
but you don't know your uncle at all.

81
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:15,341
- Icee pop, clear!
- Hey!

82
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,551
Kids! You gotta believe me!

83
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:28,238
<i>For once I'm actually innocent!

00:05:35,963 --> 00:05:39,415
- Break down the door!
- Or... maybe not.

87
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:52,406
Stanford Pines, you stand accused
of theft of government waste,

88

conspiracy, and possession
of illegal weapons.

89
00:05:54,792 --> 00:05:56,660
How do you plead to these charges?

90
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,746
Uh... "guiltoccent."
I mean, "innoguilty."

91
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,499
Um...
Can I have my phone call?

92
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:07,421
Okay, give me whatever you
got that comes with a free toy.

93
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:08,722
<i>Soos!</i>

94
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,842
Mr. Pines? Is this some
sort of possession situation?

95
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:13,343
<i>Soos, pick up!</i>

96
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:15,729
Mr. Pines, what happened?
I heard you got arrested or something?

97
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:17,397
I had to go get some panic food.

98
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:18,732
<i>Listen, I need something from you.</i>

99
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:20,684
You know that vending
machine in the gift shop?

100
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,853
<i>I need you to guard it with your life.</i>

101
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:25,439
<i>No matter what happens,
no matter who talks to you,</i>

102
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,357
<i>don't let them touch that machine!</i>

103
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:33,363
Time for a repair guy...
to become a repair man.

00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,699
<i>Sir, your Junior Yum-Yum
Baby-Time Kiddo Meal?</i>

105
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:38,441
Just put one in my mouth.

106
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,055
Let's do this.

107
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,546
<i>We've got Mr. Pines in custody.</i>

108
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,465
<i>Our men are searching
the shack for that device.</i>

109
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,600
<i>You take care of those kids.</i>

110
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:55,552
What are you gonna do to us?

111
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:58,555
- We'll be taking you to child services.
- Boo!

112
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,774
In the meantime, enjoy
some mindless reality TV...

113
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:03,727

<i>You're watching Ker-Prank'd
with Justin Ker-Prank.</i>

117
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,403
Dipper, this is crazy.

118
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:15,539
There's no way Stan was
stealing hazardous waste.

119
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:18,501
- We gotta clear his name!
- Hmm...

120
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:22,629
Wait a minute, the security tapes!

121
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,549
Didn't Stan say he was restocking
the gift shop last night?

122
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,467
If we could get the Mystery
Shack's surveillance tapes,

123
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:28,752
we could prove he's innocent!

124
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:31,838
We just need to think
of a way out of here.

125
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,591
Think, Mabel. Think.

126
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,593
No!

127
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:54,578
Oh oh oh...

128
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:57,864
<i>Mayday, mayday!
Agent down!</i>

129
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,622
- Darn branch!
- Yes!

130
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,508
Backup! Requesting backup!

131
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,680
Come on, Dipper. We're gonna
go clear our uncle's name.

132
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,716
Oh, you poor kids. You really
think your uncle's innocent?

133
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,803
<i>I've seen it all before.
False names, double lives.</i>

134
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,638
<i>One minute, they're
playing with water balloons.</i>

135
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,723
<i>The next, they're
building doomsday devices.</i>

136
00:08:23,774 --> 00:08:25,809
<i>Your uncle scammed the whole world.</i>

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,217
<i>You gonna let him scam you, too?</i>

138
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:31,648
You... You don't know
what you're talking about.

139
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,567
<i>You're gonna regret this!</i>

140
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:50,842
Only five more hours till it happens.
I gotta be there!

141
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:53,420
Come on, Stan,
you gotta think of a way out of this.

142
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:54,671
Think! Think!

143
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:56,590
Huh?

144
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:06,566
They're getting stronger!
Of course, that's it!

145
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:11,688
H-hey! Whoa!

146
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,357
Is it just me, or did the
entire world just hiccup?

147
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,610
I'm sure it's just
a baby-sized earthquake.

148
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:18,695
Aww, baby-sized!

149
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:23,500
It's happening!
The end times!

150
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:26,703
When that machine activates,
I gotta get outta town!

151
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:30,707
Git in there, raccoon wife, git!

152
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,427
Eh?

153
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,078
<i>All right, here's the plan.
 I'll take out those</i>

154
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,605
<i>two guard guys, you karate-chop
the other dude in the neck,</i>

155
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,607
and then we'll back-flip
through the front door!

156
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,477
Mabel, aren't you forgetting
the simpler solution?

157
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:51,528
Oh, right.

158
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:56,495
- So is it a rock, or is it a face?
- I think... it's a metaphor.

159
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,548
All right. If I was Stan,

160
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,883
where would I hide
those surveillance tapes?

161
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,841
Wait! The Antelabbit!

162
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,593
Don't you mean "jackalope"?

163
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:25,860
Pfft! That can't be right.

164
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,766
<i>Yes!</i>

165
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,033
<i> It's this week! 
This is it!</i>

166
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:35,772
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

167
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:38,608
Someone yelled "Wormy Dance."
We had to!

168
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,693
Fast-forward.

169
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,864
<i>Ha! There it is!
Stan restocking, like he said.</i>

170
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:48,585
And the date shows it was last night!
It's proof! He's innocent!

171
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,252
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, maybe he's just

172
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:01,214
going to the bathroom outdoors,
the way nature intended.

173
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:08,388
<i>Oh, no. Stan, you didn't!</i>

174
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,391
Don't panic. That could
be anyone in that suit.

175
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:13,777
<i>Hot Belgian waffles!</i>

176
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:18,481
<i>Wait, I'm alone. I can
swear for real! Son-of-a... </i>

177
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,867
That's him, all right.

178
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:25,488
Okay, okay. So maybe Grunkle
Stan stole some toxic waste.

179
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,491
That doesn't mean he's leading
a nefarious double life.

180
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:31,511
Mabel, I'm not so sure about that.

181
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:36,800
What? What is all this?

182
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,835
Stetson Pinefield?

183
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:42,722
Hal Forrester?
Andrew "8-Ball" Alcatraz?

184
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,200
These are fake IDs, Mabel!
You wouldn't need these

185
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:47,644
unless you were trying to
hide your real identity.

186
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:49,596
But why would Stan do that?

187
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,521
What?

188
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,607
<i>"Stan Pines Dead"?</i>

189
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,859
<i>"Foul play
suspected in Pines' death."</i>

190
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:07,107
"Fiery car crash, brakes cut... "
By who?

191
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,785
<i>"Unnamed grifter at large"?</i>

192
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:14,471
Why would they call him "unnamed"?

193
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:17,374
- Unless Stan...
- ... isn't...

194
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>Stan?!</i>

195
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,708
<i>Stan Pines is dead? </i>

196
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,795
Then who have we been living with?
It doesn't make any sense!

197
00:12:30,846 --> 00:12:33,547
There has to be some explanation.

198
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,701
Maybe we're getting Ker-Pranked!
Justin Ker-Prank is gonna

199
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:40,479
jump up from behind one of
these plants, any minute now!

200
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:43,774
Any minute, Justin.

201
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,477
Can't believe it! This whole summer
I've been looking for answers,

202
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,863
and the biggest mystery
was right under our nose.

203
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:51,816
There's gotta be some kind of
explanation in here, somewhere.

204
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:55,653
What the... ?
"Secret Code to Hideout"?

205
00:12:55,704 --> 00:13:00,374
Let me see that!
A1, B, C3...

206
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:03,544
- I've never seen a code like this.
- Wait, I have!

207
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,663
Dipper, it's the vending machine!

208
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,720
All right, Pines.
Play time is over.

209
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:15,423
Chopper's ready to
dust off to Washington.

210
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:17,425
I'll enjoy putting you away.

211
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:19,727
What? Um, can't we stick
around for maybe one minute,

212
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,762
uh, one minute, thirty seconds?

213
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,765
We're not falling for your games, Pines.

214
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:29,603
You've been running your whole life.
Your time is finally up.

215
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,772
Bathroom break?
Just gimme 15 seconds.

216
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,408
Sorry, but you've got a flight to catch.

217
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:40,831
Oh, yeah? So do you!

218
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,616
Huh?

219
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,707
Whoa, whoa, hey!

220
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,799
Hey!
Dang it, get back here!

221
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,551
<i>Men, get him!</i>

222
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:06,640
No!
 You won't get away with this!

223
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,529
Gonna get ya! Gonna get ya!

224
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:13,647
<i>Ow!</i>

225
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,783
Whoa!

226
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:17,818
- You know where the Mystery Shack is?
- Uh, yeah.

227
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,537
Okay, here's a hundred bucks.

228
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,455
Drive as far away from
the Shack as possible,

229
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,657
and don't stop when the
cops start chasing you!

230
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,580
<i>He's getting away!</i>

231
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,500
Obviously, follow that cab!

232
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,670
Stanford escaped! He's at large!

233
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:39,673
We need to sweep the town!
Move, move, move!

234
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:54,522
All right, Soos, remember the plan.

235
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:56,440
Protect the machine, earn Stan's trust,

236
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:58,692
legally get adopted by Stan,
change name to Stan Junior.

237
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:01,529
- Soos!
- Oh, kids, where have you been?

238
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:02,830
W-what are you doing here?

239
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:04,832
Stan gave me a mission
to protect this machine.

240
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:07,418
Ha!
And I thought I loved snacks!

241
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,587
Soos, listen.
Something huge is going on here.

242
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:13,424
If Stan is hiding some dangerous secret,
we need to find out what it is!

243
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,544
- I need you to step aside.
- Yeah, just let us through

244
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:19,630
so we can prove this is all
just a big misunderstanding.

245
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,425
Guys, I know this seems crazy,

246
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:24,043
but I promised Stan I would
guard this with my life.

247
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:27,471
I'm sorry, Soos.

248
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:30,558
Attack glitter!
It's pretty, but it hurts!

249
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,775
- Please, Soos!
- C'mon, Soos!

250
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,445
Aw, c'mon, I don't wanna fight you guys!

251
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,564
This hurts me more than it hurts you!

252
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,651
Seriously, it hurts me
way more than it hurts you.

253
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:51,462
Ohh...

254
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:58,886
It's like something from a video game.

255
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,389
- Or a dream.
- Or a nightmare.

256
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:09,763
I gotta be there when it happens!

257
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:21,292
Guys, are we dreaming?
Somebody wake me up.

258
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:23,260
This... can't be real.

259
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,430
I don't understand. Why
would Mr. Pines have all this?

260
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,599
It's just like that bunker in the woods.

261
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,352
But what is it doing
underneath the Mystery Shack?

262
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:35,272
Okay, okay, so he's got
a huge, gigantic lab.

263
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:36,640
That doesn't mean anything bad.

264
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,442
Everyone's got secrets!

265
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:41,645
It's still Stan, and he loves us.

266
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:46,367
- And we love him, right?
- Can't be... it's impossible.

267
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,569
<i>The other two journals?!</i>

268
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,572
All this time, all this time,
Stan had them?!

269
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,542
I can't believe it!
Was anything he said to us real?!

270
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:57,578
- Why would he have those journals?!
- Maybe he's the author.

271
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,547
Or maybe he stole them from the author!

272
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:01,632
Maybe the reason he has
all of those fake IDs

273
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,584
is because he is a master criminal,

274
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:06,617
<i>and this machine is his master plan!</i>

275
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:13,394
Whoa!

276
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,565
"I was wrong the whole time."

277
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,601
<i>"The machine was meant to create
knowledge, but it is too powerful!"</i>

278
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:22,653
"I was deceived, and now it is too late!"

279
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:27,038
<i>- "The device, if fully operational,"
- "could tear our universe apart!"</i>

280
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,328
"It must not fall into the wrong hands.

281
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:34,615
"If the clock ever reaches zero,
our universe is doomed."

282
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:41,194
It's the final countdown!
Just like they always sung about!

283
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:46,460
The agents were right!
We have to shut it down!

284
00:17:57,522 --> 00:17:58,639
There! Quick!

285
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:03,394
Turn these! Together!

286
00:18:06,231 --> 00:18:07,531
That's it!
The shutdown switch!

287
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:13,571
This all stops now!

288
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:18,208
<i>Don't touch that button!</i>

289
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,631
Dipper, just back away.

290
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,669
Please don't press that shutdown
button. You gotta trust me.

291
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,421
And I should trust you, why?

292
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:34,308
After you stole radioactive waste,
after you lied to us all summer!

293
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:37,561
- I don't even know who you are!
- Look, I know this all seems nuts,

294
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:41,231
but I need that machine to stay on.
If you just let me explain...

295
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:44,085
Oh! Oh, no!
Brace yourselves!

296
00:18:52,277 --> 00:18:53,694
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

297
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:05,205
<i>T-minus 35 seconds.</i>

298
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:09,376
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

299
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:10,544
<i>Dipper!</i>

300
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,632
Mabel! Hurry!
Shut it down!

301
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,470
No!

302
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:22,473
Mabel, Mabel, wait!
Stop!

303
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,642
Soos, what are you doing?
I gave you an order!

304
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:27,227
Sorry, Mr. Pines,
if that is your real name,

305
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:30,230
but I have a new mission now,
protecting these kids!

306
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,616
Soos, you idiot, let me go!

307
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:36,570
- Let me go! C'mon!
- Mabel, press the red button!

308
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:39,490
- Shut it down!
- No, you can't! You gotta trust me!

309
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:44,495
Grunkle Stan, I don't even
know if you're my Grunkle!

310
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:46,463
I wanna believe you, but...

311
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,253
Then listen to me.
Remember this morning,

312
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,352
when I said I wanted to
tell you guys something?

313
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,553
<i>T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

314
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,592
I wanted to say that you're gonna
hear some bad things about me,

315
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:02,346
and some of 'em are true, but trust
me, everything I've worked for,

316
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:05,349
everything I care about,
it's all for this family.

317
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,684
Mabel, what if he's lying?

318
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:09,570
This thing could destroy the universe!
Listen to your head!

319
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,405
<i>Look into my eyes, Mabel!</i>

320
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,273
You really think I'm a bad guy?

321
00:20:13,324 --> 00:20:15,693
He's lying!
Shut it down, now!

322
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,760
<i>- Mabel, please!
- Ten, nine... </i>

323
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,334
Grunkle Stan...

324
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:25,536
<i>Six, five... </i>

325
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,374
I trust you.

326
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,543
Mabel, are you crazy?!
We're all gonna...

327
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,381
<i>One.</i>

328
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,715
Nooo!

329
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,138
W-What? Who is that?

330
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,557
The author of the journals...

331
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:25,062
<i>... my brother.</i>

332
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:29,999
- Is this the part where one of us faints?
- Oh, I am so on it, dude.
