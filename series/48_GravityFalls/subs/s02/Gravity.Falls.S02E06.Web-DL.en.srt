Those people are called animators.

354
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,557
Hello? [echoes]

355
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,726
Mr. Claymore?

356
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:13,645
We want to get a look at your figurines.

357
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,513
We're not paparazzi.

358
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,999
Aha!

359
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:20,868
See, Mabel, it's all
just special effects.

360
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:21,970
You can come out.

361
00:17:22,005 --> 00:17:23,004
MABEL: No!

362
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,005
Kid, listen to me.

363
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,009
For the last time, there is
nothing here to be afraid of...

364
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,863
[roars]

365
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:33,715
[screaming]

366
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,716
[groans]

367
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:37,118
It's slowly...

368
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,655
swiping at us!

369
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,857
Let's escape by standing still!

370
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:45,026
Oh, it didn't work!

371
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:47,829
[Screaming]

372
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,132
Whoa!

373
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,967
[Screams]

374
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:53,968
[roars]

375
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:55,970
[screaming]

376
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,138
[groans]

377
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:03,044
How is this happening?
What do they want?

378
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,046
HARRY: I'm afraid they want you.

379
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:11,986
Harry Claymore, master of special
effects, circa 1970 something.

380
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:15,857
Alas, my effects are more
special than you know.

381
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,759
What? But how are these things real?

382
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,861
- What about stop motion?
- What?

383
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:21,116
Do you really believe someone

384
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:23,147
moves these figures one frame at a time?

385
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,799
I'm not a masochist.

386
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,702
I used black magic to make
them animate themselves.

387
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:29,804
It was great at first, but one day...

388
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,010
No!

389
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:38,646
Where's the heart?!

390
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:40,648
<i>HARRY: Now that they were out of work,</i>

391
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:43,718
<i>they went mad and enslaved me!</i>

392
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:46,888
And now they will turn you
into unholy beasts of clay

393
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:48,756
to join in their mischief!

394
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,291
Well, Mr. Pines, at least you'll finally

395
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:51,893
get to work with your favorite director.

396
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:55,062
And by work, I mean, suffocate
inside a big wad of clay.

397
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,065
DIPPER: Help!

398
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,667
- Somebody help us!
- Help!

399
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:00,868
Oh, what do I do?

400
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:03,704
How can I defeat those monstrosities?

401
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:09,977
Hey, I changed it into something I like.

402
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:12,980
Whoa. I think I have an idea!

403
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,651
Hey,
one-eyed-clops!

404
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,052
Yeah, I'm talking to you, dum-dum!

405
00:19:18,088 --> 00:19:19,720
Come at me!

406
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:20,788
[Yells]

407
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,097
Ah!

408
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:31,766
Wipe that face off your face.

409
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:36,003
Oh, I've got big plans for you!

410
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,905
Hey, skeleton dorks!

411
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:40,741
It's "clayback" time!

412
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:42,110
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

413
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:45,947
Dude, you conquered your fear.

414
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:49,667
That's right. Because
she believed in herself.

415
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:50,885
Can it, Twinkleheart!

416
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,020
Just start pounding those skeletons!

417
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,125
Mabel, you did it!

418
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:58,860
So you're not scared anymore?

419
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:03,097
Oh, I'm scared twice as much
now, but now I know it's rational.

420
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:05,967
Kid, I'm sorry I doubted
you. You were right.

421
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:08,019
Stop motion is pure evil.

422
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:10,071
And probably really expensive.

423
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:11,973
Incredibly expensive.

424
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,710
This is an impressive fight though.

425
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:17,044
I'm glad I'm facing towards it.

426
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,047
ALL: Yay!

427
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,716
That was the best part.

428
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,959
Well, I think today we learned
that you can remold your fears.

429
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,795
I'm just glad none of
us got turned into clay.

430
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:35,863
Holy Toledo!

431
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,867
Who wants to see me
change into most anything?

432
00:20:39,903 --> 00:20:42,170
[Humming]

433
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:45,940
I can walk through walls. Whoa!

434
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:49,875
We're safe now, kids. We're safe.

435
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,870
I don't get it. 
You don't want the pig,

436
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:55,623
you don't want my tapes...
What are you gonna buy?!

437
00:20:56,147 --> 00:20:58,447
How about this delicious potion?

438
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:00,771
Here, have a free sample.

439
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:11,195
You should have bought my merch
when you had the chance, buddy.

440
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,319
But that's OK.

441
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:15,643
I'll have some new for sale very soon...

442
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,667
[laughter]

443
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,526
And here we have our latest attraction:

444
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:23,891
The legendary Cheapskate!

445
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,274
I saw it blinking.

446
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:27,639
Ha! Just an optical illusion.

447
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,863
Come along, everyone. 
Step right up!

448
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,887
[laughter]

449
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:36,187
That's right, I'm a jerk.

450
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,411
Hey! Wanna play
Tic-tac-toe?

451
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:44,635
Hey! I wanted to be X's! 
Let me be X's.

452
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,659
Trust me, just let her be X's.

453
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,174
[sighs]
Yay!

454
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,898
Actually, I'm sorry.
 I changed my mind.

455
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:53,222
I'll be O's.

456
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,935
OK, you're gonna hate me right now...

457
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,170
but is X's still a possibility?

458
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:02,998
I don't think you're
playing this right...

459
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:07,299
