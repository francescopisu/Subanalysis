Who wants Stan-cakes?

2
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:11,793
They're like pancakes, but they
probably have some of my hair in 'em.

3
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:12,694
Pass.

4
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:16,298
It's here! Oh, it's here! It's here!
It's here! It's here!

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,666
I've been waiting all morning

6
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,201

Wha-wha-what?

13
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,754
Looks like someone bought
their way to the front page.

14
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,123
Is it legal for a child
to wear that much make-up?

15
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,891
Ugh. Pacifica.

16
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,726
She always ruins everything.

17
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,128
Aww, cheer up, Mabel.

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,890
I mean, no one even reads
newspapers anymore.

19
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:48,931
Dudes!

20
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:51,266
V-neck season is upon us!

21
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,308
Who wants to help me get
ahead of the fashion curve?

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,643
I'm taking it one step further

23
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:57,072
with the W-neck!

24
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:59,474

How about
we take a break, huh?

Would kicking all our butts

Yeah, besides
the Bermuda's Triangle,

79
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,998
how mini golf works
is the world's greatest mystery.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,366
As far as I'm concerned,

81
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:14,469

Oh, would you look at that?

84
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,041
I didn't know it was
"hobos golf free" day.

85

91
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:35,557
working out for you?

92
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,058
Great, actually.

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,326
That's the thing about money.

94
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,195
It makes problems go away.

95
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,197
Well, can't buy you skill.

96
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,666

This is Sergei, my trainer.

99
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:51,139
The Sportlympics had
mini golf once.

100
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,374
I took gold!

101
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,410
So if you don't mind moving out of
the way of the professionals...

102
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:01,316
( bell ringing )

103
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,323

114

Oh, the King is down!

116
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:46,495
This isn't over.
You. Me. Midnight.

117
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,330
We'll see who's best.

118
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,331
I'll be here.

120
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,672

Time to scratch mini golf off
my talents list.

124
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,692
Aww, don't give up, Mabel.

125
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:21,229
Yeah, if you beat her at this, she
could never rag on you again.

126
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,297
Imagine it.

127
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,468
Um, the section for ugly
grandma clothes is over there.

128
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,636
Oh, yeah?

129
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,740
Well, the section for people who
lost at mini golf is over there!

130
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,677
We came as fast as we could.

131
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,113
We heard a little girl
got seriously burned!

132
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,581
TOGETHER: Oh!

133
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,616
I'm ruined!

TOGETHER: Yay!

136
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,555
You're right, guys.

137
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:48,677
I just need to practice
a little more before midnight.

138
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,459
Go to the golf course
after dark, you say?

139
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,528
I don't know.
We'd have to break in and--

140
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,230
Just kidding!
Let's break in!

00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,667
What?
What is it?

152
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,103
( Whispers )
Grab your club.

153

Hi! Hello! I'm Franz.
And welcome to our home.

160
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:11,573
What is this?

161
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,174
Yeah.

162
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,578
Are you guys tiny humans?
Or enormous mini-humans?

163
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,913
Neither.
We're lilli-putt-tians!

164

Lilli-- Lilli-putt...

165
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,477

written out than spoken.

And we control the balls!
Behold!

BOTH: Wow!

168
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:44,673
( Yodeling )

169
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,577
That's incredible!

170
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,546
And so needlessly complicated.

171
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,781
Aw, shucks.

172
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,549
It's only our
life-long passion!

173
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,785
Would you like us
to elaborate through song?

174
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,820
( Begins singing )

175
00:08:58,822 --> 00:08:59,821
Nah, we're good.

176
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:02,624
( Sigh )

177
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,193
So what are you hugelings
doing here anyway?

178
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:06,961
We kind of have to play
this golf tournament

179
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,197
against my rival, Pacifica.

180
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,732
Oh, rivals.
Rivals, rivals.

181
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:13,535
Oh, we know all about rivals.

182
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,770
Put a clog in it,
ya windmill lubbers!

183
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,510
These really bottom popinjays are
terrible at controlling the balls!

184
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,447
We are the ball masters, says I!

185
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,415
( Pirates laughing
and cheering )

186
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,718
Shut your mouths,
you showboating pirates!

187
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,687
Everyone knows the Eiffel
Tower hole is the best!

188
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:38,660
Stay thee your comments,
ye scurrilous Frenchmen!

189
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:43,331
None controllable is better
than the knights of...

190
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,233
Wiener castle.

191
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,468
Who wrote this?

192
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,710
We'll settle
which hole is best!

193
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:48,603
Attack!

194
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,637
Charge!

195
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,906
Ooh, I'm shiverin'
in me timbers.

196
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,007
Get ready to die!

197
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,778
Long live the mini king!

198
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,681
Die, you evil scum!

199
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:00,749
Ow!

200
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,783
Yarr!

201
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:04,352
( Yells )

202
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,820
( quacking )

203
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,389
( screaming )

204
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,457
(laughs )

205
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,825
These guys are a riot.

206
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,628
Guys, guys, calm down.

207
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,564
Your fighting is
inadvertently adorable.

208
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,734
Adorable we are, hugeling,
but our tale, less so.

209
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,370
Every hole in the park thinks
that it's superior.

210
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,974
From the cowboys in the east to
the grimy minors of the south.

211
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:29,511
If only there was some way
to decide which side is best

212
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:31,546
with maybe an award or,
like a trophy.

213
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,547
I don't know.

214
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,616
But, Franz, look!

215
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:40,522
The sticker.
The sticker could decide!

216
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,590
It does say "the best" on it.

217
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,958
Decide for us, hugeling.

218
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,496
Choose which mini kingdom to give
the sticker to and end our war!

219
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:49,564
( Mini people cheering )

220
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,565
Uh,

221
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,833
I don't know, guys.

222
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:56,304
I'm not sure I want to get involved
in your weird mini blood feud.

223
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,372
Psst!

224
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:58,573
Mabel, this is perfect.

225
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,775
These guys control the course.

226
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,609
Just tell them
you'll give the sticker

227
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,312
to whichever group does
a better job of helping us win.

228
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:05,680
I'm not sure, Dipper.

229
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:09,651
I want to beat Pacifica, but
doesn't this seem like cheating?

230
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:13,688
Pacifica's rich, Mabel.
She's cheating at life.

231
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,757
Hmm.

232
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,858
( Blows horn )

233
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,959
Thanks, man.

234
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,661
People of the 18 holes!

235
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,863
We're going to have
a game of mini-golf!

236
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:25,967
And whoever does the best job
helping me win gets the sticker!

237
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,903
It'll be us, lass,
not these tulip munchers.

238
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,672
I will not be insulted

239
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,608
by a man with no depth
perception wearing earrings.

240
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,111
Just remember, as long as
you're helping me, no fighting.

241
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,618
Dude, I'm cutting
"W" s into all my shirts.

242
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,100
Got to give the public
what they want.

243
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,821
Well, the kids
are taking their time.

244
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,623
Looks like
it's gonna be a while.

245
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,695
( Romantic ballad
playing on radio )

246
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,535
Sure are a lot of stars
out tonight.

247
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,203
Well, this is gettin' weird.

248
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:07,909
Now remember, Pacifica,
winning is everything.

249
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:10,612
Oh, oh, and also looks.
Winning and looks.

250
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,981
Dad, I've been practicing for,
like, a millions hours, okay?

251
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,449
I've got this.

252
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:17,852
Pacifica, darling.
We have a party to go to.

253
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,821
We'll just read about
your victory in the paper.

254
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,023
Sergei!
( snaps fingers )

255
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,395
Oh, and whatever happens,
just remember one thing.

256
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:28,563
You're a Northwest.

257
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,031
Don't lose.

258
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,003
How much do you want to bet
they're no shows?

259
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,673
Looking for someone?

260
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,909
Waiting in the dark
and not creepy at all.

261
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,176
Seriously, though?

262
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,678
I don't know
why you bothered to come.

263
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,583
Oh, I guess you could say
we've got a little something.

264
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,084
Right? Right?

265
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,819
( laughs )

266
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,054
( giggle nervously )

267
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,057
Eighteen holes.
Standard rules.

268
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,460
Winner lives in glory.
Loser wallows in eternal shame.

269
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:03,197
On your mark,
get set, Mini golf!

270
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,946
What?

271
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,448
ALL: Yeehaw!

272
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,591
Out of my way!

273
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:31,759
( Grunts )

274
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,464
Are you serious?

275
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:37,832
( Cheering )

276
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:40,935
Yarr, I say!

277
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,642
( laughs )
Miner hole.

278
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,078
I wonder what cute silly things
are going on down there.

279
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,751
You can't go in there!
There's been a gas leak.

280
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,587
Anyone who goes in there
will die!

281
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,256
( Chattering )

282
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,324
I will take it.

283
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,625
No!

284
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,195
Don't go, Big Henry!
We need you!

285
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:08,963
Go home, Polly.

286
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,672
Ahem.

287
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,944
Come on, Big Henry.
You can do this.

288
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,014
( Groaning )

289
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,764
Aah! No!

290
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,633
Sergei! Soda! Now!

291
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,605
Okay, guys,
that was badonkulous!

292
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,087
Hey, hey.
Little high fives, everyone.

293
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,355
Little high fives all around.

294
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,610
Nice one. You did it.
You're the man!

295
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:56,932
I don't want to
call it out early,

296
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:01,215
but I think the Miners might have
one of these in their future.

297
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:03,051
( Miners cheering )

298
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,854
Are you kidding me?

299
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,723
After everything
we've worked for?

300
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,224
Calm yourself, Franz.

301
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,894
There may be another way
to win the hugelings' favor.

302
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:13,961
Knock on wood.

303
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
There's something going on,
Sergei.

304
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:23,738
Maybe they has little people
who control where balls go.

305
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,107
We got to get you
English lessons.

306
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,829
I mean, think about it.
I'm globally ranked.

307
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,421
It's ridiculous that
she's beating me.

308
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,582
Ugh, Pitt Cola.
I always forget about the pit.

309
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,285
Get me a different one,
Sergei.

310
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,319
Huh?

311
00:15:38,321 --> 00:15:39,587
( Screams )

312
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,727
I can't wait to see the look on
Pacifica's face when we win.

313
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:47,969
I'm thinking it will be like...

314
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,631
You know how she does that?

315
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,935
Dipper, is it bad that I feel
good about her feeling bad?

316
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:56,070
Just enjoy your victory,
Mabel.

317
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,339
Trust me,
Pacifica will be fine.

318
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,741
( Pacifica screams )

319
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,377
What's going on here?
Let me go!

320
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,247
( Screaming )

321
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,348
What did I miss?

322
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,751
Let me go, you creeps!

323
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,620
Welcome, twins!
Welcome!

324
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,062
I can tell
you're loving this, right?

325
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,690
Right? No?

326
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,924
What are you guys doing?

327
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,960
This wasn't part of the deal,
tiny Dutchman!

328
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:22,930
Okay, so we saw you were favoring
the Miners and we figured,

329
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,899
what's better than
beating Pacifica?

330
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,200
Pfft!

331
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,668
Killing her, right?

332
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,171
As if.
I'm calling my parents.

333
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,305
Where is my phone?

334
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:32,740
( Giggling )

335
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,374
Send.

336
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,909
Hey, hey!

337
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,411
So how about it, hugeling?
Who's the best now?

338
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,982
PIRATE:
Not so fast, landlubbers!

339
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,417
If you're going to
play dirty, so are we.

340
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,754
Now give us the sticker
or he walks the plank.

341
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,955
No, give us the sticker!

342
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,557
The Miners!
The sticker's for the Miners!

343
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:52,260
Give it to us!
Give it to us!

344
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,895
Remember Big Henry!

345
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:54,962
Enough!

346
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,065
( Gasps )

347
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,134
You know what?
No one gets the sticker!

348
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:02,470
( Booing )

349
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,205
No. No. Nuh-uh.

350
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,307
No booing.
Stop. No.

351
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,277
No one gets the sticker
'cause you're all being jerks.

352
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,379
I mean,
why can't you just get along?

353
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:13,781
Because we hate each other.

354
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,417
That's kinda
how rivalries work, lass.

355
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,785
Well then maybe...

356
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,354
Maybe rivalries are dumb.

357
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,291
Maybe you don't settle them
with petty competitions.

358
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,728
Maybe the only way to be "the
best" is by ending the fighting

359
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,896
and working together!

360
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,266
( Gulps )

361
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,936
( mini people gasp
and murmur )

362
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,070
It's all so clear.

363
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,339
If we work together...

364
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:41,776
Then we can cut open her belly
and get the sticker.

365
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,412
Get the girl!
Slice her open!

366
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,749
You guys aren't appreciating
the lesson here!

367
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,052
ALL: Sticker!
Sticker! Sticker!

368
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,891
( Screaming )
Help!

369
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,193
We've got to get out of here!

370
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,529
I have to save Pacifica first!

371
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,842
After her!

372
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,811
Ah, Mr. Dipper!
<i>Nyet! Nyet!</i>

373
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,113
Don't freak out, man!
The water's shallow!

374
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,082
There is literally
no way to drown.

375
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,186
Seriously?

376
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,856
Ugh, took you long enough.
And watch the earrings!

377
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,324
They're worth
more than your house!

378
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:33,127
You know, on second thought,
maybe I won't untie you.

379
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,762
Untie me!
Untie me!

380
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,197
That's what I thought.

381
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,465
( Gasp )

382
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,834
We have you
on miniature pencilpoint.

383
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:41,435
There's no way around us.

384
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,937
You ready to putt?

385
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,272
Way ahead of you.

386
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,008
ALL: Huh?

387
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,978
Hey, you're actually
not that terrible.

388
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,979
A little rusty, but...

389
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:53,514
Just shut up and putt!

390
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:58,286
Get on! Get on!

391
00:18:58,288 --> 00:18:59,387
Gun it!

392
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,990
Don't let them escape!

393
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,361
( Screaming )

394
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:08,829
( tires screeching )

395
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,938
Sergei overboard!

396
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,173
I'll get a new one.

397
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,076
They're shutting us in!

398
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:22,810
( Exclaims )

399
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:27,982
Don't even think about it.

400
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:29,417
You call yourself a golfer?

401
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,553
Without us, that club
is useless in your hands.

402
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,589
Oh yeah?
What's ten minus six?

403
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,924
Ten-- Hang on.

404
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,159
Fore!

405
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,495
( Bell ringing )

406
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,500
( tires squealing )

407
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,276
Stay out, you dumb hugelings!

408
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,912
( Shouting )
We're done with you.

409
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:59,513
What did you say,
you little trolls?

410
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:00,881
I will sue you.

411
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,117
I will sue you
and I will own you.

412
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,985
( Gasping )

413
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,454
You two.

414
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,356
I don't know what you did
or what's going on,

415
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,858
but if you think just
because you saved my life, I--

416
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:15,363
I'm sorry, Pacifica.

417
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:19,500
You totally would've
beat me fair and square.

418
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,237
You're just lucky this sticker
looks fantastic on me.

419
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,372
( Car approaching )

420
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,379
Hey!
You're parents aren't here.

421
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,913
You want a ride home?

422
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,349
Puh-leaze,
as if I'd ride in your--

423
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,485

428

Hey, I found two tacos!

429
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:50,931
You're allowed
to eat in the car?

430
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:54,201
Yeah, the car is where
secret surprise snacks happen.

431
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,469
Want one?

432
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,471
Oh, I'm not supposed
to take handouts.

433
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:00,341
Handouts?
It's called sharing!

434
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,310
You do know
what sharing is, right?

435
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,212
Shar-- Shaar-ing?

436
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:06,514
Just take it.

437
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,551
Thanks for the ride,
or whatever.

438
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,520
Oh, and Mabel...

439
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,557
I can't believe I'm saying this
but I had fun.

440
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,592
And tell your servant
I like his W neck!

441
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,395
Yes!

442
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:23,531
So are you guys, like,
cool now?

443
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,433
I think we made some progress.

444
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,967
The important thing
to remember is that

445
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,169
at the end of the day,

446
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,571
she's just an ordinary kid
like us.

447
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,044
Should've charged her
for that taco.

448
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,679
Agreed.

449
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,948
SOOS: Hey, you got any more
of those surprise tacos?

450
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,483
( Family laughing )

451
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,953
Laugh now, hugelings.
But Franz will have his day.

452
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,588
