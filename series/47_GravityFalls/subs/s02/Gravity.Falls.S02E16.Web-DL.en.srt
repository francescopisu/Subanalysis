00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:09,551
Nice.
And don't forget bug spray.

2
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:11,954
It's perfect for spraying
in the face of hitchhikers.

3
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:13,789
Whoa! An RV, camping gear.

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,958
Are you running from the law again?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,961
Dude, it's the ultimate
Oregon road trip adventure.

6
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:21,514
More like revenge trip.
Every year, my tourist

7

trap competitors prank
the Mystery Shack.

8
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:27,269
Last year, those hooligans
duct taped Soos to the ceiling.

9
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:31,040
- That was a fun 78 hours.
- Well, no more. This year, we're

10
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,742
visiting every tourist trap
along the Redwood Highway,

11
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:36,278
<i>and I'm gonna prank
back every single one.</i>

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,882
Bow-wow.
Time to let the Road Dawgs bark.

13
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:42,618
That is us.
We are the Road Dawgs.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,553
Thanks for letting me
bring Candy and Grenda along

15
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,689
- for our road trip, Grunkle Stan.
- The more, the merrier.

16
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,292
Just sign these
non-disclosure agreements.

<i>None of your parents are lawyers, right?</i>

18

What do you say, dude?
You comin'?

19
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:57,566
I already went to the trouble
of packing all your stuff.

20
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:59,635
Even the stuff you kept in
that secret box under the bed.

21
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:02,337
Whoa! What the...

22
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:05,908
- What's that?
- Uh, nothing.

23
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,277
Just... Wendy stuff, from old times.

Bro, I thought you were
finally past all this.

[sighs] I know, I know.
I know she's not interested,

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,365
and I know it's over, but

28
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:20,255
how do you just turn off
the way you feel about someone?

29
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:22,825
Two words, Dipper. Move on.

30
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:25,160
Yeah, dude, and a road
trip's the perfect place

31
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:26,995

I can't believe we're sitting at a table

Ooh! Informational travel pamphlets.

40
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:32,207
I want to read them all and
gain their travel knowledge.

Thinkin' about Miss Cold
Shoulder over there, huh?

00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,629
Ah, I'm so embarrassed.

62
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:43,599
Look, earlier this summer, I
ruined my chances with Wendy.

63
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,868
[chuckles] Yeah. Chances.

64
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,304
And I wanna move on, but I'm
terrible at talking to girls.

The moment I open my mouth around
them, I unravel like... like...

66
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,578
well, I can't think of a perfect
metaphor, but you get the gist.

67
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,199
At this rate, I'm gonna grow
up to be a sad loner like

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,819
- Toby Determined.
- Whoa, never say that about yourself.

<i>Lucky for you, I'm an expert on women.</i>

70

Listen to me, kid. When it comes
to girls, always be confident,

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,160
and be funny, but not too funny.

72
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,862
<i>And be kind of annoying,
but in a loveable way.</i>

73
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:16,598
I don't know, Grunkle Stan.
This sounds kinda jerky.

74
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,668
Hey, "jerky" is just
a term non-jerks use

75
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,737
to bad-mouth innocent jerks.

76
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,740
Confidence, comedy, some
third word starting with a "C."

The three C's of the Stan
Pines Dating Technique.

- Cool. Grunkle Stan, thanks.

Oh, hi. I'm Emma Sue.

Huh, yeah. Weird, right?
Pretend you're screaming.

Okay. You gotta take a

00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:48,257

Ho ho, just kidding.

101
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,360
- You are the worst.
- You bet I am.

102
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:54,229
I'm bad, Emma.
Kind of a jerk.

103
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,731
Emma, come on.
We have to get to Canada

104
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:59,067
- before your mother gives birth.
- It's a long story.

105
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,738
- Maybe you could tell me sometime.
- Here's my email address.

106
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,873
Write me and I'll tell you all about it.

107
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:09,444
A girl gave me her email,
and it wasn't out of pity.

108
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,813
Ha ha, yes!

109
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:15,751
Ugh! I'm okay.
I'm better than okay.

110
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,452
Mabel, hi. There's my Grenda.

111
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:19,087
Candy, looking great, looking great.

00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,257
<i>Is that a new pair of
glasses? Very shiny.</i>

00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:28,430
Maybe it's the blood pooling in my
head, but Dipper seems different.

[groans]

116
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,733
Yes, good different.

119
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:48,717
- What a lovely normal home.
- Stan Pines!

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,321
<i>I can't believe it worked.</i>

121
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:54,122
What do I do now?
Do I email her?

122
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:56,058
No, no, you practice.

123
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,393
The more girls you talk to,
the better you get at it.

124
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:01,263
Grunkle Stan, these tips are priceless.

125
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:03,865
And that's just the
tip of the advice-berg.

126
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,753
- Everyone on board?
- Probably.

127
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:31,493
Guys? Hello?
Anyone?

128
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,795
<i>They'll come back for me.</i>

129
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:39,468
So then I said to the bouncer,
"Where's your ID, ugly?"

130
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,103
That's where I got this scar.

131
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:43,438
[giggling]
Grunkle Stan, I gotta say,

132
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,153
this was one of the
best days ever. Look!

133
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:51,046
That's the Stan Pines method, kid.
Works every time.

134
00:07:51,048 --> 00:07:53,815
I'm just a little worried, though.

135
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:56,485
I mean, is it bad to flirt
with this many girls at once?

136
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,854
I'm just trying to get over Wendy.

137
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:00,489
I don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings.

138
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,425
Please. That's the best part
of flirting on a road trip.

139
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,394
You're not gonna see
any of these gals again.

140

00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:09,963

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,301
Okay, it's time for...

143
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,336
<i>[both] Truth or dare or don't!</i>

144
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:18,340
- I choose don't.
- You always choose don't.

145
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:23,912
- Fine. Uh... truth.
- Do you like someone?

146
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:28,383
<i>[Grenda] Uh-oh.
Someone's blushing.</i>

147
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,452
Okay, maybe just a little.

148
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:32,888
I don't know for sure.
It just started.

149
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,589
<i>Tell us, tell us!</i>

150
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:38,827
Okay. It begins with a "D,"
and ends with an "ipper."

151
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:41,296
- No.
- Yes.

152
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:42,564
[shuddering]

153
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:46,234
Ready, Grenda?
Three, two, one.

154
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:49,071
[both shrieking loudly]

155
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:52,229
Man, coyotes sound a lot
worse than I remember.

156
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:57,395
Candy, Candy, all my life
dreams are coming true right now.

157
00:08:57,397 --> 00:09:01,099
- My brother, my best friend.
- I can't breathe!

158
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:04,135
I'm so excited, I can't breathe!

159
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:08,073
I never really noticed him before,
but he seems deeper lately,

160
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:10,408
less sweaty and more charming.

161
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,310
But how do I approach him?

162
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:17,117
Don't even worry about that, Can-Can.
Mabel's got a plan.

163
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,979
[muffled] Mabel's got a plan.

164
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:25,090
All right, campers, we got another day

165
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:26,558
of breakin' laws and breakin' hearts.

166
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,727
Everything up until now
has been a walk in the park

167
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,395
compared to our next attraction.

168
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,797
Is it a walk in the
world's biggest park?

169
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,035
Sort of. There she is, kids.
Mystery Mountain.

170
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,639
Five times the size
of the Mystery Shack,

171
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,174
and what's worse, she
has real attractions.

172
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:45,076
Oh, I have read about this place.

173
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:48,079
It has sky tram,
and a mummy museum,

174
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:51,750
<i>and sightings of half-human,
half-spider creatures.</i>

175
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:54,753
Even their made-up legends
are better than ours.

176
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:57,489
Today, the mountain falls.

177
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,259
Question: The backseat makes me carsick.

178
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:02,794
Can I sit up front today?

179
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:05,463
Also a question: I'm
the size of two people.

180
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,566
Can I have a whole seat to myself?

181
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:10,841
- I don't know. Sure.
- Ooh, change-up!

182
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:14,606
[grunts] Wait, that means
it'll be just me and...

183
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:18,243
- Candy Chu. Sixth grade.
- Oh! Hey.

184
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:25,083
You're sitting close.

185
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,252
[giggling]

186
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:30,489
So Dipper, I was wondering,
would you maybe want

187
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,725
to walk around the Mystery
Mountain with me today?

188
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,327
Sure. I mean...

189
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,097
- wasn't that already the plan?
- I mean, just us.

190
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:42,221
You and me.
Candy and Dipper.

191
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,842
All right, Road Dawgs, I got five bucks

192
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:55,113
for whoever can tip the big blue ox.
Go, go, go.

193
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:58,516
I will see you in there.
[nervous giggle]

194
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:02,821
- Hey, what's with the mopey mug, kid?
- Stan, you gotta help me.

195
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,656
Everything you taught
me worked too well.

196
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:06,558
I think Candy just
asked me out on a date.

197
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,829
- Hey, look at this little champion.
- What? No. I mean...

198
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:13,164
Candy's great, she's
sweet, and she's smart,

199
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,834
but I never thought of her like that.

200
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:18,169
This is all moving way too fast.

201
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:19,671
[hyperventilating]

202
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:21,840
Okay, I just need to be honest with her,

203
00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:24,476
and tell her I'm not ready for all this.

204
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:27,412
[laughs] Don't you see
what's happening here?

205
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:29,615
That's your dumb obsession
with Wendy gettin'

206
00:11:29,616 --> 00:11:31,816
in the way of your future.
If you wanna move on,

207
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:34,280
you gotta say yes to
whatever comes your way.

208
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,665
Speaking of which...

209
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:42,327
- But I don't wanna lead her on.
- Uh-uh-uh, watch and learn.

210
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,898
Whoa, I seem to have lost my number.
Can I borrow yours?

211
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,336
[laughs] You are a riot.
What brings you here?

212
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:54,506
We don't normally get men this
handsome round these parts.

213
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:57,543
[chuckles] Well,
Darlene, between you and

214
00:11:57,544 --> 00:12:00,578
me, what I'm doin'
here is a little secret.

215
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,815
Oh, you seem like a man with secrets.

216
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:05,316
[both chuckling]

217
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:08,586
- Ugh!
- You know, I'm going on a break.

218
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,690
You wanna take the sky
tram up to Widow's Peak?

219
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:16,194
Take my advice or don't, but
clearly, I know what I'm doing.

220
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:18,263
Oh, fancy.

221
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:29,374
Oh, I can't believe this is happening.
A real date.

222
00:12:29,376 --> 00:12:30,909
I wonder what they'll name the baby.

223
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:35,747
If I had a baby, I would name it
Grenda 2: The Sequel.

224
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:38,483
You would make such a good mother.

225
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:43,238
- This place is so enchanting.
- Sort of confused

226
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,356
by the phrase
"new mummies daily" though.

227
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:46,691
I mean, how does that even work?

228
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,927
This mountain's full of mysteries.

229
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,996
Like why is my head
falling on your shoulder?

230
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:56,367
- Beeoop.
- Uh, yep, this is what I want.

231
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:58,737
This is all part of the plan and stuff.

232
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,940
- Oh, Dipper, hey.
- [gasps] Corn maze girl.

233
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:05,944
- I was wondering when you'd call.
- Dipper, who is this?

234
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,790
Nobody. I mean, uh...
somebody, but...

235
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:12,250
Dipper!
I didn't recognize you right-side up.

236
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,018
You'll never guess
where my mom gave birth.

237
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,822
- Hey, who are these girls?
- Dipper, why haven't you called?

238
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,325
Did our romantic log ride
mean nothing to you?

239
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:23,695
I can't believe it.
You agreed to go on a date with me,

240
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,697
and you are seeing
all these other girls?

241
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,966
Well, answer us.
Which one of us do you like?

242
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,268
I... I like all of you.

243
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,304
I mean, I don't like any of you.
I mean...

244
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,839
I was trying to learn
how to talk to girls.

245
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,341
[nervous chuckle]

246
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,309
- Unbelievable.
- So gross.

247
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:39,778
What a jerk.

248
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,281
Dipper Pines, I thought
you were a nice guy,

249
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:46,174
but I guess you only
care about yourself.

250
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:51,456
Uh, Candy, wait.
[sighs] I messed everything up.

251
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,992
I gotta find Stan.
He'll know what to do.

252
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:58,797
Oh, are you sure you wanna go
this deep into the forest?

253
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,499
- It's so scary.
- Ha. Don't worry, toots.

254
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,002
That spider people stuff
is just an urban legend.

255
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:06,070
I can't believe people fall for it.

256
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,839
You're so brave.

257
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:10,008
What can I say?
I'm a real catch.

258
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,776
Yes.

259
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,678
<i>[distorted voice] The catch of the day.</i>

260
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,734
Uh, I think your contacts fell out.

261
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,517
[Stan screaming]

262
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,587
[panting] Uh, have you
seen an old guy around here?

263
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,756
Big ears, orange nose,
a real know-it-all.

264
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,893
<i>Uh-uh-uh. Flame
retardant raccoon says,</i>

265
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:31,362
<i>don't hug forest fires.</i>

266
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,698
[frustrated groan]

267
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,434
Stan, where are you?
I need your advice.

268
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,870
[static]
Grunkle Stan?

269
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,839
<i>Hey, buddy boy.</i>

270
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:43,007
<i>Remember how we were
talkin' about my technique?</i>

271
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:45,743
<i>Well, sometimes it leads
to unexpected consequences.</i>

272
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:47,679
Yeah, you can say that
again. Where are you?

273
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,547
<i>The good news is,
I've solved the mystery</i>

274
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:50,949
<i>of where Oregon's mummies
come from.</i>

275
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,417
<i>The bad news is,</i>

276
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,452
I'm about to become one.

277
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:57,088
Turns out Darlene is one
of those spider people.

278
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,701
But beyond that, the date's been okay.

279
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,596
Wait, wait, wait.
Darlene's a spider person?

280
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:07,732
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

281
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:09,467
One minute, we're having a perfect date,

282
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,603
and the next minute,
she's growing extra legs

283
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,805
and encasing me in webbing.
Women, right?

284
00:15:13,807 --> 00:15:17,809
- You couldn't tell she was a spider?!
- I was blinded by flattery.

285
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,111
Also this acid she spit in my face.

286
00:15:20,113 --> 00:15:21,813
I'm up the mountain at Widow's Peak.

287
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:24,382
All right, I'm gonna find you. Stay put!

288
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,919
You got it.
[static]

289
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:31,022
Uh-uh. Trying to escape?

290
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:36,728
You tricked me. I'm 80% certain
you don't really love me at all.

291
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,464
Ha! Men will fall for anything.

292
00:15:39,466 --> 00:15:41,633
"You're so funny. Great story.

293
00:15:41,635 --> 00:15:44,569
I love a man with shoulder hair."

294
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:47,605
You... You didn't mean
it about my shoulder hair?

295
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,741
Tell me, Stan, before I transformed,

296
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:52,110
who'd you think was in charge?

297
00:15:52,112 --> 00:15:56,114
You, with your cheesy
lines and fake confidence?

298
00:15:56,116 --> 00:16:00,485
I'm the master pick-up artist here.
Sorry, toots.

299
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:03,187
This time, you're getting
used for your body,

300
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,024
which, to my weird species, is food.

301
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:09,060
Allow me to slip into
something more horrifying.

302
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:14,799
I wonder what beverage pairs well

303
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,502
with a vintage
70-something-year-old man.

304
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:19,137
<i>Be right back.</i>

305
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,840
Come on, Dipper, where are you?

306
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:25,360
I feel like such a fool. I should have

307
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,879
known to guard my
heart in a cage of ice.

308
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:31,816
[loudly] There, there. Let
my calming voice soothe you.

309
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:33,451
It is helping.

310
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,986
Girls, there you are.

311
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:38,022
- Betrayer!
- Oh, you. What do you want?

312
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:41,559
- I need your help.
- With what, some sick jealousy trip?

313
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:43,895
- Yes, sing it, Candy!
- Testify!

314
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:47,565
Look, I'm so sorry about everything,
but Stan's in trouble.

315
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,735
You can totally kill me later,
but right now, he needs us.

316
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,704
I'll explain on the way.

317
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:59,677
[humming]

318
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,046
Please. I don't know if
you're really up there or not,

319
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:05,216
but if you are, please
save me, Paul Bunyan.

320
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:07,051
<i>[Grenda] Mr. Pines!</i>

321
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:08,987
Whoa, did that really work?

322
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,159
Quick, before the rest
of the venom sets in.

323
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:19,664
No! Where are you?

324
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:24,869
The sky tram, everybody on.
I have a plan.

325
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:27,705
- [Mabel] Ha ha, yeah!
- [Grenda] Perfect.

326
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:30,008
Ride like the wind, sky tram!

327
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:34,212
<i>[muzak plays]

00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:36,114
<i>the world's slowest treetop tram ride.</i>

<i>Enjoy the sights

330
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,652

00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,921
Can't this thing go any faster?

332
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>No, it can't.
This is Trambience.</i>

333
00:17:55,734 --> 00:18:00,111
<i>Enjoying the view?
Take a picture. [all screaming]</i>

00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,544
- We're doomed!
- We're all gonna die!

335
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:09,814
Listen carefully.

336
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:12,316
This sky tram has an
emergency drop switch.

337
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:15,319
Below us is Oregon's
largest Paul Bunyan statue.

338
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:19,290
And Old Reliable goes
off in five, four...

339
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:21,325
Candy, wait! Don't pull that lever.
[counting continues]

340
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:24,228
- Kid, are you crazy?
- Now!

341
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,854
Nooo!

342
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:46,317
[grunting]

343
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,719
My only weakness, a giant boot.

344
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:53,667
A giant newspaper or a giant cup
would also have been pretty bad.

345
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,594
<i>Thank you for riding
Trambience sky tram.</i>

346
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>Tell your friends it was
a boring, boring ride.</i>

347
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:02,366
Kid, that was ingenious!
How'd you know that would work?

348
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:05,603
"Useless travel pamphlets."

349
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:07,905
<i>[Darlene] Stanley.</i>

350
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:12,210
I'm sorry. I don't
know what came over me.

351
00:19:12,212 --> 00:19:16,013
- You'll let me out, right?
- What? After all that?

352
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:18,349
Seriously, do I look like an amnesiac?

353
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:22,120
[laughs] You're so funny.

354
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:24,388
Have you ever considered
becoming a comedian?

355
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,694
You know, I actually have.
Comedy is too subtle these days.

356
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:32,230
My style involves
more over-sized props.

357
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:34,398
- Hey, let me get you out...
- [all] No!

358
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,167
Oh, yeah, right.

359
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,337
You win this round,
Stan, but mark my words.

360
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,405
As long as there's
men like you out there,

361
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:43,374
<i>with their dumb one-liners,</i>

362
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:46,077
<i>and pick-up moves, I'll
never run out of prey.</i>

363
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,680
[screams]
Get in the car, get in the car!

364
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,927
[sighs]

365
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:10,101
All right, kid, I gotta admit something.
I'm no expert on women.

366
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,103
Truth is, I've been divorced once,

367
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:13,938
and slapped more times
than I can remember.

368
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,441
Confidence can buy you a lot,
but at the end of the day,

369
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,710
pick-up artists tend to
get our heads bitten off.

370
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:24,689
- When it comes to women, I'm a failure.
- Hey, we're both failures.

371
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,186
You know, even if your
dating tips were bad,

372
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:31,088
I actually haven't thought
about Wendy all day.

373
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,291
Plus, you did teach me
to be more confident.

374
00:20:33,293 --> 00:20:36,488
I guess I just need to learn
to use that power for good.

375
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:43,059
Hey, I found a pamphlet I
don't think you've read yet.

376
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:48,406
It's okay, Dipper.

377
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:51,709
The open road makes
people do crazy things.

378
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:54,478
Plus, after seeing you
flee the spider like a baby,

379
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,250
- I kinda lost interest.
- Yep, yep. I deserve that.

380
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,054
[all cheering]

381
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:06,290
I still feel a little bad
about wrecking those tourist traps.

382
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,192
Ah, come on.
Everyone loves my pranks.

383
00:21:08,194 --> 00:21:10,094
And the best part is,
I never have to face

384
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:12,960
any consequences...
Sweet lord!

385
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,133
Ah, come on!

386
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:22,807
That's what you get.
That's what you get!

387
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,509
[laughing]

388
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:29,814
I don't understand.
I completely don't deserve this.

389
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:31,816
Oh, man, are we gonna
have to help clean this up?

390
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,085
Nah, I'm sure Soos will take care of it.

391
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,153
Where is Soos anyway?

392
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,329
[crows cawing]
[wind blows]

393
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:43,828
<i>Okay, Soos, remember what
your grandma taught you.</i>

394
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,963
<i>When you get lost, stay
exactly where you are,</i>

395
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,745
<i>and don't move.</i>

396
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:55,406
<i>Don't move.</i>

397
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:00,478
[wind blows]
[crows cawing]

398
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,552
<i>You know, I would make
a really good scarecrow.</i>

399
