1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,641
All right, Mabel,
today is the big day.

2
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,675
Big day!

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,345
Soos finally
fixed up the laptop.

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,513
If this thing works,

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,047
we could learn the identity
of the author

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,517
and unravel the greatest
mysteries of Gravity Falls.

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,551
You ready?

8
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,420
Oh, I'm ready, baby.

9
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:23,955
Ma-ma.

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,130
This is it.
This is it.

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,002
( Chuckles )
Ha, ha! It worked!

12
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,406
BOTH: Blip, blap,
bloobity bloop, twins.

13
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,008
( Alarm )

14
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,345
Ugh!
Of course, a password.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,047
Don't you worry, bro bro.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,184
With your brains
and my laser focus,

17
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,287
there is literally nothing
that can distract us from...

18
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,288
( piano music playing )

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,522

I finally understand

26
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,271
Reading.

27
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,073
Give me some of that honey.

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,575
( Kissing )

29
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:23,615
Ba bump.
Ba bump.

00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,016

Thank you.
Thank you.

34
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,495
Just when I was getting
over Mermando,

35
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,797
of course, you show up
at my doorstep.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,166
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about Mermando.

37
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,069
Did not care for Mermando.

38
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:22,274
Okay, this cryptology book says
there's 7.2 million 8-letter words.

39
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,242
I'll type, you read.
Okay, Mabel?

Goodnight.

( Indistinct chatter )

45
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,690
Hey, good job today, you guys.

46
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,492
You were late on your cue.

47
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,493
What?

48
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,161
Hey, hey.
Be good to each other.

49
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,596
We're all stars.

50
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,130
Hey!
Guess who's Mabel?

51
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,186
I am!
Care to learn more?

52
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,569
I bet you do.
You like to learn.

53
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,570
( Chuckles )

54
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,572
( screams )

55
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,248
And I'm up.

56
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,408
Oh, hey, I'm Gabe,
master of puppets.

57
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,509
Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,711
You're amazing
with those puppets.

59
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,147
Really? A lot of people
think puppets are dumb

60
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,082
or just for kids or something.

61
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,319
Are you kidding me?
I'm puppet crazy.

62
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,454
People call me
"puppet crazy Mabel".

63
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,823
Really? People used to call me
"puppet crazy Gabe".

64
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,658
So when's your
next puppet show?

65
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,820
I mean, you can't
really love puppets,

66
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,829
if you're not throwing
puppet shows, right.

67
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,766
Yeah, I mean I'm totally
working on a puppet show.

68
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,602
Oh, what are the details?

69
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:27,572
There are so many details.

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,676
( Sighs )

71
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,722
So, how did it go?

72
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:35,447
Dipper, how hard do
you think it would be

73
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,816
to write and compose
a sock puppet rock opera

74
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,485
and live pyrotechnics
by Friday?

75
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,519
( Beeping )

76
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,321
What?
Mabel, are you serious?

77
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,689
I don't know what happened.

78
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,658
I got lost in his eyes
and his ponytail

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,460
and I'm going to be
so embarrassed on Friday

80
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,128
if I don't have anything.

81
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,896
But what about cracking
this password?

82
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,732
You know, mystery twins?

83
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,635
If you help me with this
for just a couple of days,

84
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,470
I promise I'll help you
with the password.

85
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,405
Please.
Pretty please.

86
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,308
It's for love, Dipper.

87
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,877
All right, okay.

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,746
Yes!
Thank you.

89
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,315
This guy, he's number one!

90
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,383
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

91
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,819
Man, I can't wait to get to
the bottom of this laptop.

92
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,321
We're close
to something big here.

93
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,822
I can feel it.

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,466
Ugh!

95
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,504
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

96
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,840
Come on.

97
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,086
All right, the play
is going to be called

98
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,522
"Glove Story: A Sock Opera".

99
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,824
Just a warning,
people's eyes will get wet,

100
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,660
'cause they'll be crying
from laughing,

101
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,762
from how tragic it is.

102
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,397
Yeah, that...
that sounds great.

103
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,398
( Coughs )

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,934
Come on, Dipper. You just got
to roll with Mabel's craziness.

105
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,736

life worth living.

Don't stay up

Last time you got
this sleep deprived

118
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,463
you tried to eat
your own shirt.

119
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,432
Bleh.

120
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,368

I can't take that sound anymore.

123
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,010
I hate you sound.

124
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,812
There has to be
some shortcut or clue.

125
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,848
Who would know
about secret codes?

126
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,598
I think I know a guy.

127
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,771
Well, well, well, you're
awfully persistent, Pine Tree.

You again!

131
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:21,679
Did you miss me?
Admit it, you missed me.

132
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,381
Hardly.
You worked with Gideon.

133
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,850
You tried to destroy
my uncle's mind.

134
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,853
It was just a job, kid.
No hard feelings.

135
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,756
I've been keeping
an eye on you

136
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,559
since then and I must say,
I'm impressed.

137
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,560
Really?

138
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,861
You deserve a prize.

139
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,997
Here, have a head
that's always screaming.

00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,505
The point is, I like you.

143
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,574
How's about you let me
give you a hint, huh?

144
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,878
I only ask
for a small favor in return.

145
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,713
I'd never do a favor for you.

146
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,749
Don't forget who defeated
you last time.

147
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,851
Right, you defeated me.

148
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,086
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

149
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,323
I'll be here for you
ready to make a deal.

Still ignoring this.

00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,910
Whoa, bag check
for Dipper's eyes.

157
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,745
Ha, ha!
Nobody?

158
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,348
Dipper, I told you to get
some sleep last night.

159
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,483
Here, wake up
with some Mabel juice.

160
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,119
It has plastic dinosaurs in it.

161
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,789
It's like if coffee
and nightmares had a baby.

162
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,892
Last night I had
a dream with Bill in it.

163
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,127
Wait, hold up.
The triangle guy?

164
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,396
He said he'd give me
the code of the laptop

165
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,931
if I gave him something.

166
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,900
Like I'd actually
trust Bill, right?

167
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:49,801
Don't worry, bro.

168
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,770
Today is the day that the mystery
twins are back in action.

169
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,938
I'll help you crack that code.

170
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,808
I just got to hand off my puppet
stuff to my production crew.

171
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,009
Production crew?

172
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,880
We read the script.
Very emotional.

173
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,948
I cried, like, eight times.

174
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,016
GABE: Hey, ladies.

175
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:08,653
Gabe!

176
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,890
Helps me dry out my ponytail
after a shower.

177
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,092
Aah. Aah.

178
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,827
Hoppity boppity.

179
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,069

in foreign language )

180
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,285
It's so great to see you!

181
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:23,001
I was just working on the
world's greatest puppet show.

182
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,469
It has puppets.

183
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,471
Your passion
is so refreshing, Mabel,

184
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,840
unlike the girl from
last night's puppet show.

185
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,876
Single-stitch on one puppet
and cross-stitch on the other?

186
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,412
I was like, uh-huh.

187
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,813
Cross... huh?

188
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,716
Naturally I deleted her off
my cell phone contacts list.

189
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,953
Naturally.
( Nervous giggle )

190
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,554
I know you won't
let me down though.

191
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,856
Based on what you
said the other day,

192
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,557
you must be a puppet expert.

193
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,493
You know, Gabe,
you look pretty sweaty.

194
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,061
You should really
take your shirt off.

195
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,129
Right?

196
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,563
Aren't we all thinking that?

197
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,198
Later, ladies.

198
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:57,635
Bah!

199
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,804
We got to up our game, girls.

200
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,807
Did you hear that thing
he said about the stitches?

201
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,777
Don't worry, Mabel,
your crew can handle it.

202
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,045
( Grunts )

203
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,148
How many eyes does
a face have again?

204
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,651
I got it. I got it. Oh!

205
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:14,953
( Alarm wailing )

206
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,454
I'm not okay.

207
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,457
Ah!
Okay, I'm back on fabrication.

208
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,792
Get me my lint roller.

209
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,251
Hey! You just said you
were going to help me!

210
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:27,032
Dipper, this sock crisis just
bumped up to a code argyle.

211
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,933
The laptop can wait.

212
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,569
Mabel, do you seriously think that
your random crush of the week

213
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,972
is more important than uncovering
the mysteries of this town?

214
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,207
- You're obsessed.
- I'm obsessed?

215
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,071
Look at you. You look like a vampire.
And not the hot kind.

216
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:41,779
But you said you were
gonna help me today.

217
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,949
Well, I can help
you with tickles.

218
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,684
( laughter )

219
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,787
Okay, fine.
You know what?

220
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,689
I'll do it on my own.

221
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,226
Passwords, passwords.

222
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,396
Mabel is useless.

223
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,564
( Yawns )

224
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,832
Oh, man.

225
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,034
- <i>COMPUTER: Too many failed entries.</i>
- Huh?

226
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,837
<i>Initiate data erase
in 5 minutes.</i>

227
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,838
( beeping )

228
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,270
No! No, no, no.

229
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:11,334
I'm gonna lose everything?
I only have one more try?

230
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,113
Well, well, well.

231
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,948
Someone's looking desperate.

232
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,916
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

233
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,084
I can help you, kid.

234
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,886
You just need to hear
out my demands.

235
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,755
Ugh!

236
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,323
What crazy thing do
you want, anyway?

237
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,291
To eat my soul?
To rip out my teeth?

238
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,795
Are you gonna replace my eyes
with baby heads or something?

239
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,898
Yeesh, kid, relax.
All I want is a puppet.

240
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,667
A puppet?
What are you playing at?

241
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,102
Everyone loves puppets.

242
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,071
And it looks to me like
you've got a surplus.

243
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,040
I don't know, man.

244
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,308
Mabel worked
really hard on these.

245
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,944
Seems to me one little puppet
is a small price to pay

246
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,080
to learn all the secrets
of the universe.

247
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,283
Besides, what's your sister
done for you lately?

248
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,119
How many times have you
sacrificed for her, huh?

249
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,022
And when has she ever
returned the favor?

250
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,759
( Beeping )

251
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,629
Tick tock, kid.

252
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,899
Just one puppet?
Fine.

253
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,303
So what puppet are
you gonna pick anyway?

254
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,574
Hmm, let's see.
Eenie meenie mynee...

255
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:17,575
You.

256
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,177
What?

257
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,580
What?
This can't be happening.

258
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,182
What did you do to my body?

259
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,054
Sorry, kid, but
you're my puppet now.

260
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,923
( Evil laughter )

261
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,159
Oh, my gosh.
This can't be happening.

262
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,694
This can't be happening.

263
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,862
Wh-whoa.

264
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,063
( laughing )

265
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:44,035
Man, it's been so long
since I've inhabited a body.

266
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,203
Ooh! Ooh!

267
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,270
( Chuckles )

268
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,039
Pain is hilarious.

269
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,809
And two eyes?
This thing's deluxe.

270
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:55,113
Why are you doing this?
I thought we had a deal.

271
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,949
Look, kid, you've been getting
way too close to figuring out

272
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,183
some major answers.

273
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,286
I've got big plans coming and I
don't need you getting in my way.

274
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,188
Destroying that laptop
was a cinch.

275
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,390
Now I just need to
destroy your journal.

276
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,992
Race you to the bottom
of the stairs.

277
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:19,103
Hey.
Human soda.

278
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,038
I'm gonna drink
it like a person.

279
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:25,843
So where do you keep
that journal anyway?

280
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,212
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

281
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,881
Boy, these arms are durable.

282
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,050
I've hidden it! Somewhere you'll
never find it in a million years.

283
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,720
Hey, Dipper! I borrowed your journal
to use as a prop in the show.

284
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,413
I hope you don't mind.

285
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,922
I'm gonna go before you
process this sentence.

286
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,290
Okay, bye!

287
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,928
Sure, sounds great, sister.
I'll see you at the show.

288
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,429
Wait.
No, Mabel, don't listen to him.

289
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,697
That's not me.

290
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,733
You've got to hear me.

291
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,001
No, no. Wait. Stop!

292
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,105
Ha, welcome
to the mindscape, kid.

293
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,674
Without a vessel to possess,
you're basically a ghost.

294
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,042
Oh, hi, Dipper.
There you are.

295
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,277
What up, dude?

296
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,378
Soos. Wendy.
Help me.

297
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,347
- We're headed to the theater.
- Need a ride, Dipper?

298
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,449
( Chuckles )
BILL: Anything for you, Red.

299
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,951
I'm gonna stop you, Bill.

300
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,020
I'm gonna find that
journal before you do

301
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,454
and I'm gonna stop you!

302
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:15,693
But how can you stop
me if you don't exist?

303
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,261
( Evil laughter )

304
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,436
Bill?
Bill!

305
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,172
Got to get my body back before
he does something crazy with it.

306
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,878
Ah, nothing like
the theater, huh, toots?

307
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,714
Hey, Soos, want to hear the exact
time and date of your death?

308
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,816
( Chuckles )
Okay.

309
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,318
Hey, guys, you all made it.

310
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,288
Are you kidding me? I would
never miss whatever this is.

311
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,958
By the by, Mabel, where'd
you put my journal again?

312
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,227
I used it as a prop
for the big wedding scene.

313
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,962
I still need a reverend though.

314
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,863
Hey, what if I play
the reverend?

315
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,032
I mean, someone's got to
hold that journal, right?

316
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,334
Great. Let's go.

317
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,369
Oh, no, wait.
Mabel!

Look, it's Mabel.

- Hey there.
- Did you say stable?

324
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,869
No, he said Mabel.

325
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,871

I'm Gabe.

334
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,633
So, hey, Grendo,

335
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,935
where's that book prop I'm
using for the wedding scene?

336
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,370
It's up in the wedding cake.

337
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,172
But that doesn't come
down until Act 3.

338
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,041
So hold your horses.

339
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,978
Oh, I'll hold my horses.
I'll hold them.

340
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,279
You monster.

341
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,316
Hey, listen.
Have you seen Mabel?

342
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,984
Hmm.

343
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,152
What did Bill say?

344
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:23,187
I can't be heard
without a vessel?

345
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,889
Where would I find a...

346
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,360
Finally we're together.

347
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:34,031
I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have
to go fight in the war.

I'll wait for you, Gabe.

352
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,942
I'll wait for you.

353
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,113
<i>GRENDA: Our intermission has begun.
Mill about.</i>

354
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,448
( Crowd murmurs )

355
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,184
Ooh!
Okay, you can do this, Mabel.

356
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,519
Only 36 more musical numbers.

357
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,391
Psst.
Mabel.

358
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,896
It's come to life! The puppet
books didn't warn me about this.

359
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,934
Mabel, it's me, Dipper.
You need to help me.

360
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,002
Wait, what?
Dipper?

361
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,906
But you're so much more
of a sock than usual.

362
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,641
Mabel, you have to listen.
Bill tricked me.

363
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,111
He stole my body and now
he's after the journal.

364
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,413
You have to find the journal
before Bill destroys it.

365
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,882
It's the only hope
to get me back in my body.

366
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,650
But my cue's
coming up any minute.

367
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,053
Hey, Mabel,
do you have a moment?

368
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,054
Gabe!

369
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,055
( Giggles )

370
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,090
Ow!
Mabel.

371
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,926
Mabel, it's clear to me now
that you really love puppets.

372
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,361
I mean you went whole hog.

373
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,263
And if you stick
the ending, well,

374
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,399
maybe later you could
join me for a biscotti?

375
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,433
( Gasps )

376
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,236
You drive a biscotti?

377
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,504
I'll be waiting.

378
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:50,007
Did you hear that?
He loves it!

379
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,909
This play has to be flawless.

380
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,677
Can't we wait
until after the show?

381
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,680
Mabel, you want me to be
a sock puppet forever?

382
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,681
( laughing )

383
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,682
I'm sorry.

384
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,985
It looks funny
when you're mad.

385
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,219
( Grunting )

386
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:07,625
Just take over for me until
I get back with the book.

387
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,994
Little puppet face.

388
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,930
Gabe, you're back
from the war.

389
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,000
Yea, I am. Want to kiss and
sing at the same time?

390
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,368
Okay.

391
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,238
Seriously?

392
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:32,249
Come on.
Come on.

393
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,322
I hope this kiss never ends.

394
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,523
( Exhaling )

395
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,699
Come on, come on!

396
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,726
There must be a way to
get Dipper's body back.

397
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,763
Oh-oh, but why would
you want to do that?

398
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,265
( Gaps )

399
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,701
Bill-Dipper!
Bipper.

400
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,969
Shh.

401
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,104
You wouldn't
want to ruin the show.

402
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,272
Whoops.

403
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,307
( Screaming )

404
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,475
It's slipping.

405
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,176
How's about you
hand that book over?

406
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,745
No way. This is Dipper's.
I'd never give it away.

407
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,780
Hmm.

408
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,483
You didn't seem to have a problem
taking it for your own play.

409
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,084
Or ditching him
when he needed you.

410
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,019
So come to your senses.

411
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,654
Give me the book
or your play is ruined.

412
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,523
( Sighs )

413
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,258
There it is.

414
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,026
I mean, who would
sacrifice everything

415
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,162
they've worked for just
for their dumb sibling?

416
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,397
Dipper would.

417
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,398
Eh?

418
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,666
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

419
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,068
I'm giving you away.

420
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,003
You are a woman now.

421
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,172
Waddles, the rings.

422
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:29,273
Wait, what?

423
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,575
Oh, no.

424
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,281
Get out of my brother's body,
you evil triangle!

425
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,283
Whoa!
Children fighting.

426
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,618
I can sell this.

427
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:44,054
Aah!
You can't stop me.

428
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,057
I am a being of pure energy
with no weakness.

429
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,728
True, but you're
in Dipper's body.

430
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,197
And I know all his weaknesses.

431
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,365
What do you mean his--?

432
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,366
Tickle, tickle.

433
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,334
( laughing )

434
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,436
Aah!
Body spasms.

435
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,604
What are these?

436
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,339
A little note
about the human body.

437
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,875
You haven't slept
in over 24 hours.

438
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,343
Also, I got a full night's sleep

439
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,512
and I'm on four
mega shots of Mabel juice.

440
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,580
( Panting )

441
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,348
What is this feeling?

442
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,651
My body is burning.

443
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,153
I can't move
these stupid noodle legs.

444
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,455
Curse you,
useless flesh sticks.

445
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,791
Body shutting down,

446
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,428
must scratch,
mosquito bites.

447
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,069
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Hey!

448
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,073
What?

449
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,074
Yes!

450
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:42,179
I'm in my own body and it's just
as underwhelming as I remember.

451
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,247
( Groans )

452
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,281
Everything hurts.

453
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,749
( Evil laughter )

454
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,788
This isn't the last
you'll hear of me.

455
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,289
Big things are coming.

456
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,757
You can't stop me.

457
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,392
I'm sorry, Gabe.

458
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,371
( Opera music playing )

459
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,490
Don't worry.

460
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,826
I've seen enough movies
to know this is the part

461
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:32,596
where the audience thinks it was
all part of the show and loves it.

462
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,431
Cue applause!

463
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,600
( Crowd booing )

464
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:43,607
Gabe!

465
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,542
Stick around
for the wrap party?

466
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,544
We got mini quiches.

467
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,480
Don't speak to me, Mabel.

468
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,749
You've made a mockery
of my art form.

469
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,217
Let's go, my loves.

470
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,653
( Kissing )

471
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,888
Did he just make out
with his puppets?

472
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,591
I might have dodged
a bullet there.

473
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,833
( Speaking in
foreign language )

474
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,561
Oof!

475
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,497
Mabel,
I'm sorry about all this.

476
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:08,432
It's my fault
your puppets got ruined.

477
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,200
Well, one of them survived.

478
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,169
And she has something
to say to you.

479
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,271
I'm sorry, Dipper.

480
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,675
I spent all week
obsessing over a dumb guy.

481
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,378
But the dumb guy I should
have cared about was you.

482
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,379
Bah!

483
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,214
Mystery twins.

484
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,683
Mystery twins.

485
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,184
Ow!

486
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,852
What did Bill do to my hand?

487
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:29,887
Aah!

488
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,722
Nothing
a little sleep can't fix.

489
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,858
Come on, bro bro,
let's go home.

490
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,660
Seriously, I need to
go to the hospital.

491
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,328
Hey, Dipper.

492
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,699
What did one sock puppet say
to the other sock puppet?

493
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,733
I don't know, Mabel.

494
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,801
What?

495
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,670
You look like
you could use a hand.

496
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,905
( laughing )

497
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,710
That joke
was really something.

498
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,912
Yeah, something terrible.

499
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,580
( laughing )

500
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:58,916
( screaming )
