00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:43,831
[chuckles] Oh, well,
I don't know about...

173
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,901
- Greatness!
- All right, now, everyone go home

174
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,636
and finish getting
ready for the concert.

175
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:52,439
- Hey, don't wait up, Tambers.
- Don't call me Tambers.

176
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:54,842
[laughs]
Classic Tambers.

177
00:08:54,877 --> 00:09:00,681
"Tambry. You. Me. Date.
Bring that sweet, sweet bod.

178
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,881
Your secret admirer."

179
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:10,457
Love is about to happen, Lazy Susan.
Watch and learn.

180
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:16,497
Ugh! Robbie?

181
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:19,600
- You're my secret admirer?
- Tambry? Ugh!

182
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:21,502
This is just what I get
for trusting a toddler.

183
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,604
Listen, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

184
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,774
Dating somebody I already know?
It's kind of like admitting defeat.

185
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:30,377
- Um, way to assume I'm even interested.
- Tambry, let's be real.

186
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:32,479
If I wanted to date you,
I would have done it already.

187
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:33,847
I'm just a little out of your league.

188
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,684
Whoa, is that mustard?
Don't want to waste that bad boy.

189
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,721
Status update.
On blind date with sociopath.

190
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,624
Oh, sure. Bring out the phone.
Classic Tambers.

191
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:46,660
Hey, can I get some chili fries?
To go!

192
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:48,729
What? How is this possible?

193
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:51,432
I'm supposed to be the
best matchmaker ever.

194
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,433
<i>Did you hear that? Did you hear that?</i>

195
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:53,667
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

196
00:09:55,605 --> 00:10:00,407
Whoo-hoo!
Who's ready to fall in love tonight?

197
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:01,575
<i>All: Love God!</i>

198
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:02,643
[all cheering]

199
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:05,813
That's what they call me.

200
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:07,715
We're rewriting history tonight,

201
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,817
and it starts with you and you.

202
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:15,748
Love is real and it's in your face!

203
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,726
[chuckles]
What's your name, you little angel?

204
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:20,494
[chuckles] Meredith.

205
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:22,663
Meredith, Meredith, we got a problem.

206
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:25,633
That cutie right there is your soulmate
and you're living without him.

207
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,535
Oh, no.
What do I do?

208
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,937
Get it, girl.
You know what you love.

209
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:32,482
Pow! Match made!

210
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:33,807
Ha-ha!

211
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,577
I must know how this works!

212
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,714
Hi. Love God?
Mabel here. Big fan.

213
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,717
Can I just say, that was some of the

214
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,685
finest matchmaking I've ever seen?

215
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,588
Can you please, please,
please tell me your secret?

216
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:50,624
Well, between you and
me, let's just say,

217
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,860
my name's not exactly a coincidence.

218
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,597
Oh. My. Love God.

219
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:59,933
- Are you an actual love god?
- Call me a cherub.

220
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,935
The internet pretty much
does my job for me nowadays,

221
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,605
so I've taken some time
to focus on my rock career.

222
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,441
Boom. Cassette.
Boom. For you.

223
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,778
Oh! That's... great.
[clank]

224
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,580
So anyway, can you make
anything fall in love?

225
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,549
Like that snake and that badger?

226
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:17,685
[hissing and growling]

227
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,753
Hmm.
Ah, gee, I don't know.

228
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:21,488
That might be kind of hard to...

229
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,756
Ka-boom! Match made!

230
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:29,797
They're gonna make a snadger.
How you doing that?

231
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:32,433
Love potion, yo. I got it all.

232
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,802
Summer love, young love, anti-love.

233
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:37,805
You just got to put a little
on your fingers and pow!

234
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,607
I need that potion.
How much would it cost?

235
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,576
Um, would you accept
squirrels as payment?

236
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:45,479
Whoa-oh-oh!
No way.

237
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,880
You might think you know
what's best for people,

238
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,800
but this stuff can have
major social consequences.

239
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,720
That's why it can only be
used by a serious expert.

240
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,888
Love God!
Sign my face.

241
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:57,591
Only if you sign mine,
baby. Let's get weird!

242
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,560
[squeaks]

243
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:03,697
Shh.

244
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:08,836
Mind if I add a little
something to these fries?

245
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:10,637
I don't see why not.

246
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:21,489
Whoa! Did your whole thing
suddenly get a lot more likeable?

247
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:25,486
You don't seem as needy as
I used to think you were.

248
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:27,755
Hey, you wouldn't want to
maybe get out of here and,

249
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,657
I don't know, go kiss in public a lot?

250
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,794
For some reason, I do.
Status update.

251
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,464
You know what? Forget it.

252
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,800
Maybe I should stare at something
other than my phone for a while.

253
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:43,637
Match made!

254
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:49,676
All right, who's ready for the best
and most overpriced day of our summer?

255
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:51,478
<i>- Whoo-hoo! Yay!
- All right!</i>

256
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,547
I brought a baggie of trail mix

257
00:12:53,582 --> 00:12:56,517
and safety whistles in
case we get separated.

258
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:58,254
[clears throat] Lee.

259
00:12:58,255 --> 00:12:59,473
[laughter]

260
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:02,790
- This kid is a champion.
- We're just waiting on Tambry.

261
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,658
Can't leave without Tambry.

262
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:08,462
Sorry, guys, but Tambry's
a little busy at the moment.

263
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,630
Wink. Wink.

264
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,498
What does that mean?
Why are you winking?

265
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:14,802
Let's just say she and Robbie
took a trip to smoochville.

266
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,737
Now everyone's happy!

267
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:19,506
Wait. Wait.
Robbie and Tambry?

268
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:21,575
- This can't be happening.
- How's that?

269
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,877
He knew I liked her!
How could he do this?!

270
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:26,713
Whoa, hold it.
You like Tambry?

271
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:28,749
And you told Robbie but not me?

272
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:32,753
- You always make fun of my crushes, man.
- That's what we do, genius.

273
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:35,656
Oh. Oh.
This is so like Tambry to do this.

274
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,725
Date my ex behind my back.
I'm gonna tear her highlights out.

275
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:41,695
Guys! Guys! Calm down.
We're gonna be late for the concert.

276
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,597
Uh, news flash, kid.

277
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,899
I'm not going to the concert.
Not with him.

278
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,634
Hey, that won't be a
problem 'cause I'm out.

279
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,769
Me, too.

280
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:50,804
Wait! Wait!
This group is all I have!

281
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,907
<i>Don't make me go back to
having no friends! Guys!</i>

282
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,591
Match... made?

283
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:01,986
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Not my mailbox!

284
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:03,888
[grunts] Ow!

285
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:06,124
[growls] What did you just do?!

286
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,794
I've let these guys pick on me for years
to keep this group together.

287
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,930
And now they've totally fallen apart.

288
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,065
But we were all starting to
finally hang out together.

289
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,867
I was one of the gang.

290
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:18,002
Well, unless you can break up
Robbie and Tambry immediately,

291
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:20,905
there is no gang.
I have no more friends.

292
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:24,085
And neither do you.
I'm gonna eat this.

293
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:26,244
Mabel, what did I tell you

294
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,913
about staying out of
Robbie's personal life?

295
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,817
I know. I know!
I just wanted to be a good matchmaker.

296
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,086
I never should have gotten
love potion from the Love God.

297
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:36,955
Wait, love potion?

298
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,857
If you did a spell, then
can't you, like, undo it?

299
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,192
[gasps] That's it!

300
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:44,262
If I undo the spell,
then everyone will be friends again.

301
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,231
But I'm gonna need your help.

302
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,933
Also, you are not
pulling off that V-neck.

303
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:51,002
- I know.
- Burn it!

304
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:53,771
<i>Oho! Ha! Ha!</i>

305
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:59,277
Balloon faster, Soos!

306
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,847
We need this thing up in the air
before the festival ends.

307
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:03,982
Are you sure that that
open flame should be

308
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:05,817
that close to that
dangling cloth and rope?

309
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,487
I'm sure about everything.
Now lube up those engine

310
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:11,748
gears with some kerosene.
More kerosene!

311
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:17,161
Unh! Come back, guys!
Come on.

312
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:20,131
The tickets were 100 bucks.
I sold my watch.

313
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,966
You got to come to the concert.

314
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,836
Ew, and have to look at that?
No, thanks.

315
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:29,190
Ugh, they're doing
that couple hug-walk.

316
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:31,943
Guys, you're in public!
People can see you!

317
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,077
Dipper. Come on.

318
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,782
Love God. Sound check for Love God.

319
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,251
Ow!
Let's make some miracles happen.

320
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,787
Groupies, bed-head me.

321
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,022
[chuckles]

322
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:45,857
Love God's about to get crazy.

323
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,025
Whoa. Hey, all right.

324
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,895
Now's our chance.

325
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,831
Here we go. Let's see.

326
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:57,135
Puppy love, inter-species
love, love of country music.

327
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,169
Ew.

328
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,104
Oh! Anti-love.

329
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,173
To reverse the effects of love potion,

330
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,209
simply spray on your victim and
watch their heart die on the inside.

331
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,146
- Sounds good to me.
- Hey!

332
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:10,848
You're the one who's
been stealing my stuff.

333
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:13,583
- I am not loving this.
- I'm sorry.

334
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:15,953
But I made a
mistake and I have to fix it.

335
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:19,123
Kid, I tried to tell you.
This stuff is way too dangerous.

336
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,793
On my oath as a god, I cannot let you...

337
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:22,827
Oh, hey, where did you just go?

338
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:25,163
<i>I'm sorry, Love God!

Aagh!

349

No, no, no, everyone's
touching everything!

350
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:56,110
Give me back the potion!

351
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:58,780
Oh, hey, what's up?
Here, have a cassette.

352
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:04,202
Dang it. Fly, tiny wings.

353
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,037
Get up there. Oh!

354
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,872
I haven't had to use
these in a long time.

355
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:14,145
Dipper. Look.

356
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,880
[camera clicks]

357
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,084
Just one clean shot to
the back of their heads

358
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:21,803
and everything's fixed.

359
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,023
Sorry, kids, but you've
left me no choice.

360
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,092
Visions of heartbreak past!

362
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,065
<i>We like you now.</i>

363
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,235
<i>Yes. Definitely. Absolutely.</i>

364
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,837
Ha! You really think we'd fall for that?

365
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:40,905
[Mabel giggles]

366
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,007
Sure you can all marry me!

367
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:47,078
Oh! Guy from the $10 bill.
I forgot I had a crush on you.

368
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,046
Dang it, Mabel.
They're not real.

369
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:51,758
<i>Just give us the bottle, Mabel.</i>

370
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:53,818
Mabel, don't!

371
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:56,170
It's finally done.
When these idiots see this balloon,

372
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,022
they'll understand that
I love young people.

373
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:02,193
"I heart kids."
All right, let 'er rip.

374
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:05,763
Oh. Oh, no! A letter rip!

375
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,964
What the H?!

376
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,133
[chatter, laughter]

377
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,974
<i>[screaming] I eat kids?
But we're kids!</i>

378
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:20,194
It's heaven's punishment
for our terrible taste in everything!

379
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:28,986
Mommy, is the floating
head going to eat us?

380
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:31,088
Yes, Charlie!
Yes, he will.

381
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:37,795
Mabel, it's a trick!
Don't give him the...

382
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:38,930
Gotcha!

383
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,867
Oh! Curse my oversized heart.

384
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,937
Sorry, kids, but that's what happens
when you mess with a god.

385
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:47,939
Only a greater being from
the heavens themselves

386
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:50,808
could possibly stop...
[people screaming]

387

<i>It's coming down!</i>

388
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,213
Whoooooa!

389
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh, no.
I hope someone didn't die.

390
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:06,824
Yes, that would be awful.
[both laughing]

391
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,025
What's everybody crying about?

392
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,695
In my day, Zeppelins fell
from the sky like raindrops.

393
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:13,965
It's him!
The horrible old man from the sky!

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,867
[people shrieking]

395
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:21,205
You know what?
Being loved by the youth is overrated.

396
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,841
Being feared? Now that's priceless.

397
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,110
Love God, are you okay?

398
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:27,945
Please be immortal.
Please be immortal.

399
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,947
[gasps]

400
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,850
Dude. I am so over this!

Aagh!
Look, kid, take it, okay?

403
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:39,790
Spray everyone for all I care.

404
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:42,193
You want to mess with people's lives?
You want to play god?

405
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:43,961
Do it. 'Cause I'm sick of it.

406
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:47,899
Medic, I need... I need onion rings!

[band playing]

408
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,836
Okay, Mabel, now's our chance.

409
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,804
They break up and the whole
friend group gets back together.

410
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:01,979
Mabel!
Mabel, I just wanted to thank you.

411
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:04,782
I've been so miserable
since Wendy broke up with me

412
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,183
that I thought my life was over.

413
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:09,787
But you were right.
I just needed to move on.

414
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,158
I'm... happy?
Weird, huh?

415
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:17,494
<i>Tambry: Robbie, people are
commenting on our pictures.</i>

416
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,934
Dipper, maybe we shouldn't do this.

417
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:25,970
I mean, every time we've
played with people's fates,

418
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,105
it's only made things worse.

419
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:32,910
They are kind of perfect for each other,
in a gross kind of way.

420
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,845
But what about our friend group?

421
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,983
Well, maybe it'll sort itself
out. I mean, there's got

422
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:41,085
to be something that could
bring everyone back together.

423
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,436
Guys, I made a friendship cake.

424
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:46,819
So let's all get over this, okay?
Ugh!

425
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:48,258
My cake!

426
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,263
Hey! Food from the outside!

427
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:53,831
Ohhhh!

Yeah, fight the machine, Thompson!

432
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,209
- Throw snacks at 'em.
- Use jerky as a weapon.

433
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:06,861
