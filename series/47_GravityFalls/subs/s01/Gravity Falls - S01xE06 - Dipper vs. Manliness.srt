00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,539
Man: I like to get
my Christmas shopping
done early.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,212
Do you have anything
that's in the spirit
of the season?

3
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:14,284
Uh, how about these crystals?

4
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,746
Ha ha! Looks like
broken glass.

5
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:18,118
What are you, a cop?

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,620
Oh! what is
that new thing?

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:23,293
Grunkle Stan.
Can we go to the diner?

8
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:25,595
We're huuungry.

9
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:27,327

Aaah! aaah!
Aaah! Aaah!

12
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,164
Yeah, sure. Soon as
this yahoo makes up his mind.

13
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,606
You have this
in another animal?

14
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm fine locking him inside
if you are.

15
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:44,474
Puma shirt, panther shirt.

16
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,746
Puma shirt, panther shirt.

17
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,619
Puma shirt...

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,121
Panther shirt.

19
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,754

21
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,370
Shoo!

22
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,273
Git!

23
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:44,504
Coffee! coffee!

24
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,406
Coffee! coffee!

25
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,139
Go! go! Go! Go!

26
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,213
Whoo-hoo!

27
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:58,248
( Plates breaking )
lazy Susan! There's my little
ray of sunshine!

28
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,689
Where were you yesterday?

29
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,491
I got hit by a bus!

30
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:03,753
Ha ha ha ha!
Hilarious!

31
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:05,255
Thank you.

32
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:06,526
Ha ha ha! Ha!

33
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,528
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

34
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,200
You do split plates, right?

35
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,332
Maybe.

36
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,204
Wink.

37
00:02:14,205 --> 00:02:16,906
Great! we'll all split
one-fourth of the number seven,

38
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:18,768
plus a free salad dressing
for the lady

39
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,510
and a small plate of ketchup
for the boy.

40
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:23,213
But grunkle Stan,
i want pancakes.

41
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:25,345
With the fancy flour
they use these days?

42
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,417
What am I,
made of money?

43
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,380
Tap tap.
Ohh!

44
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,286
Don't worry, guys.
Pancakes are on me.

45
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,888
I'm gonna win some by beating
that manliness tester.

46
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,731
Manliness tester?
Beating?

47
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:44,334
( Both laugh hysterically )

48
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,236
He says... he says he's...

49
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:48,338
( Laughter )

50
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:49,869
What? what's so funny?

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,745
No offense, Dipper,
but you're not exactly
manly mannington.

52
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:59,178
Hey! I am too manly... Manny,

53
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,780
or whatever it is you said.

54
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,512
Look, face the music, kid.

55
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:05,385
You got no muscles,
you smell like baby wipes,

56
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:08,488
and let's not forget
last Tuesday's... incident.

57
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,420

00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:16,366
don't come in!
Don't come in!

61
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:19,969
You were listening
to girly Icelandic
pop sensation babba?

62
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,902
(Weak laughter) No, I wasn't.
It's not important!

63
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,405
Look, come on, guys,
I'm plenty masculine!

64
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,237
You see this chest hair?

65
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,280
Put it away! Put it away!
So smooth! My eyes!

66
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,511
Oh, man.

67
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:34,344
( Hysterical laughter )

68
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,286
Fine, family of little faith.

69
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:38,318
Get ready to eat your words...

70
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,591
And a plate
of delicious pancakes.

71
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:47,527
All right, Dipper.

72
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,701
Time to manhandle this...
Man handle.

73
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:57,236
And a-one, and a-two...

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,468
Quit stallin'!

75
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:00,441

( Baby cooing )

78
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:16,356
Oh, what?!
This thing must be broken.

79
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,389
It's totally broken, guys.
It's like a million years old.

80
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,892
Probably ran out of steam power
or...

81
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,966
It's rickety, man.
You shouldn't even...

82
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,972
Yes! pancakes for everyone!

83
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,805
( Diners all cheer )

84
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,678
( Both laughing )

85
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,281
I need to get
some chest hair,
and fast.

86
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,314
I'm fine! Heh heh.

87
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,785
Everything's fine.

88
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,758
Sheesh! how am i
related to that?

89
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,360
Come on, grunkle Stan.

90
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:53,523
I'm sure deep down
you have a soft side too.

91
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:57,367
Ha! nothing in here
but a cold, dark,
empty soul.

92
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,528
Food!

93
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:59,929
Thanks there, sugar pie.

94
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,071
I mean, honey wasp kitten baby.

95
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:03,403
Ba-baby cow...

96
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,375
Ha ha! Silly!

97
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,477
Silly man.
What was that about?

98
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:09,379
Nothing. I, uh, don't
want to talk about it.

99
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,411
Talk about what?
Why is this table wet?

100
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:12,742
Wait just a second.

101
00:05:12,743 --> 00:05:15,545
I think I have
an idea happening here.

102
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:18,047
You... and her...
No! Stop it!

103
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:19,819
Aaah!
oh, boy.

104
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,051
You have a thing
for lazy Susan!

105
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,093
You do have
a soft side!

106
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:25,995
But k-k-keep it down,
will ya?

107
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:29,399
I admit it, okay?
It would be nice
if she liked me.

108
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,432
But I've been out of the game
for so long I wouldn't know
where to start.

109
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,564
I mean, look at her.
She's so classy.

110
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,336
Spin, ya dumb pie! Spin!

111
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,838
Grunkle Stan,

112
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,341
you are a cranky, gross,
weird old man.

113
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,444
But we will get lazy Susan
to like you,

114
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,716
because nothing is stronger
than the power of...

115
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:49,379
Love?
Mabel.

116
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,851
To victory!

117
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,355
Not manly enough.

118
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,858
Stupid diner!
Stupid lumberjack!

119
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,660
No! ( coughing )

120
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,132
Another hydrant destroyed.

121
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,964
It's a gosh-dang mystery!

122
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,437
Wanna take off our uniforms
and run around in circles?

123
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:09,439
Quit readin' my mind.

124
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,002
( Laughing, whooping )

125
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:17,046
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
looking for the mailman.

126
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,749
Oh. what? Are you saying
I'm not a male man?

127
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,850
Is that what
you're trying to say?

128
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,582
I'm not male?
I'm not a man?

129
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,614
Is that what
you're getting at?

130
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:26,556
Are you crying?

131
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,058

Three...

134
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:36,596
Four...

135
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,828
Uhh! ( panting )

136
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,771
No chest hair yet.

137
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:45,035
Is it physical?
Is it mental?
What's the secret?

138
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,510
You said it, brother.
I need help.

139
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,442

Wait. sorry.

Please don't eat me!
I haven't showered
in like a week!

151
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,133
And I'm...
I'm like all elbows!
Elbows and gristle!

Gonna finish that?

No.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,902
I can't believe it.
Part animal, part human.

156
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,504
Are you some kind of minotaur?

157
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,045
I'm a manotaur!

158
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:58,477
Half man, half, uh...

00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,849
Half taur!

160
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,151
So did I, like,
summon you, or...

161

The smell of jerky
summoned me!

I got problems, manotaur.
Man-related problems.

169
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,639
Well, my own uncle
called me a wimp,

170
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,510

you seem pretty manly.

give me some pointers?

Hmm. very well.

Dude, watch out!

181
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:57,938
( Roaring )
( Screaming )

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Whoa.

183
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,744
( Grunting )

184
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,747
This place is amazing!

185
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,049
The gnomes live
in the trees,

186
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,122
the mer-people
live in the water...
'Cause they're losers!

187
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:17,056
But we manotaurs
crash in the man cave!

188
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,287
( Gong resounds )

189
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:21,190
Beasts! I have brought you...

190
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:24,233
A hairless child!

191
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,165
'Sup?
all: huh?

192
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,599
This is, uh, pubitaur,
testosteraur, pituitaur,

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,240
and I'm chutzpaur.

194
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,903
And you are...
My name's Dipper.

195
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:36,105
( Booing, groaning )
weak!

196
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,708
The, uh, destructor?

197
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,180
Yeah, that's better.
An improvement, yeah.

198
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,782
( Gong resounds )

199
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,214
Dipper the destructor
wants us to teach him

200
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,256
the secrets to our manliness!

201
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:50,720
I need your help.
Look at this, guys...
Look at this!

202
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:53,963
I must confer with
the high council.

203
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,965
So, teach him our man secrets,
or what?

204
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:58,267
He's a human.
I don't like him.

205
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:01,100
I don't like your face!

206
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,103
( All roaring )

207
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,106
I like these guys.
Aaah!

208
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:11,210
Okay, grunkle Stan.

209
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:15,044
Welcome to the first day
of whatever is left
of your life!

210
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:16,786
First a "before" picture.

211
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,148
Aaah!

212
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,821
I never miss
a scrapbook-ortunity.

213
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,023
В™є deedley-dum, mem-ories в™є

214
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,154
bleet!

215
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,896
Let's start out
with some role-playing.

216
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:28,357
Soos will play
lazy Susan.

217
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm soft like a woman.

218
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,062
Grunkle Stan, show me
how you approach a woman.

219
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:36,305
Remember this is a safe,
non-judgmental environment.

220
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:39,770
I'll just be right off
to the side judging you
on a scale from one to ten.

221
00:10:43,914 --> 00:10:47,176
( Spits )
can I borrow some money?
( Whistle blows )

222
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,378
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

223
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,150
Head manotaur:
After a lot of punching,

224
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,284
we have decided to deny
your request to learn
our manly secrets.

225
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:57,056
Denied!

226
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,058
Denied!

227
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,931
Okay, fine.
That's okay with me.

228
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:04,393
Obviously you guys think
it would be too hard
to train me.

229
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,296
Maybe you're not man enough
to try.

230
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:08,667
All: huh?!!!

231
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,199
Not man enough?!

232
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,101
Destructor...

233
00:11:12,102 --> 00:11:13,873
Not man enough?!!!

234
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,174
He didn't mean it.

235
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,377
I have three y chromosomes,
six Adam's apples,

236
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:22,281
pecs on my abs,
and fists for nipples!

237
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,755
Seems to me you're scared
to teach me how to be a man.

238
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:29,188
Hey, do you guys hear that?
It sounds like...(Clucking)...

239
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,260
Oh, that's weird.
( Clucking )

240
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:35,094
Is that... that sounds like...
Yeah, a bunch of chickens!

241
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,225
( All gasp )

242
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:37,296
( Muttering )

243
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,798
I feel all weird.

244
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,731
He's using some
sort of brain magic!

245
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,273
After a second round
of deliberation,

246
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:47,276
we have decided to help you
become a man!

247
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:49,408
All:
man! man! Man! Man!

248
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,940
Great! thanks, guys.

249
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,212
Whatever it is,
i will not let you down.

250
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,284
( Eagle screeches )

251
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:58,387
Being a man is about
conquering your fears.

252
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,219
For your first man task,

253
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,054
you must plunge your fist
into the pain hole!

254
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:06,356
( All gasp )
the what?

255
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:10,029
Pain hole, schmain ho...

256
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,801
Whaaaa!
aaaaaah!

257
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,163
Aaaahhh!!!!

258
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,038
Are you sure this is
really necessary?

259
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,910
You wanna be a man, don't you?

260
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,744
All:
man! man! Man!
Man! Man! Man!

261
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:29,348
( Dipper screaming )

262
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:34,053
All right. Let's try to get that
inner beauty on the outside.

263
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,354
Smile harder.

264
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,326
( Grunts )

265
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:38,387
Harder!

266
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:39,488
Perfect.

267
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,530
Soos!
what's up, hambone?

268
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,193
What do you think?

269
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:47,166
Aaaaaah!

270
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,470
Ohh. this is going to take some
really great training music.

271
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,306
В™є when the tiger roars в™є

272
00:12:57,307 --> 00:13:00,479
в™є and the mountain cries в™є

273
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,882

в™є you gotta go the miles в™є

276
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,860
в™є you gotta face the trials в™є

277
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:12,321
в™є never lose sight

278
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:14,964
в™є you got believe

279
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:17,196

280
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,328
в™є teach your uncle

281
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,570
в™є now you're gonna jump

282
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:24,904
в™є keep on shavin'

283
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,807
в™є I don't really know what

284
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,914
в™є your heart's on fire and
the fire is in your heart в™єв™є

285
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,515
aaah!

286
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,218
Who wants to rub this
on my back?

287
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,421
Guys, I just want to say that
these last few hours have been...

288
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,924
I feel like there's
really been some growth.

289
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,926
I have a growth!

290
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,159
Glark, you are hilarious today!

291
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,262
It's just you guys
took me under your wing

292
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,604
and have just been
so supportive.
Oh, stop.

293
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,466
No, you know what?
You really have been.

294
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,568
I feel like I'm finally
becoming a man here.

295
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:01,440
Not yet, destructor.

296
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,342
One final task remains.

297
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,344
( Towel snaps )
hey, quit it!
You quit it!

298
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,516
The deadliest trial of all.

299
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,548
I've survived
forty-nine other trials.

300
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,450
Whatever it is,
bring it on!

301
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,582
Yeah!
yeah!
yeah!

302
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,935
Behold our leader...
Leaderaur!

303
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:28,137
В™є rum-ta-tum-tum
tum-ta-tum в™є

304
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,469
is he the oldest
or wisest or...?

305
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,371
Greetings, young...

306
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,973
Aaaah!

307
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:37,276
Nah, he's just the offering.
That is leaderaur.

308
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,309
( Old manotaur screams )

309
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:45,915
You! you wish to be man?

310
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,257
Arrrr!

311
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:49,389
Yeah!
yeah!
yeah!

312
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,161
Then you must do heroic act.

313
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:54,994
Go to highest mountain...

314
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,097
Aaaaah!

315
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,100
And bring back head of...

316
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,432
The multi-bear.

317
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:05,434
Ohh!
ooh!

318
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:08,507
The multi-bear?
That some sort of bear?

319
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,179
He's our sworn enemy.

320
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,583
Conquer him and your
mansformation will be complete.

321
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:17,086
Conquer? I don't know, man.

322
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:20,019
Destructor!
is this yours?

323
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,351
Uh, no. Ha ha! I...
I don't know whose that is.

324
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,493
I was just borrowing it.
It's a friend's. Not mine.

325
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:27,456
( Dubious growling )
i don't know about this.

326
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:28,528
Uh...

327
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,701
( Grunts )

328
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:35,704
I shall conquer the multi-bear!

329
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:37,706
( All cheering )

330
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,468
Aah! aah!

331
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:40,670
I'm okay.

332
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:46,216
( Heroic music playing )

333
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,529
( Thunder crashes )

334
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:09,969
( Thunder crashes )

335
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,610
I'm comin' for you,
multi-bear.

336
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,612
Okay, grunkle Stan.

337
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,514
You started like this,

338
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:28,087
but you became...

339
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,189
Can I scratch myself now?

340
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,721
No! no, no, no!

341
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:34,623
Is that throw-up on your shirt?

342
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,726
I don't know
how to answer that.
Ohh!

343
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,069
Face it, Mabel,
your uncle's unfixable.

344
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,632
Like that spinning
pie trolley thing
in the diner.

345
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:46,135
Grunkle Stan,
come with me!

346
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:48,006
And leave your pants at home.

347
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,739
With pleasure!

348
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:59,688
What is a multi-bear?

349
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:01,720
( Growling )

350
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,552
Oh, that's a multi-bear.

351
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,454
( Roaring )

352
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:07,796
Bear heads...
Silence!

353
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,698
( Whimpers )

354
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,631
Child, why have you come here?

355
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,204
Multi-bear,
i seek your head!

356
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:18,137
Er, one of them, anyway.
There's like, what, six?
Six heads?

357
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,541
This if foolish!
Leave now or die!

358
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:24,413
So be it.

359
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:26,816
( All roaring )

360
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:33,823
( Puny roar )

361
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,730
Hahh!

362
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:48,798
( Panicked roar )

363
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,246
A real man shows no mercy!

364
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,078
Ohh. very well, warrior.

365
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,852
But will you Grant
a magical beast
one last request?

366
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:05,554
Uh, okay.

367
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:09,259
I wish to die listening
to my favorite song.

368
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:13,562
Tape is already in there.
You can just hit any...

369
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,724
Yeah, yeah, that's it

370
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:16,796
( babba playing )

371
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,800
You listen to Icelandic
pop group babba?

372
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,472
I-i love babba.

373
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:25,704
I thought I was the only one.

374
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,536
All the manotaurs make fun of me

375
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,839
because I know all the words
to the song disco girl.

376
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,682
Oh, you mean...
В™є disco girl в™є

377
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:35,714
в™є coming through в™є

378
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,886
в™є that girl is you в™є
в™є that girl is you в™є

379
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,789
в™є ooh ooh, ooh ooh в™є
в™є ooh ooh, ooh ooh в™є

380
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,821
ha ha ha!
This is crazy!

381
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,555
Finally, someone who...
Who understands that...

382
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:50,199
Oh, yeah. I guess
I'm supposed to kill you
or I'll never be a man.

383
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,760
I accept my fate.

384
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,802
No! really?

385
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,165
It's for the best.

386
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,137
( Grunts )

387
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,810
( All gasp )
I'm not gonna do it!

388
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:05,714
You were told
the price of manhood
is the multi-bear's head!

389
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:06,875
Listen, leaderaur, all right?

390
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:08,777
You too, testosteraur,
pituitaur,

391
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:11,250
and... I don't know,
whatever your name is.

392
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,881
Beardy?
it's beardy.

393
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:16,325
You keep telling me
that being a man means
doing all these tasks

394
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:18,187
and being aggro all the time,

395
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:20,759
but I'm starting to think
that stuff's malarkey.

396
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,431
( All gasping )

397
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:23,862
You heard me. Malarkey!

398
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:26,865
So maybe I don't have muscles
or hair in certain places,

399
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,498
and sure, when a girly pop song
comes on the radio,

400
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,670
sometimes I leave it on,
'cause dang it,

401
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,543
top 40 hits are in the top 40
for a reason,

402
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:36,375
they're catchy!
Destructor!

403
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,876
What are you saying?

404
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,209
I'm saying the multi-bear
is a really nice guy.

405
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,711
And you're a bunch of jerks if
you want me to cut off his head!

406
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,853
( Roaring )

407
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:45,854
( Gasping )

408
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:49,758
Kill the multi-bear,
or never be a man!

409
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,561
Then I guess
I'll never be a man.

410
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,823
Boo!
weak!

411
00:19:54,824 --> 00:19:58,767
( All booing )

412
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:02,371
Hey, guys! Who wants
to go build something
and knock it down?

413
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,474
( All roaring )
man! Man! Man! Man!

414
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:08,278
Man! man! Man!
Man! Man...

415
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,712
Spin! spin!

416
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,745
Lazy Susan, listen.

417
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,287
I know he's not
much to look at,

418
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:19,988
but you're always
fixing stuff in the diner,

419
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,720
and if you like fixing stuff,

420
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,393
nothing could use more fixing
than my grunkle Stan.

421
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,425
Also, women live
longer than men,

422
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,427
so your dating pool is smaller
and you should really
lower your standards.

423
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,531
So, lazy Susan,
whaddya say?

424
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,835
Arggh.

425
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:37,966
Hey!

426
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,838
Here's my number.

427
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,611
Why don't you give me
a call sometime?

428
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:44,643
Really?
really!

429
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:45,774
Ha ha!

430
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:47,876
Also, here's some pie.

431
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:50,979
On the house...
For you!

432
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,452
( Squeals )
we did it!

433
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,884
When are you gonna call?
You want to call now?

434
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,026
I don't have a phone.
Let's buy a phone!

435
00:20:58,027 --> 00:21:00,589
We can put it on a credit card!
Let's get a credit card.

436
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,932
Mabel! let a man
enjoy his pie, huh?

437
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,035
Dipper!
it's me, Mabel!

438
00:21:07,036 --> 00:21:09,267
I'm looking at you
through the glass!

439
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,899
Right here!
This is my voice!

440
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,902
I'm talking to you
from inside!

441
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:16,305
Didja see me
through the...
Yes.

442
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:17,706
What's wrong?

443
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,548
I don't want to
talk about it.
Good.

444
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,951
It's just these half-man,
half-bull humanoids
were hanging out with me...

445
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:24,953
Here we go.
But then they wanted me

446
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:26,915
to do this really tough,
horrible thing,

447
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,388
but it just wasn't right,
so I said no.

448
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,920
You were your own man
and you stood up for yourself.

449
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:35,293
Huh?
you did what was right even
though no one agreed with you.

450
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,897
Sounds pretty manly to me,
but what do I know?

451
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,970
Wait a minute!
Do my eyes deceive me?

452
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,972
You have a chest hair!

453
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:46,635
(Gasps) you're right! I do!

454
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:49,578
Ha ha! This is amazing,
i really do!

455
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:52,481
Take that, man tester!
Take that, pituitaur!

456
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,084
Pituitaur?
this guy has chest hair!

457
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,318
Scrapbook-ortunity!

458
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,821
Don't worry, kid.
If you're anything like me,

459
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,953
there's more where
that came from.

460
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,895
Ohh, gross!

461
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,998
( All laughing )

462
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:12,000
Seriously,
that's disgusting.

463
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,331
( Telephone ringing )

464
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,464
Oh, not again!

465
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,966
Answering machine:
Message number thirty-six.

466
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,738
Lazy Susan:
Hey, handsome!

467
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,511
It's me, lazy Susan,
calling to say hi!

468
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:26,575
Hi! my cats also
wanted to say hi.

469
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:28,547
Say hi, Donald.

470
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,949
Cat: meow.
Good. Sandy, you say hi.

471
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,652
Cat 2: Meow.
Mr. cat face,
now it's your turn to...

472
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,754
Cat 3: (Screeches )
Mr. cat face!

473
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,587
Anyway, call me!
Call me back! (Beep)

474
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:40,490
How do I get out of this?!
