<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:28,848
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

7
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:36,188
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

8
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:40,395

back to the past.</i>

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,094

00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,167
I know.

20
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,398
I know.

21
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,758
Get on with it,
ya blasted bag of bloated ...

22
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:02,932
- Dad, we can't hear. He's on.
- Ooh, sorry.

23
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,433
<i>Long ago in a distant land,</i>

<i>I, Aku, the shapeshifting
master of darkness,</i>

25
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,772
<i>unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,594
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>

27
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,409
<i>wielding a magic sword</i>

28
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,518
<i>stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

29
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,839
<i>Before the final blow was struck,</i>

30
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:31,222
<i> I tore open a portal in time</i>

31
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,593

32
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,958
<i>where my evil is law.</i>

33
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,476
<i>Now the fool seeks
to return to the past</i>

34
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:45,901
<i>and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

35
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,769
Not!

36
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:54,049
Because,
after all these years,

37
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:58,593
I have captured Samurai Jack

38
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:01,621
and the sword!

39
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,228
<i>No!</i>

40
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:12,003
<i>Samurai.</i>

41
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,232
Jack.

42
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:16,238
Oh, no.

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,570
Friend.

44
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,516
Oh, dear.

45
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:29,656
To all those fools
who dare oppose me,

46
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,683
your hero is dead!

47
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,818
Your hope is dead!

48
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:36,678
I am the one true master!

49
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,536
Let this be a lesson to all!

50
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:43,760
Time to die, Samurai Jack!

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,944
Huh. You know,
after all these years,

52
00:04:56,947 --> 00:05:01,287
I'm not really sure
how I want to do it.

53
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,855
Ashi.
Fight, Ashi, fight.

54
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,720
I know you're still in there.

55
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,326
Ashi...

56
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,689
Ashi.

57
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:19,313
Please... Ashi, fight.

58
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:40,589
Wait a second.
This is the one.

59
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:45,596
Or is it too much?
Perhaps a little less?

60
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:48,836
Madness!

61
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,737
Yeeeees.

62
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,742
Daughter, will you
do your father a favor

63
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:04,244
and kill the samurai?

64
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,448
No, Ashi, no.

65
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:23,962
Yes, the simplest solution
is usually the best one.

66
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,477
Ashi, you can't
let it end this way.

67
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:30,319
Please, Ashi, fight!
Fight!

68
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:41,052
Huh?

69
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,064
What the...?!

70
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,969
We're here, Jack!
We're here to rescue you!

71
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,675
Pathetic fools!

72
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:09,678
Urgh!

73
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,252
Ha!

74
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,458
Flying monkeys?

75
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,920
No, jump good.

76
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,131
Now, who's this?

77
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:33,833
The three hundred fight
for the one.

78
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:11,074
You're nothing but
insignificant insects to Aku.

79
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:14,914
And insects get squashed...

80
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,751
and exterminated!

81
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,476
Hold the line!
Hold the line!

82
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,629
Oh, dear!

83
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,657
Huh?

84
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:10,959
- No, wait!
- Jackie boy!

85
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:14,194
<i>Right.
Keep forgetting about that.</i>

86
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,763
You ... you're dead?

87
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:19,330
<i>Aye, just a wee bit.</i>

88
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,218
Then how...?

89
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,101
<i>Celtic magic!</i>

90
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:26,176
<i>Oi! Ya gotta meet
me bonnie daughters!</i>

91
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:29,316
<i>There's Flora, Maeve,
Isla, Bradana,</i>

92
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,012
<i>Murdina, Alana,
Oban, Ardbey,</i>

93
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,215
<i>Fionna, Assie,
Bonnie, Lorna,</i>

94
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:38,827
<i>Mawina, Shona, Nora, Piesil,
Shanath, Euspeth, Edme, Freya,</i>

95
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:42,852
<i>Gilbartha, Gesha, Grizela,
Innes, Dawntha, Cora,</i>

96
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,990
- Davina, Kina...
- So many.

97
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:50,717
<i>Aye, me pride and joy.
Now, take your pick.</i>

98
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:53,034
<i>I'd be mighty proud.</i>

99
00:10:53,036 --> 00:10:56,034
- I cannot.
- Wha?!

100
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,369
<i>You're suddenly too good
for me girls?!</i>

101
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:03,580
Oh, no, no.
I-I met someone.

102
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,310
Who?

103
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:08,100
Her.

104
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:14,044
<i>I don't think she's your type, laddie.</i>

105
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,931
<i>We've commandeered this samurai</i>

106
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,105
<i>to save you, samurai.</i>

107
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:35,113
A giant stone samurai?
Really?

108
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,108
<i>Now, you don't see that
very often.</i>

109
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,008
<i>Jack?</i>

110
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,756
Ashi!

111
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:06,271
Enooooooough!

112
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:48,854
Oh, dear.

113
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,846
Shields!

114
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:52,954
Dad!

115
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,557
<i>No one harms me bonnie girls!</i>

116
00:12:55,592 --> 00:13:01,032
<i>Fear the call of
the phantom pipes of Lagavulin!</i>

117
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:17,113
Ashi.

118
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:18,246
Ashi!

119
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,611
<i>Jack?</i>

120
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:22,516
Yes, I'm with you,
but you must fight, Ashi.

121
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,381
- Fight it!
- I... I can't.

122
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,042
- I...
- Ashi, you must!

123
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:30,825
Ashi!
Ashi!

124
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,120
Ashi!

125
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,528
I love you!

126
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:05,827
- Is he dead?
- No.

127
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,362
And he never will be.

128
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,663
How dare you talk back
to your father?

129
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,037
No.
You're not my father.

130
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:16,077
- Yes, I am!
- No, you're not!

131
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,772
Raaaah!

132
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,082
Huh?

133
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:36,554
Whaaaa?

134
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,935
- Ashi, you have Aku's powers.
- I do!

135
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,927
Oh, no.

136
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:43,825
You might have
beaten me now,

137
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,330
but I will destroy you
in the future.

138
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:51,001
There is no future
for you, Aku.

139
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:54,000
I disagree.

140
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,747
What trickery is this?

141
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,946
<i> Aku!</i>

142
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,048
Do not worry, samurai.

143
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,381
You will see me again,

144
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:15,196
but next time,
you will not be so fortunate.

145
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:16,551
What?

146
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:21,058
Huh?!
You're back already!

147
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,520
Yaaagh!

148
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:25,961
No, wait...

149
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,750
Yaaaaaaaaagh!

150
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,949
No more!

151
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,276
It is done.

152
00:17:41,377 --> 00:17:42,577
Ashi?!

153
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:49,109
I'm okay.
I felt him leave me.

154
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,748
He will never hurt anyone
ever again.

155
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:57,241
Ashi!

156
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,219
- Jack.
- What's wrong?

157
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,750
Without Aku...

158
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:12,664
- I would have never existed.
- No...

159
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,232
Ashi.
