1
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:04,603
50 years have passed,

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:09,708
<i>but I do not age.</i>

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:15,647
<i>Time has lost its effect on me.</i>

4
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,288
<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,559
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

6
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,196
<i>present, and future.</i>

7
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,133
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

8
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:39,304
<i>Gotta get back,
back to the past.</i>

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,440
<i>Samurai Jack.</i>

11
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:33,492
<i>Master, new arrivals
have come to offer tribute!</i>

12
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,732
Oh, great Shogun of Sorrow,

13
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,568
Master of All Masters,

14
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:46,771
you have allowed us
to inhabit this world,

15
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,774
and for that, we are forever grateful.

16
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,313
- We offer you a special tribute.
- Stop!

17
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,782
Look at what you're doing!

18
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:01,586
You're getting yourselves
all over the floor.

19
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:05,824
- Uh...
- I just had it vacuumed.

20
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,592
Out. Out!

21
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,728
Get out!

22
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:14,766
Master...
Master, we've done it.

23
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,768
May I introduce

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,872
the most epic version
of the beetle drone yet!

25
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:28,213
- And I care because?
- B-B-Because the Samurai?

26
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,748
You've wanted to kill him
since forever.

27
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,250
He's the bane of your existence.

28
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:37,189
Oh!
That was the old Aku.

29
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,724
This is a new Aku.

30
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,496
And he really doesn't care
about a pathetic samurai

31
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,499
who wanders around like a mad fool.

32
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:51,269
It's hilarious, really.

33
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,339
Look, I tell you what ...

34
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,310
you want to destroy him,
go ahead.

35
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,445
Who cares?

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,551
I certainly don't,
not one bit at all.

37
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,660
So, tell me
what's been bothering you.

38
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,263
Well, you see, Doc,

39
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,499
it's been over 50 years already.

40
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,703
- It's been that long?
- Yes.

41
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,472
You see,
that's the actual problem.

42
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:33,245
Once I eradicated
all the time portals,

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,848
I thought I would just wait it
out and then the Samur...

44
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,786
We don't say his name here.
It is a safe place.

45
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,756
Yes. Sorry, Doctor.

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,726
Well, I-I just assumed
that eventually

47
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,462
over time he would just

48
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:54,733
- Di-i-i-i-e!
- di-i-i-i-e!

49
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,703
But he hasn't even aged.

50
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,634
I mean, like, at all.

51
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,675
He just grew
that stupid beard.

52
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,379
It looks like
he'll be here forever!

53
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:13,285
I-I just don't know
if I can handle that.

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,289
Yes. It seems that
the initial time travel

55
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,992
has affected the aging process.

56
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:25,797
- It's quite the conundrum.
- Yes...

57
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,300
What is that again?

58
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:32,671
Just a confusing
or difficult problem.

59
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,907
Yes. Problem.

60
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,745
I wish there was someone who
can dispose of my problem.

61
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:46,551
- Yes. One can hope.
- Yes. One can hope.

62
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,202
Ahh!

63
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,755
<i>It's time to end it,
don't you think?</i>

64
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,725
Never.
They are just machines.

65
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,793
I'll find a way.
I always have.

66
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,262
<i>When you have the sword,
but now it's gone.</i>

67
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,064
<i>There's no hope!</i>

68
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,966
I've been doing fine without it.

69
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,735
<i>Well, listen to you.</i>

70
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,870
<i>And what are you going to do
when Aku finds you</i>

71
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,839
<i>and realizes you have no sword?</i>

72
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,576
Aku doesn't know, and he hasn't
shown himself in years.

73
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,146
He keeps thinking that one of
his machines can defeat me.

74
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,814
<i>Maybe he's right.</i>

75
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,050
<i>You haven't faced anything
so powerful.</i>

76
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,119
<i>How much longer
can you keep this up?</i>

77
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,756
It always seems bad at first,
but then I find a way.

78
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,873
They're just nuts and bolts,
just nuts and bolts.

79
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,096
<i>Who cares anymore?!
There's no way home.</i>

80
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,831
<i>There's nothing to fight for.</i>

81
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,833
<i>There's no more honor.</i>

82
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:40,038
<i>Come to think of it, the only
honorable thing to do is ...</i>

83
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,806
- Quiet.
- No!

84
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,376
<i>I won't spend eternity
in this forsaken time!</i>

85
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,146
What do you want from me?

86
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,950
<i>I want it to end.
Aren't you tired?</i>

87
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,754
<i>Wouldn't it be great
to be free of all of this?</i>

88
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,624
<i>Our ancestors are waiting for us.</i>

89
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,393
<i>They want you to join them.</i>

90
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,736
- There.
- You'll never make it!

91
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,770
<i>They'll get you!</i>

92
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,124
I'll make it.

93
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,555
Ahh!
