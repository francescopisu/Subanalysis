50 years have passed,

8
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:32,264
<i>but I do not age.</i>

9
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:38,136
<i>Time has lost its effect on me.</i>

10
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:45,844
<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

11
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,148
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,</i>

12
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,752
<i>present, and future.</i>

13
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:57,489
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

14
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,827
<i>Gotta get back,

15
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:03,695

<i>Aaaaaakuuuuuuu.</i>

18
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:22,100
Seven daughters
to do your bidding, Master.

19
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,971
They will succeed where
so many others have failed,

20
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:31,109
and we will find favor
in your glory.

21
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:50,982
<i>Why?
Why?</i>

22
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:53,585
<i>Why have you forsaken us?</i>

23
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:57,188
<i>Have you forgotten, my son?</i>

24
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,023
No. No.

25
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,795
<i>Help!</i>

26
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:06,598
<i>Help me, son!
You must!</i>

27
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,268
<i>Son, you are forgetting us!</i>

28
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,603
No.

29
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:15,840
<i>You ...
You never came back.</i>

30
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,880
<i>You left us.</i>

31
00:08:21,882 --> 00:08:24,749
<i>You abandoned your purpose.</i>

32
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:26,217
I haven't!

33
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,220
<i>You left us all to...</i>

34
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:32,349
<i>Die!</i>

35
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,431
Aahh!

36
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,155
<i>Son?</i>

37
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:42,760
Father?

38
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,295
<i>Why?</i>

39
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,296
I ... I ...

40
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:50,568
<i>We've been waiting for you
so long,</i>

41
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,837
<i>but you never came back.</i>

42
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,707
No, Father, Aku destroyed
the way home.

43
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,844
<i>I don't understand!</i>

44
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:03,181
<i>You were the only one
who could save us!</i>

45
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:04,582
Father...

46
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:07,585
<i>He destroyed everything!</i>

47
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:10,788
<i>Everything is burning!</i>

48
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,992
<i>You've forgotten your purpose!</i>

49
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,928
<i>You've forsaken us!</i>

50
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,274
Aaahh!

51
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:01,906
Any mistake is certain death,
and death is our failure.

52
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:46,250
<i>Bask in the glory of
what our master has created.</i>

53
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,052
<i>Admire its beauty,</i>

54
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,888
but know that the Samurai
is out there

55
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,659
leaving a wake of devastation
wherever he goes.

56
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:56,828
That's why, my sweet Ashi,

57
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,831
the daughters of Aku
must stay focused,

58
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,601
never relent, always attack.

59
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,536
Teach this one a lesson!

60
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,417
<i>Stop!</i>

61
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:22,487
The weak have no place with Aku.

62
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,398
Are you weak?

63
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,469
Are you weak?

64
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,175
Are you weak?!

65
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:54,820
Yes.
Aku's fire stirs inside all of you.

66
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,159
<i>To defeat the one,
your senses must be sharp.</i>

67
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,700
Their time is almost at hand.

68
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,436
Once they succeed,

69
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:14,939
you will again honor us
with your presence.

70
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:09,060
Samurai Jack!

71
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,996
Man, it is good to see you, babe.

72
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,498
What took you so long?

73
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,202
I decimated this village
days ago just for you.

74
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,004
Oh, wait.
This is you, right?

75
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:21,772
I mean, who could recognize you

76
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:25,743
with all that gear
and ruggedness, baby?

77
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,678
I'll tell you who ... me.

78
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,083
Scaramouch the Merciless,

79
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:36,120
the Pied Piper of Ruination,
the Crooner of Carnage,

80
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:41,559
the Ambassador of Annihilation,
the Eradicator of All, baby.

81
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:45,730
Also known as Aku's
most favorite assassin, babe.

82
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,369
Oh, there it is, babe,
the world-famous scowl.

83
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:54,172
Well, come on, Sammy, baby.
Whip it out.

84
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:57,108
You know what I'm talking about ...
that crazy sword.

85
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,877
Let's get slicin' and dicin',
swingin' and bashin',

86
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,779
hackin' and slashin', babe.

87
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,948
Wait.
Back off, "Beardsly."

88
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,251
Where is your sword, huh?

89
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:11,422
I don't see it.
Oh?

90
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,524
No, no, no, no, no, babe!

91
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:17,094
Don't tell me
you lost your sword.

92
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,707
Okay, Jacky, baby,
you just make with the scowl

93
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,376
while I make with the phone
and call Aku.

94
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,779
Beep, beep, beep,
bo, dee, do, bip!

95
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,648
<i>Who is this?!</i>

96
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,053
Aku, baby, how's it hanging, boss?
Guess what I ...

97
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,792
<i>What? Hello?!</i>

98
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:56,000
Ooh, nice choreography, babe.
You haven't lost a step.

99
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:58,903
Well, then... let's dance.

100
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,760
You know, babe, I wasn't crazy
about the front scruff,

101
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:57,728
but I am groovin' on the mane.

102
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:12,043
<i>Jack.</i>

103
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:14,912
<i>Help us, Jack.</i>

104
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:16,981
<i>Help us.</i>

105
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:21,185
<i>- Help us!
- Help us, Jack!</i>

106
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,056
Please, no.
You must understand.

107
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:27,992
That samurai has gone
beaucoup cuckoo.

108
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,471
Hey, you might have destroyed
my magic flute,

109
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:17,708
but you can't destroy the
musical magic that is me, babe.

110
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,436
Dig that beautiful sound, baby.

111
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:24,141
Hey, babe, I told you ...
I'm Aku's favorite.

112
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,844
No one plays the blades like I do.

113
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:29,613
No one!

114
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:47,832
Well, it's been fun, Jack-o,
but I got to move on.

115
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,066
<i>Au revoir.</i>

116
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:51,769
That's French for,
"You're dead, babe."

117
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:09,420
Well, babe, time for me
to shuffle offstage.

118
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:12,490
Looks like you're the headliner now.

119
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,600
That's all, babe.

120
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:17,521
- Ashi.
- Ashi.

121
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:31,018
Your training is complete.

122
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,453
Go! Kill!

123
