00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:04,623
50 years have passed.

2
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:08,527
<i>But I do not age.</i>

3
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:15,367
<i>Time has lost its effect on me.</i>

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,241
<i>Yet the suffering continues.</i>

5
00:00:24,678 --> 00:00:30,982
<i>Aku's grasp chokes the past,
present, and future.</i>

6
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:34,920
<i>Hope is lost.</i>

7
00:00:34,922 --> 00:00:39,057
<i>Got to get back ...
back to the past.</i>

8
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,792
<i>Samurai Jack.</i>

11
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:18,797
Oh!
Hello, little friend.

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,199
I don't suppose you know
if there is a time portal

13
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:24,536
atop this mountain, do you?

14
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:27,672
No?
Yes?

15
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:31,076
Aku has destroyed many.

16
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,612
I worry that
there are none left.

17
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:45,517
Phew!
That was close!

18
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,554
I didn't think
you'd get here so fast.

19
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,593
Fool!

20
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,633
Oh, fun fact ...

21
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:08,373
that was the last remaining
time portal in existence!

22
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,021
Ooh, so angry!
Be careful, Samurai ...

23
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:26,491
so much stress
will give you a heart attack.

24
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:29,327
Ooh!
What am I saying?

25
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:33,265
Please continue!
Never mind what I said!

26
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:39,004
Whoa!

27
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,642
Ho, ho!
Not so fast, Samurai.

28
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:47,245
I know better than to mess
with that sword!

29
00:03:48,548 --> 00:03:53,985
But before I go, I'll leave
you someone to play with.

30
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:16,000
<i>And so...
I was not able to find it again.</i>

31
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,540
There!

32
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:13,057
We are here.

33
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:59,838
- It's not here.
- Could someone else have taken it?

34
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,942
No.
I realize now that...

35
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:06,644
I did not lose the sword...

36
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,313
but the sword left me.

37
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:20,658
- Thank you, friend.
- Yes, thank you.

38
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,540
I do not know
how long this may take.

39
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,443
- I'll go with you.
- You cannot.

40
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:41,546
It is something that
I must do on my own.

41
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:44,182
Wait, I...

42
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:56,494
Oh. I guess I'll just...
wait here?

43
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:02,046
- Are you lost?
- Yes.

44
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:05,016
Good.
Come make tea.

45
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:25,970
<i>Hold it.</i>

46
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,974
Where do you think
you're going?

47
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:33,644
Up the mountain, to kill the samurai.
What's it to you?

48
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,755
I'm going to stop you.

49
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:49,260
<i>Hey, why have we stopped? 
What's so funny?</i>

50
00:11:49,262 --> 00:11:53,865
<i>It's a girl!
She says she's going to stop us.</i>

51
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:57,468
- What did he say?
- Something about a squirrel.

52
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,139
I love squirrels!
Is it lunch already?

53
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:03,274
So a little thing like you

54
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:06,144
is gonna stop
this whole army, huh?

55
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:07,411
Yep.

56
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:11,115
We're gonna rip you apart
in a bunch of pieces,

57
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,284
and then we're gonna
take those pieces

58
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:16,821
and rip them apart
into even more pieces!

59
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,490
- I'm waiting.
- Hmm?

60
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,516
- Huh?
- Huh?

61
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:22,400
- Mother?
- I knew you would fail us.

62
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:26,203
You were the strongest,
but the most unfocused.

63
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:30,541
<i>Always distracted,
questioning everything.</i>

64
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:32,910
But all that can change.

65
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:35,946
You can still honor
our Lord Father.

66
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:40,151
<i>Destroy the Samurai, Ashi.</i>

67
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:46,290
No.
You were wrong about everything.

68
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:50,961
- Jack showed me the truth.
- Then you, too, will die.

69
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:44,715
How could you betray your family?

70
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:49,887
He killed your sisters!
And you let him live!

71
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:52,957
No, you killed them!

72
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:56,360
We were made for one purpose ...
to kill!

73
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:59,375
Our fate was sealed
the day we were born!

74
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:04,435
The samurai
is our mortal enemy.

75
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:08,772
He must die at any cost.

76
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:12,266
No!

77
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,794
This is terrible.

78
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:35,866
- Really?
- Yes. Yes, quite terrible.

79
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:39,136
This tea has all
the necessary ingredients...

80
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:42,806
<i>but it lacks
the most important one ...</i>

81
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:44,341
balance.

82
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:48,746
I see why your path to the sword
remains clouded.

83
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:52,016
This isn't the path?!
I-I don't understand.

84
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:56,153
- Then you must show me the way!
- I cannot.

85
00:18:56,155 --> 00:19:00,057
It is not for me
to show you your path.

86
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,026
<i>That's fortune cookie nonsense!</i>

87
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:05,296
<i>He knows where it is.
He just won't tell you.</i>

88
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:08,032
Please, you must tell me.

89
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:11,135
That is something you must earn.

90
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:15,439
<i>Earn?!
After everything we've done,</i>

91
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:17,508
<i>everything we've been through ...</i>

92
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,513
<i>the death, the loss,
the suffering!</i>

93
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:26,250
<i>Who are you to deny us
what is rightfully ours!?</i>

94
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:28,586
Enough.

95
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:32,523
We have lost the sword
because of you.

96
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,758
<i>I have kept us alive!</i>

97
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,994
<i>He's the one
who has taken it from us!</i>

98
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:38,662
<i>He knows where it is!</i>

99
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:40,397
No.

100
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:44,201
I've let you consume me
for far too long.

101
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:46,437
<i>You're in my way.</i>

102
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:50,641
You.

103
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:53,477
You are the one who has
kept the past hidden.

104
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:58,415
Your anger, your frustration.

105
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:01,118
<i>You're a fool!</i>

106
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,156
You have blinded us,
but now I can see.

107
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:10,160
<i>You need me!</i>

108
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:13,597
Now you are balanced.

109
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:23,540
<i>Like your father,
you have been chosen.</i>

110
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:27,444
<i>To stop a force of ultimate evil.</i>

111
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:30,648
<i>You are worthy.</i>

112
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:18,929
Ashi.

113
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:28,138
- Jack?
- Yes. It is me.

114
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,840
You got your sword.

115
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:35,746
- And a shave and a haircut.
- Hmm, yes.

116
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:38,916
And you...
you have been very busy.

117
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:41,185
Ow...

118
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:44,121
Thank you.

119
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:49,876
- So, what next?
