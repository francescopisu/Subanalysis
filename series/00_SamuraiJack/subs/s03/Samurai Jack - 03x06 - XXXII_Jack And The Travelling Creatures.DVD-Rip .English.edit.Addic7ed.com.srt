1
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:07,349
Long ago
in a distant land, l, Aku...

2
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:10,618
the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,184
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:17,060
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:19,725
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:23,065
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,765
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:30,538
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:32,306
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:35,076
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,449
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:44,446
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,491
Got to get back

14
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,960
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:49,962
Watch out

16
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,293
Got to get back

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,128
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,997
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,127
Got to get back

20
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,729
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,761
Watch out

22
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:00,898
Got to get back

23
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,171
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,609
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,009
Got to get back

26
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:08,139
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

27
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,239
Watch--watch out

28
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,579
Got to get back

29
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:11,606
Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:12,618
Samurai Jack

31
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:15,177
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

32
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:23,194
Thank you, Jack.

33
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,596
Thank you for helping us.

34
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:28,863
Now let us help you.

35
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:33,737
Travel north to the city of Kojima.

36
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:36,504
There you will find Goseki.

37
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:43,348
He will guide you through the city
to the foothills of Kazuo.

38
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:51,981
There you must climb the mountain
to the Bridge of Ogami.

39
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:56,593
Once you have crossed the bridge...

40
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,930
you have entered
the mystical land of Moon.

41
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:09,940
There you will come upon a lake...

42
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:13,776
a lake of great power.

43
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:17,443
Your journey will start there.

44
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:54,978
No! Wait!

45
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,820
Stop!

46
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,586
To keep from drowning...

47
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,021
your feet must touch the ground.

48
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,642
Clever how you people use
this beast for travel.

49
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,577
We do not use him.

50
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:16,480
lt is his generosity
that allows us to cross this lake.

51
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,643
Only he can cross it.

52
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,479
l meant no disrespect.

53
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:26,219
He has forever lived in this lake.

54
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,750
Seen many things.

55
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:32,492
All-knowing and very wise.

56
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,841
Great creature of the lake...

57
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:49,815
l am in search of a passage...

58
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,977
a passage in time.

59
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,384
Please, can you help me?

60
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,910
Come with me.

61
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,210
What?

62
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:03,118
You seek a passage in time.

63
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,817
Yes.

64
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,093
Come.

65
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,589
He seeks a passage in time.

66
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:24,270
ls he the one?

67
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,906
Perhaps.

68
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:31,433
He wields the sword.

69
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:46,220
l will find out.

70
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:51,786
You will continue...

71
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,391
with him.

72
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,834
He will take me
to the time passage?

73
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,799
Yes.

74
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,456
Huh?

75
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,109
Have l passed your test?

76
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,310
Yes.

77
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,333
They call me Jack.

78
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:28,305
The creatures of this mystical land
have guided me here.

79
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,002
ls this the passage through time
that l have quested for?

80
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:32,601
Yup.

81
00:15:32,644 --> 00:15:36,011
l humbly request your permission
to use this great power.

82
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,008
No.

83
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:43,283
Guardian, by what right
do you deny me?

84
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:48,385
For countless eons, l have guarded
this magical power of time travel.

85
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,759
All have been denied...

86
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:55,290
from the mightiest of giants
to the tiniest of warriors.

87
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,733
You see, samurai...

88
00:15:56,768 --> 00:16:00,534
only one man has been
prophesied to defeat me...

89
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:05,032
and that man is the only man
who can use this time passage.

90
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:08,205
And you, my man, ain't that man.

91
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:14,050
l have hoped that just once
l would not have to battle for my goal...

92
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:17,385
because it is noble and just.

93
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:19,890
But l see that this is impossible.

94
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:22,052
l must use the power
of this time passage.

95
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:24,892
And so, l will defeat you.

96
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,488
Ain't gonna happen.

97
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,692
We shall see.

98
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:34,729
Aw, you going
all old school on me, huh?

99
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,741
Well, l got me one of those.

100
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,234
l told you, man.
You ain't the one.

101
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,750
All right, brother, let's see what
you can do with that against...

102
00:17:57,355 --> 00:17:58,481
...this.

103
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:31,584
Pretty good, but not good enough.

104
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,229
All right, dodge this!

105
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,417
That was my favorite suit
you just ruined.

106
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,789
l have never faced a foe
with such strength and skill.

107
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:26,235
l told you, man.
lt ain't gonna happen.

108
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,796
Now, why don't you leave
before you really get hurt.

109
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,273
Never!

110
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:32,708
l must return to the past!

111
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,579
Fool! You will never gain
entrance into--

112
00:21:10,582 --> 00:21:11,446
Huh?

113
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:16,847
Oh. All right. l understand.

114
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,343
You can't use it yet, Samurai Jack.

115
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:51,783
Not yet.

116
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:53,683
Not yet.

117
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,428
Got to get back

118
00:22:08,473 --> 00:22:10,771
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

119
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:11,901
Watch out

120
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,205
Got to get back

121
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:15,212
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

122
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,180
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

123
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:18,204
Got to get back

124
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:21,082
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

125
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,245
Watch out

126
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:26,856
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

127
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:31,718
Watch out

128
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:32,730
Gotta get back

129
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:33,856
Jack, Jack, Jack

130
00:22:33,898 --> 00:22:34,922
Samurai Jack

131
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:36,456
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
