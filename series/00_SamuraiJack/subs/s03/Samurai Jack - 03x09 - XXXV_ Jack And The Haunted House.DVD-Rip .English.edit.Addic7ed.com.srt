1
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:06,278
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:10,977
l, Aku,
the shape-shifting master of darkness...

3
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:14,680
unleashed an unspeakable evil...

4
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:17,451
but a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:20,119
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,459
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:28,166
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,863
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,904 --> 00:00:32,701
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:35,139
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:39,509
Now the fools seeks to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:44,506
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:46,451
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:48,954
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,047
Watch out

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,352
Gotta get back

17
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:53,188
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:55,057
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,119
Gotta get back

20
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:58,324
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,627
Watch out

22
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:00,826
Gotta get back

23
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:03,233
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,669
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:07,195

- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,300

00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:10,934
Gotta get back

28
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,968
- Jack, Jack, Jack
- Samurai Jack

29
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:14,844
- Watch--Watch out
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:27,750
Excuse me. l--

31
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:37,988
Uh, wait. Please.

32
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,055
Wait!

33
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:19,914
What?

34
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,437
Hello?

35
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,270
Hello!

36
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,106
Please, show yourself.

37
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,702
l mean no harm.

38
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:29,381
Very well.

39
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:32,407
l am leaving your doll here...

40
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:36,115
right on the--the, uh, the--

41
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,586
Good-bye.

42
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:50,358
Whoever you are.

43
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:07,451
Did l scare you?

44
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,648
Um, no.

45
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,714
lt's just that...

46
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:13,453
this place--

47
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:16,155
What are you doing here?
ls this your home?

48
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:25,460
Uh, what is wrong, little girl?

49
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:26,631
Nothing.

50
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,806
l do not think we should be here.

51
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,903
l think we have been here
too long already.

52
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:42,284
Ah, here we are.

53
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,290
lt will be good to breathe
the night-time air again.

54
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:54,760
lmpossible.

55
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,702
What is this?

56
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,329
There was a door here!

57
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:06,206
Come with me.

58
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,546
No!

59
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,051
The window's gone!

60
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,044
There was a window here!

61
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,718
And here! And here!
And here! And here! And--

62
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:29,034
l just do not understand.

63
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,330
How can...

64
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,069
l'm tired and cold.

65
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:42,514
You are right.
l, too, am feeling uncommonly weary.

66
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:44,539
Perhaps after some rest...

67
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:48,714
we shall find our way
out of this strange place.

68
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:56,114
Oh! Excuse us.

69
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,589
Please, won't you join us?

70
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:03,618
No! There is something wrong.

71
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,959
l don't understand.

72
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,797
Come. Have tea with us.

73
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:12,770
This is--is some sort of illusion!

74
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:14,796
Like everything in this house!

75
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,604
There is absolutely nothing to fear.

76
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:20,737
We are all quite real.

77
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,248
And you, little girl, are you an illusion?

78
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:33,788
Come. Drink the tea
if you don't believe we're real.

79
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,657
Please.

80
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:37,663
This is my daughter Kuni...

81
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,392
my son Tobi...

82
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:42,995
and my wife Yamiko.

83
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:56,008
Why, this is quite good.

84
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:59,848
Yes.
lt comes from the southern part of Edo.

85
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:02,183
Yes. l am familiar with Edo.

86
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,348
My family and l spent our summers there.

87
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:11,319
What has happened to your home?

88
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:13,525
And why is this room so impeccable?

89
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:20,237
Uh, there was a storm, a terrible storm.

90
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:23,503
Ah. Oh, yes. That's right.

91
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:26,272
And we have tried
to make the best of it.

92
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:27,677
lsn't that right, Tobi?

93
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,015
Shy children.

94
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:40,515
Tobi, why don't you tell our guest
about your studies?

95
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,742
Must not be feeling well.

96
00:13:58,778 --> 00:14:00,040
l'm sorry.

97
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,954
You're alive!

98
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,293
Yes. lt seems l have beaten the demon...

99
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,231
that possessed this house.

100
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,895
Kuni, l am sorry.

101
00:20:30,936 --> 00:20:33,336
l saw your family...

102
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:35,772
but l was not able to free them.

103
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:37,901
- Kuni?
- Papa?

104
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,307
Papa!
