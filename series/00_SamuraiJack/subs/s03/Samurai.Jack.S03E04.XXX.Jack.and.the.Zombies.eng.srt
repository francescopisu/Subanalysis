1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:06,250
Long ago in a distant land, l, Aku...

2
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:10,950
the shape-shifting master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:14,620
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,425
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,092
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,432
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,140
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,837
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:35,109
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

10
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:39,482
Now the fool seeks to return to the past...

11
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,479
and undo the future that is Aku.

12
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,515
Got to get back

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,960
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

14
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:49,984
Watch out

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,327
Got to get back

16
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,162
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,031
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

18
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,160
Got to get back

19
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:58,728
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

20
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,761
Watch out

21
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:00,795
Got to get back

22
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,207
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

23
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,642
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

24
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,043
Got to get back

25
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,172
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,239
Watch--Watch out

27
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,271
Got to get back

28
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,477
Jack, Jack, Jack

29
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,610
Samurai Jack

30
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:14,916
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

31
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:01,932
Hmm. Hmm.

32
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:42,540
Samurai, samurai.

33
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:47,036
Why won't you die?

34
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,620
Foolish, unknowing, innocent samurai.

35
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:44,467
Little do you know
that the path l have chosen for you...

36
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:48,873
will lead you to your doom!

37
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,511
Hello?

38
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,251
Wait, child.

39
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,560
Excuse me.
l don't mean to startle you...

40
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:22,159
but is it not unsafe
for you to be out so late?

41
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:35,643
Who's there?

42
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:46,685
Ha ha!

43
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,019
You! You there.

44
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,997
Wait.

45
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,567
l have a bad feeling about this.

46
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,472
Perhaps l should leave.

47
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,760
l am sure this is the way l came.

48
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:51,140
l will eat your soul!

49
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:20,272
What?

50
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:10,718
No!

51
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:18,570
Well, well, well.

52
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:21,436
What do we have here?

53
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:25,570
The old, powerful blade of the samurai...

54
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:29,412
the only power that can harm me.

55
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:31,007
Yes, samurai.

56
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:34,179
l shall destroy this sword...

57
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,247
and become truly invincible.

58
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:42,193
But not before l smite thee.

59
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,695
Fool!

60
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,932
How fitting indeed...

61
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,034
to be destroyed by the blade
of your worthless father.

62
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:01,070
Now prepare for your destruction.

63
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh, samurai.

64
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:54,274
Where are you, samurai?

65
00:18:54,314 --> 00:19:00,947
You can run, but you cannot hide,
because l can smell your blood.

66
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:46,556
Forgive me, father. l have failed you.

67
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,049
How? How?

68
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:14,082
Even l had forgotten that the sword
was forged in purity and strength.

69
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:16,254
lt can only be used for good.

70
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:19,458
ln the hand of evil,
it can never harm an innocent...

71
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:22,627
and so, Aku, it cannot harm me...

72
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:24,636
but it can harm you.

73
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:59,734
l will get you yet, samurai!

74
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,819
- Watch out

75
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,387
