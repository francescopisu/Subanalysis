1
00:00:02,482 --> 00:00:05,781
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,483
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:14,620
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,425
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,092
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,432
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,140
Before the final blow
was struck...

8
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,837
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:32,708
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:35,112
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:39,482
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,479
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,014
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,117
Back to the past

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,923
Samurai Jack

16
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:50,020
Watch out

17
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,361
Gotta get back,
back to the past

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,923
- Samurai Jack
- Jack

19
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:55,025
Jack, Jack, Jack

20
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,127
Gotta get back,
back to the past

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,296
Samurai Jack

22
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,635
Watch out!

23
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:01,664
Gotta get back,
back to the past

24
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,198
Samurai Jack

25
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,608
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:05,633
Gotta get back

27
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,170
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

28
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,239
Watch--watch out!

29
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,408
Gotta get back

30
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,940
Jack, Jack, Jack

31
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:13,543
Samurai Jack

32
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,111
Watch--watch out!

33
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,269
No, man.
That's some magic type junk.

34
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,277
You need to check out
in the swamp.

35
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,747
Time travel, eh?
The hermit of Boga Swamp...

36
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:44,683
knows many a mystic secret.

37
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:51,757
Boga Swamp lies exactly
2.7 kilometers due south...

38
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:53,157
of your current position.

39
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,888
Please take
your complimentary map...

40
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:56,862
of the complete
forty-hectare region.

41
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:59,491
For a holographic,
topographical projection...

42
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,091
press Enter when ready.

43
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:06,299
They say a twisted horn
marks his doorstep.

44
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,307
The hermit knows.

45
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,638
Check the swamps, yo!

46
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,803
Press Enter when ready.

47
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:50,875
Who dares to blow my door horn?

48
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,647
l am called Jack.
l am a traveler.

49
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,814
Hmm. Never heard of you.

50
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,653
l'm a hermit, after all...

51
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,387
and l have little time
for vagrants!

52
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,689
What is your business here?

53
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:03,889
l seek to travel back in time...

54
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,660
and l am told you may know
of such things.

55
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,668
Time travel, hmm?

56
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:10,397
Come with me.

57
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:11,995
Thank you for your audience.

58
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,505
- l had hoped--
- Quiet!

59
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,239
lt occurs to me that we may be
of some help to each other...

60
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:21,611
for l study the lore
of ancient days...

61
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:24,879
and it is here
that l have collected...

62
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,943
artifacts and lost treasures...

63
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,512
with links to mystic forces.

64
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:32,116
There is legend
of powerful items...

65
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,854
that may serve us both.

66
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,329
Have you ever heard
of the Titans?

67
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:41,130
Yes--the cosmic beings
that sired the gods of Olympus.

68
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,429
Quiet!

69
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:49,673
Before the birth of Aku...

70
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:54,313
before the ancient gods...

71
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:58,477
it was the Titans
that ruled all things...

72
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,180
and Cronus was their king.

73
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:07,492
He understood the secrets
of time and space...

74
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:13,932
and fashioned
for himself three gems:

75
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,765
The Eye of Cronus--

76
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:20,933
to focus his vision
of the universal time.

77
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,273
Fists of Might and Ability...

78
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,145
to grasp onto
the cosmic essence.

79
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:36,145
With these, he alone held the power
to command all eternity.

80
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:41,115
But as Cronus' power grew...

81
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:46,292
so, too, did his arrogance
and paranoia.

82
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:50,997
His appetites
drove him to madness!

83
00:04:55,442 --> 00:05:00,812
Until his own son Zeus
rose to challenge him.

84
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:04,749
Cronus was dethroned
and imprisoned...

85
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:08,117
in the cold depths of space.

86
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:14,018
He was stripped
of his mighty gems...

87
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,494
which Zeus cast earthward...

88
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,794
in hopes that
they would be lost...

89
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,097
forever.

90
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,603
But alas, with years of study...

91
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:27,766
it is l who has
discovered the tombs...

92
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,570
of these powerful relics.

93
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,305
And with the help
of one such as you...

94
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,279
we can unearth these treasures.

95
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:36,441
And with the magic
of the gems...

96
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:39,452
we can tear a hole
in the fabric of time...

97
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,614
and mold a tunnel back
to whenever you came from.

98
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,591
Come, then.
Let us claim what you seek...

99
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,924
unless, of course,
you are a coward.

100
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,239
You are a fool.

101
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,252
You're taking forever!

102
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:16,255
We'll never get anywhere
at this rate.

103
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:26,595
<i>Vamonos, muchacho!</i>

104
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,328
You are our new ride.

105
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,567
Now, then, l'll worry about
travel arrangements.

106
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:35,199
You just take care
of the heavy lifting.

107
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,637
Oh, no, young warrior.

108
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:10,165
l can only guide you
to the challenge.

109
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,837
You must enter it alone.

110
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,472
What are you waiting for?!
Go and get it!

111
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,390
Come on, already!

112
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,570
You better hurry up.
This doesn't look good.

113
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:38,429
You better get a move on!

114
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,796
l'll meet you out front!

115
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,046
Quit horsing around
and climb up here.

116
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,712
We've still got
a lot of work to do.

117
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,896
l think l can see
our next treasure from here.

118
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,802
Nah, the updrafts are too strong.

119
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,536
Guess we'll have
to use the front door.

120
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,475
l'll stay here
and watch the beast...

121
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,449
while you fetch the treasure.

122
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:09,619
And be quick about it! Grr!
This thing gets cranky.

123
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,385
Whew!

124
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:53,020
Nice going, Jackie lad!
Now throw me the fist!

125
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,926
Come on, then!
Two down and one to go!

126
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:38,904
Ah, here's the porthole.

127
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:42,897
The clock is timed to open
at the crack of dawn.

128
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:44,409
The morn is nearly upon us.

129
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:50,979
The Fist of Might.

130
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:54,349
Our final treasure lies deep within.

131
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,354
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

132
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,033
Do it!

133
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:53,400
That's right, sunshine!
lt's a door!

134
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:56,243
l'd start using it if l were you...

135
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:02,009
seeing how you managed
to lose my rope.

136
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:52,429
May l be of any assistance?

137
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,331
You can stay out of the way
and keep your mouth shut!

138
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,348
Now get him!

139
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:15,740
Behind you!

140
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,408
He's right behind you!

141
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:31,018
Fool!

142
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:38,258
You were so blinded by
your little quest for time travel...

143
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
that you couldn't see the truth...

144
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:43,932
right in front of your face!

145
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,617
Huh?

146
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:58,055
What's the matter?
Missing something...

147
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,284
Aku?

148
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,792
The Eye of Cronus.

149
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,021
No!

150
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:18,072
You have deceived me
many times, Aku...

151
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,135
but you have become careless.

152
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,307
Your lust to destroy me
left <i>you</i> the blinded one...

153
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:25,680
and now my trap is sprung!

154
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:34,826
Bah!

155
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,828
lnsolent wretch.

156
00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:39,228
Even without deception...

157
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,323
without mystic weapons...

158
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:45,302
you will fall against
the powers of Aku.

159
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:01,715
Bah, l say!

160
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:04,722
Bah!

161
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:01,605
What?

162
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:41,716
Now let us test
your enchanted steel...

163
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:45,780
against the power of the Titans!

164
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:18,322
Bah!

165
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:25,188
Run, you cowardly shadow...

166
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,563
for you know
your destruction is at hand.

167
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,592
lt is just a matter of time.

168
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,131
Watch out!

169
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,937
Gotta get back,
back to the past

170
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:39,637
Samurai Jack

171
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:41,578
Watch out

172
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,147
Gotta get back,
back to the past

173
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:48,812
Samurai Jack

174
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,048
Watch out

175
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:51,851
Gotta get back,
back to the past

176
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,755
- Samurai Jack
- Jack

177
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,952
Jack, Jack, Jack

178
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:56,893
Gotta get back,
back to the past

179
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:58,395
Samurai Jack

180
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,988
Watch out!

181
00:22:02,734 --> 00:22:04,759
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

182
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,473
Watch out!

183
00:22:09,508 --> 00:22:11,408
Gotta get back

184
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:12,910
Samurai Jack

185
00:22:12,944 --> 00:22:14,935
Watch--watch out
