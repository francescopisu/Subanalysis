1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:07,242
Long ago in a distant land, l, Aku...

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:10,882
the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:14,519
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,359
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:20,025
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:23,366
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,073
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:30,770
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,608
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:35,012
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:39,417
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:44,413
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,483
Got to get back

14
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,790
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:49,921
Watch out

16
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:51,260
Got to get back

17
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:53,095
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,964
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,127
Got to get back

20
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,296
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,532
Watch out

22
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:00,699
Got to get back

23
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,039
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:04,475
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:05,910
Got to get back

26
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:08,073
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

27
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,082
Watch--watch out

28
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,083
Got to get back

29
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:11,345
Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:12,682
Samurai Jack

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,686
Jack

32
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,017
Jack, Jack, Jack

33
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,176
Yeah, and so l was saying--

34
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,337
Whoa! Look out, man.

35
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:43,945
How much did you say this was?

36
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:47,419
lt's free!

37
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:22,248
Looks like there's a storm brewing.

38
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:26,652
lndeed.
How much for the soup?

39
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,890
- Was it the fish?
- No. Chicken.

40
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,263
Thank you.

41
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,503
Oh, excuse me.
l did not see you there.

42
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:43,332
That's it!

43
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:48,271
People...

44
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:52,081
always bumping into me.

45
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:55,087
Always!

46
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:00,891
Oh, great.
Just what l wanted to do today--

47
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:03,361
go get another manicure.

48
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,243
Hey, you dirty chicken!

49
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,187
Look what you did
to my pant leg!

50
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:30,553
l'll show you.

51
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,079
Please, l wish you no harm.

52
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:21,435
This is the silliest chicken
l've ever seen in my life!

53
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,344
Could it be?

54
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,054
No.

55
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:14,924
That sound.

56
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,309
You! You in the robe!

57
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:38,812
l demand that you cease
your walking this instant!

58
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,522
You look like a good chicken...

59
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,966
and l know a good chicken
when l see one.

60
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,144
lt's time, chicken.

61
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:41,333
All right, you swines.

62
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,865
The chicken pays 2 to 1.

63
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,207
Place your bets.

64
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,803
Place your bets.

65
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,277
You going nowhere, chicken.

66
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,440
You'll fight till you win...

67
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,507
or you die!

68
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,666
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

69
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,336
He's OK. He's OK.

70
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:02,044
Get up! Get up! Get up!

71
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,689
He's injured.

72
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:20,357
Bring out the finisher.

73
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,060
But--but that's
two opponents at once.

74
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,830
That's--that's cheating.

75
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:27,437
Do it!

76
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:28,735
lt's always me.

77
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:30,765
l always have to get the finisher.

78
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:34,438
Every time. ''Do this. Do that.
Go get the finisher.''

79
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,448
l always have to!

80
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:09,869
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

81
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,803
Of course.
How thoughtless of me.

82
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:11,462
l almost forgot about the lasagna.

83
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,062
Silly me.

84
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,833
Huh?

85
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:26,639
What's a matter?
Can't you read?

86
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:36,480
May l come in?

87
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,718
Uh, why, yes. Yes, of course.

88
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:43,558
Please, have--have a seat.

89
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:45,825
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You're probably wondering...

90
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:48,526
why the biggest fight promoter
in the business...

91
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,730
is paying a personal visit
to a bum like youse.

92
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,328
Well, the answer's simple.

93
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:57,206
l'm offering your chicken
the main event.

94
00:19:57,242 --> 00:19:59,437
The main event?

95
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:01,537
Huh. Here's my card.

96
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,615
l take it l'll see you there...

97
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,118
with your chicken.

98
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:09,950
Oh, and another thing.

99
00:20:09,988 --> 00:20:11,888
lf you're going to play
with the big boys...

100
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:13,584
try dressing like one.

101
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:19,228
Sure thing! You got it!

102
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,663
No problem!

103
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:25,563
Did you hear that, chicken?

104
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,664
''Play with the big boys.''

105
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,410
Looks like this is the place.

106
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:43,648
Yes, this is the place.

107
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,212
Magnificent.

108
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,953
Well, what do you think, chicken?

109
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,329
Maybe next time,
we find you a new leash.

110
00:20:56,835 --> 00:21:00,464
Hey! Why don't you watch
where you're going?

111
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:02,939
You almost stepped on
my champion.

112
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:25,759
Ah, you're back.

113
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:27,765
What'll it be?
The chicken, right?

114
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,131
No! No chicken!

115
00:21:33,638 --> 00:21:35,765
Ahem.
l mean, no, thank you.

116
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,298
Actually, l would like to try
the shrimp today instead.

117
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:40,502
Watch out

118
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:41,603
Got to get back

119
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:43,511
