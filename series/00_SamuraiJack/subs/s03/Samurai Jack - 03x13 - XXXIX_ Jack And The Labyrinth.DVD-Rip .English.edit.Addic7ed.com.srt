1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:06,081
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:10,715
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:14,352
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:17,386
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,025
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:23,332
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:28,106
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,803
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:32,641
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,079
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,381
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:44,447
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,085
Gotta get back, back to the past

14
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:48,719
Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:49,956
Watch out

16
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:52,089
Gotta get back, back to the past

17
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:53,121
Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,963
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,935
Gotta get back, back to the past

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,494
Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,538 --> 00:00:59,562

22
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:02,006
Gotta get back, back to the past

Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:04,473

25
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:05,500
Gotta get back

26
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:08,013
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

27
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,174

28
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:10,444
Gotta get back

29
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:11,508
Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:13,075
Samurai Jack

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,951
Watch--watch out!

32
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:24,058
ln appreciation
for saving our humble tribe...

33
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:28,431
from extinction
at the hands of the evil Aku...

34
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:31,232
we give you this map.

35
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,434
lt reveals the hidden location...

36
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:37,068
of a great source of power...

37
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,171
that Aku keeps locked away...

38
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:44,581
a power that can end
your quest...

39
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:49,214
and return you
to w<i>hen</i> you belong.

40
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:53,886
Many have sacrificed
to bring us this information.

41
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:57,454
You must use it wisely...

42
00:01:57,497 --> 00:02:02,298
for this power source
is sealed in a fortress...

43
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:06,396
a fortress stocked
with countless guards...

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,104
to protect it against
the finest warriors...

45
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:15,547
and filled with
an array of booby traps...

46
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:21,646
to defend it against
the most cunning thieves.

47
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,679
Be careful...

48
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:25,520

50
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:30,588
if you dare.

51
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,974
Halt, you are under arrest.

52
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,504
Halt, you are under arrest.

53
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:53,305
Halt, you are under arrest.

54
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,530
l wouldn't do that if l were you.

55
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:51,503
You're liable to vaporize
your hands.

56
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,636
Who are you?

57
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:56,107
Funny. l was gonna
ask you the same.

58
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:59,043
They call me Jack.
Samurai Jack.

59
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,345
4,000 years...

60
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:09,617
and still every wannabe
super spy in black tights...

61
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,454
has to use that same old tired joke.

62
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,017
Ooh, l'm a dark ninja.
Sneaky-sneaky! Whoo!

63
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,858
You can't see me! Huh!

64
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:18,454
A little respect for the j-o-b.

65
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:20,398
Excuse me.

66
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:25,363
This thing is alarmed.

67
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,531
Trip the alarm...

68
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:28,665
and none of your fancy-schmancy
kung fu moves...

69
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,834
would have saved you.

70
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,400
Uh, excuse me, but--

71
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,625
What?

72
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:28,590
Voila! Piece of cake.

73
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,898
Wonderful. Thank you.

74
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,201
Whoa, man.

75
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,263

There are too many!

85
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,683
You got that right.

86
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,627
Nice meeting you.

87
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:19,102
No!

88
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:23,972
Give me the diamond.

89
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,364
You got to be kidding me.

90
00:14:02,085 --> 00:14:03,746

96

00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,929
Hey, Jack!

100
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,178
You're welcome.

101
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:07,088
You must give me the diamond.

102
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,249
Can't do it, pal.

103
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,314

Whoo!

110
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:43,781
