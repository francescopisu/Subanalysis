1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:05,683
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:10,520
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:14,584
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,628 --> 00:00:17,392
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,059
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,399
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,765
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:30,800
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:32,641
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,079
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,449
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:44,446
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,482
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,926
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:49,951
Watch out

16
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,293
Gotta get back

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,128
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,997
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,127
Gotta get back

20
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,729
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,761
Watch out

22
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:00,898
Gotta get back

23
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:03,171
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,575
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:05,600
Gotta get back

26
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:08,136
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

27
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,239
Watch--watch out

28
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:10,544
Gotta get back

29
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,573
Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,586
Samurai Jack

31
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,746
Watch--watch out!

32
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:50,959
Shinichi!

33
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:54,399
Shinichi!

34
00:09:58,044 --> 00:09:59,068
Shini--

35
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:08,718
Oh! Ohh!

36
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:11,815
Shinichi!

37
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:14,520
Shinichi!

38
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,414
l do not understand...

39
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:43,752
why it must be you
to carry out this task.

40
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,758
My duties are clear.

41
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:49,387
As the emperor,
this problem is my responsibility.

42
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,691
What of your family?

43
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,427
Do you not have
a higher responsibility unto them?

44
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,095
Do not speak of such nonsense.

45
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,400
You are most important to me.

46
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:02,465
But the people and our land
are also my family.

47
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,375
l must go.

48
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:17,249
l cannot let this evil destroy us all.

49
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,020
My lord, the elixir is ready.

50
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,119
lt is the key to extinguishing
this devilry.

51
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,127
My lord...

52
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,175
Oh!

53
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:35,344
Oh!

54
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,945
You!

55
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,820
Thank you!

56
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,052
No!

57
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,856
My intention was to destroy you!

58
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:44,362
Oh?

59
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,532
But it was your poison arrow...

60
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:53,732
and your hocus-pocus
that set me free.

61
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:03,141
Whoa!

62
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,019
Fool!

63
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:13,115
Nothing of this world
can harm me...

64
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:18,095
for l am Aku,
the Shogun of Sorrow...

65
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,724
the Deliverer of Darkness--

66
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,893
your new master...

67
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:26,132
and you will bow to me!

68
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:31,841
Oh!

69
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:41,612
Human fool.

70
00:20:41,654 --> 00:20:47,251
l see that l must show
your world who is master.

71
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,658
Now gaze your eyes...

72
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,696
upon the full wrath
of the mighty Aku!

73
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:47,982
No!

74
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:06,728
Gotta get back, back to the past

75
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,171
Samurai Jack

76
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,504
Watch out

77
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,668
Gotta get back, back to the past

78
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,904
Samurai Jack

79
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,310
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

80
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:15,335
Gotta get back

81
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,849
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

82
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,475
