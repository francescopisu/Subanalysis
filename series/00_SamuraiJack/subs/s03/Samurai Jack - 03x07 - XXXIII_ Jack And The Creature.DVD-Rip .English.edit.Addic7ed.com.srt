1
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:06,252
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:10,916
l, Aku,
the shape-shifting master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:14,620
unleashed an unspeakable evil...

4
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,425
but a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,092
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,432
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,140
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,837
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:32,674
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,113
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:39,482
Now the fools seeks to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,479
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,424
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,928
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:50,020
Watch out

16
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,325
Gotta get back

17
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,162
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,031
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,092
Gotta get back

20
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:58,297
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,600
Watch out

22
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,799
Gotta get back

23
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,207
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,642
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:07,169
- Gotta get back
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,273
Watch--Watch out

27
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,908
Gotta get back

28
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,942
- Jack, Jack, Jack
- Samurai Jack

29
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,817
- Watch--Watch out
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:14,094
Why do l have this feeling
that l am being followed...

31
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:16,659
when l know it to not be true?

32
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:21,450
l am beginning to grow
very, very weary of this.

33
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:30,362
lt's you again!
Why are you following me?

34
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:36,731
Well?

35
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:31,294
l need not get upset
over such foolishness.

36
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,505
Still hungry, are you?

37
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:05,088
Here. Take these and depart...

38
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,319
that l may continue my quest
unhindered.

39
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:16,291
l am guessing it will require
more than berries to satisfy your appetite.

40
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:46,497
Just a little closer to that mushroom...

41
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:50,992
and soon we'll both be filling our bellies
with fresh, juicy venison.

42
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,096
lsn't that right, my furry friend?

43
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:18,622
l told you,
you have got to stop following me.

44
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,599
My journeys
have taken enough of my energy.

45
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:24,034
The last thing l am in need of
is another burden.

46
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,910
And plus, this mission
has a very low survival rate...

47
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:37,541
for those not schooled in every facet
of martial arts discipline.

48
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:31,864
Wait!

49
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:35,738
ln accordance with the map,
the cave should be...

50
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:36,798
there!

51
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:45,043
That's it!

52
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,110
The Crystal of Cagliostro.

53
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:50,553
My quest has finally ended.

54
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,387
The power of the crystal
will return me to the past...

55
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:56,223
to destroy Aku and reclaim my land.

56
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:12,300
lt seems we will be parting ways now.

57
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,039
Yes, l know.

58
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:19,141
l am sorry
if l was at times impatient with you.

59
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:21,982
l feared you would somehow interfere
with my goal...

60
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,147
when you actually helped me achieve it.

61
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,890
Well...

62
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:29,916
good-bye.

63
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,768
Wait! You must stay behind!

64
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,241
Please, go back.

65
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:46,676
Nothing can interfere
with me reaching that portal!

66
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,684
What are you doing? No!

67
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:03,918
Please, stop!

68
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:40,563
l cannot believe what you have done.

69
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,994
l must sleep now.

70
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:47,665
Tomorrow you will return
to from where you came.

71
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:15,082
She comes roaring out of nowhere
in a crazy street machine

72
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:16,754
She's pretty, pretty, pretty

73
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:19,423
But mean, mean, mean

74
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:20,988
l'm gonna help you, buddy

75
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:23,263
lt's a real bad scene

76
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:27,329
But when that ride is over
you'll be seven shades of green

77
00:15:27,372 --> 00:15:31,172
Wild ride, she'll take you for a wild ride

78
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,109
ln and out and up and down

79
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,204
Wild, wild ride

80
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:38,705
Wild ride, she'll take you for a wild ride

81
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,980
Ride on high, don't get thrown

82
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,816
Wild, wild ride

83
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,618
This ride ain't got no...

84
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,133
Wild ride, she'll take you for a wild ride

85
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,540
ln and out and up and down

86
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:06,168
Wild, wild ride

87
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:09,738
Wild ride, she'll take you for a wild ride

88
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,147
Ride on high, don't get thrown

89
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,481
Wild, wild ride

90
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:17,352
She'll keep your head a-spinning
like a hubcap on the road

91
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:21,382
And run your heart right over...

92
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:24,987
Burn rubber on your soul and laugh
as she goes rolling on

93
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,524
Funny thing about it is,
you'll miss her when she's gone

94
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:30,557
Wild--

95
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:20,715
Hmm. Looks like there is a small village
just over these hills.

96
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,660
We might find
a warm meal and some shelter.

97
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,803
- Watch out
- Gotta get back

98
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:44,440
- Back to the past, Samurai Jack
- Jack, Jack, Jack

99
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,245
- Watch--Watch out
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

100
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,346
Gotta get back

101
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:54,119
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

102
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,286
- Watch out
- Gotta get back

103
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:58,125
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

104
00:21:58,163 --> 00:21:59,960
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

105
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:01,090
Gotta get back

106
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:03,828
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

107
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,028
Watch out

108
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:09,806
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

109
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:14,636
Watch out

110
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,010
Gotta get back

111
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:17,674
- Jack, Jack, Jack
- Samurai Jack

112
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,775
- Watch--Watch out
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack
