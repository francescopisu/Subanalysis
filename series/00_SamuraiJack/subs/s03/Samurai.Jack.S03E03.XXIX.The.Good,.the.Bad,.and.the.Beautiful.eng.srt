1
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,295
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,995
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness...

3
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:14,665
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,470
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:20,137
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:23,478
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,219
Before the final blow
was struck...

8
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,881
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:32,754
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,157
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:39,528
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:44,525
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,060
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,163
Back to the past

15
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,969
Samurai Jack

16
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,065
Watch out

17
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,407
Gotta get back,
back to the past

18
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:53,968
- Samurai Jack
- Jack

19
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,070
Jack, Jack, Jack

20
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,173
Gotta get back,
back to the past

21
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,342
Samurai Jack

22
00:00:58,383 --> 00:00:59,680
Watch out!

23
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:01,709
Gotta get back,
back to the past

24
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:03,243
Samurai Jack

25
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:04,653
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,679
Gotta get back

27
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:08,215
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,284
Watch--watch out!

29
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:10,454
Gotta get back

30
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:11,986
Jack, Jack, Jack

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,361
Samurai Jack

32
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:14,865
Watch out!

33
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:36,013
l thought l told you bums
to stay out of here.

34
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:38,209
Unless you want some more, eh?

35
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,693
Are you the proprietor
of this establishment?

36
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:55,529
That would be me.

37
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:58,001
- l am Sam--
- l know who you are.

38
00:02:58,036 --> 00:03:01,528
A man could get rich
selling your skin, boy.

39
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:19,053
Perhaps you can get rich
selling something <i>to</i> me
instead.

40
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,857
Sell you what, exactly?

41
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:25,954
lnformation.

42
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:33,101
Hey, how much money you say
you had there, my friend?

43
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:38,736
Heh heh heh!

44
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,746
A pleasure
doing business with you.

45
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:53,188
Huh?

46
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,804
Wait!

47
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,204
l know why you're here.

48
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:15,941
You seek the samurai, yes?

49
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:22,747
You aim to collect
the bounty on him, eh?

50
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:27,992
l would like to help you,
Senor Clench...

51
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,823
but he has already left.

52
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,523
He took the train to Cordova.

53
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,725
Y-You still might catch him
if you hurry.

54
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,475
Hey, look, we're closed,
all right?

55
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,035
'Cause l just had
a really tough...

56
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,308

57
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:53,146
l'm sorry. Were you closin'?

58
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:56,086
No, no. Come on in. Sit down.

59
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,089
Uh, what can l get you?

60
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,853
l'd love an ice-cold
ginger ale...

61
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,416
if you've got one.

62
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:08,863
Actually, l'm very curious about
the conversation you had...

63
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,599
with that big, tall gentleman
that just left.

64
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:14,900
Oh.

65
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,432

66
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:19,944
Well, l ought to.

67
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:22,310
l used to be married to one.

68
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,712
Stand clear!

69
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,692
Yes. ln fact,
it's boarding right now.

70
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,312
Halt!

71
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,304

72
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,309
Tickets, please. Tickets.

73
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,833

Ahem.

Thank you.

79
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:25,656

80
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:28,996

81
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:32,094
Well, it's nice
to see you, too, Ezekiel.

82
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,502
Aw, shoot.

83
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:36,166
There ain't never been
nothin' nice about you, woman.

84
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,674
Now, now...

85
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,768
let's not get nasty, darlin'.

86
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,438
Don't call me ''darlin'.''

87
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,276
Well, then don't act
like a fool!

88
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,577
l know what you're up to.

89
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:46,277
You're after the bounty
on that samurai.

90
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,115
What business is it of yours?

91
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,347

92
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:51,252
Pshh! No.

You need me.

94
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,120
He's better than you!

95
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,596
Ain't nobody better
than me, woman.

96
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:01,121
You ought to know that.

97
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,224
Besides, the court says...

98
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,794
you ain't even supposed to
come within 150 feet of me...

99
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,135
so back off!

100
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,448
Looking for a seat?

101
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:21,884
Yep. Yours.

102
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,515
l'm gonna make a lot of money
cashin' in on your hide.

103
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:28,185
l hear that often,
but only from poor men.

104
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,319
Hmm. Well,
l got bills to pay...

105
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,024
and l done already addressed
the envelopes.

106
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,659
l hope you have yet to stamp
the postage on your parcels for
you--

107
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,103
Consider 'em stamped.

108
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,975
Oh! My chickens!

109
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,552
Oh!

110
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:58,647
Yowch!

111
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,486
Argh!

112
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:04,995
Aww.

113
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:08,892
Huh?

114
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,730
Grrr...

115
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:49,434
Heh heh heh!

116
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,568
Just like my pa used to say
on a cold mornin'--

117
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,077
Let's get to work, boy...

118
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,774
'cause the heat's in the tools.

119
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,064
Aw, see, now,
you know how l like it--

120
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:21,696
just the way l showed you.

121
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,199
Aaaah!

122
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:12,349
Huh?

123
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:13,720
Heh heh heh.

124
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:26,501
Huh?

125
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,574
Whoa!

126
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:45,755
Whoa! Unh! Whoa!

127
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:49,589
Galdang durn it!

128
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,177
Hey...

129
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,275
Excuse me.

130
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,479
May l?

131
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,782
Yes. Of course.

132
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,397
Nice day, isn't it?

133
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,762
Yes.

134
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,762
A bit hot, though.

135
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,307
Uh, yes, it is.

136
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:41,038
Do you know where
the best seat in the house is?

137
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:42,909
No. Where?

138
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:45,471
On the roof.

139
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,813
Really?

140
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,047
Sure. lt's got
plenty of fresh air...

141
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:52,078
360-degree views...

142
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,386
and it's very private.

143
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,754
Well...

144
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,462
l think l'm gonna go
up on the roof.

145
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,969
Yes. OK.

146
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:09,905
lt was nice
speaking to you, ma'am.

147
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,837
You're not just
gonna let a lady...

148
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,246
go up on the roof unescorted,
are you?

149
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,773
Of course not.

150
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:26,946
lsn't it beautiful?

151
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,582
Yes, it is.

152
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,906
l wanted to thank you
for saving us all...

153
00:14:43,941 --> 00:14:49,402
from that awful, terrible,
ugly old bandit earlier.

154
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,243
You were so brave.

155
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,748
Thank you.

156
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:56,412
Ooh! And so strong, too.

157
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:10,863
Y'all look so cute
up here on the veranda...

158
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:14,064
l figured l'd fix you up
some lemonade--

159
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,696
fresh-squeezed.

160
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,502
Heh heh heh!

161
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,565
Ooh!

162
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,478
Stand back, ma'am.
Once again...

163
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:25,448
this bandit has reared
his ugly head.

164
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:26,471
Unh!

165
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,280
Well, l guess love is blind...

166
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,287
'cause that ugly head didn't
keep me from marrying him.

167
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,982
Who you callin' ugly?

168
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,419
Ooh! Unh!

169
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,258
Grrr...

170
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,734
Looks like we'll have to
stick this here jackrabbit...

171
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,294
like we did that old boy
back in Kansas City.

172
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,932
Yes, darlin'. l see your point.

173
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,268
Unh!

174
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:23,603
Ha! We ain't the most notorious
man-catchers for nothin', you
know.

175
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:26,909
Oh!

176
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:36,510
Ooh!

177
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:39,182
Uhh!

178
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,556
He's gettin' away!

179
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:45,960
Don't worry, woman. l'm on it.

180
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,199
Don't let him get
to his sword, you idiot!

181
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,462
A woman's work is never done.

182
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,041
Dagnabbit!
Can't you shoot straight?

183
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,171
Don't get uppity, woman.

184
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:06,376
l don't see <i>you</i> makin'
no daylight in his broadside.

185
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:15,223
He went over the side!
Come on. We got him now.

186
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,360
Get on up here
where's l can shoot you...

187
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:25,561
you little chipmunk.

188
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:31,063
Hmm. Consarnit,
l can't get a bead on him.

189
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:39,874
Hey, Quick Straw,
l think someone...

190
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,112
is breaking out
the fights on the train.

191
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,950
Now, hold on there, Baba Louis.

192
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:47,218
Ain't nobody gonna do
no kind of fightin'...

193
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:50,715
on this here train,
on account of you and me--

194
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:52,456
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

195
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,020
ls it sleepy-time already?

196
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,361
Unh!

197
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:09,039
Huh?

198
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:14,048
Hey, fool!
Don't shoot up the engine!

199
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,609
Elsewise, we'll be stuck
out here in the desert!

200
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:18,780
Huh? Oh, yeah.

201
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,720
Good morning.
You're just in time.

202
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,250
l was fixin' to make me
some flapjacks!

203
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,961
Huh?

204
00:19:15,746 --> 00:19:18,977
The South shall rise again!

205
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,888
Well, now, ain't that
a purty little package...

206
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:34,692
tied up with a bow?

207
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:37,393
Yup. Hogtied,
just like that pig...

208
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,994
we caught back in Gower Gulch.

209
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:41,436
Ha! Yes, sirree.

210
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,098
There ain't a polecat around...

211
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,438
who can slip through the grip
of the Clenches.

212
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,841
l reckon we're just
a pair of aces, ain't we?

213
00:19:47,878 --> 00:19:50,745
Yup. Just like old times, Josie.

214
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:53,409
Just like old times.

215
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,285
You know, Zeke...

216
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:58,981
all this excitement
has got me to wonderin'.

217
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,853
Why'd we ever split up?

218
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:02,324
Workin' together again...

219
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,623
stirs up all them
good old feelings.

220
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,094
Well, Josie...

221
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:09,690
you know l was always
powerful sweet on you, but--

222
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,860
Aw, but nothin', Zeke.

223
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,802
l loved watchin'
the way you handled...

224
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,862
that cagey old samurai.

225
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:18,101
You're just so brave...

226
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:20,701
and so strong.

227
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,872
You make a girl feel
all aflutter.

228
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:25,381
Don't you see, Zeke?

229
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:28,213
lt's just like Kansas City
all over again.

230
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:32,051
And what with this huge bounty
we're about to collect...

231
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:33,386
l could end up...

232
00:20:33,423 --> 00:20:35,050
twice as rich!

233
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,957
Ha ha ha ha ha!

234
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,790
Dagburnit, Josie!

235
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:43,061
You consarn, framalandin',
flamdanglin'...

236
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,092
snake-in-sheep's-wool-
over-my-eyes...

237
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:47,626
trick-up-her-sleeve...

238
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:50,697
whoo-hoo witchy woman!

239
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:56,136
Ha ha ha ha ha!

240
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:57,476
Oh! Aah!

241
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,655
Uh, Zeke?

242
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,454
Sugarplum?

243
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:12,053
Maybe l was a mite hasty.

244
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:14,359
Court says 150 feet, woman.

245
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:16,422
150 feet!

246
00:21:16,466 --> 00:21:17,524
Watch out!

249
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,971

250
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,540
