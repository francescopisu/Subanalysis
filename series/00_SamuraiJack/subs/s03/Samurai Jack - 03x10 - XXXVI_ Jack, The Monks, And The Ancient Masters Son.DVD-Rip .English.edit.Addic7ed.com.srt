1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,355
Long ago in a distant land...

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,054
l, Aku,
the shape-shifting master of darkness...

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:14,724
unleashed an unspeakable evil...

4
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:17,529
but a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,196
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:23,536
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,244
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,941
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,778
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:35,217
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:39,586
Now the fools seeks to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,583
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,528
Gotta get back

14
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:49,032
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,124
Watch out

16
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,429
Gotta get back

17
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,265
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,135
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:56,196
Gotta get back

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,401
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,442 --> 00:00:59,704
Watch out

22
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:00,903
Gotta get back

23
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,311
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:04,746
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:07,273
- Gotta get back
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

26
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,377
Watch--Watch out

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,012
Gotta get back

28
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:13,046
- Jack, Jack, Jack
- Samurai Jack

29
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,921
- Watch--Watch out
- Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

30
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:10,196
That strike you used was a Sun Fist!

31
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:12,259
And you used an Ox Fist and Tiger Claw.

32
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:16,762
And l'll use others.
Monkey Steals the Peach!

33
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:19,037
Countered by...
Dragon Sweeps His Tail.

34
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:24,738
The Shadowless Kick.

35
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:29,242
Countered by Horse Drinking Water?

36
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:34,524
How do you know these techniques?

37
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,526
l am Shaolin, like you.

38
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,221
How can that be?

39
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:40,457
We have been secret for centuries.

40
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:43,091
lf you are truly Shaolin,
you must know...

41
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:49,869
Mantis!

42
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,238
l know it as well as...

43
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,615
Southern Fist.

44
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:06,349
How about Eagle Claw?

45
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,189
Yes! And Water Beetle.

46
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:16,659
lf you know all of this...

47
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,430
then you know
the sign of our secret brotherhood.

48
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:23,162
- Brother.
- Brother.

49
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,768
The Grandmaster must see you.

50
00:06:35,112 --> 00:06:39,173
lt is amazing that you have kept
the temple alive for so long.

51
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:40,945
lt is refreshing to see.

52
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,080
Yes. And because of the wisdom
and guidance of our Grandmaster...

53
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:47,249
we are attaining higher levels.

54
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,982
l see.

55
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,633
Step forward.

56
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,758
Speak, my son.

57
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,522
Grandmaster...

58
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,826
l am the pupil of Master Chu.

59
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:03,799
l am Tan Zang.

60
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:07,326
l was also a pupil of Master Chu...

61
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,339
with you at the temple.

62
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:10,931
How can this be?

63
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:15,104
l remember the day you arrived
at our temple.

64
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,443
l was but a boy then.

65
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:21,281
An emperor's son
had come to learn our ways.

66
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:34,190
You were training for your eventual battle
with the ultimate evil.

67
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:56,344
Eventually, Aku came for us...

68
00:08:56,386 --> 00:09:00,152
and the temple was destroyed.

69
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,719
But the survivors and l
rebuilt the temple in secret.

70
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:09,721
Over time, l became the Grandmaster.

71
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,633
The years passed...

72
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:15,968
and my chi grew more powerful.

73
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:20,170
l became one with nature...

74
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,304
and received energy and nourishment...

75
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:26,009
from the earth itself.

76
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,018
l have attained the highest levels...

77
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,816
of awareness and wisdom.

78
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,255
But look at you--

79
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,419
you have lived as long as l...

80
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:40,919
and you are the same
as when l last saw you--

81
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:42,898
your youth maintained...

82
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:49,361
your chi and the power within you
must be the--the highest of all.

83
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,204
You have surpassed me.

84
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:55,370
Uh, no, Grandmaster,
it is not as it appears.

85
00:09:56,446 --> 00:10:00,780
Aku tricked me
and sent me into the future.

86
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:05,686
l quest to return to the past
and undo the evil that he has done.

87
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:08,350
Aku! His eyes are always watching!

88
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:12,351
l must leave.
l have betrayed your secret.

89
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:16,423
l have revealed you to him.
l should not be here. l must leave!

90
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:19,526
Do not concern yourself...

91
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,537
for we are safe.

92
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,937
Aku cannot see you here...

93
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:27,137
for l shield this location from his vision.

94
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:31,443
You are safer here
than any other place on earth.

95
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:40,456
l must return to my own time.

96
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,052
Yes. To the north,
you will find a mystic temple...

97
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:48,462
guarded by a powerful magic.

98
00:10:48,498 --> 00:10:51,899
Atop this structure, a gateway exists--

99
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:55,894
a gateway that only functions
for a few moments...

100
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,067
when the sun is at its zenith.

101
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:00,406
We know the way.

102
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,241
And we will help you fight.

103
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,974
l am thankful, my brothers.

104
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,073
Thank you for your help, Grandmaster.

105
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,016
lt was good to see you.

106
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:13,720
Farewell, young samurai.

107
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:31,994
That is our goal.

108
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,559
We must reach the top before noon.

109
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,730
Then let us waste no time.

110
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:42,992
lt was nothing.

111
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:08,345
Keep moving!

112
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:31,606
A gateway that only functions...

113
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,132
when the sun is at its zenith.

114
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:49,583
Time is short!

115
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,584
- You must go.
- You must go.

116
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,587
l cannot leave you two like this.

117
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,111
There's no time.

118
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,857
We'll hold them off.

119
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,757
You must go now.

120
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:26,405
He is free. We have done it.

121
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,246
We will not escape this...

122
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,979
but we will die with honor.

123
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,097
Head for the cave!

124
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,635
Get behind the statue.

125
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:32,698
Thank you, brother, for saving us,
but why didn't you enter the time portal?

126
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:36,609
You were prepared to sacrifice.
l was not.

127
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:41,105
But with the portal destroyed,
you will have to find another way home.

128
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:43,276
l am getting used to that.

129
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:45,810
- Watch out
- Gotta get back

130
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,448
- Back to the past, Samurai Jack

135
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,132

Gotta get back

138
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,836
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

139
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,036
Watch out

140
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,813
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

141
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,644
Watch out

142
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,018
Gotta get back

144
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,782
