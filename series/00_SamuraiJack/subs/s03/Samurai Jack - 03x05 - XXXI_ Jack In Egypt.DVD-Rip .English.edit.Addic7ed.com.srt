1
00:00:02,416 --> 00:00:07,183
Long ago in a distant land, l, Aku...

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,951
the shape-shifting master of darkness...

3
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:14,620
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

4
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,425
But a foolish samurai warrior...

5
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:20,092
wielding a magic sword...

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,432
stepped forth to oppose me.

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,140
Before the final blow was struck...

8
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:30,837
l tore open a portal in time...

9
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:32,674
and flung him into the future...

10
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,113
where my evil is law.

11
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:39,482
Now the fool seeks to return to the past...

12
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,479
and undo the future that is Aku.

13
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,523
Got to get back

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,960
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

15
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:49,984
Watch out

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,327
Got to get back

17
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,162
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,031
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

19
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,160
Got to get back

20
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:58,728
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

21
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,761
Watch out

22
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:00,795
Got to get back

23
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,207
Back to the past, Samurai Jack

24
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,642
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

25
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,111
Got to get back

26
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,171
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

27
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,204
Watch--Watch out

28
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,341
Got to get back

29
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,682
- Jack, Jack, Jack
- Samurai Jack

30
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,983
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack

31
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,846
Shh!

32
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,052
l'm going to get you guys.

33
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,510
What is that?

34
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:36,511
l do not know.
l was just going to find that out.

35
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:40,686
lt looks like some kind of tomb,
and there's a story on it.

36
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:45,096
lt says that long ago,
the evil overlord, Set...

37
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:49,067
came and unleashed
his evil minions upon the land.

38
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:53,038
None of the Great Pharaoh's armies
could stop the minions...

39
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:56,133
as they brought terror to all.

40
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:58,872
The pharaoh then called upon
a great power...

41
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:03,906
to imprison the minions here,
in this tomb...

42
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,817
where they will stay forever.

43
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:08,377
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

44
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:13,620
lf the evil minions of Set were
ever to be freed of their prison...

45
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,652
the only salvation would be to--Wha!

46
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,395
What are you children
doing down here?

47
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:25,268
You know better than
to be playing in the temple!

48
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,865
You should be studying.
Where are your teachers?

49
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,070
They know you're not allowed in here,
and so do you!

50
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:34,080
Now get out of here.
Run! Go! Study.

51
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,948
We have found it.

52
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,388
Yes.

53
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:20,825
Yes. Yes!

54
00:06:58,364 --> 00:06:59,353
Whoa.

55
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,427
Ooh.

56
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,277
The ancient prophecies were true.

57
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,983
You are most impressive...

58
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:00,720
minions of Set.

59
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,629
But now that l, the great Aku,
have freed you...

60
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,998
you owe me a service.

61
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:13,734
A samurai warrior
approaches this temple--

62
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:16,401
destroy him!

63
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:56,901
lt seems so familiar...

64
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,968
this place.

65
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,205
The minions of Set!

66
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:17,506
These creatures are more powerful
than anything l have ever encountered.

67
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:20,643
But there must be a way to destroy them.

68
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,193
The prophecy!

69
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:53,783
Where is it? Where is it?

70
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:56,344
Ah!
''lf the evil should ever be freed...

71
00:12:56,388 --> 00:13:00,449
''your only salvation will be to summon
the protector and call the sun.

72
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,119
To do this, you must--''

73
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,914
''You must look for it
at the seat of evil.''

74
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:29,387
Seat of evil? Could it be?

75
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:21,028
Seat of evil, seat of evil.

76
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,200
What could that possibly be?

77
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:25,436
The statue of Set!

78
00:14:46,164 --> 00:14:48,826
The scarab. lt is the key.

79
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,226
But how to get it?

80
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:06,777
''Look for the other half where
the moon hits the sea of reeds.''

81
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,217
What?

82
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,918
Sea of reeds?
What could that mean?

83
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:50,622
Reeds!

84
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,687
Sea of reeds!

85
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:09,844
That's it!

86
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,655
One piece remains.

87
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:27,654
You must look for your salvation
in the crown of the Great Pharaoh.

88
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:21,195
Uh, excuse me.

89
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:24,861
Thank you for destroying
the minions of Set...

90
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:27,531
but, hmm...

91
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:30,666
do you happen to know...

92
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:36,146
where there's a--ahem--time portal?

93
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:47,348
Guess not.

94
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:27,392
Accursed samurai...

95
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:32,460
you have succeeded again
in eluding my effort...

96
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:35,530
but l am not worried.

97
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:39,737
For one day, you will fail.

98
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,810
- Watch out
- Got to get back

99
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:51,378
