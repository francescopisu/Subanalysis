1
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:05,753
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:10,894
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:14,564
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:20,067
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:23,410
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:28,117
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,715
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:35,521
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,462
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:44,457
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,897
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,100
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,141 --> 00:00:54,009
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,640
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,809
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,150
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:07,147
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:09,486
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,793
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:53,858
Peaches.

21
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:12,175
- Well, you know, l like some carrots.
- How about some turnips?

22
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:16,241
Right! Carrots, turnips, what else?

23
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:19,013
A nice bit of onion.

24
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:22,684
Now, hold on a minute,
onions makes his breath reek.

25
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:25,558
And how is that different
from any other day?

26
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,457
That's true.
Your breath always reeks.

27
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:30,829
Righty-oh, onions it is!

28
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,128
Right, let's see.

29
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:36,195
With all these vegetables,
l might like a pinch of spice.

30
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,131
Now, hold on.

31
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:42,008
When you say a pinch of spice,
it better just be a pinch!

32
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:45,036
Yeah! Last time you spiced
the bloody heck out of it!

33
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,242
My mouth was burning for two days!

34
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:50,611
What are you, a bunch of nancies?!

35
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,688
l'm just saying,
this is a nice piece of meat...

36
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:57,955
and l'd like to taste
the natural flavors coming through!

37
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:01,122
All right, all right. Nancies.

38
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,041
Blimey, he's stealing our dinner.

39
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,681
Yes, OK.

40
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,655
Please, l understand,
but you must be quiet.

41
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,801
Please, please be quiet.

42
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,413
Right, come on,
l think l heard him over this way.

43
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:35,857
Blimey, l swear l heard him over here.

44
00:05:41,063 --> 00:05:43,031
Now to find your parents.

45
00:06:37,953 --> 00:06:41,389
There, there, little one.
The fire will keep us warm tonight.

46
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:47,220
My mother used to tell me a story
when l could not sleep.

47
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:49,527
Would you like to hear it?

48
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,089
OK.

49
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:54,398
Long, long ago,
in the land of my ancestors...

50
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:57,428
there lived
an old woodcutter and his wife.

51
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,442
They loved each other very much.

52
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:04,378
Yet they were often sad,
for they had no children.

53
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:08,144
But one day,
the king of heaven smiled upon them...

54
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,617
and sent a gift.

55
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:12,985
As the old woman
was washing some clothes by the river...

56
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:16,685
a huge peach came floating downstream.

57
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,090
She took it home with her.

58
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,722
And when her husband returned home
from chopping wood that evening...

59
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:24,733
she presented
the giant peach for supper.

60
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:28,328
''l have never seen such a marvelous fruit,''
exclaimed the old man.

61
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,928
''Let us taste it right away!''

62
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:34,375
But just before they could slice it,
the peach popped open...

63
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,107
and there stood
a beautiful baby boy.

64
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:40,581
The old couple were shocked,
to say the least.

65
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:42,641
''Don't worry,'' said the boy.

66
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:45,518
''l have been sent from heaven
to be your son.''

67
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:49,388
The couple were overjoyed,
and named their new son...

68
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:52,826
Momotaro,
which means ''peach boy''.

69
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,023
They loved him
with all their hearts.

70
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:58,830
And Momotaro grew
into a fine, strong boy.

71
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:03,132
One day, Peach Boy
went to his parents.

72
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:05,572
''Mother, father,'' he said...

73
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:08,668
''you have been so kind to me,
l want to repay you.''

74
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,908
He told them
he wanted to travel to Ogre lsland...

75
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:16,316
and rid the country of the terrible ogres
that robbed and pillaged the land.

76
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:19,014
The old couple worried
for Momotaro's safety...

77
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:21,716
but they knew he was a special boy.

78
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,517
Along his travels...

79
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:28,997
Momotaro came across a hungry dog,
who meant to bite him.

80
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,556
But he gave the dog
one of the dumplings...

81
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,659
his mother had packed for him instead.

82
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:37,103
''l am going to fight the ogres
on Ogre lsland,'' said Momotaro.

83
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,131
''Then l will help you,''
said the grateful dog.

84
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:45,570
Soon they met an angry monkey,
who threw sticks at them.

85
00:08:45,614 --> 00:08:48,344
Momotaro threw a dumpling
back at the monkey.

86
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:51,012
The monkey's mood quickly changed.

87
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:53,544
And when he learned
of where they were going...

88
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:56,387
the monkey vowed
to help them fight the ogres, too.

89
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:04,029
As the three left the forest,
they met a vigilant pheasant.

90
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,933
The pheasant turned out
to be fond of dumplings...

91
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:09,631
but not fond of ogres at all...

92
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,835
and decided to join Momotaro
on his mission.

93
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,801
When the band of adventurers
reached the sea...

94
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,313
they went to work building a boat...

95
00:09:19,348 --> 00:09:23,045
and soon set sail for Ogre lsland.

96
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:25,485
Momotaro and his friends came ashore...

97
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:28,183
and found an ominous fortress...

98
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:32,216
full of terrible ogres of all kinds.

99
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:39,931
The gate was well-guarded,
but Peach Boy devised a plan.

100
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:43,268
''Pheasant flew over the walls
and attacked the guards!''

101
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:47,742
The ogres swung at him,
but the quick Pheasant dodged their blows.

102
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,802
With the guards distracted,
Monkey climbed the wall...

103
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:54,612
and unlocked the gate,
so that Momotaro and Spotted Dog...

104
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,278
could charge in
and take the ogres by surprise.

105
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,947
lt was a terrible battle.

106
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:02,116
Pheasant pecked the ogres' heads.

107
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:04,216
Dog bit at them.

108
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:06,557
Monkey clawed their faces.

109
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:09,621
And Momotaro swung at them
with his father's ax.

110
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:13,157
At last, the ogres surrendered.

111
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:15,602
They bowed before Momotaro in defeat...

112
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:19,198
and gave him all the treasure
they had stolen...

113
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:23,007
promising to never do
wicked deeds again.

114
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:26,037
The four friends heaped
the treasure onto their boat...

115
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:30,950
and sailed home to give it back
to the people of Peach Boy's land.

116
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:34,786
The woodcutter and his wife were
overjoyed to see their son return safely.

117
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:40,693
And with Momotaro home,
he and his family lived very, very happily.

118
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,428
Yes, yes, little one.
l, too, am hungry.

119
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,795
But l know not where to find breakfast
for one such as you.

120
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:25,191
My goodness,
what a hungry little fellow.

121
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:28,560
Are you feeling better with a full belly?

122
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,497
Yes. Me, too.

123
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:33,160
We'd best get on the road then, my friend.

124
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:36,330
Are you ready to travel?
You look ready.

125
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:40,364
Very strong, and ready to go.
Yes, you do.

126
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,899
Let us go.

127
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:30,889
You are a cagey rascal, yes.

128
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:34,054
But now that l have got you,
l am not letting go of you.

129
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:37,998
Oh, no, l am not.
l am not letting go of you.

130
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,413
Please do not cry. lt is all right.

131
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,811
Samurai Jack, prepare yourself...

132
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,213
for you are my bounty.

133
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:39,624
Wait! Look!
Look over here.

134
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,700
We must find your parents.

135
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,542
Please, no, do not get sick.

136
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:38,110
Please, do not get sick.

137
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:01,436
Do not worry, my little friend.

138
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:04,809
My mother made this for me
when l was not feeling well.

139
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:08,646
A little water and herbs
will do wonders for one's spirit.

140
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:16,714
Here, this will make you feel better.

141
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,726
Please, you must.

142
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:26,564
Perhaps some food.
Would you like some food?

143
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:39,372
Perhaps this will give you some strength.

144
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,776
You must have something.

145
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:48,585
What? What?
What would you like?

146
00:17:49,624 --> 00:17:51,854
- What?
- Momo.

147
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,262
Well, well.

148
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,427
What do we have here?

149
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:37,529
lt's the skinny bloke who stole our dinner.

150
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:45,001
Don't worry, little baby.
We won't harm you.

151
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:48,345
At least not until supper time.

152
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:12,967
68, 43, 7 1!

153
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:15,272
l'm gonna stomp your bones!

154
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:50,908
Go get him!

155
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:37,489
l got it! l got it! l got it!

156
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,821
My baby! My baby!

157
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:15,455
Thank you, kind sir.

158
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:18,159
l thought l'd never see
my precious again.

159
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:21,464
There, there, baby.
Mama's got you now.

160
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,437
Precious? What...what is it?

161
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,909
What...
What have you done to my baby?!

162
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:35,006
l am afraid your son has seen
many things on our travels...

163
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,575
and has now achieved <i>sa</i>k<i>ai</i>...

164
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,610
the spirit of the samurai.

165
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:47,961
Momotaro!

166
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:49,986
" Watch out! "

167
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:55,162
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

168
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,732
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

169
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:03,766
" Watch out! "

170
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:07,646
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

171
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:12,642
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

172
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,245
" Watch out! "
