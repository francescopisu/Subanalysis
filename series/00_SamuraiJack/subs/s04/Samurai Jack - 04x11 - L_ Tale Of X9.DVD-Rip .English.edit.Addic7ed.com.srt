1
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:05,741
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:10,883
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:14,553
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:20,055
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,399
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:28,106
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:32,703
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:35,510
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:39,485
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,456
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,886
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:50,089
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,998
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:58,630
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,672 --> 00:00:59,798
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,139
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:07,135
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,475
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:13,782
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,028
Lulu, sweet thing.

21
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,297
l miss her.

22
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:41,272
l hate the rain.
lt makes me all sentimental.

23
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:47,072
You're probably wondering
what an old robot like myself is doing...

24
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:49,104
having all these feelings.

25
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,781
Well, l'll tell you...

26
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,085
but we gotta go back,
way back to the beginning.

27
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:59,455
Aku's beginning.

28
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:04,692
Ages ago, Aku slowly rose to power
and enslaved the world.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,567
But he wasn't fast enough.

30
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:11,434
He needed an army.

31
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,974
A robot army.

32
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,314
Aku's evil scientists began to build.

33
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:23,269
The first models were crude.

34
00:04:31,284 --> 00:04:35,152
But as time progressed,
the scientists got better.

35
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,088
Much better.

36
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:43,556
We were the X-models.
Lean, mean, and all machine.

37
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,963
Except me.

38
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:01,907
See, one of the scientists...

39
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:06,009
installed an experimental
emotion chip inside of me.

40
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:11,021
Why?
He was funny that way.

41
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:51,155
Emotions are bad news
for somebody in my profession.

42
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,375
l began to have feelings.

43
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:17,920
l started to understand
right from wrong...

44
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:21,324
and what l did was very wrong.

45
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,617
l became the best.

46
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,021
The emotions helped.

47
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:01,591
ln a bad scrape,
the other X-models couldn't care.

48
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,936
l cared.

49
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:11,940
l got angry. lt wasn't pretty.

50
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:46,469
But then, l met Lulu, sweet thing.

51
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,258
l retired.

52
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,561
The last X-model left.

53
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:12,836
l was lucky, too, because those scientists
made a new breed of robots.

54
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,474
Bugbots or something like that.

55
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:21,446
l didn't care, though.

56
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:24,416
Me and Lulu had a good thing.

57
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,987
Music.

58
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,524
We love music.

59
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,429
Lulu, sweet thing.

60
00:08:58,218 --> 00:08:59,810
Time passed, but...

61
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:04,017
it made no difference to us
until Lulu disappeared.

62
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,491
Seems like Aku
got himself a little problem.

63
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:17,992
A problem that won't go away.

64
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,767
A samurai problem.

65
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:26,639
l wanted nothing to do with it...

66
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,740
but that funny scientist
informed Aku of my emotions.

67
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,924
They'd got Lulu.

68
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:47,028
Sweet thing.

69
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,057
l had no choice.

70
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,503
l came out of retirement.

71
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:39,377
Tracking the Samurai wasn't difficult.

72
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:46,048
The new bug, beetlebots, or whatever,
were no match.

73
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:51,321
The Samurai's good, real good.

74
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,284
l've never seen such talent.

75
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:31,460
l'm not sure
if l even have a chance.

76
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:37,807
But l gotta try...

77
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,938
for Lulu, sweet thing.

78
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:15,647
Well, that brings us
back to the beginning.

79
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,674
The Samurai is shacked up
in that old robot factory.

80
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:23,054
Kind of ironic, huh?

81
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:31,720
As soon as the rain stops,
l'll go in and get him.

82
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:37,967
For Lulu, sweet thing.

83
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,381
l hate the rain.

84
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,896
Lulu... Take care of Lulu...

85
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,200
Sweet thing.

86
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,148
" Watch out! "

87
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:53,324
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

88
00:20:57,403 --> 00:21:01,100
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

89
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,232
" Watch out! "

90
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:06,005
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

91
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:10,846
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

92
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:12,407
" Watch out! "

93
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:21,615
" Watch out! "

94
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,323
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

95
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:26,388
" Watch out! "
