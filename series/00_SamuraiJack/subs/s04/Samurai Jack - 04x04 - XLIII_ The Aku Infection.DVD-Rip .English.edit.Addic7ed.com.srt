1
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:05,835
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,976
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:14,647
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:20,149
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:23,493
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,200
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:32,729
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:35,606
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:39,544
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,540
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:48,980
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:50,182
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,092
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:58,723
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,765 --> 00:00:59,891
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:03,232
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:07,206
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:09,568
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,013
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,742
Destroy him.

21
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:28,972
No, l will not fight you today.

22
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,317
l don't feel good.

23
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,332
Father?

24
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,891
Mother?

25
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,456
Not too smart, is it?

26
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:48,484
Going out into a blizzard
with just a funny robe and sandals?

27
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,326
You could catch your death
out there or worse.

28
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:53,855
The storm should pass by tomorrow.

29
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,130
You can rest here till then.

30
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,070
Here. This will give you
your strength back.

31
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:01,904
Thank you.
You are very kind.

32
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:05,275
lt's OK.
Just be careful next time.

33
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,803
That weather out there is no joke.

34
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,783
We've been mining up here
for the last five years.

35
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:14,981
We've managed to mine
these three priceless stones.

36
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:19,583
One more, we can retire
and leave this blasted mountain.

37
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:22,390
Will you stop with the showing off?!

38
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:26,559
Pretty soon, the whole mountain's
gonna know about those.

39
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,966
No need to worry, my friends.

40
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:32,028
Your secret is safe with me.

41
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:34,438
l owe you both my life.

42
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:37,136
What's with your hand there?

43
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:39,111
l don't know.

44
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,280
lt will not come off.

45
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:48,284
You better get some rest.

46
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,222
You sure you don't need anything?

47
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:59,494
No. Thank you.
l will be fine.

48
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:03,731
Brave kid.
Not too smart, but brave.

49
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,131
lt is still very cold.

50
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,412
Help!

51
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:20,811
Help!

52
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:23,617
Help...

53
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,784
Help.

54
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:29,056
- Can l help you?
- Boy, am l glad to see you!

55
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:31,620
l thought l'd never get out of here.

56
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:35,431
There l was, just checking out the view,
and it is beautiful, mind you...

57
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:39,336
when suddenly the floor
started to give way beneath me.

58
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:41,863
Luckily, this rope...

59
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,608
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine. How are you doing?

60
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,879
l am sorry.
Must have slipped.

61
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,547
No problem.
Don't even worry about it.

62
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:59,423
But if you could pull me up soon,
that would be good, too.

63
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,088
And why should l?
What's in it for me?

64
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:07,593
l'll give you anything you want,
just don't drop me, please!

65
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:10,102
Drop you? l will save you.

66
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,931
OK, so what do you want?

67
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,943
l do not want anything.

68
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,275
Except everything you've got.

69
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:22,304
l will accept nothing
for only doing what is right.

70
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,817
You're gonna pay,
or l shall drop you.

71
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:27,547
No, do not worry.
l will pull you up.

72
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:30,420
Come on!
Give me some money.

73
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:33,085
Please, we must hurry
before the rope breaks.

74
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:35,720
You know, never mind.

75
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:39,563
l think l'm just going
to stay here for a while and...

76
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,294
check out the view some more.

77
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:45,202
- Are you certain?
- Yeah.

78
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,298
Very well,
if that is what you desire.

79
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:53,310
But it's pretty stupid,
if you ask me.

80
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:26,264
l think...

81
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:29,002
you owe me an apology.

82
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:32,809
l said...

83
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,144
you owe me an apology.

84
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:40,047
l'm gonna give you
until the count of three.

85
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,052
One.

86
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,055
Two.

87
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:48,922
Three.

88
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:30,162
l feel so...

89
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:32,467
l feel...

90
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,473
stronger!

91
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,538
No! No!
This cannot be happening.

92
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:40,341
Oh, yes, it can.

93
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:44,714
Must keep control.

94
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,379
Yeah! Got to get a grip.

95
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,823
Need help. The monks! l...

96
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:56,989
l'd better find those accursed monks!

97
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,594
Must find...

98
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:33,855
Yes?

99
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,869
- l am Jack.
- Oh, yes.

100
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:39,963
We have been awaiting
your arrival for many days.

101
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:43,942
The master was worried
an ill fate had befallen you.

102
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,774
Please, this way.

103
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:13,171
Master Ning...

104
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:15,640
l am sorry to disturb
your meditation...

105
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:17,734
but Jack, he has arrived.

106
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:27,648
Yes, the Wandering Samurai.

107
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,518
We were worried about you.

108
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:33,048
We began to wonder
if your quest had ended.

109
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:35,720
But we are glad
you are with us now.

110
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:38,595
Again, we extend our invitation.

111
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:42,499
We believe the Pool of Convergence
may be of use to you.

112
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:46,494
All factors of time and existence
converge here...

113
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:49,201
and form
an interdimensional nexus...

114
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:51,710
which we gaze into to study...

115
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:55,646
the infinite facets of reality.

116
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:58,549
We have never attempted
a physical journey...

117
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:01,213
but with proper conditioning
you would be able...

118
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:06,021
to step into this crossroads
and find your way home.

119
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,024
You seem weary, brother Jack.

120
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:13,692
Come! The purity of our spring
will refresh you.

121
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,066
Come, come.
Tell us of your quest.

122
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:19,594
What is it you seek?

123
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,475
l...

124
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,875
l seek...

125
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:36,852
l seek to foil the Samurai...

126
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,791
to destroy his dream
of returning home...

127
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:44,991
and to destroy
all who stand in my way!

128
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:52,334
Brothers, the pool!

129
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:13,722
Yes, slaughtering pathetic whelps...

130
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,491
is the perfect way
to loosen up...

131
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,794
before l really...

132
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:23,599
desecrate things.

133
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:20,146
Forgive me.

134
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:27,824
Be strong, my son.
You are gravely ill.

135
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,660
Aku's very essence
is creeping through your veins...

136
00:16:31,697 --> 00:16:35,133
possessing your body,
poisoning your mind.

137
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:38,467
lt means to devour your spirit.

138
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:42,531
Please...help me.

139
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,736
l beg you.

140
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:51,280
We are doing what we can
to stave the illness of the flesh...

141
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,115
but we can only slow the sickness.

142
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:57,486
You have been infected
by pure evil...

143
00:16:57,523 --> 00:17:01,152
which can only be purged
by the light of good...

144
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,219
the good within you.

145
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,227
l cannot.

146
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:10,963
You must help me.

147
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,630
l am sorry.

148
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:17,041
This is a sickness
only <i>you</i> can truly cure.

149
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:20,102
No...No...

150
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:22,307
You must. You...

151
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:27,084
You worthless, wrinkled grub!

152
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,418
l'll have you for dinner, you worm!

153
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:33,550
l'll eat every last monk
in this hole.

154
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,527
l'll devour you all...

155
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:38,928
just as l have consumed the Samurai!

156
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:45,560
Cannot fight it.

157
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:48,005
Not alone.

158
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,406
Cannot do it alone.

159
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:54,345
You are not alone, my son.

160
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,816
We are always
with you here.

161
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,375
Here, in your heart...

162
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,877
the place we will make
our stand against this evil.

163
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:06,949
But l was not there for you.

164
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:11,555
Nonsense.
Aku's victories are not your failures.

165
00:18:11,597 --> 00:18:14,259
The struggle against Aku is arduous...

166
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,327
and none have fought
more bravely than you, my son.

167
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:20,703
You have won many victories...

168
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,143
rekindling hope in the hearts
of those you have protected.

169
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:27,077
Each sends their blessing.

170
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:35,443
Each blessing
a stone to fortify this land.

171
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,391
Your castle is strong, my son.

172
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:48,229
Your allies are many.

173
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,895
Wield what lies within...

174
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,437
and reclaim what is yours.

175
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:02,504
Break the siege of darkness.

176
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:37,367
Master Ning...

177
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,471
how can you forgive one
who has raised his sword against you...

178
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:43,778
and defiled your sanctuary so?

179
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:47,274
Although the Pool of Convergence
is destroyed...

180
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,685
the nexus still exists.

181
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:53,123
ln time, we will reconstruct the gateway.

182

As for you...

183
00:20:54,693 --> 00:20:57,890
had you not defeated
the demon within...

184
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,457

We owe you our lives.

" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

194
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,187
