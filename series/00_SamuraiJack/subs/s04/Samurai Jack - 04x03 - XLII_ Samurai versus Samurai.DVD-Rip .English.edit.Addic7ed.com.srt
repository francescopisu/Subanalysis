1
00:00:02,243 --> 00:00:05,269
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:10,341
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:14,013
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:19,550
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:22,893
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,132 --> 00:00:27,566
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:32,096
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:34,972
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,911
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:43,906
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:48,346
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:49,549
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,458
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:58,090
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:59,258
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,599
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:06,562
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:08,935
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:13,242
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,313
l would like some hot water, please.

21
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,513

24
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,287
" All right "

25
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,936

Don't call me bad.

l'm the samurai dude
who invented rude.

33
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:15,819
There ain't no stoppin'

34
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,260
And this here is my mama.

35
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,499
Don't you be talkin' bad 'bout my mama
or she'll give you a whoopin'.

36
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:26,802
Ain't that right, mama?

37
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:29,773
That's right, baby.

38
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,940
'Cause...l...am...

39
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,779
Da Samurai!

40
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,824
Catch, sucka!

41
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,090
Wassup, fellas?

42
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,726
Nice hat.

43
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:59,172
That's better.

44
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,214
Yeah! Now, that's what l'm talking 'bout.

45
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:20,151
What kind of swill
are you trying to serve me?

46
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,129
Now, you lucky l'm in a good mood...

47
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:26,099
'cause mama would knock you out.

48
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:30,967
Well, hello.
l didn't see you up on the menu.

49
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,030
You must be the chef's special...

50
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:37,100
'cause you sure ain't no appetizer!
Hey, now!

51
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,044
Release the female.

52
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,680
'Scuze me, darlin'.

53
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:47,516
lt's whoopin' time.

54
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:55,323
Look out!

55
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:58,126
lt's helicopter time.

56
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,995
Here it comes.

57
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,066
The crazy eight!

58
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:17,343
Then there's the sucker punch.
Did you look up?

59
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,615
Sucka! Yeah!

60
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:23,748
And finally, the monk dunk!

61
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,052
Monk...

62
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:28,853

63
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,957
Any more suckas

64
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,662
Oh, you want some?

65
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:45,008
That's right!
Nobody messes with Da Samurai.

66
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,345
Now, gimme something l can really drink!

67
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:51,180
Yes. Yes, sir.

68
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,182
Bounty hunters!

69
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:19,673
Samurai Jack!

70
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:23,874
Yes, Samurai, it is l.

71
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,514
These are my newest
and mightiest assassins.

72
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,683
Bye-bye, Samurai.

73
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:36,128
Destroy him. Destroy him!

74
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:20,402
More hot water, please.

75
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:23,740
So you're Samurai Jack?

76
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:27,406
The poser who's been biting my style.

77
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:30,440
Nah, that's all right, son.
You looked pretty good out there.

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,724
Thank you.

81
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,126
Say what? Say what?

82
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:46,292
Yo, no, don't you turn your back
and walk away from me!

83
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,891
Didn't you hear who l am?

84
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,926
l believe everyone heard who you are.

85
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,028
Say what?!

86
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:54,206
Snap! lt's like that, huh?

87
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,733
Well, here's a 4-1-1,
Samurai Jack.

88
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,144

89
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,512
and, you see, you are a samurai...

90
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,074
but there can only be <i>one</i> samurai.

91
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,815
So me and you

00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:11,450

96
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,803
You got to be kidding me!

97
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:27,534
You know, l think l done figured it out.
You're scared to fight me!

98
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:31,101
You don't want none of this.
That's right, isn't it?

99
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,777
Thank you very much.

100
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,685

00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,235
Well, let's get this party started, fool!

105
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,862
Outside.

106
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:35,466
We will fight outside
in the shadow of leaves.

107
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,533
What?

108
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:43,516
Yeah, but it's raining...
Oh, l get it.

109
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,678
l wouldn't want to spoil
your reputation for you.

110
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:07,940
All right, Jack.

111
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,248
Draw.

112
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:38,062
- What the heck is that?
- lt is your weapon.

113
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,601
Man, l didn't say
l wanted to go fishin'.

114
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:46,772
You got to be kiddin' me with that!

115
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:51,614
You crazy.
l like it. l do like it.

116
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:55,986
Draw your weapon and quit stallin'.
Baby, l'm ready to get maulin'!

117
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:58,423
lt is your weapon
that remains to be drawn.

118
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,588
Man, l said l ain't gonna fight you
with that old toothpick.

119
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,655
You have not yet earned
the right to face my blade.

120
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,259
Earn your...?

121
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:10,270
All right, fine.

122
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:12,738
l'll earn your blade.
Now, come on!

123
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,905
Well, come on!
l ain't got all night!

124
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,780
Got to save some time for the honeys.

125
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:26,217
He who runs with aggression
walks without dignity.

126
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:31,680
Now l see your tactics.
You gonna bore me to death.

127
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,996
You can never defeat another
if you know not how to defeat yourself.

128
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,229
Man, what is this, story time?

129
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,353
Man!

130
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,322
l'm gonna tear you a new...

131
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,790
You know how much
l paid for those things?!

132
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,926
He who wears a mask
cannot see what lies within himself.

133
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,368
Now, what the heck
is that supposed to mean?

134
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,338
l'll teach you to play me the fool!

135
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,645
Why, you...

136
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:15,757
The shell of an oyster
only hides the pearl inside.

137
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,499
What kind of...

138
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:55,595
l'm finished playing around
with these old silly sticks.

139
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:58,934
When l finish you off,
l'm gonna do it with a man's weapon...

140
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,065
not some old...

141
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,202
Don't you be shushing me
when l'm talking!

142
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:07,680
- Now, l told you that l'm...
- Be quiet!

143
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,213
Later, Jack!

144
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,333
Man!

145
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,173
l guess l...

146
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,009
l guess l ain't so bad after all.

147
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,249
Man, that was pretty amazing.

148
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:41,878
Look out!

149
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,727
You have taken the first step...

150
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,595
toward the true path
to the way of the samurai.

151
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:07,940
Yo, <i>sensei</i>!
What's the second lesson?

152
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:12,070
What's tomorrow, three and four?
You got a videotape l can look at?

153
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,579
Gimme some homework, man!

154
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:16,275
Should l just think
positive thoughts? Wassup?

155
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,240
" Watch out! "

156
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:24,416
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

157
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,090
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

158
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:33,121
" Watch out! "

159
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,034
" Got to get back, back to the past,

160
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,939
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

161
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,499
" Watch out! "

162
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,540
" Watch out! "

163
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:56,351
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

164
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,378
" Watch out! "
