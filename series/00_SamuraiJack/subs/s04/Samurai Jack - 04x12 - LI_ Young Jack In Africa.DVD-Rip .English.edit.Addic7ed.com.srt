1
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,841
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:10,983
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:14,653
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:20,156
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,499
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:28,206
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:32,803
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:35,610
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,551
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:44,546
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:48,986
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,189
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,098
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,168 --> 00:00:58,729
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,772 --> 00:00:59,898
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,239
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:07,236
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,575
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:13,882
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:02,118
You are truly the Emperor's son.

21
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:04,653
You look just like him.

22
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:13,204
Yes, l know.
Your presence here means only one thing.

23
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,673
Aku has returned.

24
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:20,575
And you, little samurai,
have become the world's only hope.

25
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,845
This will be your new home.

26
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,416
Your training begins tonight.

27
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,239
Your father, the Emperor,
shortly after you were born...

28
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,908
gathered together the chiefs
of all the great tribes of the world.

29
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,076
We devised a plan.

30
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:08,144
A plan that would prepare you
for the ultimate battle...

31
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,712
against the ultimate evil.

32
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,215
Aku must be destroyed...

33
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,321
and only <i>you</i> can wield
your father's magic sword.

34
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:21,323
Together, you are the one instrument
that can stop this evil.

35
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:27,805
But tonight,
you will become one of us.

36
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:33,475
This represents the lion,
the mightiest of earth's creatures.

37
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,538
lts courage and strength unmatched.

38
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:41,076
This is the mark of rain,
nature's greatest asset.

39
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:45,080
lt has the power to give life
and to take it away.

40
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,356
And this sun is you, little samurai.

41
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,059
For you are the one light...

42
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,034
that will stand against
the coming darkness.

43
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:01,696
Now come.
Your new family is anxious to meet you.

44
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,694
l am the son of the chief of these people.

45
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,459
l am their future king!

46
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,325
My son, l see
you have met your new brother.

47
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,600
l hardly think he is fitting
of a prince's brother, father.

48
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,472
Son, you will show some respect!

49
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,705
And this is your new brother,
like it or not.

50
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:40,872
Yes, father.

51
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,621
This is the Umlangata.

52
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:25,522
lt is made
from our land's strongest trees.

53
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:28,322
We have five styles of technique.

54
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:30,329
The cheetah.

55
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:34,830
The monkey.

56
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,335
The snake.

57
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,839
The scorpion.

58
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:51,341
And the antelope.

59
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,495
Enough!

60
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:04,653
Come, let me show you our land.

61
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,058
Find the boy!

62
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:22,074
We cannot find him.

63
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:24,635
The great evil spirit
has promised us great treasure...

64
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,798
if we deliver the little child of light skin.

65
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,673
No.

66
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:38,375
l think your training here is complete.

67
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,509
" Watch out! "

68
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:54,686
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

69
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:02,461
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

70
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:03,593
" Watch out! "

71
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:07,367
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

72
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:12,207
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

73
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:13,768
" Watch out! "

74
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:22,976
" Watch out! "

75
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:26,685
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

76
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:27,749
" Watch out! "
