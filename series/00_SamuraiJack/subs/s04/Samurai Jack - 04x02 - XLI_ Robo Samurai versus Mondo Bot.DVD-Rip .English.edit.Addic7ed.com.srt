1
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,897
Long ago, in a distant land...

2
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:10,930
l, Aku, the shape-shifting
Master of Darkness...

3
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:14,603
unleashed an unspeakable evil!

4
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:20,106
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword...

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,449
stepped forth to oppose me.

6
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:28,190
Before the final blow was struck...

7
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:32,685
l tore open a portal in time,
and flung him into the future...

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,562
where my evil is law!

9
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:39,797
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past...

10
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:44,466
and undo the future that is Aku!

11
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:48,971
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

12
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:50,138
" Watch out! "

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,014
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

14
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:58,749
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

15
00:00:58,789 --> 00:00:59,949
" Watch out! "

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,221
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

17
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,152
" Got to get back "

18
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:09,592
" Watch out! "

19
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:13,694
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "
" Watch out! "

20
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:03,632
There is no escape.

21
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,144
Unpredictable.

22
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:53,854
lllogical.

23
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:14,503
lmpossible.

24
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:34,627
He is The One.

25
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,491
Quickly, rescue him!

26
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:44,930
Do not be alarmed.
You are in fine operating condition.

27
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:06,155
- Where am l?
- You are in the city of Andromeda.

28
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:08,350
Well, the city is up there.

29
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:11,258
You're down here
in the sewers of Andromeda...

30
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,387
our home.

31
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,694
How did l get here?

32
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:21,397
Well, you were in a battle,
a battle with Mondo-bot...

33
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:24,965
and you were not doing so badly.

34
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,704
But he is too powerful!
Damn him!

35
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:29,905
Who is this Mondo-bot?

36
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:32,141
Come with me. l will explain.

37
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:42,489
Our city needed a protector,
so we built Mondo-bot...

38
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,653
the most powerful
defense unit ever created...

39
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:49,426
able to protect us
against any oppressor.

40
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,161
But something went wrong.

41
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,066
Horribly wrong.

42
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,799
The Mondo-bot turned on us.

43
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,605
He began to attack
and destroy everything.

44
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:02,202
We have lived here ever since.

45
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:04,509
l am sorry.

46
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:08,005
l wish there was something l could do.

47
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:09,609
Well, there is.

48
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,348
You see, you are The One.

49
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,583
- The One?
- Yes.

50
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:19,493
We built Andromeda
on a magical ancient city of giants.

51
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:27,201
Giants that are capable
of destroying the Mondo-bot.

52
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:32,236
l still do not understand
how this involves me.

53
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:36,006
Well, you wield the same weapon
as the giants.

54
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,069
Show me!

55
00:08:37,113 --> 00:08:39,081
Swim into the city of giants.

56
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:41,606
There. That will make you
breathe under water.

57
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,245
There, you will find the key.

58
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:49,560
" Watch out! "

59
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:53,063
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

60
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,133
" Watch out! "

61
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:02,344
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

62
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:03,476
" Watch out! "

63
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,250
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

64
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,090
" Got to get back, back to the past,
Samurai Jack "

65
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:13,651
" Watch out! "

66
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,859
" Watch out! "

67
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:26,636
" Got to get back, Samurai Jack "

68
00:22:26,675 --> 00:22:27,699
" Watch out! "
