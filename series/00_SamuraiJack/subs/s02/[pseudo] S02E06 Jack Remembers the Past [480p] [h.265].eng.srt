00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,374
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,146
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:12,916
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:18,358
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,125
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,172
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,836
We are free.

12
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,411
Thank you.
Thank you for saving us...

13
00:03:57,582 --> 00:04:00,779
...from the tyranny of the Cossacks.

14
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,304
Can it be?

15
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,471
My home.

16
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,275
Father. Mother.

17
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:20,568
Well, look what l found.

18
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,867
Almost.

19
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,585
Dry your tears, my son...

20
00:19:44,762 --> 00:19:47,731
...for nothing worth having
is easily attained.

21
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:51,595
Sometimes you must fight
for what is yours...

22
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:54,067
...and for what you believe in.

23
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:56,235
Remember, my son...

24
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,773
...it is not one's outward brawn...

25
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:04,347
...but rather one's inner strength
that makes them mighty.

26
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:42,651
What was that?

27
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,288
Hey, where's the ball?

28
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,057
<i>Help!</i>

29
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,125
<i>Help, anyone!</i>

30
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,387
<i>Help! Our village is being attacked.</i>

31
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,896
Y<i>ou must help us!</i>
