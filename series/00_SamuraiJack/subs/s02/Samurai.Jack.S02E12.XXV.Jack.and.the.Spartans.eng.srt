1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,307
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:08,977
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:13,250
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,158
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,096
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,801
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,341
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,140
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:24,426
<i>Long ago, he came to us</i>
<i>in our time of need.</i>

12
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:27,588
<i>His name was</i> J<i>ack.</i>

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,260
<i>Nothing would be the same.</i>

14
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,998
-You have won.
-No, we have not.

15
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:02,071
Come. We go to meet the king.

16
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,766
My lord.

17
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,532
My king.

18
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,279
Did you hold the right flank?

19
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:13,442
We suffered many casualties,
but held our position.

20
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:16,584
Your numbers have dwindled.

21
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:19,724
l fear you will not survive
another attack.

22
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:23,292
No, my king. We will never give up.
We will fight.

23
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:28,298
Yes. l know you will not fail me.

24
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,981
Brotok, who is this you bring before me?

25
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,779
My king, this is the stranger
who aided me in battle.

26
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,488
This battle is of no concern to you.
Why did you fight?

27
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:54,352
l saw this warrior outnumbered.

28
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,586
l meant no disrespect. l apologize.

29
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:07,133
Wait! These years of war have made
my words harsh and my tone insolent.

30
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:11,503
Any man brave enough
to face these monsters is a friend.

31
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,837
What is this war?

32
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:19,981
Long ago, a mechanical beast
went mad...

33
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:23,382
...and waged war against all in its path.

34
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:25,989
<i>It feeds off the land itself...</i>

35
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:29,024
<i>...growing larger, powerful.</i>

36
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:31,856
<i>All the neighboring kingdoms have fallen.</i>

37
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,362
<i>We are the last.</i>

38
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:38,161
<i>The beast desperately wants our lands...</i>

39
00:07:38,336 --> 00:07:40,930
<i>...for our home is beautiful...</i>

40
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:42,334
<i>...peaceful...</i>

41
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:45,135
<i>...rich in resources.</i>

42
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:49,605
<i>The beast and its robots</i>
<i>would have destroyed us ages ago...</i>

43
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:55,048
<i>...but our land is protected</i>
<i>by the tallest of mountains...</i>

44
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,850
<i>...and a narrow ravine</i>
<i>is the only entrance.</i>

45
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:06,624
<i>It was there, with only 300 men,</i>
<i>that we stopped the beast,s armies.</i>

46
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
<i>The position was easy to defend...</i>

47
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:15,334
<i>...and their superior numbers</i>
<i>were made worthless.</i>

48
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:24,381
Y<i>ear after year, the war went on.</i>

49
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:46,626
<i>But the battle became a stalemate...</i>

50
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:53,171
<i>...for this creature strips</i>
<i>the battlefield clear of its fallen...</i>

51
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:57,804
<i>...to rebuild its army again and again.</i>

52
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,810
<i>And so it goes.</i>

53
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:27,101
<i>And I am the fifth king</i>
<i>to defend this gateway.</i>

54
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:37,118
And tomorrow will bring the same.

55
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:45,793
There is another way.

56
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:47,462
What do you mean?

57
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,664
There is a path through the mountains.

58
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:50,857
-What?
-How?

59
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,627
-Tell us about it.
-How can that be?

60
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:54,131
How wide is this path?

61
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:57,968
Wide enough to move through sideways,
weapons held in front and behind.

62
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,303
-How long to complete the journey?
-Half a day.

63
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:03,646
-Will you show us this path?
-Of course.

64
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,646
This war ends now!

65
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:10,049
Fifty of my best men will join me
in a strike against the beast itself...

66
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,655
...while the rest stay here
and defend our position.

67
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,620
While the monsters attack us,
we will attack them!

68
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,555
You must stay.

69
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,392
But l must be at your side.

70
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:25,729
l need you here.

71
00:10:25,904 --> 00:10:32,070
For if anything should happen to me,
you will be king, my son.

72
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:35,212
l will not fail you, Father.

73
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:59,964
Forward, my brothers!

74
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,746
Look. There.

75
00:12:57,388 --> 00:13:00,551
The last of its army has left.

76
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,460
Our time has come!

77
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,126
Spears ready!

78
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,186
Fire!

79
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,870
Porcupine!

80
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:42,383
Disperse!

81
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:59,228
<i>The war was finally over...</i>

82
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:03,100
<i>...but the warrior was gone.</i>

83
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,747
<i>His shield was all that was left.</i>

84
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:17,345
<i>This stranger who became a brother...</i>

85
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:22,481
...aided us in our time of need
and made a difference.

86
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:26,590
His sacrifice, and that of the others...

87
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:33,101
...defeated our enemy, saved our lands
and ensured our freedom.

88
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:37,707
They will be honored
and remembered forever...

89
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,106
...the 300 plus one.

90
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,580
But l believe the one survived.

91
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,651
A warrior that great...

92
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,551
...could not be stopped so easily.

93
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:48,034
