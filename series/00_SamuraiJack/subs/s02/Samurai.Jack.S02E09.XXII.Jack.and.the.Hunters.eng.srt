00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:04,340
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:09,579
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,760
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,738
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,191
Greetings, lmacandi.

12
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:22,697
l am Aku, master of the planet Earth.

13
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:27,965
l have traveled far to offer you
the greatest hunt.

14
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,802
A great prey runs free on my planet...

15
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:36,073
...terrorizing all that l have worked for.

16
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:42,084
Many have attempted to capture
this elusive target.

17
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,948
l present this challenge to you,
lmacandi...

18
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:53,962
...for you are the greatest hunters
of the universe.

19
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:59,296
l bring you countless treasure
if you accept.

20
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:03,640
And if you succeed,
the skies will darken...

21
00:06:04,476 --> 00:06:09,846
...and a rain of priceless jewels
will flood your world...

22
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:16,443
...making you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

23
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:24,218
Our race has existed
for countless eons.

24
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:28,831
The hunt is our way of life.
lt runs through our veins.

25
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,369
lt makes us rich.
Rich beyond material wealth.

26
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:38,100
We accept your challenge,
but we need not your treasure.

27
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:41,335
Our reward is the thrill of the hunt...

28
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:44,947
...for we are lmacandi.

29
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:51,852
Yes, you are truly unique creatures.

30
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:55,686
l wish you a good hunt.

31
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:27,102
This was a waste of our time.

32
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:29,906
This prey is not worthy to continue.

33
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:34,415
Let us inform Aku
that he can have his prize.

34
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:36,577
Aku? No!

35
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,415
l will not be delivered to Aku
like some animal.

36
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,973
We hunt, my brothers.

37
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:59,867
Never before have l encountered hunters
of such caliber.

38
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,813
Excuse me.
l must commandeer your chariot.

39
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:38,052
Like heck you will--
Hey, man, you,re on it backwards!

40
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:01,104
Congratulations, lmacandi.

41
00:20:01,278 --> 00:20:06,875
You are undoubtedly
the greatest hunters of the universe.

42
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:09,951
All that have preceded failed.

43
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,418
But you...

44
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:14,149
...you have captured the one being...

45
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:18,489
...who ran free on this world of mine.

46
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:22,428
Yes, truly this was
our greatest hunt...

47
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,296
...and this samurai
has proven himself...

48
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:29,030
...as the mightiest
and most elusive of prey.

49
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,741
Yes, yes.
Now, please hand him to me.

50
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:34,008
-No.
-What?!

51
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:35,338
l cannot.

52
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:39,142
A prey that has provided
such an intense and noble hunt...

53
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,181
...has earned its right to run free.

54
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:43,784
lt is the way of the lmacandi.

55
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:48,186
lnsolent fool!
l will take what is mine.

56
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,520
No, you will not!

57
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,427
No!

58
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:17,552
What happened? Where am l?

59
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,263
Y<i>ou have given us the greatest hunt.</i>

60
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,592
Y<i>ou have earned your freedom.</i>

61
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:34,568
<i>It is our way, the Imacandi way.</i>

62
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:47,579
R<i>un free,</i> S<i>amurai</i> J<i>ack.</i>

63
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:50,345
R<i>un free.</i>
