1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:04,238
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:08,978
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:13,250
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,094
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,801
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,341
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:38,139
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:26,462
As far as the eye can see,
the land is desolate...

12
00:01:26,632 --> 00:01:29,465
...and full of despair.

13
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:35,096
Shadows crawl across the earth
and black out the light.

14
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:39,175
Darkness oozes from every crevice.

15
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,676
Hope has been eradicated.

16
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:45,146
Only terror reigns.

17
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:50,584
Yet there is one that mocks
my omnipresent evil...

18
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:53,122
...with his existence.

19
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:57,250
He possesses a sword
which could destroy me.

20
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:00,865
They call him...

21
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:06,031
...Samurai Jack!

22
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:21,146
Despite my efforts,
he has not yet been destroyed.

23
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,814
But now l, Aku,
dark lord of all darkness...

24
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:29,119
...will make the final move...

25
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:33,890
...and annihilate Samurai Jack forever.

26
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:41,401
From deep within the bowels
of the pit of hate...

27
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:46,067
...l summon Demongo!

28
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:04,920
What is thy bidding, my master?

29
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:09,431
You are one of my
most powerful minions.

30
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:12,593
You possess the ability to steal...

31
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:17,003
...the essence of
the mightiest of warriors...

32
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:20,338
...or the deadliest of beasts.

33
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:23,504
You have never failed me.

34
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:27,648
The more essence l take...

35
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,280
...the more powerful l become,
my master.

36
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:39,563
And l have stolen the essence
of the greatest of warriors.

37
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,360
l cannot be defeated.

38
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,571
Find Samurai Jack.

39
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:52,540
Destroy him and enslave his essence.

40
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:56,579
Samurai Jack.

41
00:03:56,748 --> 00:03:59,182
A prize indeed.

42
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:03,151
The greatest of all warriors.

43
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,221
Yes.

44
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,620
What better way to get rid of him...

45
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:13,060
...than have his essence
imprisoned for all time?

46
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:18,066
lt is as good as done, my master.

47
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:23,157
lf you seek conflict, you have found
the wrong man to deal with.

48
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:26,404
You are mistaken.

49
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:30,063
l am the dealer of destruction...

50
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:32,369
...the merchant of doom.

51
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:38,608
And l seek you, Samurai Jack.

52
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:54,793
-Who are you?
-Aku has sent me to destroy you.

53
00:05:54,966 --> 00:06:00,233
-Aku?!
-My master tires of your existence.

54
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:03,397
You are a powerful foe.

55
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:08,069
Perhaps too powerful for my master...

56
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,942
...but not for me.

57
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:16,577
My name is Demongo.

58
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:21,058
l have come...

59
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:26,425
...to capture your warrior's essence.

60
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,146
Merchant of doom?

61
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,515
You are a fool, samurai.

62
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:58,687
Do not meddle in things
you do not understand.

63
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:28,148
Titan, destroy the samurai!

64
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:04,120
You've met your match, samurai.

65
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,826
Crush him!

66
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:11,899
Crush, crush, crush!

67
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:36,155
Stop your whining.
lt's just a scratch.

68
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,761
Now get him!

69
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,475
Curses.

70
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,544
You are next.

71
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:40,852
-l know these warriors.
-They, too, were once thorns in Aku's side.

72
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:46,588
But now l, Demongo,
control their essence...

73
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:50,860
...as l will control yours.

74
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:56,868
Prepare yourself, samurai,
for annihilation.

75
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:45,941
You cannot win, samurai.

76
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,347
l am more powerful.

77
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,250
A power fueled only by the strength
and skill of the great warriors...

78
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:54,687
...whose essence you have stolen,
Demongo!

79
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:58,089
Without that, you are nothing.

80
00:11:59,197 --> 00:12:02,166
You are wise, samurai.

81
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,732
But who cares?

82
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:15,736
When l have your essence...

83
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,879
...l will be the greatest warrior.

84
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,467
lt cannot be.

85
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,073
How is it possible?
l just defeated them.

86
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:53,575
Yes, you did.

87
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:56,151
But they are essence.

88
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,915
You cannot defeat essence.

89
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:04,023
You may defeat them again
and again and again.

90
00:13:04,195 --> 00:13:06,459
But l command the essence...

91
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:11,625
...of thousands
of such powerful warriors.

92
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:17,105
Even one as mighty as you
cannot defeat them all.

93
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,402
We shall see.

94
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:34,244
lt is futile.

95
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,689
You still think you can win.

96
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,655
How commendable.

97
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,929
How futile.

98
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,699
So many.

99
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,945
There, you fools. There.

100
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:20,841
Destroy. Destroy Samurai Jack!

101
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,980
l want his essence!

102
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,394
Yes! Yes! Fight! Fight!

103
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,825
lt's just a matter of time, samurai.

104
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:41,155
Only a matter of time before...

105
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:48,968
...my defeat.

106
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:56,139
There must be a way to defeat Demongo.

107
00:18:56,981 --> 00:19:00,041
A way to stop Demongo
from using essence.

108
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:03,242
Essence of trapped warriors.
Trapped essence.

109
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,514
Free the essence,
Demongo has no power.

110
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,949
How do l free the essence?

111
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,694
Yes. From within.

112
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,293
How do l get inside?

113
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,647
lmpossible!

114
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:03,813
And l free your essence!

115
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:42,211
My essence.
Where is all my essence?

116
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:47,451
No!

117
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:25,088
You have failed me, Demongo.

118
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:29,289
No, master. Please forgive me.

119
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:33,931
No.

120
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:39,102
Once again the saga continues.
