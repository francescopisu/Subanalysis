1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,307
<i>Long ago, in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:09,113
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:13,247
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,094
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,801
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,341
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,138
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:44,625
l just crushed your dumb old car
with my super-cool bike.

12
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:46,559
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

13
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:50,565
Come on. Everyone knows a bike
could never smash a car, dumb.

14
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:44,304
Time out, dudes!

15
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:58,362
Now, you listen here, dudes.

16
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,658
We got a respect-for-private-property
thing going on here...

17
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,495
...that don't involve flying around
at top speed...

18
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,002
...on them motorcycles,
smashing windows.

19
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,573
What's this? A hero?

20
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,573
l like him. He's got spunk.

21
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,106
Release him.

22
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:47,138
Who in the--?

23
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,873
You have insulted my footwear.

24
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,553
My sandals don't like to be laughed at.

25
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,093
Get him!

26
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,973
That's right. Come to--

27
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:49,227
Come on, boys.
This fool isn't worth our time.

28
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:55,100
Nice moves, dude. l like your style.

29
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:59,004
l can honestly say that l have never seen
anyone champion the ideals...

30
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:02,271
...of shoemanship with such
heartfelt ''game,'' if l may.

31
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:06,781
l gotta confess, l'm kind of feeling
a kindred spiritual kind of bond...

32
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:11,752
...kind of thing here with you. Because l,
like you, understand the importance...

33
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:15,381
...of the proper footwear
in our everyday performance.

34
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:21,225
And if l might be so bold, you, sir,
are in need of a new pair.

35
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:31,103
Since you were such a bro
about helping me out of that jam...

36
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:35,474
...l'll give you for free, at no additional
charge, your pick of any shoe...

37
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,515
...at the world-famous Foot-Chalet.

38
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,559
Get a load of those legs!

39
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:02,529
Hey, good-looking, we'll be back
to pick you up later.

40
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,329
-Check out them stems.
-Say, sweet thing, let me get your number.

41
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:11,669
-Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
-Oh, no, she didn't. Do you believe that?

42
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:14,073
Oh, girl, look at you.

43
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:21,548
Baby, baby!
Oh, baby, you looking good.

44
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,949
l'm gonna have to lose weight
or something.

45
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:27,455
Shoot, l ain't mad at you, sweetie.
Do your thing, girl.

46
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,220
That's right, girl. You gotta work
what you got. You know what l'm saying?

47
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,604
Any luck, dude?

48
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,802
l almost forgot about these.
They just arrived.

49
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,073
Utilizing the latest technologies.

50
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:09,049
Air foam, transposit shock-absorbing
double-wishbone...

51
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,451
...5.1 -digital-surround suspension--

52
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:17,752
Well, whatever, dude! They're the newest,
latest ones. Let's try them on.

53
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,324
Easy now.

54
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:31,074
Make me proud, brother.

55
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:13,266
Those-- Where did you--? How--? Wait!

56
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:17,709
Excuse me. Pardon me. Young boy, wait!

57
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:24,614
Boy! Come back! Wait!

58
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:28,216
l saw Samurai Jack! l saw Samurai Jack!

59
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:34,660
-Excuse me. l--
-No, no. Sorry. Shop is closed.

60
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:40,634
You come back tomorrow. lt is dinnertime.
l am closing shop. We open at 6 tomorrow.

61
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:43,330
You-- You.

62
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,265
You are the samurai.

63
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,835
Samurai Jack.

64
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:54,212
lt is an honor that you
would grace my humble garage.

65
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:58,649
-To what do l owe this great privilege?
-l don't mean to trouble you...

66
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,155
...but l was wondering--

67
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,026
Where to find dinner?
Right here, my friend.

68
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,494
My wife is cooking as we speak.

69
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:11,066
Thank you, but there are villains
at large that l must deal with.

70
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:16,366
Oh, there are always villains. But you
cannot defeat them on an empty stomach.

71
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,477
Now, come. lt will be a great honor
if you'd join my family for dinner.

72
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,240
Come, come.

73
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:33,684
l saw Samurai Jack! l saw Samurai Jack!
l saw Samurai Jack!

74
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:36,759
Did not. Like, l'm sure.

75
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,953
l know. He's such a little dorf-norb.
lt's like--

76
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:41,621
Ladies.

77
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:45,963
Oh, my gosh. He's so handsome.

78
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:50,540
Dear, set another place at the table.
We have a guest.

79
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:55,772
Did you bring home another
oily jet-car pilot again? l swear, if you--

80
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:01,648
-Oh, Samurai Jack.
-Madam, please excuse my intrusion.

81
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,652
No, no. Please, please.
Welcome to our table.

82
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,586
Thank you. Your home is wonderful.

83
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,354
Perhaps this is the time machine
l have been seeking.

84
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:16,961
We feel it is important
to remember the old ways.

85
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:22,367
We try to honor our ancestors
by keeping traditions from the old land...

86
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,407
...and by retelling the old stories.

87
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:27,840
And the new stories.

88
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,139
Yeah, your stories.

89
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:34,751
<i>He came back, back from the past</i>
S<i>amurai</i> J<i>ack</i>

90
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:39,318
We know you'll beat Aku someday,
Mr. Jack. You're the greatest.

91
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:45,024
Yes. Your legend is an inspiration
to all who live under the heel of Aku.

92
00:19:45,196 --> 00:19:50,099
Please, if there is any way
we can help you, just ask.

93
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,430
Well, l wanted to ask
about your son's shoes.

94
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:42,447
Thank you so much, my friend.

95
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,087
l wish l could repay you some--

96
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:21,875
