1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,273
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:09,580
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:13,247
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,094
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,232
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:31,342
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:38,142
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,386
Move it, slave. Pick it up.

12
00:02:55,454 --> 00:02:58,355
Don't worry,
you'll get used to it soon enough.

13
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:03,051
-What do you mean?
-Silence! No talking, slave.

14
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,102
Halt.

15
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,945
-What is--?
-No talking.

16
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,818
lt is no use.

17
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:39,616
There is no escape.

18
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:42,618
What is this place?
Why have we been brought here?

19
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:46,321
These things are of no importance now.

20
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:50,229
When daybreak comes, you will fight.

21
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:54,566
-And then you will be no more.
-What?

22
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:02,814
He's right.
None can survive in the Dome of Doom.

23
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,809
Come on, wake up. lt's showtime.

24
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,515
Come on, move it.

25
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:44,053
And now, without any delay,
the first challenger of the day.

26
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:47,885
Weighing in at 280 septiles...

27
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,584
...Poogle the Pitiful.

28
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:54,289
Facing the 1 2-time champion
of the ring...

29
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:59,165
...the minister of agony,
the baron of brutality...

30
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:04,570
...the coroner of carnage,
the dealer of destruction...

31
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:08,543
...Gordo the Gruesome.

32
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:27,060
Well, how about that, folks?

33
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:32,169
That was a pretty long round
for Gordo the Gruesome.

34
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,500
Bring out the next challenger.

35
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:42,212
lntroducing our next opponent,
weighing in at a mere--

36
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:46,515
Well, there you have it, folks.

37
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,928
Welcome...

38
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,973
...to the Dome of Doom.

39
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:26,019
Our talent search has spread
throughout the universe...

40
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:30,525
...to bring you only the finest quality
of challenger...

41
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,926
...to battle the greatest of champions.

42
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:36,932
No victory is too small.

43
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:39,696
No wound is too great.

44
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:43,830
No weapon is illegal.

45
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:52,042
And now the Dome of Doom
presents for your pleasure...

46
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:56,278
...Two Sandals the Treacherous.

47
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:03,892
Gordo, we call upon you
to destroy this vile villain.

48
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:13,436
Prepare to suffer,
Two Sandals the Treacherous.

49
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:18,133
l will beat you like a drum.
l will hang you out like laundry.

50
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,801
And now, without any further--

51
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,972
l am the master mechanic,
the alpha and omega.

52
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,813
l will put a hurting on you, slave.
l'm gonna tear you up into little shreds.

53
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:31,581
Then l'll take those shreds
and tear them into shreds.

54
00:08:31,756 --> 00:08:34,418
l will make your mother cry.
l will make your Aunt Edna...

55
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,152
...from Withershoot proper,
south of Barnaby, cry.

56
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:42,095
Are you ready for pain, Two Sandals?!

57
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:45,100
l am not intimidated by your shouting.

58
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,034
A true warrior fights not with words,
but with--

59
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:53,933
What?

60
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:43,827
This-- This is unprecedented.

61
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:45,986
But wait.

62
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,001
Oh, yes.

63
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:55,633
lt looks like he's gone primal
on us, folks. This is it.

64
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:47,889
Oh, this is unwitnessable.

65
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,120
Nobody has ever knocked down Gordo.

66
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,762
He's out.

67
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:07,968
l-- l have nothing to say.

68
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,481
Except...

69
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:13,242
...bring out the next champion!

70
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:22,954
Deep from within the deepest abyss
of the seventh ocean of Amalgamous...

71
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:29,259
...arose a champion
of unimaginable proportions.

72
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:36,533
Half machine, half flesh, all terror.

73
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:41,407
The Aqualizer.

74
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:53,988
Dome of Doom,
once more have you summoned.

75
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:59,858
To answer your call, l have risen
from the depths of the abyss...

76
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:06,527
...to conquer the ring
and to put an end to this lowly amateur.

77
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,803
Do not fear.

78
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:48,412
l have traveled the seven seas
and conquered far greater foes...

79
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,843
...than this mere contender.

80
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:22,228
Help me!

81
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:26,002
Help!

82
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:30,747
<i>Doom, doom, doom!</i>

83
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:42,818
The crowd calls upon you, Two Sandals...

84
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:46,862
...to put the doom on the Aqualizer.

85
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:05,878
No, l will not participate
in this senseless violence any longer.

86
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,850
You will have to get
your entertainment elsewhere.

87
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:17,456
This is a dark moment indeed.

88
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:21,489
Not only has he insulted the ring...

89
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,896
...he has insulted us.

90
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:28,732
We will show no more mercy
to this two-sandaled heathen.

91
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,013
lntroducing the champion
to end all champions.

92
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:47,090
Weighing in at a mere 700 tons...

93
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,021
...l give you...

94
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:57,230
...Sumoto.

95
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,835
l will not fight.

96
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:04,607
Then you will be destroyed.

97
00:16:09,981 --> 00:16:12,415
l will not fight you, Sumoto.

98
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:21,616
lt's the Sumoto swan dive.

99
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:26,058
No challenger has ever survived it.

100
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,703
Thank you, Sumoto...

101
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:41,538
...for putting the doom back
in the Dome of Doom.

102
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:48,444
This-- This can't be.

103
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:17,480
lt looks like Sumoto is ticklish.

104
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,866
This is incongruous...

105
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:43,871
...inconceivable, inexcusable.

106
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,204
Very well then.

107
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:50,143
lf no one champion can bring him down...

108
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:53,977
...then bring out all the champions.

109
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:58,252
May l present Torto.

110
00:17:58,422 --> 00:18:01,050
Maotis.

111
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,251
The Claw.

112
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:07,124
Raptor.

113
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:12,160
Mr. Roboto.

114
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:17,165
And finally, Ganeesh.

115
00:18:18,542 --> 00:18:20,874
This must end once and for all.

116
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:27,708
Let the carnage begin.

117
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:29,045
Wise man knows everything,
a shrewd one, everybody.

118
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:31,272
You can hide, but you cannot run.

119
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:12,687
A true coward runs not from his opponent
but from himself.

120
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:18,653
Many receive advice.
Only the wise profit by it.

121
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,118
<i>Two</i> S<i>andals, Two</i> S<i>andals, Two</i> S<i>andals!</i>

122
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,383
Enough!

123
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,154
ls this what you call entertainment?

124
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:56,231
The senseless slaughter of innocents?
No more.

125
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,528
Set the slaves free.

126
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:07,466
Set them free.

127
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:10,978
Yes, yes, of course.

128
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:23,659
From now on, there will be
no more fighting for your entertainment.

129
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:29,497
You heard him, you're free.
Now get out of here. Go on, get.

130
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,760
You.
