1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:04,272
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,449 --> 00:00:09,011
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:13,283
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,225
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:22,128
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,368
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:31,373
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,909
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,106
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:15,437
At last, my quest has come to an end.

12
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:26,357
Not so fast, samurai!

13
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,152
Aku!

14
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:34,127
Your efforts are in vain, samurai.

15
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:37,735
This gateway into the past is forever...

16
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,572
...beyond your reach!

17
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,319
Poor samurai.

18
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:59,719
Once more you failed!

19
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,587
As you lie smashed and defeated...

20
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:07,289
...so lie your hopes of going home.

21
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:14,930
Till we meet again.

22
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,197
Sorry.

23
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,340
What sort of creature are you?

24
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:08,144
l man like you.

25
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:10,755
l have never seen man fly.

26
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,514
l no fly.

27
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,181
Jump good.

28
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,531
-Jump really good.
-Yeah.

29
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:30,197
Can you teach me to jump good?

30
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,603
Tribe show me.

31
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:33,209
l show you tribe.

32
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:36,176
Tribe show you how jump good.

33
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,154
There!

34
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:16,616
Tribe.

35
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:26,894
You are one of these creatures?

36
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,657
No, l man.

37
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,960
-Then how?
-They raise me.

38
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:34,936
They say long ago l with other tribe.

39
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:52,286
<i>Keep moving. Keep moving.</i>
<i>Keep moving.</i>

40
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:05,100
<i>Keep moving. Keep moving.</i>
<i>Keep moving.</i>

41
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,346
<i>They say I stray from tribe.</i>

42
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:22,519
<i>Keep moving. Keep moving.</i>
<i>Keep moving.</i>

43
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:28,417
And so l became new member of tribe.

44
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,926
And as you see, whole tribe jump good.

45
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:33,928
So l jump good.

46
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,623
Yes.

47
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,655
Danger. Must hide!

48
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,518
What?

49
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,820
l'm sorry.
That is not your food.

50
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:10,392
Leave here, and you will not be hurt.

51
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,915
-Who are they?
-Other tribe.

52
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,213
Why do you not defend what's yours?

53
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,586
We peaceful like flower.

54
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,660
Know not how to protect ourselves.

55
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:55,424
Other tribe take food, smash home,
never leave us alone!

56
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,196
We pick up pieces,
replant somewhere else.

57
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:04,034
We scared.

58
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:08,441
Now, like before,
we find new home.

59
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:11,945
l could show you how
to defend yourselves...

60
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,414
...how to protect what is yours.

61
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,417
And we show you to jump good.

62
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:26,124
They agree.
We learn to protect and defend.

63
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,460
-And they will show me to jump good?
-No.

64
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,158
l mean yes.

65
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,014
Let's do it.

66
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:36,587
Let's do it!

67
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,401
You jump good.

68
00:16:47,752 --> 00:16:50,915
Thank you, friend,
for everything you have shown me.

69
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,682
Friend.

70
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:12,149
Hungry? Here food.

71
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:15,682
Still hungry? Here more.

72
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,657
Take it!

73
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,464
Never come again.

74
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,126
-Aku!
-Samurai fool.

75
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:28,265
Your efforts are in vain again.

76
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:34,598
This gateway to the past
is once more beyond your rea--

77
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:36,034
You can fly?

78
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,402
No. Jump good.
