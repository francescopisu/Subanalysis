1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:04,307
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:09,580
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:13,247
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,094
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,198
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:31,331
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,140
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,152
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:04:26,044 --> 00:04:27,739
My clothes.

12
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,517
Rabbit! Rabbit!

13
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:42,955
Come out, rabbit!

14
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,762
What manner of place is this?

15
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,342
Hey, why don't you watch
where you're--? Naked!

16
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:12,106
Sir, l apologize for what l am about to do,
but l must borrow your clothes.

17
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,677
My what?

18
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,827
Although they lack the comfort,
durability and style of my gi...

19
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,027
...these humble garments will have to
hold me until l regain my proper attire.

20
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:36,367
Now to go find that rabbit.

21
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,221
That's the hoodlum that stole me cats!

22
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:53,823
-Mine too!
-And mine.

23
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:57,393
-After him!
-Wait, please-- l did not--

24
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:06,128
You'll never get away, you no good--

25
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,395
Go on, say it.

26
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:10,666
Cat burglar!

27
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:44,571
l am terribly sorry, mister.
Do you need a ride?

28
00:07:46,578 --> 00:07:49,479
Yes, please. Quickly.
Take us away from this vicinity.

29
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,115
-Get back here, you thief!
-Get back here, you thief!

30
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:55,946
lt seems as though that angry mob
is trying to get your attention.

31
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,089
Please, we must leave immediately.

32
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:01,248
The urgency in your grip tells me
you are in grave danger.

33
00:08:01,426 --> 00:08:03,986
l will take you the heck out of here.

34
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:05,652
We are not going anywhere.

35
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,161
lt seems we are too heavy.

36
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:09,994
l will release some ballast.

37
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,108
We have to get higher.

38
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:21,711
l'm afraid we are too heavy.

39
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:25,979
lt seems that l have another customer.

40
00:08:28,486 --> 00:08:29,817
Thank you, sir. Come again.

41
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,421
Please, take a number.

42
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,763
lf we don't take off soon, l think you'll
be forced to share my taxi services.

43
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:45,994
We would be able to rise higher if only
we had some weight left to drop.

44
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,742
Well, the cat's out of
the bag now, my friend.

45
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:28,169
-What was that?
-What was what?

46
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:31,008
-Oh, look at that. A white rabbit.
-White rabbit?

47
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,268
Up there! After him!

48
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,919
Open the door! We're coming in!

49
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:22,996
Hello.

50
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,430
Forgive us, lady.

51
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,828
We was in pursuit of a thief.

52
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,565
You haven't seen one about, have you?

53
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:31,532
No, l have not.

54
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:33,700
He must have gone this way. Come on!

55
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:44,483
Oh, there you are.
We've been looking all over for you.

56
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:47,682
Have you any idea what time it is?

57
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,650
Hurry. You're on.

58
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,715
At last, princess of hearts,
l have you right where l want you.

59
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:15,080
And this time, there will be no escape.

60
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:22,953
Your line.

61
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:29,699
You're supposed to scream.

62
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:39,802
My fair prince will rescue me.

63
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:41,741
My fair prince will rescue me.

64
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:59,555
Yes, yes. Your prince might come...

65
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:04,134
...but he will be too late to save you
from the Cheshire dragon.

66
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:09,834
Aku.

67
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:49,106
Fear not, princess of hearts,
for l have come to save you.

68
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:33,148
Look, it's the princess of hearts.

69
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,882
Just like in the play.

70
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:39,729
Please, l don't have time.

71
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:41,660
And she's wearing the magic apron.

72
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,166
-l want it.
-l want the dress.

73
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:47,896
-l want the blouse.
-No, wait. Stop.

74
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:49,403
l want her hair.

75
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:57,075
You're not the princess.

76
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:13,086
Hey, you. You can't run
around here almost naked. Stop.

77
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,098
Calling all units.

78
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:20,363
Calling all units. Almost-naked man
running loose in terminal.

79
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:22,438
<i>I repeat, almost naked.</i>

80
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,097
<i>Arrest him immediately.</i>

81
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:28,268
There he is. Hold it right there, mister.

82
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,776
-Stop.
-Stop.

83
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:21,864
Why, he's almost naked.

84
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,572
Calling for backup. Calling for backup.

85
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:34,336
Look out for an almost-naked man
on the A train.

86
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:51,320
-Stop right there.
-Not another step.

87
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,487
We've got you now, buster.

88
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:55,655
No, please, you don't understand.

89
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,331
Hey, that's him.

90
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:03,064
The almost-naked man.

91
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:04,401
Stop him!

92
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,240
What was that? Let's check up front.

93
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:52,420
Have you seen
an almost-naked man on the train?

94
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,424
No, sir. l can't say l have.

95
00:16:56,594 --> 00:16:58,926
Well, if you do, please notify us.

96
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:01,428
Yes, sir. Of course.

97
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,430
Come on. Let's check the cargo hold.

98
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:20,110
Look! Nobody's driving the train.

99
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,783
Are you crazy, man? Get back in there.

100
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,787
What are you waiting for?
Hurry, or we'll crash.

101
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:35,297
Wake up. Wake up.
We are about to crash.

102
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,754
Don't you know what you're doing?
Use the trackball, man.

103
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:10,378
l've got you now, rabbit.

104
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,648
Hey, put me down, you.

105
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,224
Let me go!

106
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:19,896
Hey, mister, what's the big idea?

107
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,628
My sword and my gi,
what have you done with them?

108
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:26,235
Take it easy.
They're in my backpack.

109
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,303
-Your backpack?
-Sure.

110
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:30,406
My sword.

111
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,244
Did not your parents teach you
it is wrong to steal?

112
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:38,414
l don't have any parents.

113
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:39,810
l'm all alone.

114
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:46,252
l saw your stuff just sitting there,
so l took it.

115
00:20:46,857 --> 00:20:48,085
l'm sorry.

116
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,057
l was hungry.
Your sword and bathrobe looked valuable.

117
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:54,823
Almost as valuable as robot slug tusks.

118
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,490
Robot slug tusks?

119
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:17,821
-Will these do?
-Wow, mister. Thanks.

120
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:21,515
l'll never go hungry again.

121
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:27,793
A stranger world than this
l fear l have yet to visit.
