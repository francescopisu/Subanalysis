1
00:00:01,246 --> 00:00:04,306
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:09,011
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:13,283
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,794
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,175
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:57,649
lt is impossible.

12
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:28,678
That is my hat.

13
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:32,616
Yes.

14
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:09,916
Thank you.

15
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:22,028
May l ask where you are headed?

16
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,181
lt appears very difficult.

17
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,351
Yes.

18
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,392
What is at the peak of this mountain?

19
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,668
Truth.

20
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:01,169
Truth?

21
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:09,341
Legend has it there lies a great power
at the summit of Fatoom.

22
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:14,213
We three have trained for a lifetime
to climb this mountain...

23
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,513
...and achieve its power.

24
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:20,249
That is, of course, if it exists.

25
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:26,022
You see, no one has ever reached
the summit of Fatoom.

26
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,772
Not yet.

27
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,621
You go on and collect your rocks.

28
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,887
l will handle this.

29
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:41,964
Goatman, please let us pass.

30
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:50,207
Good. lt is all clear.

31
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,991
The path is clear.

32
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:46,892
lt is all right to contin--

33
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:29,801
Wait, please.

34
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,599
Wait.

35
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,979
Wait for me.

36
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:08,216
lt is impossible.

37
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,215
Do you give up?

38
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,260
Will you abandon their hope?

39
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:49,158
<i>Can you not feel their desperation?</i>

40
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:59,342
<i>Will evil forever rule the world?</i>

41
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,442
Have you forgotten?

42
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:38,242
No. l have not forgotten.

43
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,080
Thank you, mountain monks.

44
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:17,845
Thank you.

45
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,655
Aku!

46
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:23,020
l will never give up!

47
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:28,188
l will return to the past and destroy you!
