1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,403
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:09,634
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,301
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,816
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,148
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,856
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:31,395
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,794
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,193
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:43,206
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,465
PIease, don't take my souI.

12
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,867
Aku, you wiII not cIaim another innocent!

13
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,807
Samurai Jack!

14
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,219
My hero.

15
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,028
I hate being Aku!

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,931
I don't wanna be him anymore!
I wanna be Jack!

17
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:22,370
What? First of aII,
I do the best Jack imitation.

18
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,010
Do it again, PhiI!

19
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:29,211
Aku, you wiII not cIaim another innocent.

20
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,541
And, second, you used to Iove being Aku.

21
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,279
Yeah. That was before Jack came aIong!

22
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,720
Now everyone wants
to pIay Jack and destroy me!

23
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,552
But you Iook just Iike him.

24
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,160
It's just my hair.

25
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,894
No, Aku. Your tricks wiII not
protect you this time!

26
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,662
Yeah! Destroy Aku!

27
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:08,419
For eons I have terrorized this Iand.

28
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,489
Every miserabIe creature trembIed...

29
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,424
...at the mere mention of my name.

30
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:21,033
The pitifuI peopIe shrank
before my awesome power.

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,662
But now I am openIy mocked
by these measIy urchins.

32
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,002
TaIes of the samurai's heroics
have spread...

33
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,545
...through the worId Iike a virus!

34
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,947
But I wiII cure the worId
of this pIague of hope.

35
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,282
I wiII unIeash such eviI...

36
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,890
...that even the most innocent souI...

37
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,587
...wiII be consumed by terror!

38
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,459
We're not afraid of you anymore, Aku...

39
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,933
...no matter what you do.

40
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:02,640
Hush! You cannot speak of Aku this way.

41
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,803
InsoIent brats!

42
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:12,247
Their eIders stiII fear and respect
the aImighty Aku.

43
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,319
But this new generation...

44
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,587
...the seed of rebeIIion has been pIanted
in them by these taIes of heroism.

45
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:33,131
WeII, if they respond to stories...

46
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:37,902
...I have a taIe or two that wiII turn Aku...

47
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:42,878
...into the hero of their young hearts!

48
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,781
-What's going on?
-Why have we been forced to come here?

49
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:11,060
A taIe must be toId.

50
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:15,537
A taIe of epic proportions.

51
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,173
I wiII take you to a universe far away.

52
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,579
<i>To a world of hunger.</i>

53
00:06:25,751 --> 00:06:32,054
<i>For the only one who ate</i>
<i>was a corrupt and evil beast.</i>

54
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,853
<i>A devourer of worlds...</i>

55
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:40,226
<i>...who set his sight</i>
<i>on our defenseless sphere.</i>

56
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,302
<i>But a beloved and courageous hero</i>
<i>arose to oppose...</i>

57
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,907
<i>...the terrorizing beast.</i>

58
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:53,512
<i>Mounted on his sled</i>
<i>with eight tiny reindeer...</i>

59
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,513
<i>...he flew into battle</i>
<i>against the cosmic scourge.</i>

60
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,531
<i>Then the great warrior</i>
<i>focused all his power...</i>

61
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,864
<i>...into his spear of truth.</i>

62
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,769
<i>And he hurled it with all his might.</i>

63
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,975
<i>The spear struck the beast...</i>

64
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,915
<i>...transforming him into...</i>

65
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,783
<i>...beef jerky!</i>

66
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,426
<i>The great warrior was victorious.</i>

67
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:49,592
<i>And the people feasted</i>
<i>on the spoils of his conquest...</i>

68
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,762
<i>...and never went hungry again.</i>

69
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,276
<i>"Who shall we thank for this heroic feat?"</i>
<i>the people asked.</i>

70
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:05,042
<i>The warrior removed</i>
<i>his helmet to reveal himself.</i>

71
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:09,051
<i>It was none other than I...</i>

72
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:11,951
<i>...Aku!</i>

73
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,686
<i>And so the people bowed down...</i>

74
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:19,297
<i>...and made the great warrior their king!</i>

75
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:25,028
That is the story of how I came to be.

76
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,549
Perhaps my story is too compIex
for these young minds.

77
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:48,285
A story of the purest,
simpIest theme must be toId.

78
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,329
Yes. Fairy taIes are simpIe.

79
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,864
But the heroes within are Iegendary.

80
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,004
''LittIe Red Riding Hood.''

81
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,267
''Once upon a time...

82
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,675
<i>...there was a little girl</i>
<i>who was loved by all. "</i>

83
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,745
Yes, I am famiIiar with this one.

84
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:19,186
<i>Once upon a time, there was a little girl...</i>

85
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:23,351
<i>...with an adorable red cape...</i>

86
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:29,195
<i>...and great flaming eyebrows...</i>

87
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,932
<i>...who was beloved by all.</i>

88
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:36,666
<i>And so the people</i>
<i>affectionately named her...</i>

89
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,470
<i>...Little Red Hood.</i>

90
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:46,307
<i>One day, Little Red Hood was on her way</i>
<i>to her grandmother's house.</i>

91
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,952
My poor grandmama is of deIicate heaIth.

92
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,752
So I am deIivering to her...

93
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:59,455
...a picnic basket of confectionery treats!

94
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:05,736
Did someone say ''picnic baskets fiIIed
with deIicious confectionery treats''?

95
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,967
<i>And so the mean wolf took a shortcut...</i>

96
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,305
<i>...and arrived at Grandmother's house...</i>

97
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,142
<i>...before Little Red Hood.</i>

98
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,314
Who's there?

99
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,818
Howdy-ho, Grandma.
It's me, the woIf.

100
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:26,151
-Oh, my!
-Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm petrifying.

101
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,589
Now, enough of the chitchat.
In you go.

102
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,393
<i>How horrible!</i>

103
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,125
<i>Little Red Hood approached</i>
<i>Grandma's house...</i>

104
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,499
<i>...unaware of what awaits her within.</i>

105
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,898
Who's there?

106
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,100
Hey, hey. Keep it down in there!

107
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,840
Come in, my chiId.

108
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,420
Hey, Red. How about giving me
some of those confectionery treats?

109
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:01,091
My, Grandma! What big eyes you have!

110
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,593
Yeah, yeah. Big eyes, big teeth,
and a big appetite!

111
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,028
<i>The wolf attacked Little Red Hood...</i>

112
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,465
<i>...not knowing that Little Red Hood</i>
<i>had laser eye beams...</i>

113
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,539
<i>...great combat skills...</i>

114
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:21,239
<i>...and a powerful uppercut</i>
<i>that freed Little Red's grandmother...</i>

115
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:25,713
<i>...from the evil bowels of the wolf.</i>

116
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,121
Confectionery treats.

117
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:35,818
<i>And so Little Red Hood was victorious!</i>

118
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,233
Do not be afraid, chiIdren.

119
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,067
Show your joy.

120
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,508
Do you not Iike the taIes of Aku?

121
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,343
Speak!

122
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,614
Yes, chiId.

123
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,919
Share your thoughts on the taIes of Aku.

124
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,892
WeII, the stories were toId very weII.

125
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,988
Yes?

126
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:19,160
But I think we wouId Iike
to hear a story about...

127
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,071
...Samurai Jack?

128
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,105
What?!

129
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,073
So be it.

130
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,273
Pay attention, chiIdren...

131
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:37,912
...for you are about to hear the story of
''Jack and the Three Bears.''

132
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,894
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>there were three bears...</i>

133
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,166
<i>...who lived together in a house of wood.</i>

134
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,105
<i>One was a little wee bear.</i>

135
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,477
<i>One was a middle-size bear.</i>

136
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:10,850
<i>And the other was a great, huge bear!</i>

137
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,225
I made us some porridge, comrades.

138
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,159
But, aIas, it is too hot.

139
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:24,234
That's okay, brother. We can go for a waIk
in the woods whiIe it cooIs off.

140
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,032
You made porridge!

141
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,779
<i>And while they were out...</i>

142
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,325
<i>...a wicked samurai came to the house.</i>

143
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,656
<i>He was not a good samurai.</i>

144
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:59,270
<i>He was an impudent, bad, old samurai.</i>

145
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,870
Oh, yeah! Porridge!

146
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:14,077
<i>And so the wicked samurai began to eat.</i>

147
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,588
<i>It did not matter to him...</i>

148
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:22,352
<i>...if the porridge was too hot,</i>
<i>too cold, or just right.</i>

149
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,124
<i>He ate it all!</i>

150
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,967
AII right! Good.

151
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:37,666
<i>And then he set off</i>
<i>to destroy the three bears' house.</i>

152
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,985
<i>When the three bears returned...</i>

153
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,854
<i>...complete destruction awaited them.</i>

154
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,301
-Someone's been eating my porridge!
-Someone's been messing with my books!

155
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,738
Someone's been wearing my cIothes!

156
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,243
Someone wrecked our whoIe house!

157
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,143
And there he is!

158
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,805
SIeeping in my bed!

159
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,047
Shut up! I'm trying to sIeep!

160
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,048
<i>Sir? Aku?</i>

161
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:05,720
Yes, chiId?
Why do you interrupt Aku?

162
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,000
WeII, the thing is...

163
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,829
...Jack wouIdn't do that.

164
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,994
Oh? You know him?

165
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,036
No. But--

166
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,266
Very weII.

167
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,880
Perhaps I exaggerated a IittIe.

168
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:28,475
But this next story is true
to its uttermost detaiI.

169
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:35,116
<i>Once upon a time, there was a house</i>
<i>built from straw, wood and brick...</i>

170
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:43,424
<i>...where three innocent little pigs</i>
<i>happily made their residence.</i>

171
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,935
<i>Until there was a knock at the door.</i>

172
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:51,675
<i>It was big, bad Jack.</i>

173
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,446
LittIe pig, IittIe pig...

174
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,377
...open up and Iet me in!

175
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,246
Not by the hairs on our chinny-chin chins!

176
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,614
Then I'II huff and I'II puff...

177
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,017
...and I'm coming in!

178
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,788
Here's Jackie!

179
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,662
<i>Aku, sir?</i>

180
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,804
Yes, girI chiId?

181
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,139
I'm scared.

182
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:26,539
Good. The samurai is scary!

183
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,341
-But Jack wouId never do such a--
-SiIence!

184
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,816
I wiII continue with yet another taIe.

185
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,553
<i>The story of poor little Cinderella</i>
<i>and her evil stepmother, Jacqueline.</i>

186
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:49,167
<i>And her two wicked stepsisters,</i>
<i>Jackie and Jackquela.</i>

187
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,199
-Scrub that fIoor!
-Wash those dishes!

188
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,894
Make me dinner!

189
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,232
<i>-But Jack is a man.</i>
<i>-Very well.</i>

190
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,873
<i>There once was a house</i>
<i>made of candy.</i>

191
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,444
<i>But a giant samurai came and smashed it!</i>

192
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,779
Guess my name!

193
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,079
<i>But those are three different stories.</i>

194
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,915
<i>With great endings.</i>

195
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,423
<i>And so the samurai prince</i>
<i>finally found the magic frog...</i>

196
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,427
...<i>and kissed him, enraging the frog...</i>

197
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,792
<i>...who then ate the samurai prince.</i>

198
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,764
<i>But wasn't Jack just a giant?</i>

199
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,700
<i>Yes. And he fell off the beanstalk.</i>

200
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,932
<i>-But he wasn't on a beanstalk.</i>
<i>-You are correct.</i>

201
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:34,511
<i>He was searching for his lost sheep</i>
<i>who stampeded over him.</i>

202
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,375
<i>That's not how the story goes.</i>

203
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:40,678
<i>Yes, it does! After barely surviving</i>
<i>the sheep stampede...</i>

204
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,979
<i>...a cat in giant boots came along...</i>

205
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,453
<i>-...and kicked the samurai!</i>
<i>-What?</i>

206
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,491
RapunzeI, RapunzeI, Iet down your hair.

207
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,245
<i>What's happening?</i>

208
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,117
Enough! Here is the truest taIe of aII!

209
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,350
<i>There was an almighty, all-powerful wizard.</i>

210
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,325
<i>And there was a pathetic, little samurai.</i>

211
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,330
<i>And the wizard destroyed him!</i>

212
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,633
The end!

213
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,274
-No, that's not how it wouId happen.
-Yeah!

214
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,278
<i>First, it would be a misty night.</i>

215
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,815
<i>And Jack would be climbing a huge castle.</i>

216
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,115
<i>But not before he defeated its 8-foot,</i>
<i>six-armed mutant guard.</i>

217
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,363
<i>Yeah! Then he would</i>
<i>be climbing all battle-damaged.</i>

218
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,097
<i>With his hair all messed up.</i>

219
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,832
<i>With his sword in his teeth!</i>

220
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,372
<i>Yeah. And as Jack reaches</i>
<i>the top of the castle...</i>

221
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,847
<i>...Aku would creepily creep out</i>
<i>from the shadows.</i>

222
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,350
<i>But Jack can smell his foul stench.</i>

223
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,421
<i>-And then they fight!</i>
<i>-Not yet!</i>

224
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,921
<i>First, they would stare each other down!</i>

225
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,029
<i>-And then they'd fight!</i>
<i>-No, not yet!</i>

226
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:40,767
<i>Jack would first say, " You have plagued</i>
<i>the land with your evil long enough.</i>

227
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,338
<i>Prepare to meet your doom. "</i>

228
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,374
<i>-And then they'd fight!</i>
<i>-No, not yet!</i>

229
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,446
<i>Because Aku would answer,</i>
<i>"You are truly powerful, samurai...</i>

230
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:52,549
<i>...but no match for my evil wizardry!"</i>

231
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,712
<i>-Now?</i>
<i>-Now.</i>

232
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,584
<i>And then they'd fight!</i>

233
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,659
<i>Aku quickly turns into a huge....</i>

234
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,386
<i>Dragon-like creature.</i>

235
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,430
<i>But he's no match for Jack's samurai skill!</i>

236
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,631
<i>And with one mighty blow...</i>

237
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,647
<i>...Jack destroys Aku!</i>

238
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,880
<i>Then he would sheath his sword</i>
<i>all cool-style and say:</i>

239
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,748
<i>"My quest has ended.</i>

240
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:35,757
<i>I will now travel back to my own time</i>
<i>and undo the evil that Aku has done. "</i>

241
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,451
<i>The end!</i>

242
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,570
