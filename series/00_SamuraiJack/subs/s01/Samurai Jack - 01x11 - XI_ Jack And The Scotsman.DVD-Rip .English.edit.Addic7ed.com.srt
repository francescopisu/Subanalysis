1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:04,388
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:09,619
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,795 --> 00:00:13,287
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:18,801
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,133
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:26,841
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:31,381
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,780
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,178
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:43,191
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:16,827
By the Iook on your face,
I can teII you Iike the pipes, wee Iaddie.

12
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,933
PIease, I don't mean to interrupt...

13
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:33,441
...but am I cIose to the end
of this bridge?

14
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:35,340
No, far from it.

15
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:38,505
I've been traipsing across this bridge
for days now.

16
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:41,578
Seems I have a Iong way to go stiII.

17
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,118
I shouId be on my way.

18
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,122
Excuse me.

19
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:54,629
-What do you expect me to do?
-Just stand aside.

20
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:58,792
And risk faIIing over the side
for a perfect stranger?

21
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,134
Away and bow your head.
You stand aside!

22
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:06,641
My destination Iies at the opposite end
of the bridge.

23
00:07:06,811 --> 00:07:09,575
And you'II get there after you back up...

24
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,648
...and I reach that end of the bridge first.

25
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:18,281
That wouId waste too much time
and time is what I don't have.

26
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:22,825
So you think you're better than me
because you're in a hurry.

27
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:25,519
WeII, I'm in a hurry too!

28
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,530
But, no, you did not
think of that, did you?

29
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,361
That I might be an equaI.

30
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:35,973
No! You just consider yourseIf
superior, right off.

31
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,471
You're rude.

32
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:40,672
You mistake my comment, sir.

33
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:43,973
Do I? You think I'm dumb too?

34
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:45,877
No, I....

35
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,211
Look, we are both in a hurry.

36
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,048
So I shaII hang from these pIanks
and you may waIk over.

37
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,656
So you get a peek up my kiIt?

38
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,383
That is not what I am suggesting.

39
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,052
-So you say, you pIucky-faced hing-oot!
-What did you caII me?

40
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,324
So you're deaf too,
you cIagtaiI cuddie dreik!

41
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,297
I'II teII you what we're gonna do.

42
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,266
We'II fight for it...

43
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:08,735
...to the finish.

44
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:12,968
-I do not think there is any need to--
-Listen, you boony bIathering numpty.

45
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:17,740
The onIy way for you to get across
this bridge is to beat me in combat!

46
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:22,353
Now, are you a man,
or a worthIess bIate Iike I know you are?

47
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:25,583
I'm caIIing you a coward!

48
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,918
I fear no man.

49
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:33,655
That's some tough taIk coming from
a man who wears a basket on his head!

50
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,857
I carry my haggis in a basket.

51
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:40,596
You might even make me shiver
if you weren't dressed in a nightgown.

52
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:42,171
You Iook Iike my nanny!

53
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:46,270
You caII that thing dangIing
off your hip a sword?

54
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,843
Looks Iike a butter knife.

55
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:51,106
You'II not hurt anyone,
wieIding a piece of tinfoiI around.

56
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:54,513
You'd be better off using your sIippers
for a weapon.

57
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:59,751
This is a sword!

58
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,093
And it's bigger than yours.

59
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:12,636
What do you think of that, Mr.
Pajama-Wearing, Basket-Face...

60
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:15,773
...SIipper-WieIding, CIype-Dreep-BachIe...

61
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,704
...Gether-Uping-BIate-Maw,
BIeathering, GomeriI...

62
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:23,745
...Jessie, Oaf-Iooking, Scooner, Nyaff,
PIookie, Shan, MiIk-Drinking...

63
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:29,478
...Soy-Faced ShiIpit, Mim-Moothed,
SniveIing, Worm-Eyed, Hotten-BIaugh...

64
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:32,782
...ViIe-Stoochie, CuIIy-Breek-Tattie.

65
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,444
You gonna weep now?

66
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:01,446
ShaII I pause whiIe you mourn your hat?

67
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:05,111
I can pIay a meIanchoIy tune
to go with your weeping.

68
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:25,105
You've done it now.

69
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:31,678
I'm gonna turn your head
into a fIour sifter.

70
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:32,599
Aye, you got a Iot of pep
for a wee Iaddie.

71
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:48,790
The horse-cut technique
shouId've destroyed your sword.

72
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,587
Magic runes, Iaddie!

73
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:53,595
AII them fancy moves
wiII get you nowhere.

74
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,791
Now, quit your jumping around
and get to fighting!

75
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:31,156
Prepare to meet your doom.

76
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:41,010
I'II give you one more chance to give up.

77
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,772
I am not defeated.

78
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,939
And I shaII hoId my ground.

79
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:48,642
HoId your ground?

80
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,118
You can bareIy hoId your sword.

81
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,620
Then come get me.

82
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,257
What?

83
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,892
I....

84
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,960
Seeing that I'm a sportsman...

85
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,794
...I'II give you a moment to recuperate.

86
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:27,416
They're after me. After you?
They're after me!

87
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:34,722
Aku's got a price on my head!

88
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,389
Aku has a price on my head!

89
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:44,668
We are in no condition to fight.

90
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:49,108
EspeciaIIy not with a pajama-wearing daisy
strapped to my wrist!

91
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:53,512
-We must escape.
-Over the side!

92
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,057
Leave it to a Iover of basket hats
to jump Ieft instead of right.

93
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,219
I'm having second
thoughts now anyway.

94
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,126
We have no idea how far down--

95
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:27,316
Great job, Iaddie.

96
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:30,886
-You have any idea where we are?
-No.

97
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:32,852
So, what now, smarty-pants?

98
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,492
For the moment, we are safe
from those bounty hunters.

99
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,821
We must find sheIter before they find us.

100
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:40,657
We are defenseIess in this Iagoon.

101
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:52,570
Shut it!

102
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,145
There.

103
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,980
We'II be safer on Iand.

104
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,399
--hear you!!

105
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:24,636
--bIaster!

106
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,688
What I do not understand...

107
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,421
...is, why Aku is after you.

108
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,362
I have a huge price on my head.

109
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,695
Oh, yeah. Huge.

110
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,862
I'm the most wanted man on this pIanet.

111
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,272
Bounty hunters of aII types
are after me skin.

112
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:05,541
My face is pIastered on wanted posters
in every town on seven countries.

113
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,776
Oh, yeah. I'm infamous.

114
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:13,287
No. I don't beIieve it.

115
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,230
Got it!

116
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:10,336
I think they're gone.

117
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:12,072
Are you sure?

118
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:15,047
Aye, it's quiet.

119
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:34,827
Jump now!

120
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,054
-This might not work.
-Of course it works. We're a IethaI pair.

121
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:55,522
Behind you!

122
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,996
The arrow reIies on the bow.
The bow, on the arrow.

123
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,600
But they are not tied together.

124
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,827
That wouId be pointIess now, wouIdn't it?

125
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:11,172
ExactIy. Together we are formidabIe...

126
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,435
...but shackIed, our power is pointIess.

127
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:16,171
-We must be free.
-Aye, free.

128
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,281
And we'II take them together!

129
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,176
Is that the best you can do?

130
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,331
I'd say we've wiped out
our bounty-hunter probIem.

131
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:57,497
-For now.
-Aye. For now.

132
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:14,822
I was wrong about you.

133
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:17,017
I acted fooIishIy as weII.

134
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:19,094
No hard feeIings, aye?

135
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:20,855
I'II buy you a refreshment.

136
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,329
PIease, aIIow me.
I shaII buy you a refreshment.

137
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,799
No, no, I'II buy you one. I insist.

138
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,995
No, I must buy you one,
to make amends.

139
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:31,368
It's aII right. I'II buy.

140
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,237
-No, I wiII buy.
-I'II buy.

141
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,105
-No, I wiII buy.
-I'II buy.

142
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,678
-No, I wiII.
-I wiII.

143
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,576
-I wiII.
-Me! Me!
