1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,394
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:09,626
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,293
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:18,807
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,140
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,848
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:31,387
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,786
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:38,184
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:43,198
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,150
HeIIo!

12
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:49,718
Yes, yes. I have been expecting you.

13
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:53,330
-I have come for--
-PIease, pIease. Do not insuIt me.

14
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,295
I know why you are here.

15
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,662
-You do?
-Of course.

16
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:01,672
Many things in Iife are a mystery,
but I know why you are here.

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,707
Yes, I know Iike a mother
knows its chiId.

18
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,744
For exampIe, if the chiId came home crying,
the mother wouId know why.

19
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:12,508
That is how I know why you are here.

20
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:15,050
PIease. I am here
for something very important.

21
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,419
Of course. This I know. You are here
for what you cannot find anywhere eIse.

22
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,593
You are here to fuIfiII
your most intimate desire.

23
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:28,426
You are here for what has been woven
through time to guide you to your home.

24
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,833
-Yes. Is it here?
-Of course. May I present...

25
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,771
-...the Aragian rug of King Bassad.
-What?

26
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:41,002
Yes. This I know. It is quite breathtaking.

27
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,842
I am sorry. I must have the wrong pIace.
I do not wish to purchase a rug.

28
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,883
-What?
-I was positive this was the pIace.

29
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:51,221
Wait. May I see that?

30
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:57,857
The ancient scroII of the WooIies.

31
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,725
Yes. They said that you
might be abIe to heIp me.

32
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:06,860
Of course. The WooIies are oId friends.
Why did you not say so in the beginning?

33
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,632
-But I tried--
-No matter. Come quickIy.

34
00:04:10,175 --> 00:04:12,905
I sense we haven't much time.

35
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,240
There.

36
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,048
The Light of Eternity.

37
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,587
Come, sit.
There is nothing to fear.

38
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,501
PIace your hands into the Iight.

39
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:57,117
The Iight has accepted you.

40
00:04:57,455 --> 00:05:00,652
A vision is forming.

41
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:05,994
A strange structure with a jeweI inside.

42
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:10,157
Yes. It is what you seek.

43
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:14,101
The jeweI possesses great magic.

44
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:19,533
-What has happened?
-A warning.

45
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:25,783
OnIy one of pure heart may approach
and use the power of the jeweI.

46
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,852
My mission is nobIe. My heart is pure.
I have nothing to fear.

47
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:33,021
Yes, the truth you speak.

48
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:38,151
Now foIIow the setting sun
and the rising moon.

49
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:41,628
They wiII be your guide.

50
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,862
Something is wrong.

51
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:51,065
-It is something eviI.
-I cannot make the image out.

52
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:02,713
<i>Master Aku will pay us greatly</i>
<i>for your destruction.</i>

53
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:06,615
My sword.

54
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,224
What are you Iooking at?

55
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,801
What the--?

56
00:07:06,484 --> 00:07:08,816
-The eviI.
-Yes, I know.

57
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:11,512
No. You don't understand.

58
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:18,925
-It's about time.
-I needed my sword.

59
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:28,270
-I can see.
-Who are you? And why did you heIp me?

60
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:31,135
You're not the gratefuI kind, are you?

61
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,050
This way.

62
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:49,954
Hurry.

63
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,241
-Do you know how to ride an ukIa?
-A what?

64
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:13,480
-It's Iike a cameI, but different.
-I know how to ride a cameI.

65
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,881
Good.

66
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,051
-UkIas?
-AdorabIe, aren't they?

67
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:31,667
Hut, hut, hut!

68
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,461
No. ''Hut, hut, hut!''

69
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,274
Hut, hut, hut!

70
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:41,871
Hut, hut, hut!

71
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,926
-Who are you? Why did you heIp me?
-You're weIcome.

72
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:18,843
My time in this Iand has made me
harsh and rude.

73
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,076
Forgive me. I did not mean to insuIt you.

74
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:24,721
-No tears shed, samurai.
-Jack.

75
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:27,187
-What?
-Samurai Jack.

76
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,826
It is what the peopIe of this Iand
have named me.

77
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,655
Okay.

78
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:37,096
Then Iet us find sheIter for the night, Jack.
The night is not for riding.

79
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,412
Do not worry. They're harmIess.

80
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:30,950
I am Ikra.

81
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:37,453
I came to that pIace not to save you,
but to save my father.

82
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,538
You see, many moons ago,
my father, a great warrior...

83
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:55,236
...stood against our Iord and master
Aku's tyranny. But Aku was too powerfuI.

84
00:10:55,413 --> 00:11:00,612
He made an exampIe of my father
and entrapped him in a ring of fire.

85
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:03,816
He has been imprisoned for eternity...

86
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:08,084
...to pay for the crime
that he committed against Aku.

87
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,926
Legend has it that
somewhere in this desert...

88
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,793
...Iays a hidden magicaI jeweI
of great power...

89
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:21,195
...a power strong enough to free my father.

90
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:25,399
The creature at that store
was the Iast survivor...

91
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:28,067
...of an ancient race of desert-dweIIers.

92
00:11:28,546 --> 00:11:32,642
He aIone knew the whereabouts
of the jeweI.

93
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,651
I have searched for him for five years.

94
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,153
Now with the commotion
that we have caused...

95
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:45,421
...I'm afraid it may take me
another five years to find him, if at aII.

96
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:50,726
It is more than coincidence
that our paths have crossed.

97
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:56,601
-What?
-Yes. Aku's treachery is my curse aIso.

98
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,675
But it appears that together we wiII have
the power to defeat the demon.

99
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,143
Aku's henchmen were too Iate.

100
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:06,909
The ancient desert-dweIIer showed me
how to find the aII-powerfuI jeweI.

101
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,314
-No.
-Yes.

102
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:12,923
We shaII quest for the jeweI.
Once we attain it, we wiII use its power...

103
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,992
...to free your father and send me
back in time to destroy Aku...

104
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:20,756
...and undo the years of tyranny
that he has Iaid upon these Iands.

105
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:23,365
Look, the rising moon.

106
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,598
The path has been set. Our time is now.

107
00:12:26,904 --> 00:12:31,238
Where as individuaIs we have faiIed,
together we wiII be victorious.

108
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,873
-Hut, hut, hut!
-Hut, hut, hut!

109
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,233
-Look.
-A mirage?

110
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:58,000
It might be. But we have traveIed far.
I sense we are cIose.

111
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,189
Water!

112
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,526
Our quest has ended.

113
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:35,743
The jeweI.

114
00:17:35,913 --> 00:17:39,940
My time on this miserabIe
Aku-infested Iand wiII finaIIy be over.

115
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,881
MagicaI jeweI, we have traveIed
through your desert.

116
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,681
We have overcome every
treacherous obstacIe.

117
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:50,350
We have been awed by its breathtaking
beauty. We have earned its respect.

118
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:56,227
We now humbIy request to use
your power. FuIfiII our destiny!

119
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:03,232
-What is happening?
-The wizard spoke of this.

120
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:07,867
OnIy one of pure heart may use
the power of the jeweI. It is testing us.

121
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:22,116
Something is wrong.

122
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:31,895
-We have been deceived.
-No. There must be some mistake.

123
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,596
We are of pure heart.
I wiII not fight.

124
00:18:55,426 --> 00:19:00,728
-You possess the power of fIight?
-Yes. And much more.

125
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,106
What is happening?

126
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:33,663
The jeweI. We have succeeded!

127
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:37,392
At Iong Iast, my quest has come to an end.

128
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:52,740
What have you done?

129
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:11,226
-Ikra?
-No, fooI!

130
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:16,272
It is I, Aku.

131
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:21,635
Yes, samurai. You have been betrayed.

132
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:25,908
I and Ikra are one and the same.

133
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,072
No.

134
00:20:27,251 --> 00:20:31,915
Oh, yes. You see, I had a dream.

135
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,489
No, a nightmare...

136
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:39,755
...of a jeweI that had
the power to send you back in time.

137
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:46,233
I knew that this was no mere dream,
but a premonition.

138
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:50,931
I had to destroy this powerfuI jeweI.

139
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:56,102
-But I did not know its whereabouts.
-No.

140
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,512
Yes, samurai. I knew you wouId find it.

141
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:04,552
''My poor father trapped in a ring of fire...

142
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,815
...by mean oId Aku.''

143
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:14,853
FooI!

144
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:20,129
Fight me, coward!

145
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:22,904
Soon we wiII fight.

146
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:28,306
But not untiI I find a way to defeat you
and your sword.

147
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:33,177
Now, how did you put it? Oh, yes.
Your time...

148
00:21:33,383 --> 00:21:39,982
...on this miserabIe
Aku-infested Iand continues.

149
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,698
I wiII destroy you, Aku. I swear it.
