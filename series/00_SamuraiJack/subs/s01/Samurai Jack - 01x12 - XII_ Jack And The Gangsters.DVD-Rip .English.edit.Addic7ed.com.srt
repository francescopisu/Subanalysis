1
00:00:01,196 --> 00:00:04,359
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:09,629
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:13,296
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:18,811
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,143
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,851
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:31,391
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,789
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,195 --> 00:00:38,188
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:43,201
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:25,876
-Yeah?
-Ricko Benny Giordano.

12
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:32,283
Come on in.
WeIcome to the BIue Monkey.

13
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:47,618
WeIcome, friends. And a warm weIcome
to the Buddy Righteous Orchestra.

14
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,320
And without any further ado...

15
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:55,526
...pIease weIcome
the IoveIy LuIa LiIIywhite.

16
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:35,626
Okay, mac, that's enough.

17
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:37,600
Nice and sIow.

18
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:40,036
That's right, put the butter knife away.

19
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,142
Come on. Move it
before we throw you out.

20
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,210
Wait. Let him stay.

21
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,488
It's okay. Let him go, see?

22
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,024
-You know, we couId use a guy Iike you.
-''We''?

23
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:02,856
Me and the boys, see?

24
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:08,367
Stitches, Mr. Shine,
Mr. PibbIes and KnuckIes.

25
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:13,303
-Yeah. WeII, actuaIIy, my reaI name is Joe.
-Mr. PibbIes.

26
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,200
What exactIy does your organization do?

27
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:23,044
Why, me and the boys sort of run things
around this town. Know what I mean?

28
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,616
Say, how'd you Iike to--?

29
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:27,311
It's aII right.
You can put them down now.

30
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,817
How'd you Iike to be a member
of the most feared gang in the city, see?

31
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:36,657
What activities does your gang
participate in?

32
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,822
Stitches, break it down for him.

33
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:44,599
We fix things. Know what I mean?

34
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:51,103
Make sure money goes to the right pIaces
around here: the horses, casinos, banks.

35
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,974
You foIIow?

36
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,511
You are invoIved in crime.

37
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,946
Now, did I say that?

38
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,680
Enough has been said.

39
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:05,348
Your activities are of no interest to me.

40
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:07,289
I wish to be no part of your group.

41
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:14,393
So a prima donna, eh?

42
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,797
Get out of here. Go on.
Beat it, aItar boy.

43
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:25,311
What are you, crazy?
You out of your mind?

44
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,072
What's up with this guy?

45
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:29,512
WeII, what are you aII
standing around for?

46
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:32,847
We got a deIivery to make for Aku.

47
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:36,755
-Do you mean the great and powerfuI Aku?
-Of course.

48
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:41,793
The master of darkness, the shogun
of sorrow, the big boss himseIf: Aku.

49
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:46,662
-And you have deaIings with Aku in person?
-Sure. AII the time.

50
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:50,668
-What's it to you anyway?
-PIease forgive me. I thought you were--

51
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:53,432
-SmaII time?
-WeII, no. I--

52
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:57,510
Oh, so now Mr. Goody-Two-SandaIs
feeIs Iike taIking, eh?

53
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:02,615
PIease understand. I have spent my Iifetime
preparing to come face to face with Aku.

54
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:05,446
FuIfiIIing this goaI wouId
forever change my Iife.

55
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:15,353
Okay, boy. We'II give you a shot.

56
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:20,297
But you gotta pass
a IittIe test first, see?

57
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:23,130
You know, to prove
you got the stomach for it.

58
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,101
Here's the skinny.

59
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:29,766
<i>It's not a hard job, but your heart's</i>
<i>gotta be in the right place, see?</i>

60
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:33,846
<i>One of our clients, see, hasn't</i>
<i>been paying his protection money.</i>

61
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,648
<i>So he needs to be rubbed out.</i>

62
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:59,295
<i>You tell him the Society for the Preservation</i>
<i>of Animal Love has sent a surprise gift...</i>

63
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:02,875
<i>...as a token of appreciation</i>
<i>for his ongoing love of animals, see?</i>

64
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:05,512
<i>Then you got 20 seconds</i>
<i>to hightail it out of there...</i>

65
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,242
<i>...and then it's "bang. "</i>
<i>The gift that keeps on giving.</i>

66
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:18,191
-WeII, kid, how'd it go?
-It went exactIy as pIanned.

67
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:19,916
The oId man took the package.

68
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:22,585
I said my Iines exactIy
as I was supposed to.

69
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:23,991
<i>He never suspected a thing.</i>

70
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:27,063
<i>After which,</i>
<i>I immediately left the premises.</i>

71
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,362
<i>He never knew what hit him.</i>

72
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:33,701
You shouId not be concerned with any
further payment probIems with your cIients.

73
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:38,403
Pretty coId-bIooded, kid.
I'm impressed, see?

74
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
A price must be paid for disobedience.

75
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,448
I Iike this guy.

76
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:49,680
Boys, meet ''Jackie the BIade.''

77
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:52,690
Looking pretty good there, huh? Yeah.

78
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,191
Nice-Iooking suit. Sure.

79
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:56,387
-Terrific.
-I Iike the shoes.

80
00:08:56,564 --> 00:08:58,896
With aII the accouterments, see?

81
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,899
Yeah, great.
How come he gets the cooI name?

82
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,401
AII right, you knuckIeheads, Iisten up.

83
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:07,234
We're here to taIk about a very big job.

84
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:10,741
One of very speciaI interest
to the big boss himseIf.

85
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:13,142
-Aku?
-That's right, Jackie.

86
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,908
Now, nobody's ever puIIed
this one off, see?

87
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,813
But with you on our side,
we'II smoke it.

88
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:20,749
And we wiII get to meet Aku?

89
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:24,915
Not onIy wiII you get to meet him,
but if we puII this off successfuIIy...

90
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:29,051
...the big boss wiII make us richer
beyond our wiIdest dreams, see?

91
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,667
Boys, say heIIo
to the PubIic Works and UtiIities BuiIding.

92
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,165
HeIIo.

93
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:40,268
It's a weII-kept secret
that deep inside this buiIding...

94
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,274
...Iies the Iegendary Neptune JeweI, see?

95
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,605
And it's our job to get it out.

96
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,613
You mean, we gotta fit
inside that IittIe thing?

97
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:54,179
-What is the importance of this jeweI?
-Here's the short version, Jackie.

98
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:57,916
Long before you was born or I was born
or anybody was born...

99
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:01,255
<i>...the Neptune Jewel was kept inside</i>
<i>this mountain, see?</i>

100
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,091
<i>Legend has it, it was placed there</i>
<i>by an ancient spirit...</i>

101
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:09,862
<i>...who gave the jewel special powers</i>
<i>to control all the waters of the world, see?</i>

102
00:10:10,037 --> 00:10:12,232
<i>Naturally,</i>
<i>Aku wanted the jewel's power...</i>

103
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:15,204
<i>...so evil could control the world,</i>
<i>which it should.</i>

104
00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:20,105
<i>But then, this no-good, goody two-shoes,</i>
<i>good-for-nothing got in the way, see?</i>

105
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:23,747
<i>I don't know how she did it,</i>
<i>but she beat our boss.</i>

106
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:30,082
<i>And she summoned</i>
<i>the forces of nature to guard it:</i>

107
00:10:30,358 --> 00:10:31,723
<i>Earth.</i>

108
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,356
<i>Wind.</i>

109
00:10:42,236 --> 00:10:44,329
<i>And Fire.</i>

110
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:52,009
<i>And so Earth, Wind and Fire have guarded</i>
<i>the jewel for centuries, see?</i>

111
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,704
<i>Making it impossible for Aku</i>
<i>to get his hands on it.</i>

112
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,676
<i>And since the big boss himself</i>
<i>couldn't close the deal...</i>

113
00:10:57,852 --> 00:11:01,549
...it's been centuries since anybody's even
thought about it. So you see, see?

114
00:11:01,722 --> 00:11:05,249
You'd have to be pretty nuts
to try to swipe the Neptune JeweI.

115
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:10,329
At Ieast that's what I thought,
untiI I saw Jackie here in action.

116
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:13,296
The way you cIeaned up them robot thugs
at the BIue Monkey...

117
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:16,630
...made me think we're just nuts enough
to puII this one off.

118
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,671
So are you game, Jackie?

119
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,300
To stand in Aku's presence,
I wouId consider no feat too great.

120
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:28,039
Way to go, Jackie. That's pretty cooI.
You know what you're doing.

121
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:33,209
AII right, here's the pIan, Jackie.
We strike this Sunday at midnight, see?

122
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:07,559
You wiII never possess the Neptune JeweI.
You wiII not escape.

123
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,499
-Come and get me.
-InsoIent fooI!

124
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,916
Hey, Iook.

125
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,719
He did it.

126
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,127
Way to go there, Jackie-boy!
What do you know about that?

127
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,199
That's reaIIy something.

128
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:57,771
Who dares to summon--? Oh, it is you.

129
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:59,970
Yes. You see--

130
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:03,878
Do you forget that you are forbidden
to come here?

131
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,678
Yeah, boss, I know.

132
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:10,187
But this time we reaIIy got something.
Something big, see?

133
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,723
What can you possibIy have...

134
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:18,763
...that the aImighty Aku cannot attain?

135
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:23,335
-The JeweI of Neptune.
-What? It cannot be.

136
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:27,998
The power to controI
aII the water of the worId.

137
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:30,507
OnIy for you, my Iord.

138
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:35,137
Yes. It truIy is the magicaI jeweI.

139
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:41,515
But how did such an eIusive treasure
come into your possession?

140
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:45,920
WeII, it wasn't easy, master. But we got
a IittIe heIp from our newest member.

141
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:48,653
-Come on out, Jackie.
-Jackie?

142
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,869
-ActuaIIy, it's Jack.
-You!

143
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,540
What the heck is going on, man?

144
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:05,634
You wiII not defeat me so easiIy.

145
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:11,211
Yes. It won't be easy,
but it wiII be worth the effort.

146
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,455
The sword!

147
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:20,286
Why is Jackie
fighting the big boss, boss?

148
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:25,023
I don't know, see? But we'd better save
Jackie before he ain't no more.

149
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,724
No tricks wiII save you this time, Aku.

150
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,036
Aku!

151
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:07,901
Easy there, Jackie-boy.

152
00:19:08,075 --> 00:19:10,600
What? Where am I? What happened?

153
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:13,937
Can you beIieve this guy?

154
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:17,944
What happened, Jackie,
is that we saved your Iife.

155
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:19,278
You what?

156
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:23,355
You see, you Iost your mind back there
and started to duke it out with the big boss.

157
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:26,618
So we naiIed you over the head, man.

158
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:29,727
Lights out. And here we are.

159
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:32,058
Yeah. We saved you before Aku
had a chance...

160
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:34,757
...to put you out of commission
permanentIy.

161
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:37,369
I cannot beIieve this!
