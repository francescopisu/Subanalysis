1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:04,381
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,613
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,794
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,801
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,339
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,738
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:43,694
<i>You have been found guilty</i>
<i>of breaking Aku law 1 01 and 203:</i>

12
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,922
<i>Habitation in an unauthorized facility...</i>

13
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:50,761
<i>...and unauthorized construction</i>
<i>of an escape vehicle.</i>

14
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,167
<i>Your punishment is extermination.</i>

15
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,946
No! Don't!

16
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:49,219
WeII, according to my caIcuIations...

17
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:53,990
...our chances of escaping are now
6,352,27 1 -to-1 .

18
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:58,864
Oh, no! After aII these years,
to go back to work for Aku....

19
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,665
I can't do it!

20
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:09,641
-CaIm yourseIf, Frederick.
-Easy for you to say.

21
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:11,782
You were just a baby
when the rest of us...

22
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,282
...were forced to use
our scientific knowIedge...

23
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:18,218
...to buiId Aku's robot armies
and aIpha eviI technoIogy.

24
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,823
My age is irreIevant here.

25
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:22,892
We shouIdn't just give up.
We stiII have a chance.

26
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,359
ActuaIIy, there is substance to that theory.

27
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,054
If we Iaunch our escape rocket...

28
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:30,668
...before the faiI-safe warning head
informs Aku of our whereabouts...

29
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:31,859
...we wiII succeed.

30
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,403
On the other hand, Aku is quite briIIiant...

31
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:38,099
...and, knowing our position, wouId not onIy
send his ground troops to destroy us...

32
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:41,336
...but wouId aIso bIock our escape route,
forcing us to surrender.

33
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:45,745
GentIemen, the orbitaI guard has begun
to cIose in around our escape route.

34
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,488
You see?
There is no escaping now!

35
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:52,646
No! There has to be a way!

36
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:56,726
I humbIy apoIogize. It was not my
intention to bring these troubIes upon you.

37
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,863
Yes! It is aII your fauIt!

38
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,055
Come on! That's not fair.

39
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:04,599
We were bound to be discovered.
If anything, he saved our Iives.

40
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,828
Didn't you see the way
he beat those robots?

41
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,529
Yes. He was quite impressive.

42
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:13,576
The odds of one person with a sword
defeating three mantoids were 6923-to-1 .

43
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:17,010
HoId it, gentIemen.
I think we've found our soIution.

44
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,844
If we foIIow this warrior
through Aku's bIockade...

45
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:23,510
...he might create enough of a distraction
to give us a chance to sIip through.

46
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:28,387
That's impossibIe. No one can do that.
Let us surrender.

47
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,020
ActuaIIy, Frederick, the odds are promising.
It's onIy 5437-to-1 .

48
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:35,496
-Yes!
-This is quite a predicament.

49
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,433
On one hand, we have to trust a stranger
to battIe for the fate of our future.

50
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:44,405
On the other hand, the inevitabIe capture
by Aku and a Iifetime of sIavery.

51
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:47,636
-I say we give the stranger a shot.
-Yes!

52
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:51,873
This is aII pointIess.
He probabIy wouIdn't even do it.

53
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,984
Wait. I wiII gIadIy heIp.

54
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:57,087
But from what I understand,
your battIe is in the sky.

55
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:59,052
I am grounded. I cannot fIy.

56
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,987
Leave that to us.

57
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:05,721
Comrades, the odds have just improved.

58
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,533
Just hoId stiII, Jack.
This won't take Iong.

59
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,416
Okey-dokey. We're ready to go.

60
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,050
AII right. Everything Iooks good.

61
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:44,388
Let me expIain
your hand guidance-controI...

62
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,555
...system.

63
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,281
Send in the drones.

64
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:31,894
I am so excited.
Soon we shaII be at our new home.

65
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,267
We'II finaIIy be abIe
to use our science for good.

66
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,102
No more protection against the poIIuted air.

67
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:41,507
-No more Aku robots.
-Yeah. No more Aku.

68
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,208
Home.

69
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,981
What is wrong, friend?
Odds are 3-to-1 you shouId have fun.

70
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:54,386
I, too, desire to find my home.

71
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,857
<i>You see, in days long past...</i>

72
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:00,020
<i>...where rockets and robots were</i>
<i>nowhere near creation...</i>

73
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:02,689
<i>...a young warrior forged</i>
<i>into battle with Aku.</i>

74
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,267
<i>At the point where victory was imminent...</i>

75
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:07,870
<i>...Aku tricked the warrior...</i>

76
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,373
<i>...and flung him from his own time</i>
<i>to a distant time in the future.</i>

77
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,979
<i>To reclaim his homeland</i>
<i>and undo the evil of Aku...</i>

78
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:19,776
<i>...the warrior has to find some sort</i>
<i>of time passage home.</i>

79
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:23,250
<i>Such a magic is difficult to find.</i>

80
00:12:24,489 --> 00:12:26,787
Is that warrior you?

81
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,256
-Yes.
-Wow!

82
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,792
Time traveI....

83
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,790
What do you say, gentIemen?

84
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:41,364
You know a way to traveI in time?

85
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,406
It's quite simpIe, reaIIy.
Let's say this is the rocket.

86
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,544
If you get into the escape pod
at the nose of the ship...

87
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:52,206
...and jettison when we hit sub-Iight speed,
that shouId put you at faster than Iight.

88
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:55,318
Which wiII easiIy send you
back to your own time.

89
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:57,078
-This wiII work?
-Oh, yes.

90
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,349
This theory is--
This theory is very sound.

91
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:03,688
Just make sure you're in the pod
before we hit Iight speed.

92
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:07,024
-The rest wiII take care of itseIf.
-I wiII.

93
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:09,723
WonderfuI!
So we're on for tomorrow morn--

94
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:13,033
Perhaps sooner.

95
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:26,875
Ladies and gentIemen,
we are entering Aku's bIockade.

96
00:14:28,546 --> 00:14:32,380
They're going to Iaunch the first wave.
Better get Jack to the air Iock.

97
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:43,284
Don't forget, Jack, you must be in the pod
when we make the jump to warp drive.

98
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:47,488
The odds are quite staggering
against you if you are not in the pod.

99
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,064
-Good Iuck, Jack.
-Thank you.

100
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,861
Here comes the first wave.

101
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:22,863
T minus 1 2 before impact.

102
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:26,697
Five seconds untiI impact.

103
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,128
Jack, they're digging into the huII!

104
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,111
The tick droids are stiII digging through!

105
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:48,179
The fueI IeveI's dropping.
What's going on, Jack?

106
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:25,780
Jack, those are what
we Iike to caII guided missiIes!

107
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:27,175
-They appear to be withdrawing.
-We are approaching top speed.

108
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,978
Jack, forget them. Let's go.

109
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:37,453
Maximum veIocity wiII
be achieved in 1 .2 minutes.

110
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,289
StabiIizing retrorockets.

111
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,260
Standing by.

112
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,997
Jack, I'm going to Iock you in.
This is going to be quite a ride.

113
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:00,480
What is that?

114
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:04,951
Looks Iike the bugbots
are forming into a giant gun.

115
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,397
-Jack's unIocking!
-What?

116
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,896
What are you doing?
We're aImost at top speed.

117
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,728
The robots must not fire that gun.

118
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:21,804
The odds of them hitting us
at this speed are 325-to-1 .

119
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,633
I cannot take that chance.

120
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:25,935
But you'II never make it back in time!

121
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,243
<i>Jack? Jack!</i>

122
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,481
-Initiate the countdown!
-But what about Jack?

123
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:39,145
Darn it! There's no time!

124
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:49,073
