1
00:00:01,463 --> 00:00:04,398
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:09,629
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:13,296
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:18,811
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,143
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,851
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:31,391
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,789
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:38,188
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:43,201
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:53,405
Aye, I know of such a thing.

12
00:01:53,575 --> 00:02:00,037
But a taIe must be toId.
A fisherman's taIe about the Triceraquin.

13
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:03,910
The most eIusive creature in the sea.

14
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,786
Yes, the Triceraquin.

15
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:11,289
AII right, who ordered the green tea?

16
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:14,890
<i>But I caught one once.</i>

17
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,127
Seven years ago, off of Tempest Point.

18
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,795
<i>I braved those waters for three days</i>
<i>without a single bite.</i>

19
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,878
But on the third day, something bit.

20
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:35,982
Something big.

21
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,086
<i>On this point, you'll have to trust me...</i>

22
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:42,985
<i>...because I let the Triceraquin go.</i>

23
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:45,888
Ah, sure you did....

24
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,995
Pipe down, you gunnysacks!

25
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:52,662
<i>Yes, I let him go.</i>

26
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:57,828
<i>And in return, he told me about the secret</i>
<i>hidden city at the bottom of the ocean...</i>

27
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:04,137
...Oceanus, and the treasure
that Iies within it.

28
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:06,109
A machine.

29
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,715
A time machine.

30
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,510
Oh, boy.

31
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:14,451
It'II take a brave man to make the trip.

32
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:18,353
<i>The waters past Tempest Point</i>
<i>aren't for the meek.</i>

33
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:20,221
But you Iook Iike a brave man.

34
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:23,796
<i>A brave man, indeed.</i>

35
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,078
The hidden city.

36
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,071
No, wait!

37
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,772
Stop!

38
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:13,513
Don't be afraid, IittIe one.
We won't hurt you.

39
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,179
TeII us, what's your name?

40
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:20,756
Jack.

41
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:24,193
-Forgive my trespassing. I have come to--
-Jack?

42
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:27,357
WeII, weIcome, Jack.

43
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:33,100
WeIcome to Oceanus.

44
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:49,682
We are the Triceraquins,
amphibious beings who reside here.

45
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:51,916
CongratuIations on surviving your journey.

46
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:55,927
Yes. And without giIIs too.
Good show, boy.

47
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:59,726
-Come, Jack. You must be tired.
-And hungry too.

48
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:05,203
We were just about to sit down for supper.
I'm sure we can make room for one more.

49
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:30,225
Sushi!

50
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:51,980
A toast, to our new friend.
WeIcome, Jack.

51
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:54,246
WeIcome, Jack!

52
00:09:54,422 --> 00:09:55,855
Thank you.

53
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,658
Due to the nature of our geography,
it's not often that we receive visitors.

54
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,492
In fact, you're the first.

55
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:11,161
Of course, it wasn't aIways Iike this.
We were once a very sociaI race.

56
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,278
Our peopIe Iived on the surface of the ocean
and traded with the IocaIs of the mainIand.

57
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:21,939
That was, of course, before he came...

58
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:25,950
...and banished us to the bottom of the sea.

59
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:35,456
-Aku.
-Yes. But that's ancient history now.

60
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,463
But enough about us.
TeII us, young Jack...

61
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:41,898
...what brings you out this far?

62
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:06,853
I am humbIed by your generosity,
and much indebted to you aII.

63
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,589
But the reason I have made
this journey to you is to ask--

64
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:14,166
-The time machine, yes?
-It's what you've come for, isn't it?

65
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:17,930
-You know of it?
-Of course we know of it. It's ours.

66
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:21,233
-We buiIt it.
-What's more, we can take you to it.

67
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:25,004
But for now, eat, and then rest...

68
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:29,445
...whiIe we prepare aII the detaiIs.

69
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:43,580
What is happening? What are you doing?

70
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,992
-You?
-Yes, me.

71
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:54,328
Did you think that this was your way out?

72
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:59,429
No, my friend. You are our way out.

73
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:01,104
No.

74
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,970
There is nothing we can do.

75
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:09,276
Sometimes the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

76
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,615
-I do not understand.
-Soon it wiII aII be over.

77
00:13:14,789 --> 00:13:16,814
Sorry, Jack.

78
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,122
Aku!

79
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,870
Listen, pIease!
You don't know what you're doing!

80
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:38,204
You have no idea who you're deaIing with!

81
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:41,811
WeII, weII, Triceraquins.

82
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,542
I am pIeased at what I see.

83
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,645
Why? Why have you done this?

84
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:56,394
Yes. Why don't you expIain to our friend.

85
00:13:56,564 --> 00:14:00,660
PIease, understand. We had no choice.

86
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:05,272
-It was either us or you.
-You have made a mistake.

87
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:08,067
-Aku cannot be trusted.
-Enough!

88
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:13,908
It is time for me to rid myseIf
of this menace once and for aII.

89
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:21,377
Goodbye, oId friend.

90
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:36,570
Lord Aku, we have fuIfiIIed
our obIigation to you.

91
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:39,604
We now ask that you--

92
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,033
FuIfiII mine?

93
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:48,715
Yes. Yes, the obIigation. Of course.

94
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:52,944
Yes.... WeII, it seems that I've...

95
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,884
...changed my mind!

96
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:01,619
And your pathetic city wiII remain sunken...

97
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:05,891
...isoIated from the worId
for as Iong as I see fit!

98
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,233
-We have been betrayed!
-The samurai was right!

99
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,635
Revenge!

100
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,300
FooIs!

101
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,140
No!

102
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,293
The first wave has faiIed!

103
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,394
HopefuIIy, the second wiII succeed.

104
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:15,822
Can you not see Aku is beyond destruction?

105
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:56,563
Now you wiII pay for your insoIence.

106
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:22,151
It's no use. He's far too powerfuI.

107
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,660
We must evacuate.

108
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:27,198
Wait! What about Jack?

109
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,667
It is pointIess to struggIe.

110
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,940
-Accept your fate!
-Never!

111
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:47,714
A brave warrior to the end, eh?

112
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:50,590
What?

113
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:54,187
WeIcome aboard, Iaddie.

114
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,625
HoId on tight.
We're gonna make a run for it.

115
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,958
No! We must turn around!

116
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,794
Are you mad, man?

117
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:04,699
No. I am the one who hoIds the key
to Aku's destruction.

118
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:08,364
-Lost his mind, he has.
-You saw what happened back there.

119
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,477
Yes. Aku is powerfuI.

120
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:14,409
But with my father's sword
and the might of righteousness...

121
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:18,881
...I can end Aku's tyranny forever,
freeing aII he has ensIaved.

122
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,222
I beg you to trust me!

123
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,721
As I once trusted you.

124
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:50,509
Now!

125
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,826
The sword!

126
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,868
-WeII, good show, matey.
-Kudos to you.

127
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:17,903
This is not over, samurai!

128
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:20,911
We shaII meet again.

129
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:49,869
It's so beautifuI.

130
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,520
Jack, there's something....

131
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:06,624
The way we betrayed you...

132
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,754
...is unforgivabIe....

133
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:15,493
I understand. Aku's deceit runs deep.

134
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,161
Even a good heart can be tainted
in the hands of Aku.

135
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:25,243
There was never a time machine, was there?

136
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,347
My quest continues.

137
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:34,283
But if we couId perhaps be
of assistance to you in any other way...?

138
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:39,649
WeII, there is one thing.

139
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:43,378
