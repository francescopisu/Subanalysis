1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,340
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:09,146
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:12,882
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:18,360
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,125
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,403
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:31,134
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,778
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:38,139
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:43,186
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,870
Charge!

12
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:05,695
I, aIone, was the onIy survivor.

13
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:11,239
My entire robot army,
compIeteIy annihiIated!

14
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:15,743
In my dreams I stiII see arrows...

15
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:18,007
...faIIing Iike rain!

16
00:07:18,183 --> 00:07:23,177
What does the tower hoId that wouId make
you sacrifice a whoIe army?

17
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:27,314
Treasure? GoId? Rubies?

18
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:33,328
Bah! Nothing as materiaIistic as treasure.

19
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,035
At the top of the tower is
a mysticaI weII...

20
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:41,695
...the weII of King Ozerick.

21
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,202
Those who reach the infamous weII...

22
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:49,541
...are granted one wish.

23
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:52,477
Your greatest desire.

24
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:56,813
Get out of the great Khan's chair!
What are you, teIIing stories again?!

25
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:01,084
Get swabbing the deck
or I'II toss you overboard! You has-been!

26
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:14,096
Excuse me.

27
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:16,570
Is this pIace you speak of reaI?

28
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:21,303
Of course! As a matter of fact,
we're passing it now.

29
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,447
There!

30
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,011
In the center of that mist-shrouded isIe...

31
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:35,558
...Iies the treasure of King Ozerick.

32
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:37,824
Thank you.

33
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,261
Huh? What? Wait!

34
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,596
I beg you, reconsider.

35
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:49,536
There are onIy three archers,
yet they decimated my whoIe army.

36
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:52,642
You are just one man!

37
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:56,770
Do the math. Why attempt it?

38
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:00,075
That weII couId get me home.

39
00:09:00,251 --> 00:09:03,652
There are other ways to get home.

40
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:07,151
Not for me.

41
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:46,390
It's no use.
No one can fight Iike this.

42
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,160
A great warrior...

43
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:54,703
...must be in tune with aII of his senses.

44
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:59,832
OnIy then wiII you be abIe to extend
your awareness...

45
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:04,778
...so that you may fight on any IeveI.

46
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:08,578
-Try again.
-Yes, <i>sifu</i>.

47
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:11,820
I must fight on their IeveI.

48
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,139
I am ready.

49
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,739
Where? What?

50
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:32,837
I can see!

51
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,341
We're restored!

52
00:20:34,512 --> 00:20:36,480
How is it possibIe?

53
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,379
You have broken our curse.
We thank you.

54
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:54,425
-I have come to make a wish at this weII.
-The weII is yours.

55
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:13,742
<i>Proclaim your wish, great warrior...</i>

56
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:20,414
<i>...and it will be fulfilled</i>
<i>beyond your wildest dream.</i>

57
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:26,855
My quest has finaIIy come to an end.

58
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:32,094
-Oh, mystic weII, I humbIy wish--
-Wait!

59
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:36,797
We must warn you.
Any wish granted comes with a price.

60
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:41,001
It was forever ago, we fought Iong and hard
to reach this weII.

61
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:44,739
When we arrived, we stood before the weII
and made our wish:

62
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,940
To be the greatest of warriors.

63
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:50,644
The spirit of the weII did, indeed,
make us great warriors.

64
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:54,450
But in so doing, robbed us
of our sight and our minds...

65
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,856
...ensIaving us as its personaI guard.

66
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,428
We have Iived cursed Iives untiI now.

67
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:20,309
EviI spirit of the weII...

68
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:23,586
...you wiII not cIaim another innocent!

69
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:27,451
I wish thee destroyed!

70
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:57,585
The greatest of warriors.

71
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,814
A nobIe spirit.

72
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,959
Such sacrifice.

73
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,030
