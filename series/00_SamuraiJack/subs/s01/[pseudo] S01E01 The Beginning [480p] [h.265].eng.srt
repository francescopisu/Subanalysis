1
00:01:57,963 --> 00:02:01,899
Once again, I am free to smite the worId...

2
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,559
...as I did in days Iong past.

3
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:10,205
<i>When the evil shape-shifting wizard, Aku,</i>
<i>arose from the bowels of hate...</i>

4
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:14,778
<i>...to ravage our homeland,</i>
<i>I was a young emperor at the time...</i>

5
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:17,506
...and was heIpIess against his powers.

6
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:22,518
But I remembered our grandfather's
grandfather's story of three monks...

7
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:25,316
...who were gifted with mysticaI powers.

8
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,550
I rode to the highest peak
of the mountainside...

9
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:34,996
...where the monks agreed to forge me
an enchanted sword with great magic.

10
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:40,867
Armed with the sword and the hope of my
peopIe, I pIunged into battIe against Aku.

11
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,032
His eviI was no match for the power
of righteousness.

12
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,580
And with the sword's magic, Aku's demon
forces were impIanted into the earth...

13
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:55,914
...forever petrifying him into
the wasteIand that he created.

14
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,926
Through years of hard work,
we have rebuiIt our gIorious past...

15
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:11,161
...with hopes never to encounter
such an eviI as Aku again.

16
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:17,869
AIways be aIert, my son.

17
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,440
For the presence of eviI is sometimes
right behind you.

18
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,110
No, it cannot be.

19
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,916
Aku.

20
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:48,557
The sword.

21
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:50,733
Not this time.

22
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:57,902
Mother, Aku has returned.

23
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:01,443
Do as we have pIanned.
Our future depends on it.

24
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,979
Break.

25
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,897
Here's some water, my emperor.

26
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:28,135
None for him.

27
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:30,600
I'm sorry, emperor.

28
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:35,368
Water. Water. Water.

29
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,776
I said, no water!

30
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,624
He has returned.

31
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:54,495
Insubordinate fooI.
No one attacks Aku's minions.

32
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,065
Destroy him.

33
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,902
My son.

34
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:54,282
What has happened to our Iand, Father?

35
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,823
My son.

36
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:58,518
It has been many years
since that fatefuI day...

37
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:01,221
...that Aku returned
from his imprisonment.

38
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,938
EnsIaved, we have become,
to unearth the riches of our Iand...

39
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:11,973
...so that Aku can strengthen his powers...

40
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:15,544
...and begin to take over the worId.

41
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:26,786
Do not worry, Father. For with the power
of this sword, I wiII vanquish Aku...

42
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,917
...sending him back into the pit
of hate from which he came.

43
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,561
No!

44
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,500
I thought once Iike you,
but the sword is onIy a tooI.

45
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:46,609
What power has it compared
to the hand that wieIds it?

46
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:51,339
EviI is cIever, and deception
is its most powerfuI weapon.

47
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,043
Let the sword guide you to your fate...

48
00:17:54,218 --> 00:18:00,088
...but Iet your mind set free
the path to your destiny.

49
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:06,058
I wiII not faiI you, Father.

50
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:16,699
Be wary, my son,
for eviI finds a way.

51
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:49,606
The mist is fuII of demons. Aku is near.

52
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:06,585
Aku!

53
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:44,817
Who dares to summon
the master of masters?

54
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:46,929
The deIiverer of darkness?

55
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:51,626
The shogun of sorrow, Aku.

56
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:55,294
I am the Iost son of the Iand
that you have piIIaged.

57
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:57,668
I am here to recIaim it.

58
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:02,312
For my peopIe. For my father.
For my birthright.

59
00:20:03,581 --> 00:20:05,310
FooI.

60
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,384
No mortaI can hurt the great Aku.

61
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:15,352
That sword. I remember that bIade.

62
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:17,994
I recognize your bIood.

63
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:23,828
You are the son of the fooI
who imprisoned me those many years ago.

64
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,559
No matter.

65
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:30,901
Neither he nor the sword had the power
to sIay me forever.

66
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:33,543
And neither do you.

67
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,806
No matter what form you take, Aku...

68
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:06,340
...you wiII never defeat the side
of righteousness.

69
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:09,701
Now, demon, with the bIessings
of righteousness...

70
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:12,172
...and the power of the sacred bIade...

71
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:15,801
...I cast thee back to the viIe pit
from which you came.

72
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:46,904
You might have beaten me now,
but I wiII destroy you in the future.

73
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:49,409
There is no future for you, Aku.

74
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,174
I disagree.

75
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:56,252
What trickery is this?

76
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:59,055
Aku--

77
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:06,588
Do not worry, samurai.
You wiII see me again.

78
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:11,463
But next time you wiII not be so fortunate.

79
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,029
