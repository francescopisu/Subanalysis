1
00:00:01,446 --> 00:00:04,381
<i>Long ago in a distant land...</i>

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,613
<i>...I, Aku, the shape-shifting</i>
<i>master of darkness...</i>

3
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>...unleashed an unspeakable evil.</i>

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:18,794
<i>But a foolish samurai warrior</i>
<i>wielding a magic sword...</i>

5
00:00:18,964 --> 00:00:22,127
<i>...stepped forth to oppose me.</i>

6
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,835
<i>Before the final blow was struck...</i>

7
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:31,374
<i>...I tore open a portal in time,</i>
<i>and flung him into the future...</i>

8
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:33,773
<i>...where my evil is law.</i>

9
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,171
<i>Now the fool seeks</i>
<i>to return to the past...</i>

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,185
<i>...and undo the future that is Aku.</i>

11
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:35,531
This is Sir Dreyfuss AIexander,
Angus McDuffy...

12
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:40,667
...and I am Sir CoIin BarthoIomew
Montgomery RothchiId III.

13
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:43,542
You, my friend, are a Iiving fossiI.

14
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,377
The speII Aku cast must have ripped me
from my own time...

15
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,451
...and fIung me into the distant future.

16
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,683
We need you. With your tremendous skiII,
you can break us free from Aku's grasp.

17
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,156
I wiII heIp you.

18
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:57,227
We never got your name.

19
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:58,721
-Jack.
-Jack was aII--

20
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,258
-Yo, Jack.
-Jack!

21
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,066
They caII me Jack.

22
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:07,099
Many years have gone since that day.

23
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:13,609
And now, my formidabIe foe,
you wiII pay for my pain in the past...

24
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:17,215
...with your pain in the future.

25
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:19,350
Aku's drones approach from the South.

26
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:22,487
They wiII be upon us by sunrise.

27
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:56,816
I say, there are quite a few of those
Aku destroyer beetIe drones.

28
00:02:56,988 --> 00:03:00,185
How are you ever going to be abIe
to defeat them?

29
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:02,053
I'II need some weapons.

30
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,457
The destroyer drones
have entered the vaIIey!

31
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,325
Everyone take cover!

32
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:27,201
No. There is no escape.

33
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:16,515
Now, that was smashing!
A reaI bang-up job!

34
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:25,119
Good Sir Jack, 'twas truIy a nobIe deed
you have done today...

35
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:28,493
...and an historic victory
most worthy of our Iogs.

36
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,363
You have saved our pack
from the wrath of Aku's drones.

37
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:34,265
We are forever indebted to you.

38
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:39,339
Thanks are not necessary.

39
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,138
It is my duty to oppose
the minions of Aku...

40
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:46,181
...and my mission to vanquish
the very demon himseIf.

41
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,012
WeII, then, now that we have
a chance at freedom...

42
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:51,780
...we shouId take our Ieave
of these forsaken mines.

43
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:54,584
Our pack shaII continue
our once-nomadic Iife...

44
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:58,285
...searching for more answers
to our puzzIing history.

45
00:21:58,462 --> 00:21:59,952
I wish you the best.

46
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,360
We certainIy invite you to join us.

47
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,898
No. I cannot.

48
00:22:04,068 --> 00:22:06,298
Aku's wrongs must be righted.

49
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,904
SureIy there is a way to reverse his speII.

50
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,473
I wiII find a way back to my own time.

51
00:22:11,642 --> 00:22:14,611
There, I wiII finish what I started
centuries ago...

52
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:19,078
...and defeat Aku's eviI
before it was ever truIy unIeashed.

53
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:29,122
He is stronger than I remember.

54
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,420
But no matter.

55
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:37,556
For you see, IittIe samurai,
the worId is mine.

56
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:40,727
My eyes and ears are everywhere.

57
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:43,738
Nothing you do wiII go unseen.

58
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:45,842
Quest as you may...

59
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,969
...but we wiII meet again when I see fit...

60
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:54,208
...in a time and pIace of my choosing.

61
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:58,116
And it is I who shaII put an end
to the war...

62
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,156
...started in that age Iong past.

63
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:04,317
Samurai Jack.

64
