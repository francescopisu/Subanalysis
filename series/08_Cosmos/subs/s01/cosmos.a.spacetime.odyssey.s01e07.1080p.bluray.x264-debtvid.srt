<i>But the Bible does not give exact years...</i>

33
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,398
<i>...so, Ussher searched for an event
in the Old Testament...</i>

34
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,151
<i>...that corresponded
to a known historical date.</i>

35
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,564

36

43

44

in the rocks themselves.

46

...are made of sediments...

48
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,242
...deposited as fine grains in a time
when this part of the world was a sea.

49
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,997
Over eons, the sediments
were compressed into rock...

50
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,087
...under the weight of succeeding layers,
with the oldest ones at the bottom.

51
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,760
Pick a layer, any layer.

<i>...but for the animals who evolved later,

Okay, pick another layer.

62
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,946
<i>This layer is known
as the Bright Angel Shale.</i>

63
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:22,200
<i>It formed about 530 million years ago.</i>

64

65

<i>So you want to know the age of the Earth?</i>

66

67
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,590

"begats," add up all the layers.

69
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,969
Just one problem.

70
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,879
We know from observing this process--

71
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,175
Because it still happens today
in oceans and lakes around the world.

72
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,103
<i>--That sediments can be laid down
at widely different rates.</i>

73
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:55,313
<i>It usually happens very slowly,
say a foot of sediment per thousand years.</i>

74
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:59,230
But when there's a rare catastrophic flood,
it can happen much faster...

75
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,366
...as much as a foot in just a few days.

76
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,831
Many geologists tried this method
to calculate the age of the Earth.

77
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,592
They used the Grand Canyon and other
sedimentary sequences around the planet.

78
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,803
<i>But their answers ranged too widely
to be of much use.</i>

79
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,512
<i>Anywhere between 3 million years
and 15 billion.</i>

80
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,022
There were other problems
with this method.

81
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,606
Even the deepest layers of rock
are not the oldest things on Earth.

82
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,864

could survive the Earth's violent infancy.

Yeah, Laurie. Yeah, she's a chemist too.

166
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,006
We worked on the Manhattan Project
together at Oak Ridge.

167
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,846
Good, okay, well,
first thing you need to know:

168
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,682
There are these tiny
crystals called zircons.

169
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,349
Real small, size of a pinhead,
tight as a drum, and tough.

170
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:36,986
Nothing gets in or out of them,
and I'm talking for billions of years.

171
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,772
We know how old these grains are...

172
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,862
...because we've already dated the rocks
they came from.

173
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,825
Each little zircon has only a few parts
per million of uranium inside...

174
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,368
...and that uranium is decaying
to even tinier amounts of lead.

175
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,900
You figure out how to
measure that lead, and

176
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,290

it for a meteorite.

Yeah, yeah, I don't see why not.

179
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,807
Good, because when you do, you'll be
the first man to know the age of the Earth.

180
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,182

...another grad student, George Tilton...

185
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,922
...was measuring the amount of uranium
in the same grains.

the amount of lead with equal accuracy.</i>

wildly inconsistent.

It was cheap, very malleable,
easy to work with.

actual measurements you've
taken in the field?

486
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,261
Yes.

487
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,553
Are these observations different
from the ones...

488
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,218
...we've been hearing about
from other witnesses?

489
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,309
No, they're the same observations.

490
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,675
You've testified that
there has been no change

491
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:15,400
in natural lead levels,
is that correct?

492
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,361
That is correct.
You're sure about that?

493
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,740
Absolutely.

PATTERSON: The levels we see
in people today may be typical.

495
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,447
But they are not by any means natural.

496
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,076
So you don't disagree
with Dr. Kehoe's numbers?

497
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,618
No, no.

498
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:35,086
You're saying that the, uh, same numbers
are leading to different conclusions?

499
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,590
Yes.

I would agree with that, yes.

You seem to be very sure
of your conclusions, Dr. Kehoe.

It so happens that I have more experience
in this field than anyone else alive.

At these levels, lead is a severe
chronic insult to the human body.

507
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:08,950
There is no medical evidence that lead
has introduced a danger to public health.

508
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,621
It's irresponsible to mine
millions of tons of toxic material...

509
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,663
...and disperse it into the environment.

510
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,834
If there was proof of harm,
we would have found it.
