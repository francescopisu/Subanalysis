153
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,323

...whether you're talking about an eye
or a camera obscura...

00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,049

to restrict the light

that can enter an otherwise
darkened chamber.

157
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:50,962
That aperture excludes the chaos
of extraneous light rays that surround us.

158
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,177
The smaller the aperture, the fewer
directions that light can come from.

159
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,388
And that makes the image sharper.

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,144
So instead of being blinded by the light...

161
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,351
...we can see everything it has to show us.

...and the ability to restrict access
to Fraunhofer's laboratory...

344
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,264

<i>And it has to lose energy
to jump back down.</i>
